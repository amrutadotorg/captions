WEBVTT

00:03.740 --> 00:17.930
I welcome all of you from abroad, and this
Kolhapur is regarded as one of the deities’

00:17.930 --> 00:38.370
temple, which have three-and-a-half deities,
or you can say three-and-a-half coils of the

00:38.370 --> 00:54.920
Kundalini, so it is said that, in this triangular
bone of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded

00:54.920 --> 01:03.731
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the
plateau is in the center so the all the three

01:03.731 --> 01:07.120
sides make a nice triangle - is the Kundalini
of the whole universe, of the whole world,

01:07.120 --> 01:09.479
is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

01:09.479 --> 01:12.850
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.390
The first one is of Mahakali.

01:15.390 --> 01:18.810
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

01:18.810 --> 02:07.270
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

02:07.270 --> 02:22.350
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

02:22.350 --> 02:30.790
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him.

02:30.790 --> 02:44.910
Now the second one is Mahasaraswati, is at
Mahurgadh.

02:44.910 --> 02:59.930
We always sing Mahurgadawari song, that is
the one is Mahasaraswati, which is also called

02:59.930 --> 03:06.730
as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided Mahasaraswati.

03:06.730 --> 03:21.860
Then the third one is Mahalakshmi, that is
at Kolhapur.

03:21.860 --> 03:37.260
Here a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed
by the Mother, so this place is specially

03:37.260 --> 03:54.070
very holy for all of us; because you got your
Realization as the Kundalini went through

03:54.070 --> 04:02.960
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished
by Mahalakshmi principle.

04:02.960 --> 04:22.060
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

04:22.060 --> 04:31.810
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.”

04:31.810 --> 04:40.990
This comes with the full understanding of
the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine

04:40.990 --> 04:51.199
percent people don’t know, because all the
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to

04:51.199 --> 04:56.770
the different timings, and people never worried
about it.

04:56.770 --> 05:11.710
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

05:11.710 --> 05:32.039
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

05:32.039 --> 05:34.840
is the power of fire?

05:34.840 --> 05:51.610
The power of fire can be that it can give
you light, it can burn away things, but supposing

05:51.610 --> 06:01.310
it does not have its power, then who’ll
care for fire?

06:01.310 --> 06:02.310
Nothing.

06:02.310 --> 06:15.740
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless.

06:15.740 --> 06:29.020
So this power, this Shakti, has to be awakened
within us, because we do not have the power

06:29.020 --> 06:30.280
of the Spirit.

06:30.280 --> 06:38.509
We have to have the power of the Spirit.

06:38.509 --> 06:46.379
That’s only possible if you get your Self
Realization.

06:46.379 --> 07:02.370
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power.

07:02.370 --> 07:23.199
Now this power is made as the power of a Mother.

07:23.199 --> 07:38.530
Mother is the most loving relationship, and
through that relationship all the love is

07:38.530 --> 07:39.669
expressed.

07:39.669 --> 07:58.479
That is why the Shakti is that of a Mother,
and the affection, the love, the patience

07:58.479 --> 08:31.520
that Mother has for Her children, the Shakti
too has the same powers, you see, and that

08:31.520 --> 08:40.539
is how this Shakti never can harm you.

08:40.539 --> 08:57.470
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

08:57.470 --> 09:04.519
because without Her you cannot get Realization.

09:04.519 --> 09:18.480
But also we can say, higher than that, or
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.

09:18.480 --> 09:19.480
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise.

09:19.480 --> 09:25.519
This is the ladder through which this power
of Kundalini can rise.

09:25.519 --> 09:39.490
So both the powers are very important and
very much related to each other.

09:39.490 --> 09:49.690
Mahalakshmi principle starts when we have
finished with Lakshmi principle.

09:49.690 --> 10:18.620
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

10:18.620 --> 10:27.759
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?

10:27.759 --> 10:36.720
We have gone into imbalances, so what should
we do?

10:36.720 --> 10:39.000
We have to balance ourselves.”

10:39.000 --> 10:41.730
So how do we balance ourselves?

10:41.730 --> 10:49.010
We have to have the knowledge of the Spirit.

10:49.010 --> 10:55.390
That is called as aadhyatma.

10:55.390 --> 11:09.970
You have to know what is the knowledge of
the Spirit, and to know the knowledge of the

11:09.970 --> 11:19.720
Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened, and that
you are to be connected to this all-pervading

11:19.720 --> 11:20.720
Power.

11:20.720 --> 11:29.130
Once that happens, you just become one with
that energy and you get transformation within

11:29.130 --> 11:43.199
yourself, because there is light and in the
light you can see all your problems, all your

11:43.199 --> 12:03.579
defects; and also if you know how to correct
it, is the easiest thing to do is to get transformation

12:03.579 --> 12:05.560
in Sahaja Yoga.

12:05.560 --> 12:14.480
All of you have been very much transformed,
and now I find it difficult even to recognize

12:14.480 --> 12:20.600
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

12:20.600 --> 12:21.620
so beautiful.

12:21.620 --> 12:27.180
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

12:27.180 --> 12:35.029
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness.

12:35.029 --> 12:50.370
I don’t know how I’m talking; and I am
merged just in the meditative mood, absolutely

12:50.370 --> 12:53.540
into meditative mood.

12:53.540 --> 13:02.430
Because when you are in the center you don’t
think, you are in meditation.

13:02.430 --> 13:06.089
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.

13:06.089 --> 13:11.860
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi

13:11.860 --> 13:12.860
principle.

13:12.860 --> 13:19.069
But in India because of so many saints, we
feel that we should short-circuit it.

13:19.069 --> 13:27.759
First let us develop our own aadhyatma, let
us develop our knowledge of atma and then

13:27.759 --> 13:42.150
take to science, so there is no more imbalance
within us; because without the foundation

13:42.150 --> 13:55.010
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you
take to any kind of progress, you can topple

13:55.010 --> 13:56.010
down.

13:56.010 --> 14:00.690
That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,
enterprises and also projections of religion

14:00.690 --> 14:10.190
have gone to waste, because there has been
no balance.

14:10.190 --> 14:21.480
It is important that we must have the balance
within ourselves.

14:21.480 --> 14:41.629
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

14:41.629 --> 14:58.110
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

14:58.110 --> 14:59.110
whole.

14:59.110 --> 15:12.540
This they know, and that’s what, by knowing
that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga, they grow

15:12.540 --> 15:27.170
very deeply; the depth, the depth they have
achieved with this faith, that we have to

15:27.170 --> 15:32.020
be self-realized, and that we have to feel
the all-pervading Power.

15:32.020 --> 15:43.839
This conviction itself gives them the depth
and so when they achieve Realization, they

15:43.839 --> 15:48.279
just go down very deep.

15:48.279 --> 16:01.540
But most surprising, people who have never
heard about Ganesha, who have never heard

16:01.540 --> 16:13.880
about Kolhapur, have never heard about Mahalakshmi
are sometimes much, much better, much more

16:13.880 --> 16:28.370
deeper than the people who know all these
things by heart.

16:28.370 --> 16:42.339
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

16:42.339 --> 16:47.520
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside.

16:47.520 --> 17:03.649
They have nothing in them to tell us because
they have had no experience of the Self, no

17:03.649 --> 17:07.780
experience of the Self.

17:07.780 --> 17:18.709
That’s only possible when your Kundalini
rises and breaks your Brahmarandra.

17:18.709 --> 17:35.240
That is the time the first experience comes
to you of this all-pervading Power.

17:35.240 --> 17:47.940
So all those people who have been only just
praying to Mahalakshmi, have been going to

17:47.940 --> 17:59.039
Her, doing a lot of penances, fasting, this,
that, have no idea as to what Mahalakshmi

17:59.039 --> 18:10.049
wants, and they always complain to Me: “Mother,
we have done this, we have done that.”

18:10.049 --> 18:13.830
People are very religious.

18:13.830 --> 18:28.630
They are doing all kinds of ritualism, what
we call as karmakanda, but with that you do

18:28.630 --> 18:34.910
not reach where you have to reach.

18:34.910 --> 18:43.970
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

18:43.970 --> 18:51.740
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know.

18:51.740 --> 18:58.470
So Sahaja Yoga is very important to give them
this experience, so that they can really verify

18:58.470 --> 19:09.360
whatever is said in the science of spirituality
about getting Realization, is absolutely true.

19:09.360 --> 19:20.250
Not only that but it’s very practical, and
every person who gets Realization can understand

19:20.250 --> 19:22.880
it very well.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.400
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people.

19:26.400 --> 19:37.659
But still there are some very, very good people
here also, and because of Mahalakshmi, they

19:37.659 --> 19:45.710
make very good ornaments because these ornaments
are offered to the Goddess.

19:45.710 --> 19:54.990
You can feel there a kind of a subdued feeling
for God, feeling for spirituality, but they

19:54.990 --> 20:04.680
do not have the experience that you have got,
so you are much higher than all of them.

20:04.680 --> 20:09.100
And those who have the experience can feel
more, once they go to the Temple, if you can

20:09.100 --> 20:17.260
go to the Temple to see the place also; but
give yourself a big bandhan because I have

20:17.260 --> 20:21.730
seen it, next to the deity there are very
funny people sitting.

20:21.730 --> 20:25.020
They’re doing all kinds of commercial activities.

20:25.020 --> 20:30.470
They are selling flowers, they are selling
this, selling everything.

20:30.470 --> 20:34.730
So you have to be careful, with a bandhan
you can go and see for yourself.

20:34.730 --> 20:43.370
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

20:43.370 --> 20:51.080
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

20:51.080 --> 21:01.870
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

21:01.870 --> 21:09.190
way religious, but are just commercial people.

21:09.190 --> 21:21.490
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,
can never give you at all any satisfaction.

21:21.490 --> 21:30.419
Apart from that it can take you to something
unknown, of dangerous shores.

21:30.419 --> 21:37.650
But if your faith is pure, without any greed,
without any demands, then you develop your

21:37.650 --> 21:49.860
depth within yourself; which is very helpful
after Sahaja Yoga.

21:49.860 --> 22:01.210
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

22:01.210 --> 22:03.020
calculation of Shri Chakra.

22:03.020 --> 22:10.590
I met a scientist in Russia, in Moscow, who
has done a research, very much big research

22:10.590 --> 22:12.370
on this Shri Chakra.

22:12.370 --> 22:20.549
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,

22:20.549 --> 22:28.110
so all the things that we do with hands after
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand

22:28.110 --> 22:34.870
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita
Chakra.

22:34.870 --> 22:54.490
Now how it works is a very complicated thing,
but we don’t have to worry about that.

22:54.490 --> 23:18.529
As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out.

23:18.529 --> 23:36.490
It works by itself, as if it is a built-in
mechanism within us, which knows what sort

23:36.490 --> 23:53.880
of vibrations to be given to a particular
person for a particular cause, or a particular

23:53.880 --> 23:55.580
purpose.

23:55.580 --> 24:05.019
If that person has certain defects also, these
chakras know what is to be emitted, how to

24:05.019 --> 24:07.260
work it out.

24:07.260 --> 24:21.149
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

24:21.149 --> 24:29.169
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini.

24:29.169 --> 24:39.010
But if you have Vishuddi problem, then you
can find that your hands are stiff and you

24:39.010 --> 25:03.210
cannot feel guidance, or you can say, the
Divine intentions of Realization; because

25:03.210 --> 25:15.580
when you start using your hands you don’t
feel any vibrations, so how will you know

25:15.580 --> 25:17.110
what’s happening?

25:17.110 --> 25:27.799
It’s a very complicated thing, and for that
complicated thing these instruments are made

25:27.799 --> 25:49.940
already, are prepared already; they are quite
equipped with all the knowledge that is necessary,

25:49.940 --> 26:07.950
like a feedback as you call it, or we can
call it a complete programming is there.

26:07.950 --> 26:26.769
So as soon as you put your hand on a person,
the programming starts working it out.

26:26.769 --> 26:42.970
Because it is programming is done by God Almighty,
it can never be wrong.

26:42.970 --> 27:02.820
It cannot be two different things, as far
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

27:02.820 --> 27:22.910
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

27:22.910 --> 27:40.890
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India.

27:40.890 --> 28:00.730
But here the atmosphere is so bad, as if to
think of God, to talk of God is absolutely

28:00.730 --> 28:01.730
wrong, you cannot say.

28:01.730 --> 28:12.870
The people are in illusion, and they think
that all these talks has brought us nothing.

28:12.870 --> 28:29.700
To them it is the progress of the West is
more effective, more apparent, that they can

28:29.700 --> 28:42.280
see how you have progressed in materialism,
and they can’t understand how we could progress

28:42.280 --> 28:53.889
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

28:53.889 --> 29:07.899
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

29:07.899 --> 29:12.960
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.

29:12.960 --> 29:23.600
For that it is important to give up some of
your conditionings, because this knowledge

29:23.600 --> 29:24.910
is coming definitely from India.

29:24.910 --> 29:40.960
I mean the Indians had all the knowledge of
your medical science, this science, that science,

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
that science.

29:41.960 --> 29:51.260
But God’s science is in India, and for that,
what are you going to do?

29:51.260 --> 30:05.500
When the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it?

30:05.500 --> 30:21.460
How are you going to work it out, that this
is the science of God, and the God’s science

30:21.460 --> 30:28.770
has to be understood with full dedication
and devotion?

30:28.770 --> 30:36.230
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

30:36.230 --> 30:50.630
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult.

30:50.630 --> 31:09.010
But if you can understand that, as for science
we had to accept it fully from the West, you

31:09.010 --> 31:27.950
have to accept the knowledge of your Spirit
from the East, East has the knowledge of the

31:27.950 --> 31:46.429
Spirit: for
that you have to be ready to receive it.

31:46.429 --> 32:01.399
But if you are still in your arrogance, if
you are still in your own conditionings, then

32:01.399 --> 32:05.399
you cannot do it.

32:05.399 --> 32:18.059
Like a boy who comes from a village, who has
never known about science, and you suddenly

32:18.059 --> 32:28.710
put him in a science college, he’ll say:
“What is this nonsense, what’s all this

32:28.710 --> 32:29.710
all?

32:29.710 --> 32:34.410
I have never known these things.

32:34.410 --> 32:44.150
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?”

32:44.150 --> 32:52.250
All kinds of things he can start saying, and
this conditioning is there.

32:52.250 --> 33:16.130
Then he’ll run away from school within one
year or two year, maybe earlier, and that

33:16.130 --> 33:29.059
is what I find is their conditioning, which
turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga after

33:29.059 --> 33:30.059
some time.

33:30.059 --> 33:38.830
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

33:38.830 --> 33:47.179
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

33:47.179 --> 33:51.000
are very much conditioned also.

33:51.000 --> 34:10.590
But is easy to overcome that when you realize
that whatever your worship: for example, in

34:10.590 --> 34:26.579
India everybody has a kuladevata, means the
family’s goddess, everybody has; they must

34:26.579 --> 34:31.730
worship that goddess, particular goddess,
everybody has.

34:31.730 --> 34:45.000
So they have to, if they just ask: “Mother,
are You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

34:45.000 --> 34:46.830
flowing.

34:46.830 --> 34:59.790
So the conditioning gets very easily eradicated,
but the mental acceptance of something is

34:59.790 --> 35:02.760
very difficult to go.

35:02.760 --> 35:13.620
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental.

35:13.620 --> 35:16.120
They go mental.

35:16.120 --> 35:28.000
If you go mental, then you cannot understand
many things.

35:28.000 --> 35:36.100
But if you are spiritual, then you can understand.

35:36.100 --> 35:46.330
For example, we see Mother Earth giving us
these flowers and all that, how can we go

35:46.330 --> 35:47.330
mental about it?

35:47.330 --> 35:48.330
It’s a living process.

35:48.330 --> 35:50.609
For any living process we cannot get mental.

35:50.609 --> 35:58.390
So now you will say: “All right, this is
because of seed has got this, and the seed

35:58.390 --> 35:59.390
is planted”; but how, why?

35:59.390 --> 36:00.390
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

36:00.390 --> 36:01.390
Then you’ll keep quiet.

36:01.390 --> 36:02.390
But say if there’s a sage, he’ll say:
“All right, this is Mother Earth, She wants

36:02.390 --> 36:03.390
to give to Her children, these flowers, fruits,
these trees, so She’s working it out.”

36:03.390 --> 36:04.630
So one has to jump from one conditioning of
materialism.

36:04.630 --> 36:11.030
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves.

36:11.030 --> 36:16.270
Energy is stationary, it never moves.

36:16.270 --> 36:21.470
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

36:21.470 --> 36:22.470
blind.

36:22.470 --> 36:24.470
Supposing there is electricity here flowing,
all right, well and good, but supposing somebody

36:24.470 --> 36:26.730
stops it, it will stop.

36:26.730 --> 36:34.970
It has no mind, it is a mindless thing.

36:34.970 --> 36:38.380
So in materialism you become mindless.

36:38.380 --> 36:42.800
You start seeing also that within yourself,
that you have become mindless; and becoming

36:42.800 --> 36:45.579
absolutely, absolutely, I should say, like
robots sometimes, which is mindless, which

36:45.579 --> 36:47.589
is fixed, fixed quantity.

36:47.589 --> 36:55.990
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve
seen, that people have very fixed ideas.

36:55.990 --> 37:06.980
It’s difficult for them to get out of it
because they don’t have that movement towards

37:06.980 --> 37:10.790
the spiritual subtlety, where one can use
the mind to do something.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.339
We would say that Mother Earth has got the
mind.

37:13.339 --> 37:17.660
Now that nobody can believe in the West, except
for Sahaja Yogis.

37:17.660 --> 37:22.080
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.

37:22.080 --> 37:26.260
How can you believe such a thing, that this
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth

37:26.260 --> 37:27.260
produces these things?

37:27.260 --> 37:28.680
But logically you can see, logically.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.680
Logically.

37:29.680 --> 37:38.060
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

37:38.060 --> 37:43.034
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons?

37:43.034 --> 37:44.320
It’s called as Ritambhara pragya in the
Hatha Yoga.

37:44.320 --> 37:48.770
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which
thinks.

37:48.770 --> 37:55.890
She has a mind of Her own, She decides and
She works out everything.

37:55.890 --> 37:58.660
This concept was doubly denied in the West,
is first is that they cannot accept a Goddess.

37:58.660 --> 37:59.869
Woman has no part.

37:59.869 --> 38:06.910
Right from Socrates onward, nobody has talked
much about a Woman, except of course there

38:06.910 --> 38:16.430
is Athena and all that, but it’s very minor
roles they have.

38:16.430 --> 38:28.940
Greeks had goddesses who were just like human
beings, so that also gets ruled out, and very

38:28.940 --> 38:30.190
little was accepted; and when Christianity
came, somehow or other Christians saw to it

38:30.190 --> 38:34.002
that there should be no mention of the Mother
in any way.

38:34.002 --> 38:35.350
But despite that, people worshipped the Mother.

38:35.350 --> 38:42.956
They worshipped the Mother of Christ as, some
like a Goddess; though in the Bible She’s

38:42.956 --> 39:01.609
talked as a “woman”, in a very derogatory
style She’s addressed.

39:01.609 --> 39:12.920
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

39:12.920 --> 39:24.849
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication?

39:24.849 --> 39:41.140
What is the justification or what is the logical
thing, how to explain?

39:41.140 --> 39:44.670
So you have to say: “It is a mystery.

39:44.670 --> 39:46.569
God is a mystery.

39:46.569 --> 39:48.980
He hangs somewhere in the air.

39:48.980 --> 39:52.040
He does everything.”

39:52.040 --> 39:56.450
And how can people believe in it?

39:56.450 --> 40:02.880
So the Christian conditioning has been even
worse than, I think, Jew conditioning because

40:02.880 --> 40:07.400
they just took it out, Christ’s Mother,
away; though the painters, artists wouldn’t

40:07.400 --> 40:14.230
do that, they wouldn’t accept: they had
the Mother there.

40:14.230 --> 40:18.430
But despite all that, the Motherhood has not
been respected that should have been, in the

40:18.430 --> 40:26.670
Bible, which is a very wrong thing, while
Mahalakshmi Herself incarnated as Mother Mary

40:26.670 --> 40:27.670
Herself.

40:27.670 --> 40:32.650
And to say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”,
I think is a great insult.

40:32.650 --> 40:34.620
And where women are insulted like this, where
the Goddesses are insulted, we cannot expect

40:34.620 --> 40:36.190
any spiritual growth unless and until you
accept that it’s the Shakti, is the Motherhood,

40:36.190 --> 40:39.490
who is the only thing that’s the communication
between us and the Divinity.

40:39.490 --> 40:40.579
So this conditioning, Christian conditioning
has to go out, as far as the Motherhood is

40:40.579 --> 40:41.579
concerned.

40:41.579 --> 40:45.119
It’s very surprising sometimes when I see
how these people have tried to bring down

40:45.119 --> 40:46.119
the level of a Goddess to just a woman.

40:46.119 --> 40:47.119
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

40:47.119 --> 40:48.119
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

40:48.119 --> 40:49.119
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only.

40:49.119 --> 40:50.119
It’s not done by God Almighty, He’s just
a spectator.

40:50.119 --> 40:51.119
She does everything.

40:51.119 --> 40:52.119
Once that concept can fit into your heads
properly, then you will see so many conditionings

40:52.119 --> 40:54.450
will drop out; because religion was organized,
and in an organized religion you can put whatever

40:54.450 --> 40:57.770
you like, the way you want to put it, and
it was such a big mistake.

40:57.770 --> 40:58.770
By that people developed a lot of ego, lot
of things against women, and also the first

40:58.770 --> 40:59.850
sin they call the “original sin” and all
that is because of a woman, they really ill-treated

40:59.850 --> 41:00.850
women and they have no respect for them.

41:00.850 --> 41:01.850
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

41:01.850 --> 41:02.850
they have tried to become something like actresses.

41:02.850 --> 41:16.369
But you can understand that without the power
there is no sense in anything, and this is

41:16.369 --> 41:18.641
the power of Love and this is the power of
Truth.

41:18.641 --> 41:19.641
And once you get that power we should humble
down, and know that this power is within us,

41:19.641 --> 41:20.641
which has given us all this knowledge, which
has given us all this ability to raise the

41:20.641 --> 41:21.641
Kundalini.

41:21.641 --> 41:22.641
All this is because of energy within us, the
Shakti within us.

41:22.641 --> 41:23.641
Without that we are nothing.

41:23.641 --> 41:24.641
And that too is the Mother who has done it.

41:24.641 --> 41:33.480
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

41:33.480 --> 41:34.740
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?”

41:34.740 --> 41:35.869
I mean, it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”,
as if I am sort of a, that movement where

41:35.869 --> 41:40.670
women are starting a fight with the men, sort
of a thing, and now: “This is another guru

41:40.670 --> 41:45.309
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

41:45.309 --> 41:47.890
It’s the only the Mother who does this job,
so there’s no question of asking such a

41:47.890 --> 41:48.890
question.

41:48.890 --> 41:49.890
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

41:49.890 --> 41:50.890
woman as a mother, is very powerful.

41:50.890 --> 41:51.890
But we should encourage it and try to develop
it, so that spiritually you can communicate,

41:51.890 --> 41:52.890
spiritually you can imbibe these qualities
for your own children.

41:52.890 --> 41:53.890
The mothers who do not have aadhyatma can
never develop good children with proper emotions,

41:53.890 --> 41:54.890
with proper value system of morality.

41:54.890 --> 41:55.890
So it is very important for every mother to
be very proud that they are mothers, and for

41:55.890 --> 41:56.890
girls who are going to be mothers to be very
proud that they are going to be mothers, and

41:56.890 --> 41:57.890
that they represent the Shakti.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.688
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

41:59.688 --> 42:00.688
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power.

42:00.688 --> 42:01.688
I’m not talking only about your wives.

42:01.688 --> 42:02.688
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

42:02.688 --> 42:03.688
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable.

42:03.688 --> 42:07.320
And women should try to be respectable, to
try to know that they are the powers and they

42:07.320 --> 42:12.690
are the ones who will be used by this Divine
power as channels, more than men.

42:12.690 --> 42:15.680
But if they are useless, then of course they
wouldn’t bother about them, they would like

42:15.680 --> 42:16.680
to bother then about men, much more than what
you are.

42:16.680 --> 42:17.680
So it is important to understand what is your
role in Sahaja Yoga.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.680
This is your role in Sahaja Yoga.

42:18.680 --> 42:19.680
And I am sure you can work it out.

42:19.680 --> 42:20.680
You can manage this part.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.140
You can equip yourself for this role, which
is so beautiful and so good.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.780
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

42:25.780 --> 42:27.190
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

42:27.190 --> 42:30.290
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

42:30.290 --> 42:31.290
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

42:31.290 --> 42:32.290
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta.

42:32.290 --> 42:34.720
Shri Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.170
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this.

42:37.170 --> 42:38.170
So seriously you must understand what is it…

42:38.170 --> 42:41.241
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

42:41.241 --> 42:44.920
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.630
Left, right is finished now, you are just
in Mahalakshmi state: what to do?

42:46.630 --> 42:48.050
“Mahalakshmi state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp,
beyond that, I don’t know what stages it

42:48.050 --> 42:49.050
is.

42:49.050 --> 42:50.050
It comes down a little bit, then again it
goes back to the same.

42:50.050 --> 42:50.056
[End of English part of talk]
