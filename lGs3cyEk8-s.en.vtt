08:23.524 --> 08:32.599
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

08:33.552 --> 08:40.547
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

08:40.748 --> 08:44.272
for all the humanity.

08:44.473 --> 08:50.788
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

08:50.988 --> 08:56.075
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

08:56.276 --> 09:01.496
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

09:05.715 --> 09:09.554
When this happened

09:13.382 --> 09:19.058
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

09:19.259 --> 09:24.711
because no one would understand Me,

09:24.912 --> 09:32.429
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

09:32.629 --> 09:38.248
to say something about Sahasrara.

09:40.038 --> 09:50.087
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

09:50.288 --> 09:58.678
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

09:58.879 --> 10:04.939
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

10:06.312 --> 10:15.098
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

10:18.000 --> 10:27.409
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

10:28.253 --> 10:32.424
and unless and until there are many lights,

10:32.625 --> 10:39.501
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

10:41.249 --> 10:45.106
It is a human error, also, all the time,

10:45.359 --> 10:52.553
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

10:52.753 --> 10:57.885
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

10:58.086 --> 11:01.573
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

11:01.774 --> 11:07.385
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

11:08.274 --> 11:13.233
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

11:13.433 --> 11:19.744
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

11:19.945 --> 11:24.232
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

11:25.259 --> 11:32.259
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

11:32.460 --> 11:37.028
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

11:37.229 --> 11:44.617
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

11:44.817 --> 11:53.884
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

11:54.085 --> 12:00.253
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

12:00.453 --> 12:07.347
Human level is moving on another plane

12:07.548 --> 12:12.580
and it has to come up to a higher plane

12:12.780 --> 12:19.115
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

12:20.652 --> 12:25.604
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

12:25.871 --> 12:32.417
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.220
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

12:36.421 --> 12:39.761
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

12:39.962 --> 12:46.146
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

12:48.655 --> 12:57.687
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

12:57.888 --> 13:05.096
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

13:05.297 --> 13:11.401
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

13:11.602 --> 13:15.708
their fondness for things may be different,

13:15.909 --> 13:21.763
but inside they are all very beautiful.

13:23.515 --> 13:29.187
And this I found out, one after another.

13:29.388 --> 13:34.302
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

13:34.503 --> 13:41.785
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

13:42.703 --> 13:46.255
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

13:46.456 --> 13:49.493
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

13:49.694 --> 13:56.759
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

13:58.586 --> 14:06.461
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

14:08.076 --> 14:14.928
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

14:15.128 --> 14:20.370
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

14:20.570 --> 14:28.015
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

14:28.215 --> 14:36.469
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

14:36.668 --> 14:41.104
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

14:41.305 --> 14:44.491
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

14:44.692 --> 14:49.432
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

14:49.677 --> 14:54.945
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

14:55.961 --> 15:03.694
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

15:04.099 --> 15:12.973
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

15:15.839 --> 15:25.201
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

15:25.400 --> 15:32.518
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

15:32.985 --> 15:42.228
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

15:42.744 --> 15:54.133
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

15:54.914 --> 16:01.771
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

16:01.971 --> 16:07.040
which gave them sense of reality,

16:07.240 --> 16:13.718
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

16:15.317 --> 16:21.601
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

16:21.801 --> 16:28.184
I didn't say that it took Me long,

16:28.383 --> 16:32.851
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

16:33.052 --> 16:36.988
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

16:37.189 --> 16:43.854
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

16:44.055 --> 16:50.653
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

16:50.854 --> 16:55.502
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

16:55.702 --> 16:58.469
but only I felt that from human level

16:58.669 --> 17:05.475
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

17:05.674 --> 17:10.805
then some of that still lingers on,

17:11.005 --> 17:16.702
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

17:16.903 --> 17:24.394
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

17:24.973 --> 17:33.838
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

17:34.038 --> 17:38.447
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

17:38.647 --> 17:45.254
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

17:45.455 --> 17:51.062
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

17:51.262 --> 17:59.748
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

18:00.895 --> 18:06.716
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

18:06.916 --> 18:13.809
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

18:16.839 --> 18:24.210
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

18:24.410 --> 18:28.926
maybe it's your own understanding.

18:29.127 --> 18:35.677
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

18:35.877 --> 18:41.781
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

18:41.982 --> 18:46.944
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

18:47.145 --> 18:51.857
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

18:52.058 --> 18:58.286
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.803
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

19:01.003 --> 19:06.470
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

19:06.670 --> 19:16.091
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

19:16.291 --> 19:23.803
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

19:25.078 --> 19:30.829
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

19:46.839 --> 19:52.642
When you feel responsible, you must know

19:52.843 --> 19:58.752
that you are not in charge, one thing.

19:58.961 --> 20:07.875
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

20:08.264 --> 20:18.048
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

20:19.894 --> 20:24.549
So to think that you are doing anything

20:24.749 --> 20:30.065
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

20:30.263 --> 20:35.707
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

20:35.908 --> 20:40.821
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

20:41.571 --> 20:45.328
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

20:45.528 --> 20:52.125
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

20:52.520 --> 21:00.229
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

21:00.446 --> 21:06.058
this great tree of spirituality within you.

21:06.294 --> 21:15.722
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

21:15.931 --> 21:24.345
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

21:25.459 --> 21:33.817
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

21:35.955 --> 21:40.095
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

21:40.296 --> 21:46.438
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.115
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

21:50.315 --> 21:53.351
You are testing yourself, and now must know

21:53.551 --> 21:58.637
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

22:01.412 --> 22:04.907
where very few have entered.

22:15.125 --> 22:19.357
And there in that garden, when you enter,

22:19.714 --> 22:30.411
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

22:32.209 --> 22:38.158
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

22:38.816 --> 22:46.889
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

22:47.089 --> 22:51.324
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

22:51.524 --> 22:55.512
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

22:55.713 --> 23:01.880
that friendship, without any expectation.

23:03.035 --> 23:06.351
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

23:06.551 --> 23:12.161
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

23:12.361 --> 23:17.642
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

23:18.785 --> 23:23.506
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

23:23.706 --> 23:27.914
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

23:28.114 --> 23:33.676
or he's not doing much in life.

23:42.577 --> 23:46.444
This integration, this oneness,

23:46.645 --> 23:51.191
this feeling of identification with others

23:51.392 --> 23:57.683
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

24:00.540 --> 24:06.721
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

24:07.764 --> 24:12.735
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

24:12.935 --> 24:18.323
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

24:18.523 --> 24:23.508
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

24:23.955 --> 24:28.652
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

24:28.853 --> 24:34.233
but I've seen how it happens.

24:35.777 --> 24:42.892
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

24:43.092 --> 24:48.941
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

24:50.778 --> 24:53.475
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

24:53.675 --> 25:00.509
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

25:00.710 --> 25:05.185
Here then, you become absolutely humble

25:05.587 --> 25:09.904
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

25:11.364 --> 25:15.362
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

25:15.561 --> 25:20.475
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

25:21.527 --> 25:29.484
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

25:31.191 --> 25:36.300
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

25:37.229 --> 25:44.389
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

25:44.590 --> 25:50.457
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

25:50.897 --> 25:56.007
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

25:59.079 --> 26:04.193
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

26:04.626 --> 26:08.299
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

26:10.542 --> 26:20.495
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

26:21.204 --> 26:25.924
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

26:26.125 --> 26:30.183
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

26:32.854 --> 26:36.893
Such a flexible temperament you developed

26:37.094 --> 26:41.848
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

26:42.085 --> 26:46.698
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

26:46.899 --> 26:51.548
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

26:51.747 --> 26:58.749
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

26:58.950 --> 27:06.656
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

27:08.728 --> 27:14.580
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

27:14.781 --> 27:21.100
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

27:21.301 --> 27:25.698
to do this great job, to do that.

27:31.744 --> 27:40.757
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

27:41.856 --> 27:46.400
nor you should think that you are very
small.

27:48.357 --> 27:57.068
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

27:57.268 --> 28:06.360
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

28:06.560 --> 28:10.927
It could expand into anything,

28:12.001 --> 28:17.448
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

28:18.548 --> 28:26.515
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

28:27.714 --> 28:33.814
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

28:34.014 --> 28:40.039
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

28:40.239 --> 28:45.245
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

28:45.500 --> 28:52.191
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

28:53.655 --> 29:00.628
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

29:00.829 --> 29:06.639
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

29:06.838 --> 29:14.380
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

29:15.763 --> 29:18.901
I'll give you an example.

29:20.022 --> 29:26.506
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

29:26.707 --> 29:31.809
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

29:32.009 --> 29:35.975
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

29:36.175 --> 29:42.583
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

29:42.784 --> 29:47.585
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

29:48.894 --> 29:54.735
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

29:54.936 --> 29:58.668
and she couldn't move her fingers.

29:59.189 --> 30:04.293
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

30:04.493 --> 30:09.496
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

30:09.696 --> 30:14.293
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

30:14.493 --> 30:18.780
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

30:21.417 --> 30:24.112
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

30:24.313 --> 30:27.609
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

30:27.810 --> 30:30.473
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

30:30.673 --> 30:32.746
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

30:32.947 --> 30:36.411
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

30:36.689 --> 30:41.533
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

30:41.733 --> 30:45.309
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

30:45.510 --> 30:47.249
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

30:47.450 --> 30:52.366
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

30:52.566 --> 30:57.347
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

31:00.184 --> 31:03.242
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

31:03.443 --> 31:09.249
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.731
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

31:13.930 --> 31:16.291
if you have to do that, it will work out.

31:16.452 --> 31:21.030
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.956
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

31:25.157 --> 31:27.938
and who is not a realized soul.

31:28.138 --> 31:33.209
A realized soul person is not bothered

31:33.410 --> 31:40.576
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

31:41.845 --> 31:44.488
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

31:44.689 --> 31:50.951
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

31:55.387 --> 31:58.572
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

31:58.772 --> 32:03.294
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

32:03.495 --> 32:07.118
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

32:07.319 --> 32:10.207
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

32:10.408 --> 32:16.336
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

32:16.649 --> 32:20.832
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

32:21.033 --> 32:24.032
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

32:24.233 --> 32:29.059
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

32:29.259 --> 32:32.907
That you can live under any circumstances

32:33.107 --> 32:39.785
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

32:41.402 --> 32:46.696
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

32:49.883 --> 32:55.819
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

32:56.020 --> 32:58.973
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

32:59.173 --> 33:01.985
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

33:02.185 --> 33:06.055
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

33:06.255 --> 33:13.643
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

33:14.210 --> 33:18.814
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

33:19.014 --> 33:25.025
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

33:25.225 --> 33:34.069
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

33:34.540 --> 33:39.729
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

33:39.929 --> 33:46.064
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

33:46.458 --> 33:53.135
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

33:53.335 --> 34:01.524
If it can, it will, and also it tries

34:01.725 --> 34:10.164
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

34:10.787 --> 34:16.383
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

34:16.584 --> 34:21.801
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

34:22.610 --> 34:28.451
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

34:28.785 --> 34:37.419
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

34:39.852 --> 34:47.889
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

34:48.090 --> 34:54.321
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

34:54.522 --> 34:58.749
this Divine power, they cannot.

34:59.701 --> 35:04.102
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

35:04.303 --> 35:12.029
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

35:12.230 --> 35:18.391
and now you are just like great citizens

35:18.591 --> 35:25.911
of the great realm of divinity.

35:26.296 --> 35:32.507
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

35:33.475 --> 35:40.853
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

35:41.419 --> 35:51.334
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

35:51.834 --> 36:00.048
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

36:00.248 --> 36:06.032
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

36:06.232 --> 36:13.950
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

36:14.482 --> 36:20.606
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

36:20.787 --> 36:25.865
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

36:26.065 --> 36:31.326
But it never means that you should give up,

36:31.526 --> 36:37.090
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

36:37.291 --> 36:45.326
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

36:45.781 --> 36:49.807
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

36:50.007 --> 36:57.004
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

36:57.204 --> 37:03.280
or I do not earnestly want anything.

37:05.261 --> 37:09.915
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

37:10.779 --> 37:16.977
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

37:17.238 --> 37:22.487
You people are very differently made.

37:22.688 --> 37:25.961
Because you have achieved something.

37:36.186 --> 37:42.843
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

37:43.791 --> 37:46.559
Because you’ve achieved something,

37:46.760 --> 37:53.583
you know how you were and what you are now.

37:56.558 --> 38:04.643
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

38:06.020 --> 38:10.648
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

38:10.849 --> 38:15.959
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

38:16.160 --> 38:21.583
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

38:21.784 --> 38:30.174
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

38:30.658 --> 38:37.117
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

38:37.317 --> 38:42.775
You have crossed the bondage and now

38:42.976 --> 38:47.312
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

38:49.141 --> 38:56.070
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

38:56.270 --> 39:05.110
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

39:05.311 --> 39:09.120
then this lotus opens like this.

39:10.275 --> 39:15.298
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

39:16.993 --> 39:22.104
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

39:22.305 --> 39:28.754
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

39:28.955 --> 39:34.990
just like these, and they look like flames.

39:35.190 --> 39:41.805
But these flames are not with any heat,

39:42.005 --> 39:47.223
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

39:47.423 --> 39:54.722
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

39:56.414 --> 40:01.758
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

40:02.139 --> 40:09.632
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

40:11.953 --> 40:14.917
This is what has happened to you.

40:16.638 --> 40:22.323
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

40:24.741 --> 40:30.128
and there where we fail, sometimes,

40:30.422 --> 40:37.388
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

40:38.515 --> 40:46.373
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

40:46.574 --> 40:50.191
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

40:50.392 --> 40:59.314
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

41:05.009 --> 41:07.947
So you have to be,

41:15.840 --> 41:18.821
you have to be on the guard,

41:20.683 --> 41:26.393
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

41:27.798 --> 41:33.182
The first is ego, which how to attack,

41:33.383 --> 41:38.497
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

41:39.101 --> 41:42.279
that's the only vehicle.

41:46.572 --> 41:52.066
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

41:52.267 --> 41:56.789
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

41:58.745 --> 42:03.987
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

42:04.876 --> 42:10.910
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

42:13.208 --> 42:15.843
Why are you angry?

42:16.883 --> 42:21.970
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

42:22.171 --> 42:25.412
or to check someone? Why?

42:25.926 --> 42:28.695
The mind will not answer.

42:31.547 --> 42:34.912
The simple thing, if you can do,

42:35.113 --> 42:40.829
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

42:41.813 --> 42:48.406
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

42:50.775 --> 42:54.263
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

42:54.463 --> 42:57.590
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

42:57.791 --> 43:03.413
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

43:05.790 --> 43:09.591
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

43:09.792 --> 43:14.496
just know that you have to love that person.

43:17.230 --> 43:21.265
Now, how will you love that person?

43:21.465 --> 43:28.858
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

43:29.059 --> 43:34.449
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

43:36.453 --> 43:41.589
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

43:42.200 --> 43:47.760
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

43:47.960 --> 43:51.663
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

43:51.864 --> 43:56.073
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

43:56.289 --> 44:01.205
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

44:01.459 --> 44:04.169
Very amusing.

44:06.864 --> 44:11.396
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

44:11.596 --> 44:18.661
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

44:18.862 --> 44:22.649
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

44:22.850 --> 44:25.653
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

44:25.821 --> 44:26.933
makes no difference.

44:27.134 --> 44:32.377
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

44:32.578 --> 44:39.453
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

44:41.354 --> 44:44.885
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

44:45.086 --> 44:50.341
and that's the only source of her life,

44:50.542 --> 44:54.668
then I can understand why she is so upset.

45:00.848 --> 45:03.713
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

45:03.914 --> 45:08.033
very easily, it's not difficult,

45:08.525 --> 45:13.158
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

45:13.681 --> 45:22.827
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

45:23.807 --> 45:27.751
then what happens, you get understanding.

45:27.982 --> 45:34.389
Understanding of that person, you realize,

45:35.801 --> 45:39.411
as if identified with that person.

45:40.288 --> 45:45.114
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

45:45.315 --> 45:50.855
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

45:51.056 --> 45:55.741
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

45:55.941 --> 46:01.141
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

46:04.903 --> 46:10.887
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

46:11.088 --> 46:14.487
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

46:14.688 --> 46:19.454
The identification with another is very
important.

46:24.026 --> 46:29.587
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

46:30.829 --> 46:36.396
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

46:37.804 --> 46:44.753
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

46:44.953 --> 46:51.948
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

46:53.555 --> 47:04.656
This ego will immediately sucked in

47:04.857 --> 47:11.466
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

47:16.497 --> 47:21.246
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

47:22.579 --> 47:31.523
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

47:32.392 --> 47:36.103
Because you are a realized soul.

47:39.456 --> 47:43.566
Also, as I said,

47:45.673 --> 47:49.743
when you are identified with another
person,

47:50.339 --> 47:55.969
you put that person in charge of divinity -

48:01.703 --> 48:07.518
just a feeling of oneness.

48:10.541 --> 48:17.456
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

48:20.372 --> 48:26.684
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

48:26.885 --> 48:34.104
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

48:34.305 --> 48:38.729
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

48:38.930 --> 48:44.735
Not a saint, saint never says that.

48:45.648 --> 48:47.509
That time, when you say that,

48:47.710 --> 48:51.273
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

48:51.474 --> 48:53.828
For example, the one, now supposing

48:54.029 --> 48:59.246
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

49:00.734 --> 49:04.487
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

49:04.688 --> 49:09.664
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

49:14.184 --> 49:18.521
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

49:19.283 --> 49:22.325
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

49:22.526 --> 49:25.486
or the gentleman who has done it,

49:26.228 --> 49:30.633
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

49:31.284 --> 49:35.843
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

49:36.044 --> 49:38.750
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

49:38.951 --> 49:43.268
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

49:47.141 --> 49:50.764
Who are you to judge anyone?

49:56.189 --> 50:04.888
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

50:06.027 --> 50:13.104
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

50:13.305 --> 50:17.244
So why waste energy on judging others?

50:21.276 --> 50:27.137
We should see what is good in others,

50:29.062 --> 50:32.801
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

50:33.002 --> 50:35.518
everything first class.

50:37.810 --> 50:45.640
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

50:47.573 --> 50:52.371
You can watch, you can witness,

50:53.212 --> 50:58.706
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

50:58.907 --> 51:02.760
something that would upset others.

51:03.762 --> 51:06.676
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

51:06.877 --> 51:12.097
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

51:12.298 --> 51:15.933
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

51:16.134 --> 51:18.780
is just bubbling through that,

51:18.981 --> 51:23.761
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

51:23.962 --> 51:28.950
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

51:29.291 --> 51:32.016
You can be in the same position.

51:32.217 --> 51:34.763
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

51:34.963 --> 51:37.998
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

51:38.198 --> 51:42.802
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

51:43.286 --> 51:48.604
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

51:48.902 --> 51:52.984
you are too great to bother about these
things.

51:53.987 --> 52:00.105
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

52:00.306 --> 52:04.647
and just making yourselves small.

52:06.881 --> 52:13.363
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

52:13.564 --> 52:21.513
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

52:22.676 --> 52:28.381
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

52:29.988 --> 52:36.361
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

52:37.146 --> 52:41.087
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

52:42.734 --> 52:46.263
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

52:49.120 --> 52:53.439
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

52:58.705 --> 53:05.909
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

53:06.110 --> 53:09.461
what love I have expressed?

53:09.875 --> 53:14.818
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

53:15.770 --> 53:22.374
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

53:22.575 --> 53:26.432
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

53:26.632 --> 53:32.020
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

53:32.221 --> 53:38.748
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

53:39.045 --> 53:42.160
But what have you done

53:45.858 --> 53:50.112
in this realm of reality?

53:50.660 --> 53:54.437
Have you enjoyed the reality?

53:55.794 --> 54:06.335
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

54:09.371 --> 54:19.658
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

54:20.904 --> 54:26.540
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

54:26.741 --> 54:32.879
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

54:33.418 --> 54:42.165
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

54:44.095 --> 54:57.858
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

54:59.311 --> 55:03.803
So ugly this world has become.

55:05.351 --> 55:08.530
Can you beautify it?

55:11.201 --> 55:15.223
You can, because you can transform people.

55:15.424 --> 55:22.895
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

55:25.153 --> 55:31.681
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

55:32.816 --> 55:39.210
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

55:40.360 --> 55:47.557
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

55:47.758 --> 55:52.907
The another side is that we are still
identified

55:53.107 --> 55:57.567
with things which we should not have been
identified.

55:59.809 --> 56:02.640
We can just find out.

56:04.890 --> 56:14.503
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

56:17.483 --> 56:27.713
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

56:29.979 --> 56:33.928
All the fools, you see,

56:34.129 --> 56:40.688
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

56:40.889 --> 56:50.811
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

56:51.851 --> 56:55.469
God knows when it is going to collide.

56:56.001 --> 57:01.979
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

57:02.180 --> 57:06.010
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

57:06.211 --> 57:09.872
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

57:10.073 --> 57:14.143
come home and again quarrel and fight.

57:16.679 --> 57:20.729
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

57:21.110 --> 57:24.470
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

57:24.671 --> 57:28.672
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

57:28.873 --> 57:33.414
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

57:33.615 --> 57:37.505
and what happens to them? Nothing.

57:37.808 --> 57:42.415
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

57:42.616 --> 57:48.011
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

57:48.741 --> 57:53.982
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

57:57.636 --> 58:03.268
I've known so many people like that.

58:07.522 --> 58:16.031
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

58:16.232 --> 58:20.275
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

58:20.476 --> 58:25.872
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

58:26.073 --> 58:29.857
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

58:30.058 --> 58:36.280
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

58:37.447 --> 58:41.900
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

58:42.100 --> 58:45.312
everybody knew he's having a bath,

58:45.513 --> 58:51.789
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

58:51.990 --> 58:57.640
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

58:58.227 --> 59:00.736
and I heard something like,

59:00.937 --> 59:04.059
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

59:04.260 --> 59:07.315
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

59:07.516 --> 59:12.324
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

59:12.525 --> 59:16.639
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

59:16.840 --> 59:22.520
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

59:22.720 --> 59:30.508
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

59:30.708 --> 59:33.394
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

59:33.595 --> 59:38.725
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

59:40.419 --> 59:44.446
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

59:44.922 --> 59:48.661
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

59:48.862 --> 59:55.874
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

59:56.075 --> 01:00:05.275
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

01:00:05.973 --> 01:00:09.598
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

01:00:09.799 --> 01:00:16.436
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

01:00:17.484 --> 01:00:21.328
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

01:00:21.529 --> 01:00:26.879
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.835
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

01:00:33.036 --> 01:00:40.469
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

01:00:41.183 --> 01:00:45.516
That kills the full experience of reality.

01:00:47.082 --> 01:00:52.342
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

01:00:52.543 --> 01:00:57.257
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.256
morning till evening.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.472
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

01:01:03.673 --> 01:01:05.953
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

01:01:06.154 --> 01:01:09.254
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

01:01:09.455 --> 01:01:12.207
But we are not brainless people.

01:01:12.408 --> 01:01:17.418
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:22.071
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

01:01:22.272 --> 01:01:25.987
or which are something, we don't.

01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:39.082
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:48.139
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

01:01:49.322 --> 01:01:53.442
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:56.720
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:02:03.508
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

01:02:03.709 --> 01:02:11.119
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:23.773
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:31.595
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:38.896
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

01:02:39.097 --> 01:02:44.913
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

01:02:45.114 --> 01:02:49.945
It's absolutely a flexible personality

01:02:50.146 --> 01:03:00.855
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:10.843
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

01:03:12.398 --> 01:03:19.390
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:28.279
that are facing us because of stupidity.

01:03:30.108 --> 01:03:34.318
This integration I'm sure will take place,

01:03:36.846 --> 01:03:45.193
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

01:03:45.709 --> 01:03:55.446
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

01:03:55.850 --> 01:03:58.840
It's going to happen.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:04.242
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

01:04:04.443 --> 01:04:10.324
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

01:04:10.525 --> 01:04:16.235
to truth and reality? It will.

01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:21.811
So today, on such an important day for us,

01:04:22.012 --> 01:04:28.580
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:38.580
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

01:04:38.781 --> 01:04:44.867
light of compassion, light of love

01:04:46.895 --> 01:04:55.646
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

01:04:56.289 --> 01:05:04.160
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

01:05:05.025 --> 01:05:08.561
May God bless you.
