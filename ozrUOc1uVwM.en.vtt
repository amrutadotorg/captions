WEBVTT

07:39.700 --> 07:48.760
So very nice to come and meet you all here.
Very kind of you to have invited Me to your

07:48.980 --> 08:01.700
ashram.
So you must have realized from experience

08:01.720 --> 08:08.880
of these two days’ program that we had,
though it looks formidable in the beginning

08:09.400 --> 08:17.340
it’s not so difficult to achieve results
and

08:17.400 --> 08:33.081
to get people realized. I find all of you
have been very sensible and you worked it

08:33.090 --> 08:43.449
out very well.
It was such a pleasure, such a joy for Me

08:43.449 --> 08:52.560
to see that you gave Realization to so many
people and you managed to convince them about

08:52.560 --> 09:03.790
Sahaja Yoga. It is very difficult in these
modern times, especially in the country like

09:03.790 --> 09:26.000
America and others of the same kind that it’s
impossible for people to know that there is

09:26.000 --> 09:32.209
anything beyond.
Of course, unknowingly they are seeking – unknowingly.

09:32.209 --> 09:42.480
They are not even aware that there’s a possibility
of their getting a Self Realization. And so

09:42.480 --> 09:53.510
many fake people have arrived that they think
it’s another kind of a guru shopping that

09:53.510 --> 10:00.889
they have to go through.
And when I came first to America, I think

10:00.889 --> 10:07.310
the first country I came to was America in
a way. I had gone to Iran before that because

10:07.310 --> 10:20.550
My brother was there. And when I came first
to America it was a surprise to Me in so many

10:20.550 --> 10:31.449
ways, that they came to My lectures, quite
a lot of them in every place I went to.

10:31.449 --> 10:45.970
But they did not understand what I was saying,
what I was trying to communicate to them.

10:45.970 --> 10:51.490
And they did not like that I told them that
they have to be careful about people who take

10:51.490 --> 11:01.040
money from them, there are no courses. I think
there are these lectures somewhere with Me,

11:01.040 --> 11:05.880
which I gave in those days. I didn’t talk
of negativity or anything though I found the

11:05.880 --> 11:15.870
whole place was flooded with negative forces.
All that was done in those days had an effect

11:15.870 --> 11:24.420
on the minds of the seekers and that’s how
the seekers were lost, so many of them were

11:24.420 --> 11:33.769
lost. And again, what we find that they are
getting lost more and more.

11:33.769 --> 11:46.149
At this time we cannot say in what area or
what group or what part of the country we’ll

11:46.149 --> 11:55.339
be able to work out better. But in any case,
better in the West Coast. I think people are

11:55.339 --> 12:08.019
more reasonable about it. For you it is a
difficult task to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

12:08.019 --> 12:16.490
But I would say you should go all out. Not
to feel shy, not to make reservations about

12:16.490 --> 12:22.610
it.
How they talk about their gurus all the time.

12:22.610 --> 12:27.910
You meet somebody in the plane sitting next
to you, suddenly he starts talking about his

12:27.910 --> 12:32.949
guru. You are amazed, when you don’t know
the person at all, he starts talking about

12:32.949 --> 12:42.970
his guru. So to open the topic best is to
wear something of My photograph or something

12:42.970 --> 12:49.279
so that people ask who is this person to begin
with. Or could be a badge if you can wear

12:49.279 --> 12:55.380
it or if it is allowed to wear. Something
like that if you wear and people ask you,

12:55.380 --> 13:02.410
you can talk. You can start talking.
We have to talk. That’s the only way we

13:02.410 --> 13:05.930
can spread Sahaja Yoga.
Of course, you can have programs, you can

13:05.930 --> 13:12.079
get people, you can give them Realization,
this that. But to talk about it is important,

13:12.079 --> 13:16.579
because see those people who have come much
later than Me, much, much later than Me to

13:16.579 --> 13:22.839
this country have so much well known everywhere.
Everybody knows about them.

13:22.839 --> 13:29.660
Now of course, it is also true, the second
point is that in Sahaja Yoga you have to become.

13:29.660 --> 13:33.420
You cannot just say that, “All right, I
have become a Sahaja Yogi.” No, you cannot.

13:33.420 --> 13:38.660
Nor can you say, “I am following Shri Mataji;”
that also cannot be said. Nor you can say

13:38.660 --> 13:42.589
that, “All right, we have an organization,”
or something like that, or, “ I’m wearing

13:42.589 --> 13:46.480
this just because She is my guru.” You can’t
say that. You have to become. You have to

13:46.480 --> 13:50.860
become a Sahaja Yogi.
If you have to become a Sahaja Yogi, then

13:50.860 --> 14:01.399
it has to be worked out and that takes time.
To rise from Nirvichara to Nirvikalpa it takes

14:01.399 --> 14:06.480
time. For some people it takes more time.
For some people it takes less time. Depends

14:06.480 --> 14:13.879
on the preparation of a person. Also I would
say, previous lives, good deeds and this life’s

14:13.879 --> 14:20.569
understanding, so many things are there. So
it takes time. But at least one can talk about

14:20.569 --> 14:27.370
it so the atmosphere is created.
You can talk to people, tell them that “We

14:27.370 --> 14:34.699
have found the truth and it’s very simple.
You can’t pay for it. It just works. It’s

14:34.699 --> 14:40.709
spontaneous. It’s a living process. It’s
a evolutionary process.” You can talk like

14:40.709 --> 14:46.810
that. Not about Me, but about Sahaja Yoga,
in an abstract manner. “And it’s such

14:46.810 --> 14:53.589
a wonderful thing, one should do it.” All
such talks are going to help us a lot though

14:53.589 --> 15:00.800
I would say, those who listen to you may not
get Realization, but at least in the atmosphere

15:00.800 --> 15:05.819
it will be. And that is going to help us a
lot. If it is in the atmosphere, people know

15:05.819 --> 15:08.740
that there’s something like this coming
up.

15:08.740 --> 15:15.440
For you people, of course, you have to work
hard and you have to become Sahaja Yogis.

15:15.440 --> 15:23.899
Becoming is a little bit difficult task sometimes
because there is this great Mr. Ego or may

15:23.899 --> 15:31.009
be certain conditionings, you see, that people
can’t give up, and that they find it difficult

15:31.009 --> 15:39.519
to get out. But if you know how to raise your
Kundalini, She will manage it. She knows how

15:39.519 --> 15:45.399
to do it and She will give you that status.
But first and foremost thing is to meditate

15:45.399 --> 15:51.110
and to raise your Kundalini. Meditation is
the only way you can grow. There’s no other

15:51.110 --> 15:57.290
way out. Because when you meditate you are
in silence, you are in thoughtless awareness.

15:57.290 --> 16:03.079
Then the growth of awareness takes place,
then it opens out. But if you are thinking

16:03.079 --> 16:09.990
– supposing there is a lake and the lake
is completely in a turmoil. Nothing can grow.

16:09.990 --> 16:15.810
But supposing it is silent, then lotuses can
grow, anything can grow in it. In the same

16:15.810 --> 16:27.449
way, if your mind is agitated and your growth
is not yet fully expressing itself, then it’s

16:27.449 --> 16:35.420
such a vicious circle that you are agitated
and your growth is hindered, again you are

16:35.420 --> 16:40.649
agitated, your growth is hindered.
So the best way is to take to meditation.

16:40.649 --> 16:48.600
When you take to meditation this turmoil will
settle down. And when it will settle down,

16:48.600 --> 16:53.560
your growth will take place. After meditation
you’ll feel definitely that you have come

16:53.560 --> 16:59.560
out very well, you have grown very well. But
for that one has to be very honest. You cannot

16:59.560 --> 17:04.000
force people to be honest. That’s one thing
you can’t do. You have to be honest yourself.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.850
You are not to be hypocrite. You have to see
for yourself that whatever you are doing is

17:08.850 --> 17:14.620
for your benevolence, is for your good, and
that you have to do it because it is good

17:14.620 --> 17:20.460
for you, to begin with. And then for the good
of the humanity. You are doing for the good

17:20.460 --> 17:23.860
of the humanity.
Now some people who come for the first time

17:23.860 --> 17:29.020
will have lots of doubts because of ego. They
have lots of doubts because of ego. “How

17:29.020 --> 17:36.250
can that be? How can this be? How?” I mean
all kinds of things they ask. Now, you have

17:36.250 --> 17:42.260
to say that first of all you develop your
insight. You develop your enlightenment. Your

17:42.260 --> 17:49.120
light is not sufficient. In the light only
there are no doubts. Supposing in darkness

17:49.120 --> 17:55.580
you think that this table has no cover. Is
all right. You can think whatever you like,

17:55.580 --> 17:59.700
but when there is light you see for yourself
there is a beautiful cover on top of this

17:59.700 --> 18:04.820
table.
In the same way, it happens to us that we

18:04.820 --> 18:12.200
have to achieve a state. And once we achieve
that state then there’s no question, there’s

18:12.200 --> 18:18.750
no doubt, there’s nothing, and you become
so empowered. It is such a simultaneous thing.

18:18.750 --> 18:25.880
It works. As soon as you achieve something,
it works. When it works, then you are convinced.

18:25.880 --> 18:33.220
It’s a, I’d say, is a very beautiful new
chain starts within yourself and then you

18:33.220 --> 18:45.060
really starts enjoying your joy of your Self.
But that portion for anyone is little risky,

18:45.060 --> 18:51.520
for anyone. If you have crossed that, then
you are above it. But if you are still little

18:51.520 --> 19:00.070
bit in between, be careful.
You can be deluded. You can be quite deceived

19:00.070 --> 19:06.680
about it because we have all kinds of people
in Sahaja Yoga. The door is open to everyone.

19:06.680 --> 19:11.990
We get many negative people also. They are
still lingering on the periphery. And you

19:11.990 --> 19:16.060
are also on the periphery, then you meet those
people, and you think, “How can that be?

19:16.060 --> 19:21.060
This person was so bad. He says he’s a Sahaja
Yogi, but he’s like this, like this, like

19:21.060 --> 19:29.990
this.” That shows one thing for definite,
that if you see somebody of that kind, of

19:29.990 --> 19:40.870
that mentality, which is not Sahaja, if you
see someone who is not up to the mark, and

19:40.870 --> 19:48.020
who behaves in a very mundane manner, or may
be in a very ridiculous manner, know that

19:48.020 --> 19:53.680
that person is not a Sahaja Yogi.
But you have to be Sahaja Yogi. Don’t judge

19:53.680 --> 20:03.150
Sahaja Yoga by other people. You judge it
by your own ascent and by your own enlightenment.

20:03.150 --> 20:08.750
If you are not enlightened you cannot see
anything. Even if you are slightly enlightened

20:08.750 --> 20:14.970
and not enlightened fully, then you see other
people. Don’t see other people. See yourself.

20:14.970 --> 20:22.810
Seeing yourself, you will become more aware
and more conscious. And once this awareness

20:22.810 --> 20:30.780
grows, you start seeing the truth as it exists.
So for Sahaja Yogis it is important, first

20:30.780 --> 20:40.160
of all to watch themselves.
Now we discovered that, you see, in the groups

20:40.160 --> 20:46.690
that will form a collective and when we start
living together, see some of the old style

20:46.690 --> 20:52.710
things still linger on. The common thing is
the gossip. This is, Christ has called then,

20:52.710 --> 20:57.780
“Beware of the murmuring souls.” He knew
that these will be coming back on the stage

20:57.780 --> 21:04.080
again when I will be here to tell you about
Sahaja Yoga. So He already told that, “Beware

21:04.080 --> 21:08.050
of the murmuring souls.”
And these murmuring souls, first of all their

21:08.050 --> 21:12.060
attention is not all right. Their attention
is here and there and they’re trying to

21:12.060 --> 21:19.660
find out something. And then they start talking
about things. Then they start creating problems.

21:19.660 --> 21:30.050
And they are somehow, like to destroy your
Realization. They want that you should not

21:30.050 --> 21:36.520
achieve what you are achieving because they
cannot achieve it. So then they see that somehow

21:36.520 --> 21:41.090
you should be destroyed, so they talk to you
in a manner that you start doubting yourself.

21:41.090 --> 21:47.600
You start doubting Sahaja Yoga. Or else, they
start talking about others and try to create

21:47.600 --> 21:53.460
a problem for you.
For that I would say that nobody should talk

21:53.460 --> 22:00.370
to anyone about others. It’s one of the
tricks they can play as we have in Ramayana.

22:00.370 --> 22:06.420
There was a maidservant called Manthara.
That’s why it’s said in Indian language

22:06.420 --> 22:11.730
that, “don’t talk to people who are lower
in levels.” I don’t mean lower in the

22:11.730 --> 22:16.250
way that people understand, but lower in levels
as far as the spirituality is concerned. So

22:16.250 --> 22:22.060
this lady went and told the step mother of
Shri Rama, who loved Rama very much that,

22:22.060 --> 22:28.150
“See now, when Rama becomes the king, your
son will have no place,” and all those things.

22:28.150 --> 22:37.070
And she convinced her. By that the whole Ramayana
was created and Rama had to go to the jungle.

22:37.070 --> 22:44.450
So all such people start talking. They talk
in such a manner that you feel that oh we

22:44.450 --> 22:50.120
are very important and the lady or the gentleman
is taking so much interest in us, and she’s

22:50.120 --> 22:55.990
telling us this, and then this negative force
starts forming a group among yourselves. And

22:55.990 --> 23:07.280
when such a group is formed that group becomes
anti God, anti Sahaja Yoga, and then it is

23:07.280 --> 23:15.370
a very big problem because the undercurrents
start and they try to destroy your collective.

23:15.370 --> 23:20.890
So anybody starts talking ill of another person,
just tell that person, “Shut up. I don’t

23:20.890 --> 23:26.430
want to hear anything against anyone. If you
have to say anything go and tell the leader,

23:26.430 --> 23:33.800
but not me. I am not interested.” You be
interested in your ascent. If you are not

23:33.800 --> 23:38.200
interested in your ascent, then what you will
do, you’ll watch other people, you’ll

23:38.200 --> 23:40.870
look at others, you see how they are, not
yourself.

23:40.870 --> 23:47.860
Now it is for your gain you have come to Sahaja
Yoga, not for anybody else’s gain. First

23:47.860 --> 23:54.800
of all your gain. And once you gain something,
then you can only help others to do something

23:54.800 --> 23:59.770
about it. So it is important to understand
the first rule of Sahaja Yoga is that you

23:59.770 --> 24:12.450
look at yourself. How are you? Are you really
progressing? Or you are worried about other

24:12.450 --> 24:21.700
thing, like your business, this that? Or you
are worried about your ascent? What are you

24:21.700 --> 24:26.130
worried about? Are you worried about your
ascent? If you are worried about your ascent,

24:26.130 --> 24:32.540
what are you doing about it? That has to be
the main object of life. The rest of the things

24:32.540 --> 24:39.520
follow it. Once you ascend, the whole cosmos
can look after your problems, but you must

24:39.520 --> 24:45.490
ascend into the kingdom of God; that’s the
main point is. So first of all you have to

24:45.490 --> 24:56.260
ascertain about yourself. Am I ascending?
Am I transforming? Am I giving up all my bad

24:56.260 --> 25:05.770
habits? Am I getting rid of my temper? Am
I getting peaceful? Am I now sweet? Or am

25:05.770 --> 25:15.010
I now still the same horrible criticizer of
others? Just put your attention to yourself

25:15.010 --> 25:20.360
and see for yourself. It’s like a mirror;
you start seeing yourself in the mirror, what’s

25:20.360 --> 25:24.630
wrong with you. And then you try to correct
it.

25:24.630 --> 25:31.530
Now second point is that you must see your
vibrations, what centers you are catching

25:31.530 --> 25:36.100
yourself. For that you have to give yourself
a bandhan. You give yourself a bandhan and

25:36.100 --> 25:40.620
see for yourself what’s wrong with you.
When you give yourself a bandhan you will

25:40.620 --> 25:48.230
know about your chakras, and you’ll be amazed.
I have known some people who found out they

25:48.230 --> 25:53.050
had cancer. Through centers they could say,
“Mother we must be having cancer.” And

25:53.050 --> 25:58.470
then it was discovered in time and we could
manage it very well, because they themselves

25:58.470 --> 26:03.040
found it. And then they asked Me what to do
and then I told them and they got cured. And

26:03.040 --> 26:08.630
when they went to the doctors they said they
had cancer. And once they cured themselves

26:08.630 --> 26:12.570
they were all right.
So that is how first pay attention to yourself.

26:12.570 --> 26:17.530
You find out what’s wrong with you. Some
of you might be having terrible ego. Then

26:17.530 --> 26:21.860
may be you might be having a very bad Agnya
chakra. Then you should find out, have you

26:21.860 --> 26:27.240
got Agnya chakra? This is ego. Then there’s
a very good remedy in Sahaja Yoga, which may

26:27.240 --> 26:31.000
look ridiculous but it’s very good remedy
is to beat yourselves with shoes, as they

26:31.000 --> 26:37.650
know is the beating with the shoes is called
as a shoe treatment.

26:37.650 --> 26:46.750
Now, then you have to go further. See you
find yourself that your right side is hot.

26:46.750 --> 26:52.090
What you do is put your right side towards
the photograph and the left side up towards

26:52.090 --> 27:00.410
the ether. The ether takes away the heat.
But what actually happens is that your right

27:00.410 --> 27:07.250
side gets the vibration and the heat is pushed
towards your left and passes out into the

27:07.250 --> 27:14.370
ether. Now this heat comes from too much futuristic
living. Those people who are too much futuristic,

27:14.370 --> 27:20.330
they have too much heat. And too much heat
has to go away, and when this heat starts

27:20.330 --> 27:26.300
going away then you are amazed how it works.
For that there are various things we have

27:26.300 --> 27:32.140
to use, but mainly for right-sided people
they should not use any light at all. They

27:32.140 --> 27:37.840
should not sit in the sun. They should sit
in the moonlight. They should read some poetry.

27:37.840 --> 27:46.650
They should not tie up watches. They should
not look at time. They should allow the time

27:46.650 --> 27:53.450
to pass, and they should just become very,
sort of emotional people. They should sing

27:53.450 --> 27:57.630
songs of bhakti. They should not do Hatha
Yoga. There are so many things they should

27:57.630 --> 28:04.300
not do if they are right sided. You will be
surprised how people have been helped through

28:04.300 --> 28:10.060
this kind of a treatment, which treats one
side of your being.

28:10.060 --> 28:20.120
On the left hand side people are the people
as you know are the ones who are docile, who

28:20.120 --> 28:27.660
bear up lots of things from others and cry
and weep and all the time are on the losers

28:27.660 --> 28:33.210
end.
Such people have problems also because all

28:33.210 --> 28:42.720
their organs are lethargic and they have problems
of a lethargic heart, lethargic liver, lethargic

28:42.720 --> 28:50.220
intestines. Everything becomes very lethargic.
All these left side things can be cured. Plus

28:50.220 --> 28:55.040
they might have some sort of a badha in them,
in the sense they are possessed by someone.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.910
Of course, some of them are possessed by right
side also. Not that only the left side is

28:59.910 --> 29:05.700
possessed. But from the right side also they
are possessed. And left sided possessions

29:05.700 --> 29:12.370
are of a peculiar type, because they give
you pain in the body. You get pains in the

29:12.370 --> 29:17.010
body. Right sided person doesn’t get any
pain himself. He gives pain to others. He

29:17.010 --> 29:23.020
is very sarcastic, he is very aggressive,
he troubles others, but the left sided people

29:23.020 --> 29:27.090
have pains themselves. They get a pain here
and a pain there and pain here.

29:27.090 --> 29:31.520
So left side has to be cleared, as you know
very well through the light. Light is put

29:31.520 --> 29:36.970
before the photograph, left hand towards the
photograph, right hand on the Mother Earth.

29:36.970 --> 29:43.970
So the left hand gets the light and the light
passes through and the negativity of the left

29:43.970 --> 29:48.390
side passes to the right hand, and the right
hand is on the Mother Earth. The Mother Earth

29:48.390 --> 29:54.460
is the one who sucks in all these negative
forces of the left hand side.

29:54.460 --> 29:58.370
So these are the two sides which we clear.
But once you have cleared these two sides

29:58.370 --> 30:02.840
then you can use the photograph. Sit with
your both the hands towards the photograph

30:02.840 --> 30:09.470
and put both the feet in the water, little
bit of salt in it and about five ten minutes

30:09.470 --> 30:17.150
you must allow the vibrations to clear you
out. Then wipe your feet. Put the water properly

30:17.150 --> 30:26.370
into some disposal and then sit down for meditation.
If you can do that everyday, even ten minutes,

30:26.370 --> 30:32.120
is more than sufficient. Don’t have to do
anything in an extreme manner.

30:32.120 --> 30:36.270
In the morning time, you have to give yourself
a bandhan when you are going out. Don’t

30:36.270 --> 30:43.560
go out without giving a bandhan. And attention
should be all the time inside, in the sense

30:43.560 --> 30:48.760
that, walking on the road people have habit
of seeing this, seeing that, seeing like that.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.770
The attention gets frittered away. What you
should see is you should see about three feet

30:52.770 --> 30:57.600
or four feet at the most from the ground and
not above. Because you can see all the beautiful

30:57.600 --> 31:04.450
children, flowers everything. There is nothing
very beautiful above that. So better is to

31:04.450 --> 31:10.160
see only up three four feet if possible, to
fix your attention, so the attention becomes

31:10.160 --> 31:16.670
concentrated. And you feel very relaxed and
relieved of too much of wobbling of your eyes.

31:16.670 --> 31:24.090
Eyes are very important. Very important, and
as you will notice, because you are all realized

31:24.090 --> 31:30.310
souls, that your eyes now have got a glint,
a kind of a light in the eye. And that light

31:30.310 --> 31:38.780
shows that you are realized souls. But to
keep it up you have to look at things which

31:38.780 --> 31:48.130
are not anti God, which are not dirty, which
are not filthy, which are against Sahaj religion,

31:48.130 --> 31:56.080
which is against Sahaj culture. If you can
manage that, it is going to help you a lot.

31:56.080 --> 32:02.530
Now one has to understand that now we have
come out of all man made things, like man

32:02.530 --> 32:11.790
made countries. We don’t belong to America,
or to England, or to India. We belong to the

32:11.790 --> 32:18.190
Kingdom of God. In the universal country we
have come. Now we have become universal beings.

32:18.190 --> 32:25.200
As we have become universal being, we don’t
even have all these dividing factors, which

32:25.200 --> 32:34.190
divides human being as a race, or any higher,
lower castes. This is no more there.

32:34.190 --> 32:40.110
Moreover, now we have given up all man made
religions. We have entered into the religion,

32:40.110 --> 32:46.680
what we call as the universal religion, the
universal pure religion and we should be proud

32:46.680 --> 32:51.630
of it that somehow or other we have managed
to be there, to be in that universal pure

32:51.630 --> 32:57.370
religion.
So what is the content of this pure religion,

32:57.370 --> 33:06.500
you should know. What is the universal pure
religion has given us? First of all it has

33:06.500 --> 33:11.680
given us Self Realization. As a result of
that it has given us collective consciousness.

33:11.680 --> 33:17.840
It has given us powers to raise the Kundalini
of others. It has given us the source of compassion

33:17.840 --> 33:24.570
and love that acts, that works, and an attention
which is effective. So many things it has

33:24.570 --> 33:29.630
given us. So it’s not that when we follow
that religion, we are like any other people

33:29.630 --> 33:37.350
who follow any religion, but we have certain
powers. So these powers increase when we humble

33:37.350 --> 33:45.530
down. They do not increase with arrogance.
With arrogance one can only become stupid.

33:45.530 --> 33:54.120
That’s the only end of arrogance and ego.
So with this humility, one should know that

33:54.120 --> 34:01.220
now you belong to Sahaj culture, and Sahaj
culture is that of humility. If you are not

34:01.220 --> 34:06.040
humble, then you have not yet achieved your
Sahaja Yoga.

34:06.040 --> 34:10.990
While talking to others, I know there are
people who are horrid, who are no good, who

34:10.990 --> 34:17.500
look to be absolutely satanic. But there’s
no need to be angry with them or to shout

34:17.500 --> 34:25.769
at them. I know how to do it, how to look
after that side. You don’t have to bother.

34:25.769 --> 34:35.149
You keep your poise, you keep your balance,
you keep your smile and just manage the show.

34:35.149 --> 34:41.059
Don’t get involved into another person.
Don’t get involved into discussions and

34:41.059 --> 34:47.139
arguments. But just your silence can also
improve all that.

34:47.139 --> 34:54.559
Now as you grow up, then you will develop
the discretion and proper idea how to react,

34:54.559 --> 35:04.259
how to work it out. But you have to allow
that growth to manifest. By that you can raise

35:04.259 --> 35:09.359
the Kundalini of many. I always say those
who have raised the Kundalini of hundred people

35:09.359 --> 35:20.950
are to be given certificate that they are
Sahaja Yogis, at least hundred. That’s in

35:20.950 --> 35:29.869
India, but here I would say if you have given
Realization to ten people, the very difficult

35:29.869 --> 35:37.880
people, first of all, one is equal to hundred.
So let us keep it ten people. If you have

35:37.880 --> 35:44.329
given Realization to ten people, at least
then we can say that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

35:44.329 --> 35:50.650
and as you go on giving Realization you will
enjoy it. Enjoy it. And then you will have

35:50.650 --> 36:11.220
more powers, and more powers, and more understanding.
So best thing is that you
should try to put your attention within yourself

36:11.220 --> 36:19.190
to see for yourself how far you have come,
through your vibrations, know yourself, what

36:19.190 --> 36:27.569
is required in you. First and foremost thing,
the light has to be clean. Then see how far

36:27.569 --> 36:36.289
you can reach your light, how far you can
increase your dimension, how far you can go

36:36.289 --> 36:42.599
with others.
I hope this little, small little explanation

36:42.599 --> 36:50.930
about your meditation and your method of rising
and ascending will help you to grow further.

36:50.930 --> 37:10.640
But I don’t mind if you have any questions,
I would like to answer them.

37:10.640 --> 37:44.000
May God bless you all. May God bless you.
May God bless you.

37:44.000 --> 38:10.730
Question & Answer Session
Q1 (Lady): In my everyday course of living,

38:10.730 --> 38:41.329
I run across people, and they’re mean to
other people, they’re mean to myself, you

38:41.329 --> 38:55.259
know with no just cause whatever, and I really
have a reaction to want to be mean back, or

38:55.259 --> 39:01.970
speak up to the person, and I know it’s
not good for me. So I would think, what could

39:01.970 --> 39:30.309
all of us do when someone is mean to us or
mean to someone else to rise above it, or

39:30.309 --> 39:47.660
what can we know about it so that we can take
care of the situation by grace?

39:47.660 --> 40:31.839
Shri Mataji: I think told you the story of
a Chinese sage. In the same way, try to watch

40:31.839 --> 40:36.559
and witness. You see, somebody is shouting
or screaming at someone, he’ll keep quiet.

40:36.559 --> 40:45.859
Just watch him. Open your eyes, or you can
push it like that. Immediately the fellow

40:45.859 --> 40:51.440
will understand that he’s stupid. You see,
you have to be above everything else. It’s

40:51.440 --> 41:15.999
very simple. If somebody is saying like that
just watch that person, what is he up to?

41:15.999 --> 41:27.039
Don’t get involved.
Q2 (Gentleman): Mother, a number of years

41:27.039 --> 42:39.420
ago, I caught the disease of Herpes and I
still haven’t been able to get rid of

42:39.420 --> 42:53.559
it yet. Do You have a suggestion how I could
get rid of it?

42:53.559 --> 43:07.319
Shri Mataji: I think you should put – I
think I will tell you what is to be done.

43:07.319 --> 43:13.759
It will work out. You should, somebody has
got rid of it and I think we can work it out.

43:13.759 --> 43:17.630
All right? May God bless you.
Q3 (Lady): Shri Mataji, through meditation

43:17.630 --> 43:27.779
and through using the fire we try to be in
thoughtless awareness and we try to control

43:27.779 --> 43:42.519
our thinking. But many times, what happens
to me is though I meditate, thoughts come

43:42.519 --> 44:30.710
into my head. They just come all of a sudden
and know they are not part of me. Is there

44:30.710 --> 44:45.829
a method to control these thoughts so we can
meditate?

44:45.829 --> 45:11.089
Shri Mataji: See, you must raise your Kundalini.
Try to raise it. Put your attention to your

45:11.089 --> 45:42.869
Sahasrara. Say, “Mother come in my head.”
As soon as Kundalini crosses the Agnya you

45:42.869 --> 46:11.089
cannot have those thoughts. You should allow
this simple method also, that if you see any

46:11.089 --> 46:32.630
thought coming in, you should say, “I forgive”.
I forgive is a very big mantra. Say that,

46:32.630 --> 46:33.420
thought will stop.
Q4 (Gentleman): Shri Mataji, what does it

46:33.420 --> 46:41.160
mean when a house is struck by lightening?
Shri Mataji: House is struck by lightening,

46:41.160 --> 46:46.440
whose house?
Gentleman: It’s my wife’s and my house

46:46.440 --> 46:50.359
and we are renting it to another person.
Shri Mataji: The person may not be all right.

46:50.359 --> 46:58.460
He might be misusing your house. Must be something
wrong with him. Lightening is one thing understands

46:58.460 --> 47:06.150
everything. Better get rid of that fellow.
Q5 (Lady): Shri Mataji, this week we were

47:06.150 --> 47:10.960
talking about a similar experience that many
of us have when we listen to Your lectures,

47:10.960 --> 48:14.460
mostly when we listen to the tapes or watch
the videos. And if it happens to be those

48:14.460 --> 48:21.109
times when we are fortunate enough not to
be to the left or to the right, but to be

48:21.109 --> 48:25.940
as centered as we can be, and we are listening
attentively to everything You say, why is

48:25.940 --> 48:27.239
it that sometimes, right afterwards, someone
would ask something about the tape and often

48:27.239 --> 48:30.859
we can’t remember consciously a word of
what we heard? It wasn’t that we were off

48:30.859 --> 48:38.039
thinking or that we were sick, we were listening
attentively, but then afterwards it’s not

48:38.039 --> 48:43.259
a conscious thing that we can recall or speak
about. We were talking about that this week.

48:43.259 --> 48:47.480
Shri Mataji: What happens? What happens?
Lady: That after listening to one of Your

48:47.480 --> 48:55.999
tapes sometimes we can’t remember what You
have said, even if it’s not one of those

48:55.999 --> 49:03.160
times when we are to the left or to the right.
We seem to be relatively…

49:03.160 --> 49:08.359
Shri Mataji: It has an effect, all right.
It has an effect. But after that I think you

49:08.359 --> 49:12.059
all should go into meditation for a while.
After listening to My lecture you just go

49:12.059 --> 49:16.329
into My meditation. Actually, My lectures
are not to be understood by your brains but

49:16.329 --> 49:21.609
through your Kundalini, and through your heart.
So it doesn’t matter if you don’t remember

49:21.609 --> 49:26.890
something. It’s all right. It’s so many
lectures I have given. How can you remember?

49:26.890 --> 49:34.549
I also don’t remember much of it. But it
will come handy whenever you want to use some

49:34.549 --> 49:40.489
words or sentence it will come handy. You’ll
not know from where it is coming. It’s all

49:40.489 --> 49:43.720
recorded. Is all recorded.
Shri Mataji: What about children? No problems?

49:43.720 --> 49:45.789
What’s the question?
Gentleman: May I ask one question?

49:45.789 --> 49:57.829
Shri Mataji: Please, please.
Q6 (Gentleman): You
said we always – it is about anger. I think

49:57.829 --> 50:03.700
if someone misbehave with You, I get very
angry. Is it right or is it wrong?

50:03.700 --> 50:07.880
Shri Mataji: It’s right. That’s the only
time you should really be angry. Angry is

50:07.880 --> 50:12.499
spontaneous, but you need not do anything.
I can look after Myself. But reaction is correct.

50:12.499 --> 50:17.160
The reaction is correct.
Q7 (Lady): Shri Mataji, if the children, when

50:17.160 --> 50:22.480
you ask them say to meditate and they go,
“No, I don’t want to do it.” or “ Do

50:22.480 --> 50:26.450
I have to foot soak?” I don’t know how
to – I don’t want to be, “Oh, you have

50:26.450 --> 50:33.869
to do it”, because then it wouldn’t be.
So what’s the best way to approach them?

50:33.869 --> 50:39.859
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s all right. Leave them
alone. They are all right. No problem. They

50:39.859 --> 50:49.170
don’t need it so much. Some of them are
really born realized, and they’ll take to

50:49.170 --> 50:51.839
it later on if they gather anything funny.
Q8 (Lady): Does that mean that we still make

50:51.839 --> 50:58.720
them do it? I know they’ll take to it later
but we should have them [INAUDIBLE]. It’s

50:58.720 --> 51:29.489
a joy for us. But should we.. They have to
do it, is that the way it should be?

51:29.489 --> 51:30.829
Shri Mataji: Children? No, no, no. Don’t
be harsh, don’t be harsh with them. See,

51:30.829 --> 51:38.999
children should not be made to do something
like that. They themselves will start doing

51:38.999 --> 51:47.680
it after sometime when they see you doing
it and all that. But don’t spoil them. That’s

51:47.680 --> 51:56.789
the point is. You see, we must know the discretion
about it. Sometimes we spoil our children

51:56.789 --> 52:02.249
very much. Encourage them to be generous.
Encourage them to be sharing. Encourage them

52:02.249 --> 52:08.769
to be compassionate. Encourage them to be
kind to others. But if they are rude or they

52:08.769 --> 52:13.460
are harsh or you find they are quarrelling,
then you can slap them. It’s all right.

52:13.460 --> 52:29.069
Yes you have to. For five years you have to
do that. In case, I mean it’s not a religious

52:29.069 --> 52:35.910
duty but..
Q9 (Gentleman): Mother, You have spoken about

52:35.910 --> 52:41.140
the importance of us establishing ourselves
in society with careers and professional jobs.

52:41.140 --> 52:55.839
How do we know how far to go in our professions,
in our careers, and how important they are

52:55.839 --> 53:36.779
and when we have to say enough of that and
live our lives as Sahaja Yogis, because I

53:36.779 --> 53:47.650
feel that sometimes the things we have to
do as Sahaja Yogis come into conflict with

53:47.650 --> 53:55.099
our professional [UNCLEAR WORD].
Shri Mataji: No. It cannot be you see. Now

53:55.099 --> 54:04.190
take your profession of any kind that you
have. You have to do it in a Sahaja manner

54:04.190 --> 54:17.450
that you don’t too much deliberately plan
it and think about it. It will come your way.

54:17.450 --> 54:31.849
If you believe that the whole cosmos is trying
to help you, the whole cosmos will bring forth

54:31.849 --> 54:42.660
everything before you. And it will work out.
You don’t have to do much effort, to think

54:42.660 --> 55:18.150
about it, what should I choose, whether I
should take this or whether I should take

55:18.150 --> 55:25.059
that. Only thing what you have to do is just
to see for yourself that you are watching

55:25.059 --> 55:31.140
and seeing an opportunity coming to you. And
allow the opportunity to appear before you.

55:31.140 --> 55:35.769
It does. Don’t have to deliberately bother
your head, what to take, what to do. That

55:35.769 --> 55:44.970
you need not do. It will just be there. You’ll
be amazed how it works. I will give you an

55:44.970 --> 55:52.759
example. Recently, there’s one Mr. Hari
Jayaram. He is a mediocre, I would say, he

55:52.759 --> 56:01.109
is not very great scientist or anything. But
he did Physics, M.Sc. or something. And he

56:01.109 --> 56:09.670
was not doing very well. As such he was just
mediocre. Suddenly, he discovered a switch

56:09.670 --> 56:19.369
by which he could change the waves of the
microwave thing or something. And he didn’t

56:19.369 --> 56:27.880
know how he discovered it. He was quite amazed.
And they gave him a promotion, everything.

56:27.880 --> 56:31.509
And then they said that you have to come and
give a lecture about it. And he didn’t know

56:31.509 --> 56:40.130
how he did it. So he telephoned to Me, “Mother,
please tell me how You did it.” I said,

56:40.130 --> 56:49.710
“You just close your eyes, think of Me and
give a lecture.” And he was amazed how he

56:49.710 --> 56:53.249
could explain everything.
tm’s a question of how far you are surrendered.

56:53.249 --> 57:00.390
How far you are one with the Divine. It all
works out. Don’t have to do deliberations

57:00.390 --> 57:06.089
much. Don’t have to worry too much about
things. It will all come your way, because

57:06.089 --> 57:12.140
you have now entered into the kingdom of God.
Right? Everything is looked after. Can’t

57:12.140 --> 57:19.739
imagine how small, small things it works out.
How in details it works out. It’s very surprising.

57:19.739 --> 57:28.430
Not for Me, for everyone. For everyone, and
they tell Me, “Mother, I don’t know how

57:28.430 --> 57:34.759
it has worked out.” So when you are dissolved
in that ocean, it is that ocean which takes

57:34.759 --> 57:41.180
you up and down, and enjoy, that’s all.
So you should leave it to that ocean to decide

57:41.180 --> 57:44.739
for you.
Q10 (Lady): Shri Mataji, it seems that in

57:44.739 --> 57:49.499
Boston especially, or on the East Coast where
people are very close hearted, not very warm.

57:49.499 --> 57:55.119
And it seems to be the major block for talking
to people about Sahaja Yoga. Why is this?

57:55.119 --> 58:00.140
And what can we do about this?
Shri Mataji: I don’t know. Actually, East

58:00.140 --> 58:05.950
should be better than the West, normally.
But everything is upside down in America.

58:05.950 --> 58:12.559
Because Eastern people, you see, are always
bombarded by say Japanese, by other people

58:12.559 --> 58:19.180
who are industrialists, this that, and put
money before everything else. And they live

58:19.180 --> 58:22.650
in a way that there’s big competition for
everything and people have to fight.

58:22.650 --> 58:28.759
I was happy that you got this place little
far away from the maddening crowd. In New

58:28.759 --> 58:38.130
York you really feel you’ll go mad if you
stay there. It’s such a funny place. You

58:38.130 --> 58:45.779
are on the boulevard or you are in the office
running about, you don’t know where you

58:45.779 --> 58:52.210
are. So the impact of all these frictions
and competitions and these ideas pouring from

58:52.210 --> 58:57.579
outside, all this works out. And that makes
us feel rather funny.

58:57.579 --> 59:02.650
But the heart can be opened out by Sahaja
Yoga, by one thing, by saying, “Mother,

59:02.650 --> 59:09.799
come in my heart.” Just say twelve times,
it works. And for the brain you can say seven

59:09.799 --> 59:18.299
times, it works. I am available to you. That’s
very important for you people on this coast

59:18.299 --> 59:23.039
to say and to open your hearts.
Q11 (Lady): [INAUDIBLE] when we get too right

59:23.039 --> 59:25.479
sided ..[INAUDIBLE]
Shri Mataji: In the spiritual seeking? In

59:25.479 --> 59:29.809
the spiritual seeking there is, a speed is
not felt at all you see, in that you just

59:29.809 --> 59:38.079
feel the state. Your state you feel. You don’t
feel the speed. You don’t feel that you

59:38.079 --> 59:46.829
must do, like, I have seen some people, even
when I am giving lecture they are doing like

59:46.829 --> 59:52.829
this or they are doing like that. This madness
is not necessary. Just be quiet. Quietitude

59:52.829 --> 01:00:00.019
is the best way to ascend.
I have said that there should be thoughtless

01:00:00.019 --> 01:00:08.519
awareness. Just do it quietly. Your speed
will reduce actually; will come to a position

01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:17.089
when it is maximum for your quietitude. Quietness
within, peace within, that’s very important.

01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:25.460
If there is peace you will grow. There’s
no other way out. But you see, all this ritualism,

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:31.489
sometimes giving bandhan all the time or raising
Kundalini all the time and people even would

01:00:31.489 --> 01:00:39.809
like to see the table if it has vibrations,
you see. That’s going too far. There’s

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:41.460
no need to do all that nonsense. Sahaja Yoga
is sense, it’s not nonsense.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.559
Q12 (Gentleman): Mother, may I ask an intellectual
question?

01:00:43.559 --> 01:00:47.660
Shri Mataji: All right.
Gentleman: Is there any difference between

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:53.460
when one is witnessing in meditation and paying
attention or using the attention?

01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:58.880
Shri Mataji: Oh, witnessing is very different
from paying attention. Paying attention is

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.460
a deliberate thing. We deliberately pay attention
you see to something.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:08.349
As I am talking, you may not be realized,
you may be realized, you can pay attention

01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:25.119
to Me. But witnessing is a state. Say, I’ve
seen it Myself what happens. If there’s

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:43.349
a problem or there’s some calamity, something,
suddenly I find, I am witnessing the whole

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:50.099
thing like a drama. It’s a state. But you
can develop it if you remember, I mean, at

01:01:50.099 --> 01:01:56.579
that time people don’t remember also. Supposing
you see some calamity coming to you. Just

01:01:56.579 --> 01:02:02.029
try to witness the calamity.
I’ll tell you some examples of this. Once,

01:02:02.029 --> 01:02:08.309
went for a newspaper meeting, newspaper people
meeting Me, some sort of a press meeting,

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:15.549
Marathi people and out of them there was one
fellow called Mr. Kelkar. And he said, “Mother,

01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:25.180
I know all about You.” I said, “How?”
He said, “I have a friend called Mr. Marathe,

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:33.119
and both of us were coming down the ghats
– you know what are the ghats are, when

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:41.430
you go on the hillside – and our brake failed,
and the car started sliding down. And suddenly

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:56.109
we saw a very big truck coming all the way
and we didn’t know what to do because we

01:02:56.109 --> 01:05:23.420
could not stop the car on one side. And we
just thought, now we are going to be finished

01:05:23.420 --> 01:08:15.200
with this. And suddenly he told me that, ‘Kelkar,
you close your eyes and just say Shri Mataji.’

01:08:15.200 --> 01:09:05.910
That’s all. And suddenly we found that we
had crossed that and we were on the other

01:09:05.910 --> 01:10:10.440
side while the truck was going that side.
After all, it’s God. It’s God, you know,

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:57.320
and what is God?
I have told you the story about My father’s

01:10:57.320 --> 01:12:00.530
aunt. She told Me once a story, very nice
story about God. She said that there was one

01:12:00.530 --> 01:13:07.010
gentleman who was going to see God. I mean,
it’s a grandmother’s story, so you can

01:13:07.010 --> 01:14:55.420
understand. And he was going, on his way he
met a gentleman who was doing lots of tapasya,

01:14:55.420 --> 01:16:56.900
standing on one leg, one foot, one head, like
that. He was going on and on. So he said,

01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:48.240
“You are going to see God?” “Yes.”
“Will you tell God that I want to take Your

01:17:48.240 --> 01:18:24.110
darshan, when will You come? I am working
very hard, I am doing all these things. I

01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:54.230
have done all the rituals, everything, when
will I see You?” He said, “All right.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:19:23.040
I’ll tell Him.”
So then he met a gentleman who was lying down

01:19:23.040 --> 01:20:14.930
near the tree on the way and he said, “Oh.
Come along, come along. You are going to see

01:20:14.930 --> 01:21:45.900
God?” “Yes.” “Please tell Him, He
has not sent my food so far, I am waiting

01:21:45.900 --> 01:27:19.960
for Him.” He was quite amazed – look at
this lazy lump sitting there and ordering

01:27:19.960 --> 01:29:43.290
God.
So he went to God and saw Him. And then all

01:29:43.290 --> 01:31:49.810
his work was done, whatever it was.
And while coming, he said that “Sir I have

01:31:49.810 --> 01:32:11.650
a problem. There are two people. One is working
very hard and he is doing fasting and doing

01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:54.000
all kinds of things and he wants to know when
will You meet him.” He said, “Tell him

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:35.040
still to work little more. Still he needs
working.” And then he said that, “I met

01:33:35.040 --> 01:34:18.010
another one, a lazy lump, he just said he
has not yet received the food, and what about

01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:54.010
the food?” He said, “No. He hasn’t received?
Oh God!” He called people, come along, this

01:34:54.010 --> 01:35:21.310
that. “You must arrange, immediately. How
is it

01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:59.920
he has not received the food?”
He was quite amazed, this fellow. God said,

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:27.500
“Now you see why I was worried. You will
not understand. But you do one thing. When

01:36:27.500 --> 01:38:30.470
you go down you tell them one story. Tell
them that when you went to God, you saw that

01:38:30.470 --> 01:39:06.900
He passed one camel through the nose of a
needle. And see, you will get your answer.”

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:46.380
He went down. First he met this man who was
doing all these exercises and this and that.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:40:26.010
He said, “What did God say to you?” “He
said yes, you have to do some more and still

01:40:26.010 --> 01:41:25.380
work hard. Still not all right.” So he said,
“But what did you see, you had been there?”

01:41:25.380 --> 01:42:19.280
He said, “I saw a very great miracle that
God passed a camel through the
eye of a needle.” “Passed through the

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:45.720
eye of a needle? How can it be? It’s impossible.
What was the needle size?” “Just normal

01:42:45.720 --> 01:43:13.670
size.” He said, “How can that be? What
was the size of the camel?” “Just normal

01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:40.630
size.” “How did it pass?” “He did.”
So he went to another man, and he said, “Oh,

01:43:40.630 --> 01:44:11.690
I have got the food. I just wanted to test
you. It’s all right. I know God will look

01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:56.590
after me.” So he said, “What did you see?”
He said, “I saw a miracle that a camel was

01:44:56.590 --> 01:45:23.240
passed through the eye of a needle.” He
said, “What is there a miracle? It’s God.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:46:57.900
You know He is God. He is God almighty. What
is there for one camel? He can pass universes

01:46:57.900 --> 01:48:04.310
after universes. He is God after all.”
That’s what He is, God. And He is God almighty.

01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:37.260
Anything is possible.
Not only Me, but I’ll say, there’s one

01:48:37.260 --> 01:49:57.140
Sahaja Yogi. He is a fisherman by birth but
he is also working. He’s a graduate, so

01:49:57.140 --> 01:51:21.550
he is working in a bank. He’s a wonderful
man. And one day he decided to go across to

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:43.790
another island to talk about Me and talk about
Sahaja Yoga. And he came out of his house

01:51:43.790 --> 01:52:07.410
and he found that it was all very much about
to burst out into a storm. He stood up there,

01:52:07.410 --> 01:52:26.750
he said, “See now. I am going for my Mother’s
work, for your Mother’s work also, and please

01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:43.970
behave yourself. Till I come back you dare
not do anything.” You see, he addressed

01:52:43.970 --> 01:53:16.140
to them. He took his boat, went to another
island, he preached there, he gave them Realization,

01:53:16.140 --> 01:53:49.990
came back home, and when he was about to sleep
it started rumbling. He said, “Now it’s

01:53:49.990 --> 01:54:14.770
all right. Go ahead.”
We have people of that kind, of that level,

01:54:14.770 --> 01:54:39.870
of that variety. You can control everything
because after all you have entered into the

01:54:39.870 --> 01:55:15.990
kingdom of God. Anything is possible. It is
God. He is almighty. He can do anything. Even

01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:44.710
to feel that, you rise high. That settles
it.

01:55:44.710 --> 01:56:01.770
May God bless you.
