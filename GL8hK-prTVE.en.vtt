WEBVTT

01:36.165 --> 01:39.361
Today is the great day,

01:39.562 --> 01:44.892
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

01:45.408 --> 01:48.894
at least it is celebrated today.

01:50.823 --> 01:53.787
And you are all assembled here

01:53.988 --> 02:01.822
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

02:05.671 --> 02:11.568
You already know how He came on this earth,

02:11.769 --> 02:15.973
and what was His great work.

02:16.174 --> 02:20.966
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

02:21.167 --> 02:24.552
What was His power?

02:25.871 --> 02:30.743
Christâ€™s power was, of course, Omkara.

02:30.944 --> 02:35.674
His power was Pranava.

02:37.155 --> 02:41.074
But the essence of Christ

02:42.366 --> 02:51.154
was tapasya, tapasvita.

02:53.670 --> 02:58.110
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

02:59.892 --> 03:10.266
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.913
He's sinless.

03:22.114 --> 03:26.530
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

03:27.372 --> 03:34.750
But apparently things that look like sins

03:34.959 --> 03:38.745
are also not in His life story.

03:38.946 --> 03:44.687
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

03:44.888 --> 03:47.673
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

03:47.874 --> 03:50.297
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

03:50.498 --> 03:54.952
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

03:55.153 --> 04:01.734
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

04:01.935 --> 04:04.993
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

04:05.205 --> 04:09.665
even a slightest mistake.

04:09.866 --> 04:16.440
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

04:16.644 --> 04:26.937
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

04:29.871 --> 04:34.515
But it's very surprising that Christianity

04:34.716 --> 04:39.484
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

04:39.685 --> 04:42.456
They painted Him so differently,

04:42.660 --> 04:48.594
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

04:48.795 --> 04:51.568
Terrible mess I must say,

04:51.769 --> 04:59.358
because He was the person who tried to keep

04:59.559 --> 05:05.180
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

05:05.381 --> 05:14.274
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

05:14.504 --> 05:21.862
that their sinful life is shocking,

05:22.063 --> 05:28.104
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

05:28.305 --> 05:33.625
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

05:33.826 --> 05:38.418
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

05:38.877 --> 05:43.236
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

05:43.446 --> 05:46.994
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

05:47.195 --> 05:55.596
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

05:55.797 --> 06:02.385
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

06:02.586 --> 06:07.601
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

06:07.802 --> 06:12.949
Those who go to them, they develop it.

06:13.150 --> 06:19.915
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

06:20.116 --> 06:24.180
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

06:24.381 --> 06:32.023
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

06:32.224 --> 06:37.562
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

06:37.763 --> 06:42.315
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

06:42.516 --> 06:46.936
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

06:47.137 --> 06:52.695
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

06:52.896 --> 06:59.624
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

06:59.825 --> 07:03.477
and nobody should explain it.

07:03.678 --> 07:08.116
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

07:08.317 --> 07:14.646
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

07:15.441 --> 07:21.415
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

07:21.616 --> 07:28.464
The abandonment of your character,

07:28.665 --> 07:35.397
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

07:35.598 --> 07:43.589
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

07:43.790 --> 07:51.234
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

07:51.435 --> 07:56.023
to burn away all that is sinful.

07:56.345 --> 08:01.086
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

08:01.287 --> 08:07.364
has to be a sinless life,

08:07.565 --> 08:11.409
and that is what one has to realize

08:11.625 --> 08:17.729
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

08:18.692 --> 08:25.725
On this day of His birth, one has to say

08:25.926 --> 08:34.125
that a great life, a great personality,

08:34.326 --> 08:39.602
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

08:40.159 --> 08:45.559
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

08:45.760 --> 08:50.604
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

08:55.019 --> 09:02.276
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

09:02.477 --> 09:09.687
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

09:09.888 --> 09:17.028
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

09:17.229 --> 09:20.942
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

09:21.143 --> 09:25.100
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

09:25.301 --> 09:29.156
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

09:29.357 --> 09:36.043
so repulsive, absolutely below

09:36.244 --> 09:40.010
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

09:40.211 --> 09:45.924
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

09:48.034 --> 09:52.307
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

09:52.508 --> 09:58.717
to stand up and make your life pure,

09:59.766 --> 10:04.252
make yourself pure, and hate all

10:04.453 --> 10:08.299
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.197
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

10:11.397 --> 10:16.701
the book written by Thomas who has
described

10:16.902 --> 10:19.819
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

10:20.020 --> 10:24.571
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

10:24.772 --> 10:28.265
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

10:28.466 --> 10:35.702
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

10:35.903 --> 10:43.145
says about a personal experience
of achieving

10:44.123 --> 10:47.364
God realization, Self-realization.

10:47.565 --> 10:50.932
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

10:51.133 --> 10:56.962
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

10:57.163 --> 11:05.024
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

11:06.122 --> 11:09.450
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

11:09.651 --> 11:12.730
otherwise in any other place

11:12.931 --> 11:17.981
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

11:18.215 --> 11:22.285
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

11:22.486 --> 11:27.484
It's important, and very important for all
of us

11:29.054 --> 11:33.052
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

11:33.252 --> 11:36.166
is to purify our attention.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.824
And for that Tukarama has said,

11:39.025 --> 11:46.751
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

11:55.223 --> 11:58.114
He was born in a very humble place

11:58.315 --> 12:02.049
because He was a tapasvi.

12:02.250 --> 12:06.297
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

12:06.498 --> 12:13.637
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

12:15.205 --> 12:19.505
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

12:19.706 --> 12:30.425
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

12:34.598 --> 12:43.374
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

12:44.105 --> 12:46.961
the humble abodes are despised.

12:47.162 --> 12:56.104
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

12:56.305 --> 13:01.576
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

13:01.777 --> 13:06.472
to reflect the great image of Christ.

13:06.673 --> 13:11.310
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

13:11.511 --> 13:19.795
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

13:19.996 --> 13:22.955
Can't think of anybody better,

13:23.156 --> 13:30.742
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

13:31.085 --> 13:35.789
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

13:35.990 --> 13:43.161
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

13:44.736 --> 13:48.992
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

13:49.193 --> 13:51.292
So today we have to pray for them,

13:51.493 --> 13:55.039
that may God give them some sense,

13:55.245 --> 13:57.396
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

13:57.597 --> 13:59.968
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

14:00.169 --> 14:06.143
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

14:09.262 --> 14:13.010
So coming to His Mother,

14:14.233 --> 14:18.143
She was the power behind it.

14:18.344 --> 14:22.534
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

14:22.735 --> 14:27.398
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

14:27.599 --> 14:31.560
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

14:31.761 --> 14:39.291
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

14:39.650 --> 14:44.175
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

14:44.376 --> 14:49.816
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

14:50.017 --> 14:56.345
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

14:56.546 --> 14:58.710
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

14:58.911 --> 15:01.949
On the contrary, what we find,

15:02.150 --> 15:09.224
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

15:09.425 --> 15:12.309
You should see how it shows so clearly.

15:12.510 --> 15:16.954
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

15:17.155 --> 15:20.094
It must have a guarantee.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.657
Even if they want to have anything

15:24.858 --> 15:31.059
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

15:32.363 --> 15:35.643
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

15:35.844 --> 15:40.393
and what can they buy to sell it.

15:40.632 --> 15:45.649
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

15:45.850 --> 15:55.395
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

15:55.596 --> 16:00.378
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

16:00.579 --> 16:02.497
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

16:02.698 --> 16:06.249
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

16:06.450 --> 16:08.733
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

16:08.934 --> 16:10.637
I said, "What has happened?"

16:10.838 --> 16:14.419
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

16:14.620 --> 16:18.362
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

16:18.563 --> 16:22.729
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

16:22.930 --> 16:26.128
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

16:26.329 --> 16:29.572
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

16:29.779 --> 16:33.498
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

16:33.699 --> 16:37.040
All right, it might be real. So what?

16:37.242 --> 16:41.990
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

16:42.872 --> 16:47.194
It's very surprising. But in this country

16:47.404 --> 16:52.469
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.680
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

16:55.881 --> 17:00.365
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

17:01.686 --> 17:05.173
Not much respect for people who have money.

17:05.382 --> 17:07.911
Of course, you are expected to dress up

17:08.121 --> 17:11.823
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

17:12.024 --> 17:14.135
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

17:14.336 --> 17:18.654
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

17:20.278 --> 17:24.628
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

17:24.829 --> 17:27.994
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

17:28.195 --> 17:33.869
people just get absolutely blown off

17:34.070 --> 17:38.294
if they see something extraordinary.

17:38.495 --> 17:45.285
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

17:45.489 --> 17:49.563
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

17:49.764 --> 17:53.015
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

17:53.216 --> 18:00.417
the plate to see from where it comes,

18:00.651 --> 18:05.213
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

18:05.414 --> 18:07.406
It's very surprising.

18:07.607 --> 18:12.808
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.558
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

18:15.759 --> 18:20.586
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

18:21.745 --> 18:27.044
This kind of mental attitude towards life

18:27.245 --> 18:32.389
and the mental projections towards life

18:32.590 --> 18:36.578
makes you absolutely gross,

18:36.779 --> 18:41.060
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

18:41.261 --> 18:46.129
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

18:46.330 --> 18:53.311
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

18:54.273 --> 19:01.112
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

19:01.395 --> 19:04.064
He walked on the water.

19:04.265 --> 19:06.374
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

19:06.575 --> 19:09.844
There was no gross principle in Him,

19:10.045 --> 19:19.667
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

19:19.919 --> 19:23.800
I have to now request you all today

19:24.001 --> 19:28.131
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

19:28.332 --> 19:34.370
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

19:34.571 --> 19:39.138
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

19:39.339 --> 19:42.689
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.376
They have to understand

19:45.577 --> 19:51.181
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

19:51.393 --> 19:56.253
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

19:56.454 --> 20:02.012
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

20:02.213 --> 20:05.921
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

20:06.122 --> 20:12.236
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

20:12.437 --> 20:25.651
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

20:25.852 --> 20:29.610
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.328
It's going to be a new culture for us.

20:33.529 --> 20:35.548
We have started the dharma, all right.

20:35.749 --> 20:38.154
But every dharma has to have a culture

20:38.366 --> 20:47.505
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

20:47.706 --> 20:51.278
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

20:51.479 --> 20:55.276
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

20:55.477 --> 21:02.203
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

21:02.404 --> 21:12.809
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

21:13.010 --> 21:16.368
So for us the ideal is Christ.

21:16.569 --> 21:20.348
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

21:20.549 --> 21:25.781
But always willing to sacrifice,

21:25.982 --> 21:32.937
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

21:33.138 --> 21:39.470
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

21:39.671 --> 21:44.897
not discussing other and judging others,

21:45.098 --> 21:50.250
but giving assurances to people,

21:50.451 --> 21:58.210
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

21:58.411 --> 22:02.553
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

22:02.754 --> 22:07.065
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

22:07.266 --> 22:12.285
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

22:12.486 --> 22:22.111
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

22:22.722 --> 22:28.174
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

22:28.375 --> 22:35.226
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

22:35.427 --> 22:40.545
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

22:40.746 --> 22:44.872
But look at Him and look at yourself,

22:45.073 --> 22:49.096
born the same way as He was born.

22:49.297 --> 22:56.176
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

22:56.377 --> 23:02.444
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

23:02.645 --> 23:06.114
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

23:06.315 --> 23:08.673
and that is very important.

23:09.038 --> 23:12.150
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

23:12.351 --> 23:15.394
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

23:15.595 --> 23:22.933
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

23:23.134 --> 23:28.112
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.
