00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:14.703
So, I have to thank these two great musicians who are here.

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:21.754
You, of course, know them very well, 
and they have been coming here before also.

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:26.438
This time it was just the last minute, working out,

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:34.182
we were not very sure if they’ll be here or not, 
and it all worked out in a Sahaj way.

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:39.834
And we have to really thank them very much, because today

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:44.628
we are celebrating Shri Krishna’s puja

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:53.321
and he used to play this bansuri what you can call the flute.

00:00:53.442 --> 00:01:02.126
This was, his style was such that,

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:08.188
what we saw about the Colombian’s
thought and the philosophy,

00:01:08.308 --> 00:01:12.607
is to balance, to balance everything.

00:01:12.727 --> 00:01:19.212
The way He stands, you see, He puts the bansuri on this 
side, [on the right] but his right foot is on this side

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:29.848
so just to balance the music. And with this music, 
He used to balance the whole cosmic forces.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:39.764
Of course, description about
his flute was that when He played

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:46.863
means they became just like, we can say, pictures ;

00:01:46.983 --> 00:01:55.681
even the cows, they would not move, even
the birds, they would not sing- every thing.

00:01:55.801 --> 00:02:01.916
And the people also just enthralled completely by his
magic.

00:02:02.037 --> 00:02:07.589
And they would be just like pictures sitting
stand. And that’s what I found today also.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.660
I must say the music was so beautiful.

00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:21.727
And may Shri Krishna bless you both, so that the
rhythm of Shri Krishna and his ‘murli’ [flute in Hindi].

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.827
It’s a great occasion for us, because according
to Sahaja Yoga, America is the Vishuddhi chakra

00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:36.627
where resides Shri Krishna, whom
we call Akbar in Urdu language.

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:44.759
Now his style is so special that
He communicates with everyone.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.837
In the same way, you see, music, our
Indian music can communicate with everyone.

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:56.700
It has that capacity, because it is a spiritual music,

00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:08.607
and that can really enthrall people the way it
was happening tonight. I was so very overjoyed.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.511
The other day we had an experience
in Germany. We had a musician

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:19.239
and also everybody was rather
apologetic about him. I said : “let’s see”.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.870
And when he started playing I tell you, he was
supposed to be Ravi Shankar’s disciple, at a time.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.595
But, I mean, I forgot Ravi Shankar, everyone, the
way he started playing, just, what music coming out!

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:41.705
He’s a young fellow, wonderful! And then he just, after finishing, he said ; “it is an experience to play for Shri Mataji”

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:50.121
I said : “It’s an experience for us also! “ It was
so sweet and so beautifully, delicately rendered,

00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:55.371
the whole thing was so beautifully
done, as we saw today also.

00:03:55.492 --> 00:04:01.392
So I hope some artists will come
out Sahaja Yogis who are here

00:04:01.512 --> 00:04:07.437
and will work out lots of things of art.

00:04:07.557 --> 00:04:15.164
We have seen also the art in other ways, paintings
and we saw the drama and the film and everything,

00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:20.932
shows a lot of art is developing now in Sahaja Yoga;

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:26.887
But I must tell you also I’ve seen
some very beautiful poems being written.

00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:31.790
Apart from that there are people who
are writing very well about Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:42.260
There’s one gentleman in Romania, who
has written such a tremendously deep book.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:49.658
He has consulted, I think, all the religious books
because there’s Koran, there’s Bible, everything,

00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:54.486
he brought it to Sahaja Yoga. So, it’s all coming up now.

00:04:54.607 --> 00:05:02.517
We have to just understand that we have
to pay attention to ourselves, and meditate,

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:13.763
and I’m sure all the creativity will definitely manifest,
and will go on, showing better and better results.

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:16.868
It is absolutely evident now.

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:20.634
But it is for Sahaja Yogis now
to take it up, in a serious way.

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:28.975
Whatever is your talent, may be music, may be
art, may be film making, or may be writing also.

00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:34.677
Whatever comes up, you should really now
devote some time to that talent that you have.

00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:38.416
And it is going to work out, I’m sure, very well.
