00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:11.457
There’s one God, God Almighty,

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:20.041
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:27.351
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:35.541
So, first of all, He did was to create

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:39.311
the power of Adi Shakti.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:45.851
When It was created then there was a sound,

00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:49.911
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:52.331
by the primordial sound,

00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.591
and these three powers came out of that sound -

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:02.311
is A, U and M -Aum.

00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:07.131
The Adi Shakti is the One

00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:12.934
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:24.626
This power of His love spreads around Him, accumulates and forms another entity called as the Holy Ghost

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:30.981
or you can say the Parashakti or you can call it also as the Primordial Mother.

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:42.907
She is the Holy Ghost. Now, when the break takes place there is a sound and this sound is the logos as you call it,

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:48.802
the Spirit that is that sound which is the divine integrated sound, not one sound,

00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:56.906
and that one is called as the Omkara which is the child, the child of this couple

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:03.084
Like that there were many incidents in My life

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:08.196
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:11.857
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:14.530
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

00:02:14.802 --> 00:02:19.097
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:22.610
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:28.435
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:30.937
that means the one which has no spots on it.

00:02:31.138 --> 00:02:33.234
But that’s the name of man.

00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:37.764
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala meaning the same, Immaculata.”

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.900
My name Myself is Nirmala. Means that. Is the same.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.775
Means Nishkalanka. Actually, when I was born,

00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:54.921
I didn't have a spot on My body. No blood, nothing. Without the navel cord or anything.

00:02:55.001 --> 00:03:01.546
So My grandmother, My father’s aunty, she called Me Nishkalanka. She said, is the Nishkalanka is born.

00:03:04.357 --> 00:03:09.680
That’s also my name, Leela is, one of my names.

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.193
Actually my baptised name is that:

00:03:14.286 --> 00:03:20.570
Leela, Lalita, Nirmala, Daisy, four names. By Lutheran church, by Lutheran church.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.919
But when you get to your Sahasrara, joy is called Nirananda.

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.973
Now Nira is my name, you know that. Ananda means joy.

00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:37.967
Nira means: where there is nothing else but joy.

00:03:38.047 --> 00:03:40.973
There is complete joy, no reaction, nothing.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.872
Just submerged in joy.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.415
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:56.164
then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda, Nirananda.

00:03:56.245 --> 00:04:03.093
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda. Nirananda.

00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:12.389
Also, is surprising, my name is Nira – also, in my family I’m called as Nira.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.776
And Nira also means Mary, Maria.

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:22.971
Because it means marine. Nira is water. Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.481
It is called as Nirananda in the brain.

00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:36.365
I’m illusive, is true. My name is Mahamaya. I am illusive, no doubt.

00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:44.662
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:55.491
Now the dedication is a very important part of the ascent.

00:04:55.572 --> 00:04:57.471
Why?

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:13.631
Because when you are precariously placed, when there is immediate danger to your existence;

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:22.635
at this time, when the whole world is standing at a precarious position

00:05:22.715 --> 00:05:28.234
where it is going to be destroyed completely,

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:35.328
it’s very important that you cling on to thing that is going to save you

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:40.695
with complete might and complete faith.

00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:47.455
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary water, doesn’t matter.

00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.628
But if you are sinking in the sea,

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:56.656
and there’s a question of this moment of existence and that moment of destruction,

00:05:56.736 --> 00:06:03.425
that time, if a hand comes forward to fetch you out,

00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:06.426
there’s no time for you to think anymore

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:14.555
but cling on to it, with all your might, with all your faith.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:18.524
Cling on to it.

00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:25.639
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.732
Cling on to it.

00:06:27.813 --> 00:06:32.123
Even the death has to go back.

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:36.908
Then what about these minor things?

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:54.553
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

00:06:57.672 --> 00:07:07.571
You know that is the most powerful Name than all other names, the most powerful mantra.

00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.281
But you must know how to take it.

00:07:11.976 --> 00:07:17.633
With that complete dedication you have to take that Name.

00:07:17.713 --> 00:07:21.043
Not like any other name.

00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:26.784
You know that in India when take the name of Guru, they pull their ears

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.171
for taking the name of the Guru.

00:07:29.251 --> 00:07:36.377
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making any mistakes, please forgive me” - means that.

00:07:37.877 --> 00:07:44.937
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:53.323
Only what you need is the dedication, the dynamite of dedication.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:04.910
Don't think about what is happening, how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.975
What you have to know what you are.

00:08:08.156 --> 00:08:15.971
You have to be aware of yourself and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.774
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

00:08:20.848 --> 00:08:26.665
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:32.671
Purity is the basis of your existence.

00:08:36.543 --> 00:08:41.312
On the day of Shakti if you dance you will get that power within yourself.

00:08:41.393 --> 00:08:45.481
And that's why you are looking much better now.

00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:51.874
In My name if you dance you get the power, no doubt about it.

00:08:51.955 --> 00:08:57.414
And that's why here you have to achieve your Spiritual power,

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:03.332
your Spiritual peace and your Spiritual love.

00:09:03.413 --> 00:09:06.871
All these things if you can achieve in India

00:09:06.952 --> 00:09:12.357
you have done full justice to Me and to yourself.

00:09:12.438 --> 00:09:17.190
It is not just a picnic or an outing, nothing of the kind,

00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:23.021
and working out internally all of you, now I am sure it will work out.

00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:33.050
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:41.690
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:47.571
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:52.495
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

00:09:52.576 --> 00:09:55.976
which we have seen is so tremendous.

00:09:56.063 --> 00:10:05.343
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

00:10:05.603 --> 00:10:13.869
And my love should resound the name of God."

00:10:13.957 --> 00:10:23.277
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.
