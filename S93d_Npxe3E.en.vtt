10:03.055 --> 10:12.745
Today it's a different day altogether for all of you,

10:13.865 --> 10:22.665
because this is the Puja of Adi Shakti.

10:24.132 --> 10:31.364
And Adi Shakti is a complete personality,

10:31.965 --> 10:38.698
it's not only the left side that you know.

10:39.665 --> 10:46.364
You all know only the left side, from Shri Ganesha

10:47.932 --> 10:55.698
through the ascent of different, different chakras on the left side.

10:56.565 --> 11:02.464
I didn't want to tell you about the right side to begin with,

11:03.398 --> 11:11.398
because those who have gone through the right side got just lost.

11:14.498 --> 11:23.531
They got Gayatri Mantra from the writings

11:25.398 --> 11:28.331
but they didn't know what it was about,

11:29.065 --> 11:35.464
they just used to learn it by heart.

11:36.631 --> 11:40.398
They didn't also know the real meaning of it,

11:41.398 --> 11:47.398
and that is how they moved on the right side

11:48.631 --> 11:53.698
and, I don’t know, they landed up at the Agnya;

11:56.531 --> 12:00.898
and then they were trying for the Self-realization.

12:01.498 --> 12:07.398
They were promised that if you do this right side properly,

12:08.498 --> 12:14.565
you will reach to the ultimate goal of Self-realization.

12:15.698 --> 12:18.364
But none of them reached there.

12:18.898 --> 12:22.398
Most of them got into a terrible temper,

12:22.965 --> 12:29.398
terrible temper of cursing others, of destroying others.

12:29.731 --> 12:37.565
All these things they learnt through their right-side movement.

12:39.598 --> 12:42.398
There was no kundalini awakening,

12:43.398 --> 12:51.398
and they were made to go up to the, at the most, Agnya Chakra,

12:52.398 --> 12:59.498
and then they collapsed into different places of complete ignorance.

13:02.932 --> 13:11.098
All these books were written without understanding

13:11.631 --> 13:15.831
that it's not easy to go via right side,

13:17.631 --> 13:23.865
but best was to awaken your kundalini.

13:24.831 --> 13:30.364
The kundalini directly takes you up in the center of all the chakras,

13:30.932 --> 13:37.398
up to the Agnya and crosses Agnya, and goes beyond Agnya

13:37.865 --> 13:44.398
into the Sahasrara, and then it pierces through the Sahasrara.

13:44.998 --> 13:51.498
Now, what is so important about the Brahmarandra, from where it pierces?

13:52.431 --> 13:54.631
I never told you about it.

13:55.398 --> 13:59.631
But now I think for most of you the time has come.

14:00.932 --> 14:06.498
You see in the childhood the child has a talu,

14:06.598 --> 14:11.898
is the fontanel bone area which is pulsating always.

14:12.531 --> 14:19.464
It is pulsating because the spirit entered through that area,

14:20.731 --> 14:26.598
and when you close it, it settles in the heart.

14:28.498 --> 14:34.398
Now you have to become the spirit-oriented person,

14:34.798 --> 14:41.598
but how to enter into the Sahasrara was the problem.

14:43.065 --> 14:46.831
The tantrikas who were there, they went through the right, left side,

14:47.431 --> 14:57.665
and they developed all the practices of black – we should say, the left side.

14:59.464 --> 15:06.898
So the right-sided became extremely hot-tempered, I should say,

15:06.998 --> 15:12.631
extremely ambitious, ferocious,

15:14.398 --> 15:22.798
and they started killing people on the basis of cursing.

15:23.431 --> 15:25.731
They are very good at cursing people;

15:26.831 --> 15:31.831
to be always forward, push back all the people,

15:32.464 --> 15:36.464
and override everybody's rights.

15:36.865 --> 15:43.531
They were regarded as the most ambitious and most powerful people.

15:44.398 --> 15:50.631
Now the brahmins and to some extent the kshatriyas,

15:51.065 --> 15:53.498
they then took the right side.

15:54.398 --> 15:58.464
Because of the right side they became very powerful, no doubt.

15:59.398 --> 16:02.431
They got all the powers over the world

16:02.965 --> 16:12.665
and they were regarded as extremely powerful and majestic people,

16:12.831 --> 16:16.932
but they were not, because they were so hot-tempered.

16:17.565 --> 16:20.965
Hot-tempered people cannot be spiritual.

16:21.698 --> 16:26.364
So they were told, “You'll get your spirituality, don't worry, keep moving,”

16:26.565 --> 16:33.765
and the seven chakras were described, on the right side.

16:35.464 --> 16:41.598
According to them there is bhuh, bhurvah.

16:42.364 --> 16:46.565
Bhuh is this prithivi, is this world, bhuh.

16:46.965 --> 16:52.898
Bhurvah is the complete cosmos, or we can call it antariksha.

16:53.831 --> 16:59.364
Swaha: swaha is consumption at the Nabhi Chakra;

16:59.831 --> 17:05.598
and swadha is the, swadha is the consumption inside,

17:05.631 --> 17:12.498
is to absorption – swaha, swadha.

17:13.331 --> 17:21.331
Then is the mind, heart – manah.

17:23.932 --> 17:35.364
After manah came the Agnya – the Vishuddhi.

17:35.831 --> 17:41.698
The Vishuddhi is janah, collectivity, people,

17:42.098 --> 17:46.531
go to the people – janah.

17:47.831 --> 17:52.631
Then at the Agnya it is tapah.

17:53.932 --> 17:59.431
In tapah we have Christ in the center;

18:00.831 --> 18:10.364
left side they had Jainism, right side Christianity.

18:12.698 --> 18:16.531
They were not actually ascending path,

18:17.398 --> 18:22.865
they were just side outlets, we can say,

18:23.464 --> 18:30.032
for the energy of people who were trying to seek the truth.

18:32.831 --> 18:39.498
Now this happened for ages in India.

18:39.932 --> 18:42.531
All the gurus, all the sadhus,

18:43.598 --> 18:46.565
all the big tapassvis, all of them did this.

18:46.998 --> 18:49.398
But where did they reach?

18:49.765 --> 18:55.032
Tapassvis were the people who could give curses –

18:55.398 --> 19:00.431
kshu, shapah – to people, they could curse somebody.

19:01.665 --> 19:09.631
With the kataksha, is with the glance of the eye they could kill somebody,

19:10.398 --> 19:15.498
they could burn something; all right-sided powers they had.

19:15.998 --> 19:20.998
And with these right-sided powers, where did they reach?

19:21.865 --> 19:27.765
To hell, I should say, in a way – if not, in the limbo, as you call it.

19:29.398 --> 19:32.565
There nobody got Self-realization.

19:33.798 --> 19:43.398
You read the old books from India, but even otherwise the Greeks;

19:45.498 --> 19:51.865
and then we had Egyptians, English

19:52.831 --> 19:59.498
and all kinds of aggressive people, Germans

19:59.798 --> 20:10.132
– all of them were aggressive – Catholics, and also you had Romans.

20:10.898 --> 20:12.932
All of them were aggressive,

20:13.464 --> 20:19.032
and were taking the land and property of other countries;

20:19.765 --> 20:25.631
extremely aggressive, they believed in the killing of the people -

20:28.865 --> 20:32.965
extremely, insulting, hot-tempered people.

20:33.998 --> 20:42.531
So how to bring them to the normal, to the central path?

20:46.098 --> 20:54.398
One side was, as I told you, bhuh, bhurv, swaha, swadha,

20:54.865 --> 20:59.498
it’s consumption – this was done by Guru Principle.

21:00.965 --> 21:07.398
Then we have manah, janah – that is collective.

21:07.765 --> 21:11.731
They became collective, no doubt, because they were so powerful

21:12.364 --> 21:21.698
that they had such a lot of people with them to fight for the oppressive.

21:22.098 --> 21:25.698
With their oppressive temperament they were fighting on people

21:25.698 --> 21:27.631
and were oppressing them.

21:29.398 --> 21:34.398
All this kind of … generation came in the history,

21:34.398 --> 21:37.531
as you know, and then it disappeared.

21:39.731 --> 21:47.565
Wars were created, then so many people were killed.

21:48.731 --> 21:54.398
We had Hitler as the maximum of cruelty.

21:55.398 --> 21:59.398
They never cared for humanity.

22:00.431 --> 22:04.032
Then ultimately it came to the Agnya.

22:04.698 --> 22:14.531
Agnya also they killed Jesus Christ, they destroyed Jesus Christ.

22:15.598 --> 22:19.398
They destroyed so many great saints who were really saints

22:19.498 --> 22:25.431
through the central path – some were incarnations –

22:25.731 --> 22:27.698
and they destroyed them.

22:29.132 --> 22:37.765
All this happened since the time of Rama, all that has happened.

22:39.498 --> 22:43.932
And one after another so many rakshasas came,

22:44.731 --> 22:50.398
and they destroyed the peaceful culture of the world;

22:51.831 --> 22:57.698
extremely arrogant show-offs, as we can call them,

22:58.464 --> 23:00.831
very aggressive people.

23:01.865 --> 23:10.731
And this aggression came, came with such a great force,

23:11.865 --> 23:14.398
and followed one after another.

23:17.531 --> 23:20.464
It went up to a point.

23:20.798 --> 23:28.565
When people reacted, they were killed and were destroyed.

23:34.398 --> 23:38.531
So horrible people were created;

23:45.498 --> 24:00.398
all these people, as they were aggressive and destructive.

24:03.565 --> 24:11.698
This nature is still within us, some people, because they are right-sided.

24:12.831 --> 24:23.598
All right-side people had this problem: temper, aggression, controlling others.

24:24.932 --> 24:30.531
The growth stopped, and there was no spiritual growth.

24:31.932 --> 24:34.998
They wanted to have spirituality,

24:35.631 --> 24:45.932
but with this kind of behavior they had developed, spirituality ran away.

24:47.565 --> 24:50.431
We had so many incarnations.

24:50.898 --> 24:55.731
They all were killed, crucified, or were finished.

24:57.698 --> 25:06.665
There was no possibility of saving human beings in general.

25:08.865 --> 25:12.032
One bad man came and he ruined the whole world.

25:12.965 --> 25:17.331
We had one Hitler who really hit all the people,

25:17.398 --> 25:22.065
all the countries, all the nations, and we were all finished.

25:23.531 --> 25:30.898
All this is because we have taken to right-sided movement

25:31.665 --> 25:35.665
which they thought was easier for spirituality, which was not.

25:36.798 --> 25:42.364
So they crossed all the limits, and they reached a stage

25:42.898 --> 25:49.898
that they became absolutely devils, rakshasas,

25:50.398 --> 25:54.965
without realizing that human beings are rakshasas,

25:55.865 --> 25:58.565
that's what they become.

26:01.998 --> 26:04.898
Even their gurus were like that,

26:05.631 --> 26:13.565
and nothing but they tortured even the incarnations,

26:13.898 --> 26:16.932
all the incarnations were tortured by them.

26:17.898 --> 26:22.398
It was really – how they saved themselves is remarkable,

26:23.065 --> 26:28.364
but ultimately they couldn't produce any results.

26:29.798 --> 26:36.898
So the first thing I tried was to study about the kundalini,

26:38.731 --> 26:41.831
that I should be able to raise the kundalini.

26:42.098 --> 26:44.498
And I knew I had come for that,

26:44.765 --> 26:49.598
not for anything else, but only to raise the kundalini of people

26:49.831 --> 26:56.898
so that they take to the central path, not to the right or to the left.

26:57.698 --> 27:03.798
But I told you the knowledge of the left side, plus raising your kundalini.

27:04.665 --> 27:09.765
By raising your kundalini you broke your Sahasrara,

27:10.898 --> 27:22.565
and you entered into the realm of real joy, of reality.

27:24.132 --> 27:29.731
All these bad qualities started falling out.

27:31.398 --> 27:34.531
In the central path first the Mooladhara came.

27:35.665 --> 27:39.665
By the awakening of the Mooladhara and the central path,

27:40.498 --> 27:45.398
you became very pure people.

27:46.032 --> 27:50.798
Your eyes became pure, your licentiousness went away,

27:51.398 --> 27:56.331
your cheapness went away and you became very, very –

28:00.698 --> 28:03.898
I think we should call them the holy people.

28:04.665 --> 28:09.364
Unless and until that happens you cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

28:09.965 --> 28:14.798
You cannot be a licentious, you cannot be a flirtish,

28:15.065 --> 28:20.831
you cannot be a man who wants to grab money from others and all that,

28:21.331 --> 28:25.665
or anyone who is very aggressive could be in Sahaja Yoga.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.631
So all such people were thrown out.

28:28.898 --> 28:32.464
Once they were thrown out they were showing their teeth, I should say.

28:32.698 --> 28:35.464
They didn't like it that they were thrown out.

28:35.698 --> 28:41.364
But they understand now, some of them, that “we have made mistakes.”

28:41.698 --> 28:48.765
So first thing is that you must develop your sense of chastity,

28:49.731 --> 28:53.364
respect it and enjoy it.

28:53.831 --> 28:58.831
That happened because of your Mooladhara being awakened.

28:59.798 --> 29:07.598
That's the first chakra on the left side, where you have Shri Ganesha.

29:08.865 --> 29:12.565
But on the right side also we have deities.

29:12.698 --> 29:18.565
On every chakra we have deities to compensate,

29:19.331 --> 29:22.865
but Shri Ganesha is in the center.

29:23.898 --> 29:30.598
And that's how we were blessed by His powerful purity,

29:31.398 --> 29:35.431
and we started understanding the beauty of purity,

29:35.765 --> 29:38.565
the power of purity.

29:41.798 --> 29:46.731
That's how our right side we finished off.

29:47.398 --> 29:53.698
Right side was for fighting, for killing, anger.

29:55.898 --> 29:58.865
There was no peace for these people.

29:59.565 --> 30:06.364
The only thing they knew how to dominate others, and to be intolerable.

30:07.865 --> 30:16.364
So then they rose to a higher, to higher level of Swadisthan.

30:17.431 --> 30:21.498
In Swadisthana they rose,

30:21.932 --> 30:28.531
and the aggressiveness of the creative people to create something.

30:29.665 --> 30:31.631
Even now we have many.

30:31.831 --> 30:36.932
They create all kinds of nonsense, create all sorts of grotesque,

30:37.398 --> 30:46.831
also very, very, I should say, dirty things to make a name.

30:47.731 --> 30:51.431
So this is the another thing we got it in Swadisthana,

30:51.565 --> 30:56.464
people who wanted to have a name, a position –

30:57.698 --> 31:00.698
that came from right Swadisthana.

31:01.631 --> 31:07.932
Then the third chakra that was there was the Nabhi Chakra.

31:08.698 --> 31:12.731
On the Nabhi Chakra they went all out to make money,

31:12.798 --> 31:18.631
not Lakshmi but money, money by any means,

31:19.831 --> 31:23.631
and they cheated the whole world.

31:23.932 --> 31:31.331
With this money that they got, they did all kinds of bad things.

31:33.932 --> 31:39.731
Either they cheated or they were aggressive.

31:40.932 --> 31:47.398
Cheating was very much in the left-side countries like India,

31:48.698 --> 31:52.898
and aggressiveness in the right-side countries.

31:55.498 --> 32:02.531
In the center, what quality we have at the Swadisthana is the creativeness:

32:03.032 --> 32:06.798
creative of art, which is very beautiful,

32:06.898 --> 32:11.831
which is very deep, which is absolutely spiritual.

32:12.665 --> 32:16.565
That vanished, and people started showing

32:16.598 --> 32:20.698
even the incarnations full of dirty habits.

32:21.798 --> 32:25.898
All kinds of filth came in with that progress.

32:27.998 --> 32:31.065
Then, as I told you, there's Nabhi.

32:31.698 --> 32:39.398
In Nabhi people got after money.

32:41.032 --> 32:43.398
Left-sided people were making money,

32:43.464 --> 32:45.932
right-sided were aggressive with their money.

32:45.998 --> 32:49.665
If they were earning they thought they’re on top of the world.

32:50.498 --> 32:54.565
If they had money they thought, “Nobody is better than us.”

32:55.865 --> 33:01.065
All this finished them off, it's finishing.

33:01.498 --> 33:04.831
It will come to that point where they will realize

33:05.364 --> 33:10.565
that money is not for destroying but for construction:

33:11.098 --> 33:15.464
constructing of the country, constructing of the human beings together

33:15.631 --> 33:18.498
to bring peace and love among them,

33:19.598 --> 33:25.798
for helping, for doing all kinds of good things.

33:27.665 --> 33:38.665
Then the same right-sided people went to the chakra of the Mother,

33:40.498 --> 33:45.531
and they were horrible mothers, tried to dominate their children,

33:45.765 --> 33:52.765
dominate everyone, and could not sacrifice anything for the children.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.665
We have had enough of these women

33:56.998 --> 34:01.565
who are aggressive with their husbands, are aggressive with their children.

34:02.398 --> 34:06.731
And even the motherhood among men is dead and finished.

34:08.398 --> 34:13.398
All that kind of lot when I came on this Earth I saw,

34:13.631 --> 34:17.731
and I was shocked – what sort of human beings are those?

34:18.032 --> 34:20.431
What am I going to do with them?

34:20.798 --> 34:23.464
How will I awaken their kundalini?

34:24.398 --> 34:27.464
At the Nabhi Chakra only they were lost,

34:28.498 --> 34:31.364
but now it is the Mother's chakra.

34:31.698 --> 34:36.998
They had no fatherhood, no motherhood, they drove out their children –

34:37.698 --> 34:42.731
very selfish, self-centered, dominating parents.

34:49.398 --> 34:51.765
This was the Heart Chakra.

34:53.464 --> 34:57.665
Then came the collective chakra, what we call as the Vishuddhi.

34:58.464 --> 35:03.531
At the Vishuddhi Chakra they wanted to occupy the whole world.

35:04.598 --> 35:13.731
They wanted to occupy the whole world as their own to become emperors,

35:13.965 --> 35:18.831
and they formed empires and misbehaved to such an extent

35:19.398 --> 35:22.398
that it's not humanly possible to behave like that.

35:22.531 --> 35:24.698
They really were rakshasas, I should say,

35:24.898 --> 35:27.765
and those rakshas qualities are still there.

35:28.464 --> 35:32.598
In their behavior, in everything you can see how they behave

35:32.765 --> 35:37.431
towards people, treating them like that,

35:37.898 --> 35:44.731
creating people who are against spirituality,

35:45.398 --> 35:48.398
and those who are aggressive.

35:49.665 --> 35:53.965
Well, these became like a two-sided world

35:54.098 --> 35:58.631
where there are people who are aggressive,

35:59.398 --> 36:01.598
and the people who are tortured.

36:01.865 --> 36:11.498
This two-sided world exists even now, but is much less.

36:12.798 --> 36:16.598
Thanks to the collective understanding

36:16.665 --> 36:21.464
there are many good institution that were established

36:21.798 --> 36:26.398
but they are not working out, they are not so successful,

36:26.831 --> 36:32.631
because the men at the head of it are controlling, but controlling what?

36:32.898 --> 36:35.898
Not themselves – controlling others,

36:36.398 --> 36:41.598
and all their behavior has spoilt all the work of this chakra.

36:43.398 --> 36:47.398
Collectively you have, if you see around now today

36:47.598 --> 36:54.531
everywhere there’s war going on, fights going on, killing going on,

36:54.531 --> 36:59.898
destruction going on. How is it?

37:00.631 --> 37:05.498
There are so many spiritual people here now on this world.

37:05.831 --> 37:10.331
So the reason is, the spiritual people have become very quiet,

37:10.698 --> 37:13.765
very much enjoying their spiritual life,

37:14.498 --> 37:20.398
have become very quiet and very peaceful people.

37:20.865 --> 37:23.765
But that doesn't bring peace.

37:24.598 --> 37:29.464
You have to be dynamic and you have to bring peace in the world,

37:29.598 --> 37:31.531
you have to do something about it.

37:31.865 --> 37:34.598
We are very much satisfied with our progress,

37:34.865 --> 37:39.865
but we are not bothered as to see what is the progress others have done,

37:40.565 --> 37:43.631
how far they have gone, where can we meet them,

37:43.798 --> 37:45.565
what can we change them.

37:45.665 --> 37:48.132
At My level I can change many things,

37:48.498 --> 37:51.598
but at your level how many people have you changed?

37:51.965 --> 37:55.364
What have you done? That has to be said.

37:55.464 --> 37:59.598
Still you live with your ego, on the Agnya,

38:00.865 --> 38:03.531
and you are very happy with your peace,

38:03.665 --> 38:06.464
with everything you have got through Sahaja Yoga.

38:06.765 --> 38:10.665
This is the biggest calamity that the world is facing today,

38:10.965 --> 38:15.898
that those who are all so spiritual, those who have achieved great heights

38:15.998 --> 38:19.731
are least bothered as to what good has to be done.

38:20.098 --> 38:23.998
What they are doing is to enjoy their own spirituality,

38:24.798 --> 38:28.398
come to the puja, have more and more of it.

38:28.531 --> 38:34.665
But they have done no collective work to change people.

38:34.798 --> 38:37.631
Some of them are working, one or two,

38:37.932 --> 38:40.498
but the rest of them are having a good time

38:40.731 --> 38:44.398
enjoying themselves in such a manner

38:44.865 --> 38:50.698
that people accept them as great souls, good people, that's all.

38:51.598 --> 38:54.065
I would like you to now introspect

38:54.431 --> 38:57.464
and find out how much collective work you have done,

38:57.731 --> 39:01.965
how many people you have got – like that.

39:02.398 --> 39:04.598
With whom are you talking?

39:04.865 --> 39:07.865
How many people have you told about Sahaja Yoga?

39:08.431 --> 39:10.398
Only so many are there.

39:10.631 --> 39:15.565
Christ had only twelve disciples; they were much more dynamic than you are.

39:16.065 --> 39:18.631
So now you should take to the right side.

39:19.531 --> 39:23.398
And when you take to the right side we'll create dynamic people,

39:23.898 --> 39:32.798
not just some useless, patient, very quiet, peaceful people.

39:33.431 --> 39:35.431
This was not the aim of Sahaja Yoga.

39:35.665 --> 39:40.798
The aim of Sahaja Yoga is to change, change so many.

39:41.665 --> 39:44.898
And those who are doing that, all My blessings are with them.

39:45.498 --> 39:50.098
But those who are just keeping to themselves, it is not a very good thing.

39:50.598 --> 39:54.065
In your country how many people have got to Sahaja Yoga?

39:54.398 --> 39:58.464
Just find out. With how many people you have worked it out?

39:58.665 --> 40:03.665
So yours is not a complete yoga, yours is a partial yoga of the left side,

40:03.698 --> 40:06.865
where you are very loving, you are very kind, very this thing.

40:07.132 --> 40:09.831
I am not saying that you should become aggressive in any way.

40:10.531 --> 40:16.032
But even I have seen people want to be leaders, they want to be something great;

40:16.464 --> 40:19.398
but how many people have they given realization?

40:19.565 --> 40:22.965
How many people have they talked about Sahaja Yoga?

40:23.498 --> 40:26.498
I have said even in the aeroplane also you go,

40:26.731 --> 40:30.464
you walk in the street, anywhere people talk about Sahaja Yoga.

40:30.765 --> 40:35.431
But here we are using Sahaja Yoga for our greatness,

40:35.665 --> 40:39.998
for our understanding of ourselves.

40:40.431 --> 40:43.698
This is not why Sahaja Yoga has been brought to you.

40:44.364 --> 40:50.498
It has been brought to you for giving realizations to many people.

40:51.598 --> 40:53.665
I request all the younger people, younger generation

40:53.698 --> 40:57.398
not to waste their Sahaj energies

40:57.498 --> 40:59.765
on nonsense as the old people have done.

41:00.398 --> 41:03.531
You’d better go ahead and talk to people about Sahaja Yog,

41:03.665 --> 41:05.531
and spread the Sahaja Yoga.

41:05.831 --> 41:11.531
They are more interested in running schools, in looking after the destitute,

41:11.531 --> 41:13.731
doing this, - doing that – that's not your job.

41:14.065 --> 41:18.998
Your job is to create more Sahaja yogis, more Sahaja yoginis.

41:19.132 --> 41:23.565
But that is not there, what I find is it's not there.

41:23.898 --> 41:27.765
The right side is missing. You should come to the right side.

41:28.065 --> 41:34.364
Go all ahead. Nothing will happen to you. Nobody can kill you,

41:34.631 --> 41:38.531
nobody can disturb you, nobody can arrest you, take it from Me.

41:38.798 --> 41:43.631
You have powers but if you don't use them, you are like this.

41:45.032 --> 41:48.932
That is why we have come to the stagnated point

41:49.431 --> 41:52.531
that we should know we have to use our right side.

41:52.798 --> 41:55.598
Right side is very important.

41:56.498 --> 42:00.765
Next time I'll tell you about right side, what right-sided things you have.

42:00.898 --> 42:03.831
Now you cannot become left-sided whatever you may try;

42:03.932 --> 42:08.731
so you use your right side in the right direction

42:09.032 --> 42:15.364
with the right understanding, not as some sort of,

42:15.464 --> 42:22.765
I should say, very arbitrary or very dominating, like Hitlers.

42:23.565 --> 42:26.565
We have had also Hitlers among Sahaja yogis.

42:26.798 --> 42:29.665
But now the time has come for you

42:30.065 --> 42:33.865
to do something more than what the saints have done before,

42:34.498 --> 42:37.765
to work it out that way; not to keep to yourself

42:37.932 --> 42:42.398
that you have a family, you have very nice children,

42:42.398 --> 42:45.665
having, enjoying, all that – that's not the Sahaja Yoga for.

42:47.132 --> 42:51.965
Sahaja Yoga is for transforming the whole world.

42:52.865 --> 42:57.831
You have to think about it: what are you doing, where are you,

42:58.565 --> 43:02.531
and what have you achieved out of Sahaja Yoga?

43:02.932 --> 43:06.631
Then we come to the Agnya.

43:07.865 --> 43:13.065
In Agnya what has happened is Sahaja yogis are become, they have,

43:13.431 --> 43:19.431
they can bear anything, they can suffer anything – that's not we want.

43:20.331 --> 43:23.831
What we want, to remove the sufferings of others,

43:24.565 --> 43:26.731
remove the aggression of others.

43:26.965 --> 43:31.698
So we don't, that kind of organization we don't have,

43:32.398 --> 43:34.798
that kind of understanding we don’t have.

43:35.132 --> 43:39.765
And if that works out, you will be different people.

43:40.398 --> 43:46.698
So we have become like saints, you see, sitting in their hermit halls,

43:46.698 --> 43:51.565
something like that, not more than that.

43:52.398 --> 43:57.965
So better try to do something positive, without aggression.

43:58.132 --> 44:04.398
I know some of you are still very aggressive, are show-offs, I know that.

44:05.631 --> 44:12.898
But if you get into the mood of working out collectively,

44:13.698 --> 44:17.898
then you will realize what mistakes you have,

44:18.998 --> 44:24.865
still what is lacking in your personality – that is very important.

44:25.132 --> 44:28.898
At Agnya Chakra many Sahaja yogis falter,

44:30.464 --> 44:32.965
I don't know what happens to them.

44:33.698 --> 44:36.898
At Agnya I have told that you must forgive.

44:37.498 --> 44:41.731
But that doesn't mean that you allow people to do wrong things.

44:42.565 --> 44:45.865
Because you want to forgive it's very easy not to fight,

44:45.898 --> 44:49.831
not to say anything, just keep out, just forgive – no.

44:50.665 --> 44:57.965
You go and talk to that person and tell him it is wrong.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.431
You have to face it.

45:03.431 --> 45:08.598
If you cannot face it then you are useless, just like any other people.

45:09.098 --> 45:12.865
What's the use of you people getting your realization?

45:14.565 --> 45:19.965
So now we have to understand that it's not only that we have vibrations,

45:19.965 --> 45:22.431
that we are all right,

45:22.531 --> 45:26.698
that you can cure some people is the last word – no.

45:27.598 --> 45:30.431
You have to spread it, you have to go in the public,

45:30.531 --> 45:33.531
you have to be collective on this point

45:33.565 --> 45:34.831
and you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

45:35.331 --> 45:41.531
With so many Sahaja yogis all over the world we have not progressed much.

45:42.431 --> 45:46.865
So now it is you have to plan what you want to do,

45:46.965 --> 45:50.598
how you want to do it, and how you want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

45:50.898 --> 45:53.898
It's very important.

45:55.398 --> 46:02.398
Because you people are good at, say, talking about Sahaja Yoga,

46:02.398 --> 46:06.865
singing about Sahaja Yoga; all these things are useless unless and until

46:06.865 --> 46:12.565
you have concrete proof of getting many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

46:13.765 --> 46:15.831
In a small country like Turkey

46:16.431 --> 46:19.965
we have 25000 Sahaja yogis, what do you say?

46:20.464 --> 46:28.364
They are all Muslims, twenty-five thousands Muslim becoming Sahaja yogis,

46:28.731 --> 46:34.398
while you find that number is very small in any other country.

46:35.531 --> 46:40.698
They are not very rich, but they care for their Self-realization

46:40.898 --> 46:43.798
and for toward giving Self-realizations to others.

46:44.398 --> 46:49.698
It's very surprising how it has worked out, how it has spread.

46:50.598 --> 46:58.965
So instead of thinking of your problems, of your enemies, of your powers,

46:59.398 --> 47:01.598
think of giving power to others

47:01.798 --> 47:05.698
and making them Sahaja Yoga – it's very important.

47:06.464 --> 47:10.598
If you are in Sahasrara then you have all the powers.

47:11.698 --> 47:14.598
In Sahasrara if you do not spread Sahaja Yoga,

47:14.798 --> 47:16.865
what's the use of getting realization?

47:17.132 --> 47:20.731
Just for yourself – it's being very selfish.

47:20.998 --> 47:29.898
So I would say that instead of spreading your own glory, your own name,

47:30.398 --> 47:33.998
please try to get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

47:34.598 --> 47:37.865
Go into a very dynamic force.

47:38.631 --> 47:40.765
So many people have complained to Me

47:41.364 --> 47:44.831
that Sahaja yogis are nothing but dead people.

47:45.865 --> 47:48.665
Is that what you are?

47:49.698 --> 47:55.665
Only single person like Me has done so much work, so why not you people?

47:56.565 --> 47:59.698
In your country have you worked it out all over?

48:00.398 --> 48:01.965
Just think about it.

48:02.498 --> 48:06.431
And that's why, unless and until you don't do it you are not sampurna,

48:06.464 --> 48:07.665
you are not complete,

48:07.898 --> 48:12.865
and the Adi Shakti's powers you have not understood in its full form.

48:13.731 --> 48:17.364
That's why I'm telling you today it's a very important day

48:17.398 --> 48:19.631
that you worship Me as Adi Shakti.

48:19.831 --> 48:23.498
But you should know that Adi Shakti has to be a complete form.

48:23.831 --> 48:26.965
It cannot be only half left-sided – no.

48:28.531 --> 48:31.765
If that doesn't work out, then what's the use?

48:31.965 --> 48:38.631
It's like any other getting any other realization – that's not so important.

48:39.631 --> 48:41.431
Not only that you should spread,

48:41.598 --> 48:45.865
but also you should make them, and realize it.

48:53.498 --> 48:58.731
All My blessings, all My love, all My powers I give you;

48:59.565 --> 49:03.865
but try to understand. All right?

49:04.531 --> 49:07.331
Thank you very much.
