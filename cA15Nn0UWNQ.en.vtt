00:07.600 --> 00:11.330
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

00:11.560 --> 00:14.630
which is called as the Swadisthana.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.735
This center looks after physical

00:19.950 --> 00:22.862
and our mental activities.

00:23.610 --> 00:25.240
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

00:25.440 --> 00:28.416
that it has a very important work to do,

00:28.617 --> 00:34.119
is that it has to nourish the brain

00:34.341 --> 00:38.539
with new cells,

00:39.100 --> 00:42.789
because all the time the brain is using

00:42.990 --> 00:45.090
these cells for its activity.

00:45.290 --> 00:48.690
So the energy has to go from this center,

00:48.930 --> 00:51.179
up there you can see

00:52.090 --> 00:56.049
and then it nourishes the center,

00:56.250 --> 00:58.906
it nourishes the brain

00:59.106 --> 01:01.239
through its activity.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.359
Now when we are very futuristic

01:03.560 --> 01:06.143
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

01:06.344 --> 01:08.250
too much of our brain activity we have,

01:08.450 --> 01:10.854
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

01:11.055 --> 01:14.850
thinking too much, all the time
thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

01:15.050 --> 01:20.280
that time we are using the energy of this center.

01:20.763 --> 01:25.290
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

01:25.490 --> 01:27.310
that it goes round, as you see,

01:27.510 --> 01:29.250
it moves all round here

01:29.450 --> 01:32.890
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

01:33.090 --> 01:35.450
and it moves round and round and round,

01:35.650 --> 01:38.590
and gives energy to this area

01:38.790 --> 01:42.510
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

01:43.120 --> 01:48.690
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

01:49.510 --> 01:53.759
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

01:53.960 --> 01:57.560
then the main work of this center suffers

01:57.760 --> 02:01.710
and that’s how we develop all these diseases
of all these organs:

02:01.910 --> 02:05.619
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

02:05.820 --> 02:09.600
Liver problem means that liver has a function

02:09.800 --> 02:14.799
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.690
into the bloodstream.

02:17.891 --> 02:22.600
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

02:22.800 --> 02:25.599
the heat is retained in the liver.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.187
It passes upward and downward.

02:28.388 --> 02:30.559
When it passes upward it affects

02:30.760 --> 02:34.201
a center there, as you can see,
which we call as the right heart,

02:34.402 --> 02:37.789
and people develop what we call
the disease as asthma.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.310
And when it passes downwards

02:40.510 --> 02:42.499
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

02:42.700 --> 02:44.159
and you get kidney troubles,

02:44.360 --> 02:49.811
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

02:50.012 --> 02:56.098
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

02:56.459 --> 02:59.069
At the same time this heat can also pass,

02:59.270 --> 03:02.207
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

03:02.408 --> 03:05.607
and puts in too much of physical efforts

03:05.807 --> 03:08.637
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

03:08.838 --> 03:12.190
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

03:12.390 --> 03:14.920
because this heat can go towards his heart

03:15.120 --> 03:16.569
and just collapse it.

03:16.770 --> 03:19.590
Also those people work very hard like that

03:19.790 --> 03:22.203
can get a very massive heart attack.

03:22.404 --> 03:25.619
But the people who have other problems,

03:25.820 --> 03:28.536
on the left-hand side, are different type.

03:28.737 --> 03:32.023
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

03:32.330 --> 03:34.302
These organs do not work,

03:34.502 --> 03:36.279
and when they do not work

03:36.480 --> 03:38.450
then they have all the other problems

03:38.650 --> 03:40.510
of the left side, as we call it;

03:40.710 --> 03:44.289
and this also causes another serious problem

03:44.490 --> 03:46.750
of psychosomatic troubles.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.430
Now the essence of this center

03:50.630 --> 03:53.737
is that it is creativity.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.830
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

03:58.040 --> 04:01.030
people become extremely creative.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.910
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.880
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.870
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

04:09.070 --> 04:11.210
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.760
The most surprising thing is that people,

04:13.960 --> 04:15.890
say, even from Switzerland

04:16.090 --> 04:18.080
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

04:18.280 --> 04:20.135
who do not know a word of Hindi language

04:20.336 --> 04:23.770
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

04:23.970 --> 04:27.550
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

04:27.910 --> 04:30.449
It's impossible to believe that even the English

04:30.649 --> 04:33.337
who were so difficult to even pronounce

04:33.538 --> 04:36.050
one sentence in Hindi language,

04:36.251 --> 04:40.250
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit
and talking all these things;

04:40.510 --> 04:44.276
because of this creativity improves you.

04:44.499 --> 04:47.640
We have so many artists in India
who came to Sahaja Yoga,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.786
I don’t know if you know their names or not

04:49.867 --> 04:53.040
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.562
They got their Realization

04:54.763 --> 04:58.079
and after that, now today they are
very well-known artists.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.770
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

05:01.970 --> 05:04.230
who became quite good artists,

05:04.430 --> 05:06.150
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

05:06.350 --> 05:11.879
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

05:12.080 --> 05:16.030
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

05:16.320 --> 05:20.698
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

05:20.899 --> 05:24.230
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

05:24.431 --> 05:26.865
or if you want to do something,

05:27.066 --> 05:29.310
mouldings or anything that you want to do

05:29.510 --> 05:32.430
if you have the technique,

05:32.750 --> 05:36.230
the creativity, the power of creativity
starts pouring in you,

05:36.430 --> 05:38.043
and you start producing things

05:38.244 --> 05:41.480
on which you cannot even have thought of,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.650
and these things happen to a person.

05:43.850 --> 05:47.249
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

05:47.471 --> 05:51.880
But if with that you do not keep your
Sahaja Yoga practice,

05:52.080 --> 05:55.839
means if you do not keep your connection
with the Divine,

05:56.040 --> 05:58.390
then the energy gets exhausted.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.190
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

06:01.390 --> 06:03.960
for every artist,

06:04.160 --> 06:06.710
that he should get his connection

06:06.910 --> 06:08.730
with this All-pervading Power

06:08.930 --> 06:11.470
which is the combination of all the powers,

06:11.670 --> 06:14.370
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

06:14.570 --> 06:18.845
Not only that, but all the time
this source is flowing into him.

06:19.099 --> 06:22.450
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why
you have to do

06:22.650 --> 06:24.407
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

06:24.608 --> 06:27.220
after getting your Realization,
as I told you yesterday,

06:27.420 --> 06:29.430
that now you don’t stop at this point,

06:29.630 --> 06:31.690
you have to make the connection perfect.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.413
Without the connection,

06:34.613 --> 06:37.469
it may be that you may go down.

06:37.670 --> 06:41.748
So it’s best is to keep your connection on
and work it out,

06:41.949 --> 06:46.150
to give full respect to yourself,

06:46.396 --> 06:48.049
to your being.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.600
You are not an ordinary thing,

06:50.800 --> 06:53.060
you are not a chicken or something like that.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.679
You are a human being.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.040
And the beauty that is within you
is to be discovered,

06:58.250 --> 06:59.773
is to be nourished

06:59.974 --> 07:02.390
and to be proud of.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.007
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

07:05.208 --> 07:08.159
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.
