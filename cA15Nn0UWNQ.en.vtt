00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.330
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.630
which is called as the Swadisthana.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.735
This center looks after physical

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.862
and our mental activities.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.240
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.416
that it has a very important work to do,

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:34.119
is that it has to nourish the brain

00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:38.539
with new cells,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.789
because all the time the brain is using

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.090
these cells for its activity.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.690
So the energy has to go from this center,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.179
up there you can see

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.049
and then it nourishes the center,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.906
it nourishes the brain

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:01.239
through its activity.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.359
Now when we are very futuristic

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.143
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:08.250
too much of our brain activity we have,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.854
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:14.850
thinking too much, all the time 
thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.280
that time we are using the energy of this center.

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:25.290
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.310
that it goes round, as you see,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.250
it moves all round here

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.890
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450
and it moves round and round and round,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.590
and gives energy to this area

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.510
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.690
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.759
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.560
then the main work of this center suffers

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.710
and that’s how we develop all these diseases 
of all these organs:

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.619
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.600
Liver problem means that liver has a function

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.799
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.690
into the bloodstream.

00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:22.600
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.599
the heat is retained in the liver.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.187
It passes upward and downward.

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:30.559
When it passes upward it affects

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.201
a center there, as you can see, 
which we call as the right heart,

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:37.789
and people develop what we call 
the disease as asthma.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.310
And when it passes downwards

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.499
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.159
and you get kidney troubles,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.811
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:56.098
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.069
At the same time this heat can also pass,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.207
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:05.607
and puts in too much of physical efforts

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:08.637
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:12.190
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.920
because this heat can go towards his heart

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.569
and just collapse it.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.590
Also those people work very hard like that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.203
can get a very massive heart attack.

00:03:22.404 --> 00:03:25.619
But the people who have other problems,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.536
on the left-hand side, are different type.

00:03:28.737 --> 00:03:32.023
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.302
These organs do not work,

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:36.279
and when they do not work

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.450
then they have all the other problems

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.510
of the left side, as we call it;

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.289
and this also causes another serious problem

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.750
of psychosomatic troubles.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.430
Now the essence of this center

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.737
is that it is creativity.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.830
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.030
people become extremely creative.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.910
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.880
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.870
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.210
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.760
The most surprising thing is that people,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.890
say, even from Switzerland

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.080
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.135
who do not know a word of Hindi language

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:23.770
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.550
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.449
It's impossible to believe that even the English

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:33.337
who were so difficult to even pronounce

00:04:33.538 --> 00:04:36.050
one sentence in Hindi language,

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:40.250
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit 
and talking all these things;

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.276
because of this creativity improves you.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.640
We have so many artists in India 
who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:49.786
I don’t know if you know their names or not

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:53.040
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.562
They got their Realization

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:58.079
and after that, now today they are 
very well-known artists.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.770
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.230
who became quite good artists,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.150
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.879
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.030
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.698
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.230
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.865
or if you want to do something,

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:29.310
mouldings or anything that you want to do

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.430
if you have the technique,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.230
the creativity, the power of creativity 
starts pouring in you,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.043
and you start producing things

00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:41.480
on which you cannot even have thought of,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.650
and these things happen to a person.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.249
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.880
But if with that you do not keep your 
Sahaja Yoga practice,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.839
means if you do not keep your connection 
with the Divine,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.390
then the energy gets exhausted.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.190
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.960
for every artist,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.710
that he should get his connection

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.730
with this All-pervading Power

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.470
which is the combination of all the powers,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.370
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.845
Not only that, but all the time 
this source is flowing into him.

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.450
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why 
you have to do

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.407
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:27.220
after getting your Realization, 
as I told you yesterday,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.430
that now you don’t stop at this point,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.690
you have to make the connection perfect.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.413
Without the connection,

00:06:34.613 --> 00:06:37.469
it may be that you may go down.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.748
So it’s best is to keep your connection on 
and work it out,

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.150
to give full respect to yourself,

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:48.049
to your being.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.600
You are not an ordinary thing,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.060
you are not a chicken or something like that.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.679
You are a human being.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.040
And the beauty that is within you 
is to be discovered,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.773
is to be nourished

00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:02.390
and to be proud of.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.007
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:08.159
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.
