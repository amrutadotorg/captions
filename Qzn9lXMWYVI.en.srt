1
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:17,938
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna
Puja.

2
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:28,379
I went to America and they wanted me
to have a Mahakali Puja.

3
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,860
But I said, no, let me talk about Krishna
only,

4
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:44,108
because we have to first realize what is
the strength of this Puja.

5
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:50,793
How are we going to establish Shri Krishna
within ourselves?

6
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:57,846
He, Himself has said, that whenever there
is a downfall of dharma -

7
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:03,869
dharma doesn’t mean what we understand
as Hinduism, Christianity

8
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,794
or Islamic nonsense - it is not.

9
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:20,630
Dharma means, our primordial taboos that
are built-in in the human beings.

10
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:26,026
About these, I think aboriginals knew
better than we.

11
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,091
But then what we did, we dominated them

12
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:35,845
and also they had to change their style
of life.

13
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:39,758
The primordial taboos are only understood

14
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:47,026
if people are trying to understand oneself

15
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:53,630
or else, whatever has come to them through
tradition.

16
00:11:53,884 --> 00:11:57,871
Now, Sahaj Dharma is a little bit
different,

17
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:08,429
in the sense that it’s much higher than
the Sahaj ideas that we talk of,

18
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:16,136
but it’s much higher than even what Shri
Krishna said or Shri Rama said.

19
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:21,889
First Shri Rama thought, best is to give
them disciplines.

20
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:28,577
People should be serious about life,
have full idea

21
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:33,433
about their own being, they should
respect themselves.

22
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:40,759
All these things were written down long
time back.

23
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,905
Also, people, basically when they were
good people,

24
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:50,016
they understood that whatever is bad
for us, we should not do.

25
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,123
These are primordial taboos.

26
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:58,165
Now, these primordial taboos are built-in
within us.

27
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:06,675
Now, supposing I say don’t drink, you will
go on drinking.

28
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:11,067
If I say don’t tell lies, you will tell
lies.

29
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:16,465
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo

30
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,372
because they think now, they have freedom,

31
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:22,365
freedom to do what they like.

32
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,830
You are free people. Actually they are not.

33
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:35,098
They are under the spell of all the kinds
of allurement, you can call it,

34
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:42,040
or temptations, which are against human
life.

35
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:49,392
And it’s very natural to be a person
of Dharma.

36
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:54,202
Small children mostly have it. For example,
I’ve seen children,

37
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:57,957
they feel very shy to take out their
clothes,

38
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,303
even small, small boys, I’ve seen.

39
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:07,886
They won’t take out their clothes in
the presence of others. They feel shy.

40
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:10,274
So, all these are described like

41
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,559
“Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Lajja Rupena
Samsthita”.

42
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,499
So, you should be shy, you should be humble

43
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:24,853
and respect your body – it’s very
important.

44
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:32,506
In these modern times, exposure of body is
regarded as a great achievement of women.

45
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,873
They are trying to become aboriginals, you
see.

46
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,784
That time they never had these ideas and
they were not so confused, you see.

47
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:43,218
So, even if their women were scantily
dressed,

48
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:47,354
it didn’t mean that it was some sort
of a sex

49
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:53,397
or some sort of an attraction for men

50
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:57,438
or men behaving in funny manners

51
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,490
to show that they have a special attraction
for women.

52
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,515
I mean, why should you?

53
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,884
It is absolutely absurd that men should be
attracted to women

54
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:15,901
and women should be attracted to men -

55
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:21,270
and on the road, on the street, you go,
you see, just that going on!

56
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:27,391
This adharma is the worst I think, it’s
a curse.

57
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,427
Because after coming to Sahaja Yoga also

58
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,763
people start doing this nonsense, you know.

59
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,132
They should all go to lunatic asylum,
I think,

60
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,009
they are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,783
But dharma gets established as soon as you
have the light of the Spirit.

62
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:52,438
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put
down: A, B, C, D, E, F.

63
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,412
At the time of Moses, also, He had to put
down ten commandments -

64
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:05,788
but Krishna thought the other way round -

65
00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:12,947
to establish a Dharma of pure love, pure
love.

66
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:21,309
So, because He wanted that Shri Rama’s
taboos were forced on people,

67
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:26,711
just like Islamic, just like Christians -
never works.

68
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:30,183
So, He thought better to ask them in their
freedom,

69
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:33,727
they must develop pure love.

70
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:41,035
Radha, who was with Him, as His power,
is called as Alladha dayini.

71
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:46,885
She’s the one who gives joy. Pure joy!

72
00:16:48,604 --> 00:16:55,836
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble.

73
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:59,563
Now, drinking is against you, you know
that.

74
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:04,626
Today they are talking about tobacco,
tomorrow they’ll talk of drinking

75
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:10,821
when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

76
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:13,158
Then they will taboo it.

77
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,153
But it’s a natural taboo for your body.

78
00:17:17,354 --> 00:17:22,794
If you do something all the time which is
not good for you,

79
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:28,699
for your good life, you are becoming
adharmic.

80
00:17:30,027 --> 00:17:32,979
This is to be understood very clearly

81
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:44,245
that the Sahaja Dharma is that you are
just free -

82
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:49,045
complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense.

83
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:53,372
You are above it. You are above this.

84
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,947
Sahaj Dharma is above the Dharma

85
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:02,042
established by Shri
Krishna or by Shri Rama.

86
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,020
Because you have reached that stage.

87
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:10,727
It’s in complete freedom you have to be
dharmic.

88
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:14,403
Whatever is not good for you, you should
not do.

89
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:21,944
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t do
this or you don’t do that.

90
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:25,250
Whatever I say may not be acceptable

91
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:28,446
but immediately your vibrations will tell
you.

92
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:35,322
This is Sahaj Dharma. In the Sahaj Dharma
you get rid of all kinds of,

93
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:37,993
as they say: (Hindi words) kaama, krodha,
mada, matsa, lobha, moha.

94
00:18:38,194 --> 00:19:00,529
Means – lust, anger, attractions, then –
greed;

95
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:09,342
that’s very important, greed – greed and
attractions.

96
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:18,287
Now, if you understand how people are
greedy; greedy for what?

97
00:19:18,488 --> 00:19:23,146
This America is dying of consumerism, you
see.

98
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:26,196
Now, see the trick of the trade:

99
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:32,948
In America, you can borrow any amount
of money from the bank, no problem.

100
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:40,107
Now, even if you don’t borrow, they’ll send
you a letter,

101
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:45,359
“Why don’t you take twenty thousand
checks we are sending you, why not have it?

102
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:53,295
Ah, very rich you’ll become, you see – it’s
very nice to take the loan.”

103
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:57,699
I was told some people used to come
to Ganapatipule after taking loans.

104
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,147
I said, “Stop that nonsense.”

105
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:06,437
So they take the loan and then they come
to Ganapatipule.

106
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:13,068
All the time their mind is: “How will I pay
this loan, how will I manage?”

107
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:15,917
All the time the attention is distracted,

108
00:20:16,118 --> 00:20:22,968
even when you want to do something good
to yourself by coming to Ganapatipule.

109
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:27,297
So, such a mind is not free.

110
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:37,572
The free mind is that which has attention
completely enlightened by the Spirit.

111
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:45,534
But problem is we are still rising out
of this human bondage

112
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:50,778
to a higher life of realization.

113
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:58,001
And when we are going to that level, we
have to realize

114
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:03,534
that we have to give up all these shackles,

115
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,452
all these horrible things within us.

116
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:13,576
Like a bird, when it is born out
of the egg,

117
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:17,908
shakes out all the parts of the egg.

118
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:21,872
Your brothers, your sisters, your father,
your mother, your husband;

119
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:28,380
everybody – they’ll try to put you down.

120
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,699
Now, if they are drinking, they’ll say,
“Come along,

121
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,298
you better have something to drink, you
are not social,

122
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:39,605
you are useless, you are not up to date.
What is this nonsense?”

123
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:47,377
That’s how a fashion starts and this
collective action of fashion

124
00:21:47,578 --> 00:21:53,636
didn’t come from Shri Krishna and not
in Sahaj.

125
00:21:53,837 --> 00:22:01,773
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses.

126
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:04,779
If you want, you can wear a good dress,

127
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,757
if you don’t want you need not. You are
free.

128
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:14,148
You are free from money bondage. This is
very important.

129
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,266
Money bondage is another thing. I know
some Sahaja Yogis

130
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:20,983
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make
money out of Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,872
You came to Sahaja Yoga for what?

132
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:26,713
To get out of that money bondage.

133
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:32,694
In the Sahaj Dharma, to you money is
nothing but the dust of your feet.

134
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,228
Nothing so important.

135
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:43,181
Then, we have such a collective sense
of accepting nonsense.

136
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:48,217
That has to be dropped out, especially
in America, I was surprised.

137
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:53,753
Also in England. A fellow came as a hippie.

138
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:06,206
His hair was looking like some monkey,

139
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:09,852
monkey’s better I must say, I don’t know
like what,

140
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:15,048
all put together like a, you can say…

141
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:18,738
I mean, there is nothing to compare, I tell
you.

142
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:23,010
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

143
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:25,242
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.

144
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:28,381
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

145
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:30,860
I said, “But your brain is modern,

146
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,984
what is the use of growing your hair like
that?

147
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:37,431
You think you can become primitive?
You cannot!”

148
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,324
Then afterwards I learned that he died.

149
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:48,742
Another one like that came and he didn’t
die,

150
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:51,641
but went to lunatic asylum.

151
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:55,681
Like that I met many, but why do you do it?

152
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:58,745
Because that’s the fashion.

153
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:07,113
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers.

154
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:15,453
Now there is a joke about the new rich
people, in Russia especially.

155
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,686
Russians are not like that, normally.

156
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:23,224
They don’t accept something because it is
a fashion.

157
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:33,551
So, one fellow said that: “My God, you lost
your hand in that accident!”

158
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:40,220
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very
expensive watch from Switzerland.”

159
00:24:40,421 --> 00:24:43,465
“Really? What?” “It was a Rolex.”

160
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,868
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone.

161
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,828
The Rolex is gone! Rolex is the fashion.

162
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:54,640
[Can you remove him down, this one,
because people can’t see you.]

163
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:59,540
So these are new rich people who have
money.

164
00:24:59,741 --> 00:25:05,949
(Dog is on the stage: It’s alright now,
he’ll be able. Come along, come along. Ah.

165
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:10,483
Sit down, sit down. Now go down)

166
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,531
They (the dogs) don’t follow any fashions,

167
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:23,788
I have not seen dogs taking to any
fashions.

168
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,887
Monkeys is taking - I mean, supposing, you
see the Italian designers

169
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:33,590
make something special for them, they
won’t think much of it.

170
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:40,894
Maybe their masters might buy it, but not
these animals.

171
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,642
Now, we don’t have to become animals
of course,

172
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:48,600
but we don’t also have to become
slaves of fashions.

173
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,355
So there are some shops which are very
expensive.

174
00:25:51,555 --> 00:25:54,791
Why? Because they are designers.

175
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:58,640
So you move about telling everybody, “See,
I am wearing this thing

176
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:02,495
from a designer shop, this is from designer
shop.”

177
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,258
That means, what about you?

178
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:11,330
You have no sense of designs, you have
no sense of understanding

179
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:14,637
what you need and what you don’t need.

180
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:18,442
And nowadays most of them are in jail also,
sorry to say,

181
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:24,250
but they have money and they have made
money by befooling you.

182
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:30,591
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things

183
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:34,616
which were coming from Italy designs,
Italian designs,

184
00:26:34,817 --> 00:26:40,227
written down Italian design, so they were
buying it, Italian design.

185
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:47,034
I was surprised that such artistic things
they create

186
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:53,004
that are available everywhere, such
beautiful things.

187
00:26:53,205 --> 00:27:00,618
But what they believe in, is some sort
of a group madness.

188
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:06,358
Everybody wearing the same kind of design
is from this or that.

189
00:27:06,613 --> 00:27:09,824
This is not Sahaj Dharma. We are not
slaves of anything.

190
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:14,126
We are free people. We have not to accept
any design or anything.

191
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:19,110
Ah, it is there, is there! Let the stupid
follow that.

192
00:27:19,311 --> 00:27:21,944
We are Sahaja Yogis.

193
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:26,774
Now, this also prevails among people who
are supposed to be sadhus,

194
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:30,403
they all dress up the same way.

195
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:33,424
How can you make out who is who?

196
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:37,063
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress
up the same way,

197
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:41,249
look the same way, cut your hair the same
way. No.

198
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,824
You have to be individuals, because you
are free,

199
00:27:45,025 --> 00:27:50,556
but that doesn’t mean - freedom is always
supported by wisdom -

200
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:55,087
that doesn’t mean that you do what you
like.

201
00:27:55,288 --> 00:28:00,658
All kinds of funny things happen when
a person doesn’t know

202
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:05,830
what is the light of the Spirit.
In the light of the Spirit,

203
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:12,986
you don’t get involved into this kind
of collective madness that is going on.

204
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:16,437
We are so collective in mad things.

205
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:21,776
I wish they could be collective more
in wise things.

206
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:28,210
Wisdom is very important and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji,

207
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:32,271
Ahlada Dayini Shakti, has to come within
us.

208
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:37,543
Means, when we meet another person
in the collectivity,

209
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,342
another person should feel happy meeting
you.

210
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:47,328
So He taught the Dharma of love.

211
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:53,629
Love is not there if you discard because
he is black or because he is brown,

212
00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:00,644
because he is white. It’s very
superficial -

213
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:04,972
what is black, white and yellow? I don’t
understand.

214
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:09,818
Here they go to the sea shores to make
themselves black

215
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:18,350
and there they say, “We don’t want to have
any blacks,” specially for Americans.

216
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:25,156
I think this kind of separation I found
there,

217
00:29:25,357 --> 00:29:30,166
among the blacks and the whites, I really
wept.

218
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:33,811
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said,
“Mother, will you go to Harlem?”

219
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:37,975
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
me black, I’m black.

220
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:42,451
If you call me white, I’m white. If you
call me yellow, I’m yellow.

221
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:45,841
So, I’m going.” And there I had a lecture,
you know,

222
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:48,598
so many people were there, really I cannot
forget.

223
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,721
It is one of the most famous place that
there is built in that hall

224
00:29:56,936 --> 00:30:05,600
and the same hall is built in Australia
where I had addressed many people.

225
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:11,319
I thought, “Just look at this!” They said,
“Mother, the Australians copied from us.”

226
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,048
Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,
I tell you.

227
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:20,871
I could see their heart, I could feel it
and the fellow was trying to compere.

228
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:23,994
After my lecture he just came, he hugged
me, kissed me.

229
00:30:24,195 --> 00:30:27,924
I mean, he would have even minced me,
a little boy

230
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:33,381
about twenty-two years of age; such love
he felt.

231
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,767
And he said, “Mother, next time You come,
You are going to come to Harlem.”

232
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,673
But I am told that hall is closed.

233
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:48,020
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy,

234
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:55,987
not only against democracy but against
what Abraham Lincoln wanted.

235
00:30:56,188 --> 00:31:01,065
They had such a great man there

236
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:05,132
and there is a little street I saw in his
name.

237
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:13,860
Of course in Washington they say they have
some nice, beautiful statues.

238
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:18,785
But otherwise his principles are finished,

239
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:26,442
his ideals are finished because somehow
or other,

240
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,074
some people came and wrote against -

241
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:34,151
from England especially - against the black
people.

242
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:42,517
What business they have to write against
something that is created by God?

243
00:31:42,718 --> 00:31:45,591
If there are the same colours everywhere,

244
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:48,780
they all will look like military people.

245
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:51,611
They have to have different colors,

246
00:31:51,812 --> 00:31:54,098
they have to have different hues.

247
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:57,444
See, look at the trees, look at
the flowers.

248
00:31:57,645 --> 00:32:02,761
And look at the different hues the sky has,

249
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,216
just to make us happy – Alladha.

250
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:13,008
What gives you happiness is variety.
Variety is a sign of beauty.

251
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:18,464
If there is no variety, it’s so boring
I tell you, so very boring.

252
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:23,702
But they are very proud of it and they
think no end of themselves.

253
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:28,200
They think they are very great people, they
have a sense of superiority,

254
00:32:28,401 --> 00:32:31,877
because they have a certain type of nose

255
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:37,399
or maybe certain type of lips or maybe
certain types of hair.

256
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,431
Such stupid things they are and you join
hands with them.

257
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:43,484
How can you join hands with them?

258
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:47,345
You want your freedom? Then be a free
person.

259
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:53,599
In the freedom you have to have variety,
very important.

260
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:58,040
I would say that, now, the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America

261
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,330
should have a new style of drive: go
to the black people.

262
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:09,652
I was very happy to see the South American
seminar,

263
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:15,766
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people.

264
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:18,745
They went and met them. I have met them
also

265
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:21,312
and I was so surprised

266
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:25,260
that they immediately said, “Mother,
You are spiritual, we know,

267
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,900
but can You solve our problem?” I said,
“What’s your problem?”

268
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:33,441
“Very simple, we have a land.”
“It’s alright, then?”

269
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,558
“Very little land, five, six acres of land

270
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:39,745
that belongs to us where the sage grows.”

271
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:46,433
Sage is a kind of a, according to them,
is a holy plant. All right.

272
00:33:46,634 --> 00:33:52,655
“Now, we always meet, all of us, there
for different festivals

273
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:55,721
because we regard that land as a holy
land.”

274
00:33:55,922 --> 00:33:58,018
They know so many things, you know.

275
00:33:58,219 --> 00:34:02,051
This is a holy land - there were vibrations
for that.

276
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:06,723
So they always used to meet. So natural!

277
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:09,235
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?”

278
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:14,590
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

279
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,680
I said, “To an Indian?” “Yes, so can you
request this Indian

280
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:21,271
to return it to us? We’ll pay him the
money.”

281
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:23,447
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”

282
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:26,554
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

283
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,376
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi!

284
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:33,601
He won’t leave you even one single pai,
is he going to give you this?

285
00:34:33,802 --> 00:34:39,642
I’m sorry, I may be Divine or I may be
anything, I can’t help you.”

286
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:44,216
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it.

287
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:47,130
They should have raised voice. They should
have told the government,

288
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:50,802
“Please return their land. Why do you want
to have it?

289
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:56,775
Why want to grab it?” As it is all
the Americans are immigrants.

290
00:34:56,976 --> 00:35:02,987
They don’t belong to that place, that they
were not owners of that place,

291
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,048
they’d gone – they are immigrants.

292
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:10,029
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that

293
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,360
and then to think they are superior.
It’s very nice,

294
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:15,392
somebody enters your house and thinks he is
very superior

295
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:19,411
and drives out all the people
of the family.

296
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:24,532
That is what has happened in America and
just opposite is Sahaj Dharma.

297
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:32,298
With Sahaj Dharma, you take people into
your heart, you love them.

298
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:38,931
Your love flows all the time, your
compassion flows all the time.

299
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:43,430
To me it’s a problem, this body is more
compassionate than myself.

300
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:47,500
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything.

301
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:51,558
It wants to solve the problem of others

302
00:35:51,759 --> 00:35:55,817
but I don’t think you can have that kind
of a body, you shouldn’t have.

303
00:35:56,018 --> 00:36:00,757
But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

304
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,729
You see on the street somebody who is
a dark fellow.

305
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:13,651
I like about the black Americans, that
once I got down in one airport,

306
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:19,404
so one gentleman, black gentleman said,
“Hello darling, how are You?

307
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:22,725
How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

308
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:25,831
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

309
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:36,246
Then once I was traveling in... what was
the airport? Ursula was with me.

310
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:42,831
So he looked at me, one fellow, very tall,
hefty, fat, you know.

311
00:36:43,032 --> 00:36:47,083
He said, “Ah! Are You back again?” “Ah”.

312
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:50,818
I said, “I’m back. You know me?”
“Of course, of course, I know You.”

313
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:54,357
He had never met me, I had never known him.

314
00:36:56,706 --> 00:37:01,211
But I felt happy, I felt very happy.

315
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:04,476
That’s the best way to meet people.

316
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:09,721
Supposing you are walking on the street,
you see some black gentleman going.

317
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:14,063
It’s a terrible life there, I tell you,
it’s a terrible life for them.

318
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:19,577
I’ve known, I’ve read books on them, I’ve
cried and wept and I felt very sorry.

319
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:23,233
So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should just jump
at them

320
00:37:23,434 --> 00:37:27,593
and you should say, “Hello, how are you?”
Shake hands with them.

321
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:31,287
They won’t cut your throat, I can tell you
this.

322
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:36,478
In criminality, I don’t know who is more
criminal in America,

323
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:40,683
whether they are the blacks or
the whites, competing.

324
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,133
But, if you are kind and if you are loving,

325
00:37:44,334 --> 00:37:47,436
you can remove that part of criminality
which is within them

326
00:37:47,637 --> 00:37:53,211
because hatred can be only washed away
by pure love.

327
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:58,849
But people think they are very cunning,
very superior in cunningness, of course.

328
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,684
Otherwise, what is their superiority?

329
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:09,089
Only this complexion, this white complexion
is the worst of all.

330
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,755
I was very fair, very fair, till I got
married, or for some time,

331
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:17,870
and then I started becoming darker and
darker.

332
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:21,458
Because white complexion gets all kinds
of, see...

333
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,792
the light you put on me, I absorb, I get
a black spot.

334
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:29,424
So it’s not a very great thing to be white,
I don’t think so.

335
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:33,864
It looks very funny and pale and joyless.

336
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:39,441
But no use going to the sea, making your
body, I think brown,

337
00:38:39,642 --> 00:38:48,600
brown, not so black, brown and then
suffering from cancer of the skin.

338
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:53,798
This kind of stupidity is also very much
fashionable.

339
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:58,382
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get
impressed

340
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:02,405
by this, we should be on the watch.

341
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:06,979
I saw my granddaughter was wearing
a sleeveless dress.

342
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,342
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

343
00:39:09,543 --> 00:39:12,774
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very hot.”
She’s young.

344
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,466
I said, “But see, these are two very
important chakras.

345
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:21,214
If you expose them, then you’ll have
a problem.”

346
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:27,009
She doesn’t like to wear dresses which are
above the knee,

347
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,362
but she says, “People wear even above
the knee.”

348
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:35,948
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them closed,

349
00:39:36,149 --> 00:39:40,119
otherwise if they are affected, we’ll have
knee trouble.”

350
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,326
Immediately she changed – immediately.

351
00:39:43,526 --> 00:39:47,935
“Mother, I’ll wear blouse from inside and
something from outside.”

352
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:54,324
Immediately. Because she knew this is
a natural primordial taboo

353
00:39:54,525 --> 00:40:02,760
that we should not expose our these two
chakras and these chakras.

354
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:10,940
But, nowadays, the more you have long
legs, I don’t know,

355
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,008
they have shorter clothes.

356
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:17,083
And I don’t understand what is in the legs,

357
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:20,806
the whole beauty is in the legs or what?

358
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:26,101
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with me.

359
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:30,145
She was wearing a burkha because she was
a Moslem

360
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:34,786
and by the time we landed in London, she
took out the burkha

361
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:39,139
and the dress was much above the knees.

362
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,057
I said, “What kind of Muslim woman is she?

363
00:40:43,258 --> 00:40:49,507
She’s worse than even Christians because
they wouldn’t wear such a thing.

364
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:52,892
You know, to come out of the aeroplane,

365
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,077
you have to come down on the staircase.”

366
00:40:55,278 --> 00:41:01,531
No “Lajja”, no shame, nothing,
shamelessness!

367
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:09,418
So, Sahaj Dharma is that you have shame,
you have sense of shame.

368
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,549
What you talk to others, what you say
to others,

369
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,779
how you behave towards them, in the Sahaj
Dharma is Alladha dayini.

370
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:24,665
If something is not Alladha dayini, keep
quiet. Don’t say.

371
00:41:24,866 --> 00:41:29,692
What is the need? What is there to be
sarcastic?

372
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:34,940
Showing off your brains in your sarcasm.

373
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:40,211
It’s not a sign of good breeding

374
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:45,200
that you talk sarcastically to others
in a sharp way.

375
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:49,537
But if you talk sweetly, what’s the harm?

376
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:55,099
This sweetness comes from Radhaji.

377
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,173
Now, of course they have misused Her

378
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:03,053
and made it into a sort of a Romeo and
Juliet business. It was not that way.

379
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:09,509
She was a very pure woman and She
was Mahalakshmi.

380
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:16,729
So, to be a Mahalaksmi, after coming
to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

381
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:23,233
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly alright.

382
00:42:23,434 --> 00:42:32,282
Once I remember, I was in a big party
and one gentleman came

383
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:36,804
and he sat down, “Aaaaaah!” I said,
“What happened?”

384
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:41,950
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You.

385
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:49,472
See these women, I’m fed up. But You
came, I felt such a relief.”

386
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:54,003
I said, “What is so relieving?” “You are
so serene.”

387
00:42:54,204 --> 00:43:00,448
So, women are serene in Sahaj Dharma.

388
00:43:00,649 --> 00:43:06,098
They are not stupid, frivolous, laughing
at anything.

389
00:43:06,299 --> 00:43:11,633
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh.

390
00:43:11,833 --> 00:43:14,940
I mean, there is something laughable,
alright,

391
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:18,422
but some things are not even laughable,
they laugh.

392
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:23,646
That’s not the way. That can be ridiculous
also, can ridicule others.

393
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:30,440
But, laugh of appreciation, laugh
of enjoyment,

394
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:36,647
is so pure and creates such a beautiful
atmosphere.

395
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:43,706
I think the whole ecological problem is in
our brains and your upbringing.

396
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:46,892
It is not outside.

397
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:52,845
It is inside us, which is reflected
outside.

398
00:43:53,046 --> 00:43:58,091
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

399
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:02,428
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts

400
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:07,046
to our behavior, to how we live.

401
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:13,746
In the Sahaj Dharma, you give up lust and
greed very easily, that I know.

402
00:44:13,947 --> 00:44:16,499
I mean, if they can’t even give up that,

403
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,306
then they should not call themselves Sahaja
Yogis.

404
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:22,882
The first thing you give up is lust and
greed.

405
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,140
I find it among young people now,

406
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:34,325
that those who come to Sahaja Yoga
become really very free people.

407
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:38,384
They don’t run after women.

408
00:44:38,793 --> 00:44:41,294
Women don’t run after men.

409
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:45,425
They are together, they sit together, talk
together, laugh together,

410
00:44:45,626 --> 00:44:48,848
but it is purity that is there.

411
00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:55,144
In the Koran it is described that when
Kyama will come,

412
00:44:55,755 --> 00:45:00,010
beautiful women and beautiful men will
be there,

413
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:03,502
but they’ll have no lust and greed, they’ll
be pure.

414
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:10,657
It is today, you can see – that lust and
greed is finished

415
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:15,170
in most of you – most of you. Automatically
it is finished

416
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:21,766
and now you can see for yourself that
you’re free of this bondage.

417
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:26,633
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow.

418
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:45,318
In the Sahaj Dharma, first thing is very
important is forgiveness.

419
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:50,439
If somebody cannot forgive, then he cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi -

420
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:55,913
forgiveness. How this forgiveness comes in

421
00:45:56,114 --> 00:46:01,309
is by forgetting the past. Otherwise you’ll
go on saying,

422
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:04,860
“This person tortured me, that person
tortured me,

423
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:09,832
he was very mean to me, he was that to me,
he did this to me.”

424
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:15,395
Shows that you are not of that calibre
to understand Sahaja Yoga -

425
00:46:15,596 --> 00:46:18,913
because you cannot forgive.

426
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:22,808
What is there to remember? The present is
the best.

427
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:28,154
Now if you are sitting here with me,
enjoying the Alladha dayini Shakti,

428
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:31,714
that time if you are thinking about
the past, shows what?

429
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,988
That you are not of the calibre.

430
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:40,524
To be the calibre of Sahaja Yoga, you
should be free of your past.

431
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:44,252
Finished. There's no need to confess.

432
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:48,916
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to me of confessions

433
00:46:49,117 --> 00:46:53,592
and I just said, “Baba, just burn these
letters.

434
00:46:53,793 --> 00:46:58,337
I don’t remember. I don’t want to read
anything about anyone.”

435
00:46:58,538 --> 00:47:00,897
So, there should be forgiveness.

436
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,737
If there is forgiveness, you’ll be
surprised,

437
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:08,575
you’ll feel very relieved and your married
life will be very happy.

438
00:47:08,776 --> 00:47:12,742
But if you try to remember something...
Alright,

439
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:17,541
some marriages are really, really very
difficult, alright, so you get out.

440
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:21,035
In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed complete
divorce,

441
00:47:21,235 --> 00:47:23,558
but must be with some reason,

442
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:26,950
not because you think something is
superior.

443
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:31,060
Now we have banned many countries

444
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,088
from where we don’t want to have girls

445
00:47:33,289 --> 00:47:35,374
or from where we don’t want to have boys.

446
00:47:35,575 --> 00:47:38,209
What is the reason? With experience we
have learned,

447
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:43,061
they are not marriage substance.

448
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:48,446
Now, then better not marry.

449
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:54,922
And if you marry then live like an ideal
Sahaja Yogi.

450
00:47:55,438 --> 00:47:58,439
Also, if you are a Sahaja Yogini,

451
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:05,034
then you can carry on very much better
by forgiving all the time.

452
00:48:05,235 --> 00:48:08,124
Every time, when people tell me,
“Mother,

453
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:10,487
You see, You must help me.” “Why?”

454
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:14,671
“Because, You know, my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

455
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:17,874
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind.

456
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,866
He must give you money. Why doesn’t he
give you money?”

457
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:24,357
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say,
“Mother, she’s very extravagant.”

458
00:48:24,558 --> 00:48:30,770
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

459
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:37,371
In Sahaj Dharma, the husband-wife’s
relation should be really romantic,

460
00:48:37,572 --> 00:48:39,674
should be really beautiful.

461
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,147
It is not, you know, we talk of love and
all that here,

462
00:48:43,348 --> 00:48:47,411
very rarely people fall in love and carry
on with it.

463
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:52,101
It’s a blessing if you really get that kind
of a feeling.

464
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:55,825
But mostly it is a curse.

465
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:01,120
So to fall in love is very good

466
00:49:01,321 --> 00:49:05,429
but that doesn’t mean you forget that you
are a Sahaja Yogi.

467
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:11,685
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,
in your married life.

468
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:17,268
Same, dharma is for your children, that you
bring up your children -

469
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:22,386
not troubling them too much, but into
a free life.

470
00:49:22,587 --> 00:49:24,485
Let them use their wisdom.

471
00:49:24,686 --> 00:49:28,928
Sometimes I know children go astray and
try to follow wrong things.

472
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:33,032
Then you must correct them, you must tell
them, it is your duty.

473
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:35,751
They were not born out of the trees

474
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:39,522
but they were born here, from the parents.

475
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:43,275
So it is the duty of the parents to tell
them that this is wrong

476
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:45,458
and this should not be done.

477
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:48,655
It’s a very wrong thing, you should correct
that

478
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:53,247
and that correction should be in a Sahaj
way.

479
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:57,827
I’ll tell you an example.

480
00:49:59,498 --> 00:50:08,118
I had a problem once, with somebody
coming to me and saying,

481
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,051
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

482
00:50:13,252 --> 00:50:17,993
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi,

483
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:21,671
because a smoking Sahaja Yogi is a funny
caricature, you know,

484
00:50:21,872 --> 00:50:24,828
I can’t think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking.

485
00:50:25,029 --> 00:50:30,353
How will I look if I start smoking like
that?” “Ah, horrible!”

486
00:50:30,554 --> 00:50:35,704
I said, “Then if you are my son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.”

487
00:50:35,905 --> 00:50:39,095
He gave up smoking, can you imagine?

488
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:43,831
So, dealing with children, always make
yourself an example,

489
00:50:44,032 --> 00:50:47,064
yourself part and parcel of that event.

490
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:50,790
So the children don’t feel, you know.

491
00:50:50,991 --> 00:51:00,093
This is something that I have talked
many-a-times.

492
00:51:00,294 --> 00:51:03,383
Children is one thing I tell you,

493
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:07,720
they can give up everything but not your
love.

494
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:14,647
If they know you love them, they will not
accept anything

495
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:21,225
that will make you not love - not love
them.

496
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:28,767
This is for definite, because children are
the best people who know about love.

497
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:32,596
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that
in English language,

498
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:39,205
I didn’t see many books about children
written beautiful, beautiful things.

499
00:51:39,406 --> 00:51:42,374
There was one book that was published
when I was in London:

500
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:45,688
“The children talking about
the politicians”,

501
00:51:45,888 --> 00:51:51,566
and they published I think, 5000 books and
that very same day it was finished.

502
00:51:51,767 --> 00:51:58,031
So, talk to children, talk to them. You’ll
be amazed, they are full of honey.

503
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,959
They have such nice, nice things with them

504
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,791
and when they talk like that, then you
are amazed

505
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:09,451
how they say things, how they talk
of Sahaj,

506
00:52:09,652 --> 00:52:17,636
how they are expressing their spiritual
strength.

507
00:52:18,926 --> 00:52:28,637
Now, we have many very good children and
also they are absolutely Sahaj.

508
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,731
One boy came and he just prostrated himself
before me.

509
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:35,554
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

510
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:43,232
“I was getting cool vibrations, Mother,
from You, so I did it.”

511
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:46,823
“Is it, you like it?”
“Of course!”

512
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:50,502
“More than chocolate?”
“Of course!”

513
00:52:50,703 --> 00:52:54,104
I was surprised. “What... you eat them or
what?”

514
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,873
“No, no need to eat, you know, you feel
so happy inside

515
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:03,847
and I feel, Mother, You are putting Your
hand on my heart

516
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:07,159
and trying to console me.”

517
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,411
I was surprised. “And where is your heart?”

518
00:53:09,612 --> 00:53:13,746
He said, “It’s here, here is my heart,
I feel it here.”

519
00:53:13,947 --> 00:53:19,038
Just imagine, what love and what
understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

520
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:24,487
For these little children who are below
even five years.

521
00:53:24,688 --> 00:53:27,650
Now, you are all grown up children of mine

522
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:32,384
and I want you to know all the beauties
that are within you,

523
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,494
that you have to enjoy. First of all, learn
to laugh at yourself.

524
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:41,837
That’s the best way to enjoy yourself,
you know.

525
00:53:42,038 --> 00:53:49,474
And not to spend much time looking in
the mirror, that’s another way.

526
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:52,860
You spend too much at the mirror, then
there’s something wrong with you.

527
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:57,921
I think, personally, that it’s a kind of
a possession may be.

528
00:53:58,122 --> 00:54:04,251
So, what you should see inside: “Are we
Sahaj Dharmies?”

529
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:07,001
Mother has established Sahaj Dharma,

530
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,426
much more than what Krishna wanted
to establish.

531
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:15,859
He wanted to establish the Dharma of love
which of course we have,

532
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:21,119
but apart from that we have so many other
beautiful facets

533
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,423
and such beautiful things within our
personality

534
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:31,232
that we have forgotten to enjoy.

535
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:38,065
So, the attention should be on your own
qualities, on your own personalities

536
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:45,247
and then you’ll be amazed how your
personality is giving you joy,

537
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:53,981
giving you Alladha, giving you so much
of patience with others.

538
00:54:54,706 --> 00:54:58,691
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke

539
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:03,402
because nothing so serious.

540
00:55:03,603 --> 00:55:07,327
It’s not a Rama’s type that you have
to be serious.

541
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:15,474
I don’t have to kill anybody, I don’t use
any weapons in this lifetime.

542
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:19,094
Without weapons if things are solved, what
can you do?

543
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:22,502
But you must try to see the beauty
as Sahaja Yogis.

544
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:27,387
You should be sensitive to see how you
have been helped,

545
00:55:27,588 --> 00:55:31,646
how you have been guided, how you have
been blessed.

546
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:34,339
This is sahaj dharma.

547
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,123
If you cannot know that, then you live
on a very low level.

548
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:41,918
I mean, it’s not fault of Sahaja Yoga,

549
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:46,143
but it’s your style, you are not sensitive.

550
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:53,969
Supposing somebody does not know that he
is burning his hand.

551
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:57,260
So what will you do?

552
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:01,233
He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,
he cannot feel.

553
00:56:01,434 --> 00:56:05,167
He can drink, he can smoke, he can do
everything

554
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:08,884
and still he Is existing, alright.

555
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:13,930
Must be a rakshasa, I think or I don’t know
what to say.

556
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:18,967
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis

557
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:27,211
and not from the bad ones and how do we
proceed in enjoyment -

558
00:56:27,412 --> 00:56:30,615
which is a ocean, just an ocean.

559
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:36,068
For example, now, I came, everybody was
trying to fan.

560
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:38,370
But also in the West another problem is

561
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:42,856
they like to live in hermetically sealed
rooms, hermetically sealed cars,

562
00:56:43,057 --> 00:56:47,043
they are very afraid of draught, I don’t
know, as if they’ll be thrown away

563
00:56:47,244 --> 00:56:50,658
or what will happen to them. They don’t
want draught.

564
00:56:50,859 --> 00:56:55,131
I mean draught is not coming from some
iceberg.

565
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:59,484
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air
at all

566
00:56:59,685 --> 00:57:06,215
and that’s one other reason that people are
very suffocating sometimes, you know,

567
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:10,402
they just suffocate. They are used
to a suffocating life.

568
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:16,263
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so
somebody was driving me,

569
00:57:16,464 --> 00:57:21,204
but the person who was there was from
a Western country.

570
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:24,100
He said, “Don’t open - don’t open
the window.”

571
00:57:24,301 --> 00:57:28,006
I said, “Why?” “There’s a draught.”
I said, “In this country, in India

572
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:32,156
people live in the open. What is a draught?

573
00:57:32,357 --> 00:57:34,570
What draught you are talking about?”

574
00:57:34,771 --> 00:57:37,367
You can’t open the door, you can’t open
the window,

575
00:57:37,568 --> 00:57:40,592
you can’t open anything, if you open
anything,

576
00:57:40,792 --> 00:57:46,900
they’ll be all dead, you see as if.
So open yourself!

577
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:52,761
As it is about the nature, also it is
in their private lives.

578
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:55,912
They don’t want to open.

579
00:57:58,146 --> 00:58:00,345
If somebody comes to their house,
“Oh, my God,

580
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:03,864
now we’ll have to share the wines,

581
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:09,709
we’ll have to share the foods.” They cannot
share.

582
00:58:10,642 --> 00:58:17,523
They cannot share. That is most
uncollective.

583
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:23,949
But in India, I must say, people have
a good sharing capacity

584
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:30,253
because they are still primitive, they are
still primordial,

585
00:58:30,454 --> 00:58:38,887
yet not gone out of the way to satisfy
their own ego.

586
00:58:39,088 --> 00:58:45,208
But I think somehow or other in India,
people like to share.

587
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:56,151
If you want to please any Indian, you tell
them,

588
00:58:56,352 --> 00:58:59,981
“tomorrow I’ll come and have food with
you.” His wife will jump.

589
00:59:00,182 --> 00:59:04,302
She’ll say, “Now what do you like, tell me,
what food do you like?”

590
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:09,871
She will jump. But otherwise, what happens,

591
00:59:10,072 --> 00:59:13,249
as soon as you say he Is coming for food,
the wife will say,

592
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:18,096
“No, no, I am going to my mother.”

593
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:23,566
Immediately she’ll have a programme.

594
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,807
I just don’t understand. They’ll have
beautiful houses,

595
00:59:30,008 --> 00:59:33,242
very clean, very beautiful everything,

596
00:59:33,443 --> 00:59:36,861
but if somebody comes to their house, they
get a shock

597
00:59:37,062 --> 00:59:44,250
as if electricity has entered. So, for whom
is all this?

598
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:49,819
To show off, they will borrow money from
the banks.

599
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,656
Even Indians in America they do.

600
00:59:52,857 --> 00:59:59,854
They want to have three Mercedes, four
houses, for what?

601
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:03,428
Borrowing money, with borrowing money
they’ll do it.

602
01:00:03,629 --> 01:00:08,201
Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow any money.

603
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:13,272
There is no need, you can do away with
things.

604
01:00:13,473 --> 01:00:16,299
Why to have so many cars?

605
01:00:16,499 --> 01:00:20,013
Nowadays, people don’t even walk at all.

606
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:26,435
We used to go to our school, my father had
a car in India - nothing doing.

607
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:29,520
We had to walk. We used to climb one
mountain.

608
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:34,171
It was about five miles the school – every
morning.

609
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:39,148
Then in the night, in the evening, the car
used to come, you see.

610
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:42,638
And I would walk with my bare feet,

611
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,499
because so much vibrations were there,
and the chappals,

612
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,834
I thought were cutting my vibrations,

613
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:53,751
so I used to have chappals in my hand and
walk.

614
01:00:53,952 --> 01:00:57,432
One day, we had a new driver, my father
sent him.

615
01:00:57,633 --> 01:01:00,135
He said, “How will I know who is
your daughter?”

616
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:07,285
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in her
hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

617
01:01:07,486 --> 01:01:15,324
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity.

618
01:01:15,525 --> 01:01:20,470
It’s very important. And not to side
with anyone.

619
01:01:20,671 --> 01:01:24,040
You are not identified with anyone.

620
01:01:24,937 --> 01:01:29,499
It’s much better now, I think, because
since you have taken to Sahaj Dharma,

621
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,290
I’ve seen - English will tell you what’s
wrong with English,

622
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:36,018
Swiss will tell you what’s wrong with
Swiss,

623
01:01:36,219 --> 01:01:39,984
Indians will tell you what’s wrong with
Indians. Actually, I learnt from them.

624
01:01:40,185 --> 01:01:42,056
I don’t know these things are there.

625
01:01:42,256 --> 01:01:45,688
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with
Russians.

626
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:50,019
They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us?

627
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,477
Where do we lack in this?”

628
01:01:53,678 --> 01:02:01,099
Because the collectivity of being in one
country, say as an Indian,

629
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:08,875
we see now, what’s happening in India,
all corrupt, horrible, this, that.

630
01:02:09,076 --> 01:02:11,565
So, I said, “Alright, if you don’t like
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”

631
01:02:11,766 --> 01:02:14,596
“No, no, no, no, that - we will stay here,

632
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:20,934
but this is a very corrupt government, they
are very bad, this, that.”

633
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:26,032
Anywhere you go, you will find immediately
they see -

634
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:34,512
because you don’t know they are now chosen
to change their country.

635
01:02:35,194 --> 01:02:39,699
I have taken up many questions now,
of India

636
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,131
and I’m going to start working on that
level now.

637
01:02:44,332 --> 01:02:49,439
We have already started, in a way, for
the destitute women,

638
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,402
then for other type of poverty and all
that.

639
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:56,574
Just by saying, remove poverty, poverty
cannot be lost.

640
01:02:56,775 --> 01:03:01,019
You have to have feeling for the poor,
then only.

641
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:07,329
But you get with more that feeling because
you are an Indian.

642
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:11,961
You are an Indian, so what? Your own
brothers, sisters starving.

643
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:17,423
You get that very deep feeling within you
if you are a Sahaj Dharmi.

644
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:21,701
So, this is the new Dharma we have
established now in this world.

645
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:26,650
A new race, with a new Dharma, which is
much above

646
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:31,045
even Shri Krishna’s vision is coming
through.

647
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:36,676
He describes in the beginning. I think,
He was not a good salesman,

648
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:39,200
because He describes the best first;

649
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:43,336
you see, the salesman first will start from
two rupees,

650
01:03:43,537 --> 01:03:48,285
then go onward to two thousand rupies.
But He first told us

651
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:52,543
that you have to become Sthita Pragnya,
means Sahaja Yogi -

652
01:03:52,743 --> 01:03:57,214
and then Shri Krishna was asked a question
by Arjuna,

653
01:03:57,415 --> 01:04:01,061
“What is a Sthita Pragya?” Then He
describes a Sahaja Yogi,

654
01:04:01,262 --> 01:04:05,454
that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that.

655
01:04:05,655 --> 01:04:12,683
Now, then the questions start. You know,
Arjuna was a great questioner, I think.

656
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:15,590
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this

657
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,199
and what about that and what about that?”

658
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,869
So He goes on explaining to him that,

659
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:28,564
“You see, this is all just a Maya, this is
all an illusion you have.

660
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:31,362
Get out of this illusion.

661
01:04:31,563 --> 01:04:35,391
If once you get out of this illusion,”
because Arjuna said,

662
01:04:35,592 --> 01:04:40,221
“They are my relations, they are my
teachers. How can I kill them?”

663
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:42,994
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”

664
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:46,173
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are
being killed

665
01:04:46,374 --> 01:04:51,260
because they are not following the Satya
Dharma, so it’s alright.”

666
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:53,564
What is your brother, what is your sister?

667
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:56,051
They are not following the Satya Dharma,

668
01:04:56,257 --> 01:04:57,913
so you have nothing to do with them.

669
01:04:58,114 --> 01:05:02,219
If you can correct them and help them,
it’s alright, otherwise forget them.

670
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:06,845
First, deal with people who are straight.

671
01:05:07,046 --> 01:05:12,754
Like we should say that we must deal with
people who are simple, innocent

672
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:18,270
and then you can take to difficult people
when you are that good.

673
01:05:18,471 --> 01:05:20,379
Otherwise you will come here saying,
“Mother,

674
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:22,622
I have caught this, I have caught that.”

675
01:05:22,823 --> 01:05:25,516
So, in Sahaj Dharma, you being the Spirit,

676
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:31,855
you also know about others, very well
and you can make it out,

677
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:35,224
who is who, what chakras they are catching.

678
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:41,890
But the trouble in America, I found that
Sahaja Yogis used to,

679
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:47,166
just could go and tell somebody, “You are
catching on this chakra.”

680
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:49,438
Now, he has come for the first time and you
tell him,

681
01:05:49,639 --> 01:05:53,275
“You, you are very egoistical.” He says,
“How do you know?”

682
01:05:53,476 --> 01:05:57,215
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

683
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:00,402
Is this the way to receive a new person?

684
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:04,358
Is this the way to talk to a new person?

685
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,249
See, on the contrary, you should say,
“Come, sit down,

686
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:10,206
very nice, you are very great, see?”

687
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:15,655
Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of

688
01:06:15,856 --> 01:06:20,905
buttering, as you call it, you see, we call
it chaplusi. Then, gradually,

689
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:26,145
because you are doing this just to make
him a Sahaja Yogi,

690
01:06:26,402 --> 01:06:29,042
because you love him. Basically that is
the reason.

691
01:06:29,242 --> 01:06:31,546
But as soon as somebody comes in,
if you tell him,

692
01:06:31,747 --> 01:06:35,441
“This is wrong with you, that’s wrong
with you.”

693
01:06:35,642 --> 01:06:39,886
This is not a Pope’s business,

694
01:06:40,086 --> 01:06:42,648
where you go on telling people what’s
wrong with them,

695
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:45,346
go and confess. To whom?

696
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:48,299
To all these silly people. It’s not that.

697
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:53,208
What we have to show; that you have fallen
in love with that person,

698
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:57,066
you are nice to that person because you
like that person.

699
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,638
Then gradually you pull him up.

700
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:03,685
But as soon as he comes you give him one
shot, so finished.

701
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,047
How can you have good relations?

702
01:07:07,248 --> 01:07:08,554
Americans have to learn this.

703
01:07:08,755 --> 01:07:12,096
I don’t know why Americans think they are
very superior people.

704
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:17,426
I tell you for wisdom I would not say they
are so much.

705
01:07:17,627 --> 01:07:20,517
It’s completely lacking – wisdom in them.

706
01:07:20,718 --> 01:07:25,085
And they misunderstand people very fast,

707
01:07:25,286 --> 01:07:29,757
start judging others, is not the way you
can have Sahaj Dharma.

708
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:34,217
Sahaj Dharma is – you are your own. You
are in your own,

709
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:37,428
you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy.

710
01:07:37,658 --> 01:07:41,595
Where is the time to criticise others?

711
01:07:42,118 --> 01:07:48,523
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone.

712
01:07:48,724 --> 01:07:51,590
In that love, you should not show your pity

713
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:55,609
but love which is again: Alladha dayini.

714
01:07:55,810 --> 01:08:00,185
This is the message of Shri Krishna but
I don’t know how many understood it.

715
01:08:00,385 --> 01:08:06,562
Now, what you find those who are following
Shri Krishna, like Hare Rama people,

716
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,827
they are really beggars on the street.

717
01:08:10,028 --> 01:08:14,676
He is Kubera, and his disciples are all
beggars, can you imagine.

718
01:08:14,877 --> 01:08:18,325
Does it add to His glory as Kubera?

719
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:22,144
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

720
01:08:22,505 --> 01:08:30,089
Should be generous, should not bother too
much about yourself.

721
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:33,015
Should not all the time think about
yourself,

722
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:38,657
but think of the collectivity, how you
behave.

723
01:08:41,196 --> 01:08:46,274
Collectivity is not to bring – force people
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

724
01:08:46,475 --> 01:08:50,246
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they will
know the joy of life

725
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:54,005
and you don’t have to tell them anything.
Nothing has to be told,

726
01:08:54,206 --> 01:08:59,864
just silently it will work and they will
feel your love.

727
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:03,705
You see, love is something so great.

728
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:09,771
It not only helps others but it also
helps you.

729
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:13,439
It’s so joyous to give realisation to
others.

730
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,079
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra
is catching”,

731
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,689
why are you giving realisation?

732
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:22,002
If you don’t know how to give realisation,
better not do it.

733
01:09:22,203 --> 01:09:28,368
So, to criticise is not the way we can
enjoy love.

734
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:32,372
Ah, of course you can pull the legs of each
other sometimes,

735
01:09:32,573 --> 01:09:36,341
just for fun’s sake, but not to harm,

736
01:09:36,542 --> 01:09:43,003
not to torture, not to make that person
fall.

737
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:48,928
You are all Sahaj Dharmies, you have
accepted Sahaj Dharma

738
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:56,684
and in Sahaj Dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart,

739
01:09:56,885 --> 01:10:02,943
not hypocrisy, and a sensible life.

740
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:07,974
Now, this Pope is against abortion.
I’m not.

741
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:12,254
If a woman is suffering, let her have
abortion.

742
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:17,365
The one who is living is more important
than the ones who are not living.

743
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:23,541
If somebody wants to have abortion, that
child can be born again.

744
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:28,559
According to us, nobody dies permanently,

745
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,532
whatever it may be.

746
01:10:31,733 --> 01:10:40,936
So, this is one way they use it for
propagation of human beings.

747
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:44,130
Like they say the Moslem women are
a like a factory.

748
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:47,335
They go on producing more children, more
children, more children.

749
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,603
So there are more voters.

750
01:10:51,804 --> 01:10:55,364
So the Pope knows that. That’s why he
says, “Abortion, No.”

751
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:58,218
Christians should not abort, because
then there will be

752
01:10:58,419 --> 01:11:05,257
less Christians to compete with
the Moslems.

753
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:11,920
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such
funny, radical, nonsensical things.

754
01:11:12,121 --> 01:11:17,528
We have divorce, and we have also abortion,

755
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:26,135
which is important to understand that these
are all taboos which are there.

756
01:11:26,336 --> 01:11:33,285
But not for people who have to get out
of the troubles –

757
01:11:33,486 --> 01:11:38,282
you have to help them. Then that’s how
it works.

758
01:11:38,483 --> 01:11:41,539
But to be very frank, we don’t have to do
abortions,

759
01:11:41,739 --> 01:11:46,643
it is achieved by Paramchaitanya.

760
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,710
Paramchaitanya does for me. I don’t have
to.

761
01:11:50,911 --> 01:11:54,219
I don’t have to do anything. It’s
Paramchaitanya.

762
01:11:54,420 --> 01:12:00,790
It’s nice because it knows what is to be
done, how to achieve it.

763
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:03,689
And sometimes you are in trouble, then know

764
01:12:03,889 --> 01:12:07,485
that you are not leaving things into the
hands of the Paramchaitanya.

765
01:12:07,686 --> 01:12:09,624
If you leave it into the hands
of Paramchaitanya

766
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:13,685
things will work out very well.

767
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:17,244
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and
foremost thing is,

768
01:12:17,444 --> 01:12:21,351
how much you are enjoying yourself?

769
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:25,844
How much enjoyment are you giving
to others?

770
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:29,803
For that you have music, you have this,
that.

771
01:12:30,004 --> 01:12:32,254
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,

772
01:12:32,455 --> 01:12:38,112
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna you can’t
keep quiet.

773
01:12:39,537 --> 01:12:49,394
He played Murli, Bansuri, flute. Look
at Him.

774
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:54,933
I talked to you, but He just played Murli.

775
01:12:55,134 --> 01:13:00,742
He didn’t talk so much, except for
the Gita, you won’t find Him talking.

776
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:05,339
And those who read also Gita are horrible
people, I tell you, I have met,

777
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:10,149
those who read Gita. They don’t understand
what Shri Krishna’s Dharma is.

778
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:14,709
If they don’t understand Shri Krishna, how
will they understand Sahaja Yoga?

779
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:23,860
So, for all of you is to practice on love,

780
01:13:24,206 --> 01:13:32,943
on forgiveness, on appreciating others,
on giving joy to others.

781
01:13:33,144 --> 01:13:37,241
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very
kind to me also.

782
01:13:37,442 --> 01:13:41,103
Once I went to the shop to buy a sari,
for myself

783
01:13:41,304 --> 01:13:48,675
and the sari was very expensive for my
purpose. So, I didn’t buy.

784
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:55,117
Said, “Let it be. This colour suits me,
alright, but it doesn’t matter.”

785
01:13:55,318 --> 01:13:58,099
I didn’t have so much money to buy that.

786
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:01,489
So, that Sahaja Yogi bought that sari

787
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:05,623
and on my birthday gave me – and really,
I could not see

788
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:12,214
because my eyes were filled with tears.
Just a small thing like that.

789
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:16,235
Normally I don’t expect you to do
anything for me, no.

790
01:14:16,436 --> 01:14:19,873
But small, small things make you so happy.

791
01:14:20,074 --> 01:14:22,878
But even if you do this to somebody, may
not understand,

792
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:25,241
may not realize, may not feel it.

793
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:29,592
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, you will.

794
01:14:30,438 --> 01:14:36,582
So thank you very much; for all this that
I have said to you,

795
01:14:36,783 --> 01:14:41,738
try to enjoy yourself and make others
enjoy you.

796
01:14:41,939 --> 01:14:44,122
May God bless you.
