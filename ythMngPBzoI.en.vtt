00:03.508 --> 00:10.156
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

00:10.500 --> 00:14.044
but it never happened before.

00:14.244 --> 00:20.205
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

00:20.406 --> 00:23.377
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

00:23.578 --> 00:27.281
some good luck has to come.

00:31.508 --> 00:39.392
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

00:39.593 --> 00:46.728
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

00:46.929 --> 00:53.455
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

00:53.656 --> 00:59.502
Because He came to teach us humility.

00:59.702 --> 01:07.577
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

01:09.264 --> 01:19.361
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

01:19.562 --> 01:26.350
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

01:28.311 --> 01:34.475
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

01:35.792 --> 01:43.218
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

01:45.702 --> 01:49.818
He had to talk of humility that time,

01:50.018 --> 01:55.440
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

01:55.640 --> 02:04.656
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

02:04.878 --> 02:12.711
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

02:12.913 --> 02:18.039
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

02:18.240 --> 02:26.111
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

02:26.311 --> 02:29.514
In the same way Romans were.

02:30.858 --> 02:36.513
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

02:36.713 --> 02:40.678
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

02:40.879 --> 02:44.432
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

02:44.632 --> 02:52.076
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

02:52.408 --> 02:59.675
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

02:59.875 --> 03:05.389
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

03:05.589 --> 03:13.365
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

03:13.565 --> 03:19.930
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

03:20.131 --> 03:24.984
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

03:25.184 --> 03:28.618
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

03:28.819 --> 03:34.360
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

03:34.561 --> 03:42.147
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

03:42.348 --> 03:45.628
everybody in the office is like that.

03:46.943 --> 03:50.154
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

03:50.354 --> 03:53.158
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

03:53.359 --> 04:01.311
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

04:01.869 --> 04:05.940
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

04:06.140 --> 04:11.711
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

04:11.911 --> 04:17.233
The another humbler group was
affected because

04:17.433 --> 04:21.004
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

04:21.204 --> 04:25.303
So they became equally violent

04:25.504 --> 04:30.477
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

04:30.678 --> 04:36.615
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

04:38.342 --> 04:43.707
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

04:43.969 --> 04:49.046
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

04:49.246 --> 04:52.038
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

04:52.238 --> 04:54.661
if you develop a barking temperament

04:54.861 --> 04:59.190
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

04:59.390 --> 05:05.773
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

05:05.974 --> 05:11.413
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

05:11.613 --> 05:17.668
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

05:18.128 --> 05:20.816
and jump at every person who comes
along

05:21.016 --> 05:25.832
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

05:28.948 --> 05:34.598
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

05:34.799 --> 05:40.270
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

05:40.471 --> 05:44.173
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

05:44.375 --> 05:47.211
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

05:47.412 --> 05:53.598
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

05:58.134 --> 06:01.199
In those circumstances Christ was born.

06:01.399 --> 06:05.053
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

06:05.254 --> 06:08.029
but He was born for the whole world.

06:08.229 --> 06:13.561
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

06:13.762 --> 06:19.066
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

06:19.504 --> 06:25.398
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

06:25.599 --> 06:32.068
So they had to be controlled first of all,

06:32.269 --> 06:35.966
and Christ had to come at a time where

06:36.167 --> 06:41.797
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

06:45.425 --> 06:47.722
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

06:47.923 --> 06:54.676
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

06:57.535 --> 07:02.027
He came to create peace on earth.

07:03.706 --> 07:09.673
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

07:09.873 --> 07:13.644
secondly when you are Realized.

07:13.845 --> 07:17.295
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

07:17.496 --> 07:22.676
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

07:23.262 --> 07:31.525
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

07:31.725 --> 07:36.258
runs away from situations,
escapist,

07:36.458 --> 07:41.633
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

07:42.106 --> 07:49.348
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

07:49.976 --> 07:53.226
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

07:53.429 --> 07:57.815
and the humblest man you could
think of.

07:58.016 --> 08:04.090
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

08:04.291 --> 08:08.726
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

08:08.926 --> 08:15.434
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

08:15.635 --> 08:18.746
This is the balance.

08:22.562 --> 08:26.725
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

08:26.926 --> 08:30.725
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

08:30.926 --> 08:33.787
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

08:33.988 --> 08:41.015
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

08:41.216 --> 08:45.207
Human beings are violent to each other.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.483
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

08:51.684 --> 08:58.940
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

08:59.141 --> 09:05.270
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

09:06.974 --> 09:13.356
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

09:14.894 --> 09:19.919
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

09:20.120 --> 09:24.238
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

09:25.368 --> 09:29.465
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

09:30.025 --> 09:35.934
The birth is very, very symbolic.

09:37.302 --> 09:45.959
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

09:46.160 --> 09:51.403
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

09:51.603 --> 09:56.037
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

09:56.237 --> 10:03.066
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

10:08.184 --> 10:11.918
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

10:12.199 --> 10:20.592
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

10:20.832 --> 10:25.445
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

10:25.684 --> 10:34.801
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

10:36.067 --> 10:39.442
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

10:46.489 --> 10:50.114
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

10:56.714 --> 11:09.848
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

11:12.364 --> 11:19.363
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

11:20.768 --> 11:23.990
because people were so proud
of their money,

11:24.191 --> 11:28.639
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

11:28.839 --> 11:33.285
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

11:33.629 --> 11:37.800
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

11:37.963 --> 11:46.082
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

11:47.908 --> 11:52.405
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

11:52.606 --> 11:56.410
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

11:59.393 --> 12:05.957
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

12:07.754 --> 12:12.131
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

12:12.313 --> 12:17.769
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

12:18.073 --> 12:23.370
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

12:23.690 --> 12:27.956
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

12:32.076 --> 12:37.528
Those who have money and think
of money

12:37.729 --> 12:45.112
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

12:45.312 --> 12:48.737
They are going out already.

12:49.120 --> 12:53.419
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

12:53.620 --> 12:59.643
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

12:59.862 --> 13:08.455
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

13:10.627 --> 13:14.005
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

13:14.205 --> 13:18.407
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

13:18.607 --> 13:23.154
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

13:23.355 --> 13:27.533
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

13:27.733 --> 13:30.550
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.422
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

13:33.623 --> 13:36.655
which are never open.

13:37.664 --> 13:44.862
This kind of a ego is again revived

13:46.799 --> 13:56.213
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

13:57.948 --> 14:03.049
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.187
They gave them money,

14:05.387 --> 14:11.690
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

14:14.049 --> 14:18.881
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

14:19.082 --> 14:22.771
He was born in a manger.

14:23.478 --> 14:34.073
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

14:34.479 --> 14:36.875
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

14:37.075 --> 14:45.057
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.761
No place.

14:48.961 --> 14:56.895
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

14:57.096 --> 15:04.159
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.731
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

15:10.936 --> 15:15.596
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

15:17.226 --> 15:21.659
The humblest of all, a crib,

15:21.987 --> 15:26.422
the Highest is put in the manger.

15:30.549 --> 15:33.495
So, what do we do?

15:34.217 --> 15:36.395
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

15:36.596 --> 15:42.926
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

15:43.127 --> 15:46.650
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

15:46.851 --> 15:50.784
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

15:51.092 --> 15:54.581
I met one man one day,

15:55.342 --> 15:59.784
he was all drunk lying near a church.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.194
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

16:03.394 --> 16:09.167
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

16:09.641 --> 16:14.039
This kind of ridiculous caricature

16:14.240 --> 16:20.390
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

16:25.690 --> 16:30.596
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

16:30.797 --> 16:36.571
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

16:36.772 --> 16:40.854
Everybody will have their own concept.

16:43.334 --> 16:48.949
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

16:49.150 --> 16:54.831
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

16:56.362 --> 17:04.825
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

17:05.026 --> 17:11.643
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

17:14.917 --> 17:19.792
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

17:19.992 --> 17:24.083
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

17:24.284 --> 17:29.680
This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

17:29.881 --> 17:36.768
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

17:38.308 --> 17:42.949
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

17:43.150 --> 17:45.905
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

17:46.105 --> 17:50.356
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

17:50.557 --> 17:57.022
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

17:57.299 --> 18:02.740
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

18:02.941 --> 18:07.588
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

18:10.101 --> 18:12.596
Aren’t we?

18:13.377 --> 18:18.651
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

18:18.872 --> 18:26.354
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.909
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

18:33.110 --> 18:36.862
because He was born in a manger.

18:37.422 --> 18:41.346
No comfort was provided for Him.

18:44.468 --> 18:49.687
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

18:49.887 --> 18:54.098
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

18:54.299 --> 18:58.808
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

18:59.009 --> 19:04.777
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.315
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

19:07.522 --> 19:12.942
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

19:14.679 --> 19:24.440
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

19:30.424 --> 19:33.971
Humility and adjustment.

19:36.877 --> 19:40.766
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

19:40.967 --> 19:46.794
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

19:46.995 --> 19:50.231
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

19:50.432 --> 19:56.260
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

19:57.402 --> 20:01.148
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

20:01.348 --> 20:05.252
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

20:05.453 --> 20:10.583
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

20:10.784 --> 20:16.061
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

20:19.974 --> 20:23.397
So the peace has to come.

20:27.202 --> 20:32.164
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

20:32.365 --> 20:36.850
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

20:37.948 --> 20:43.968
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

20:48.411 --> 20:51.720
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

20:51.921 --> 20:54.981
of this body we torture everybody else.

20:55.181 --> 20:58.468
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

20:58.677 --> 21:01.155
not in India.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.974
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

21:04.151 --> 21:09.279
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.251
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

21:12.452 --> 21:15.475
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

21:15.676 --> 21:17.632
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

21:17.832 --> 21:19.404
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

21:19.604 --> 21:25.640
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.608
I mean, any country like that.

21:36.070 --> 21:41.615
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

21:41.815 --> 21:47.937
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

21:48.138 --> 21:52.359
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

21:52.560 --> 21:57.417
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

21:57.618 --> 22:00.299
Do you see that point?

22:00.499 --> 22:03.860
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

22:04.060 --> 22:06.987
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

22:07.187 --> 22:11.384
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

22:11.585 --> 22:15.563
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

22:15.764 --> 22:20.554
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

22:26.819 --> 22:31.847
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

22:32.047 --> 22:37.210
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

22:41.276 --> 22:45.347
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

22:47.663 --> 22:50.212
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

22:50.413 --> 22:55.123
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

22:55.323 --> 22:57.892
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

22:58.092 --> 23:00.600
because He was also lashed that way.

23:00.801 --> 23:05.501
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

23:05.702 --> 23:11.475
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

23:13.211 --> 23:15.383
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

23:15.584 --> 23:19.540
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

23:19.741 --> 23:24.601
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

23:24.801 --> 23:33.186
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

23:36.046 --> 23:42.455
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

23:42.656 --> 23:48.282
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

23:48.483 --> 23:54.788
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

23:54.988 --> 24:02.280
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

24:03.757 --> 24:08.608
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

24:08.809 --> 24:11.201
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

24:11.401 --> 24:15.257
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

24:16.940 --> 24:22.850
Some of them should. But they don’t.

24:23.413 --> 24:26.083
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

24:26.283 --> 24:30.663
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

24:32.384 --> 24:39.624
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

24:41.874 --> 24:46.382
But this is a short time which must
be used.

24:46.582 --> 24:50.788
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

24:50.988 --> 24:55.223
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

24:55.423 --> 24:58.629
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

24:58.829 --> 25:09.968
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

25:10.438 --> 25:16.374
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

25:17.061 --> 25:20.982
What did this world offer Him at that time?

25:21.183 --> 25:27.204
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

25:29.671 --> 25:34.528
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

25:40.589 --> 25:44.007
This is one thing one has to know.

25:46.108 --> 25:51.017
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

25:51.218 --> 25:55.122
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

25:55.322 --> 25:59.655
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

25:59.856 --> 26:06.724
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

26:06.925 --> 26:12.280
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

26:12.987 --> 26:20.882
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

26:21.194 --> 26:24.507
to give comfort to Christ.

26:24.859 --> 26:33.413
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

26:33.614 --> 26:39.827
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

26:43.503 --> 26:47.709
You are the kushas (grass) with the thistles.

26:48.584 --> 26:52.521
And for a yogi the kushasana (seat made of grass) is the one - he sits on the kusha only.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.323
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

26:55.523 --> 27:03.425
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

27:04.249 --> 27:07.810
The Mother is preparing the manger

27:08.011 --> 27:16.675
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted.

27:18.076 --> 27:27.251
The thistles: adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

27:32.049 --> 27:35.608
all must be curbed down.

27:37.567 --> 27:41.820
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

27:42.020 --> 27:46.686
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

27:49.038 --> 27:51.825
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

27:52.025 --> 27:55.538
but I know because I’ve done it.

27:57.898 --> 28:01.461
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

28:01.662 --> 28:04.796
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

28:05.115 --> 28:10.980
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

28:11.180 --> 28:16.374
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

28:16.575 --> 28:20.030
that My stomach is screwing up.

28:21.607 --> 28:25.298
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

28:25.498 --> 28:28.929
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

28:29.129 --> 28:32.864
But what about Christ within us?

28:34.405 --> 28:39.355
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

28:39.988 --> 28:42.960
with your being, with your Spirit,

28:43.160 --> 28:49.908
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

28:54.331 --> 28:58.484
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

28:58.708 --> 29:03.181
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

29:03.381 --> 29:06.721
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

29:06.921 --> 29:10.892
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

29:11.093 --> 29:14.489
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

29:14.689 --> 29:17.587
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

29:17.788 --> 29:20.925
what is all this going on?

29:21.564 --> 29:25.936
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

29:27.564 --> 29:33.975
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

29:35.181 --> 29:42.922
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

29:44.074 --> 29:48.569
If you become humble, peace will come.

29:48.906 --> 29:53.733
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

29:55.216 --> 30:01.819
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

30:03.363 --> 30:07.069
When others are before you,

30:10.707 --> 30:15.027
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

30:15.228 --> 30:19.790
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

30:19.991 --> 30:24.884
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

30:25.084 --> 30:31.139
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

30:31.340 --> 30:38.866
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

30:40.966 --> 30:44.413
You don’t know,

30:45.351 --> 30:49.772
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

30:50.623 --> 30:55.225
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

30:55.426 --> 30:58.403
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

30:58.603 --> 31:06.835
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

31:09.119 --> 31:13.124
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

31:14.272 --> 31:18.811
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

31:19.011 --> 31:24.468
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

31:24.668 --> 31:27.587
We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

31:27.788 --> 31:33.703
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

31:33.904 --> 31:40.294
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

31:40.495 --> 31:44.149
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

31:44.350 --> 31:46.572
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

31:46.772 --> 31:50.955
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

31:51.155 --> 31:54.624
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

31:54.824 --> 32:01.716
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

32:01.917 --> 32:05.421
My presence in England

32:07.963 --> 32:11.296
is good up to a point,

32:12.021 --> 32:17.335
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.261
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

32:22.461 --> 32:26.206
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

32:26.406 --> 32:30.659
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

32:30.859 --> 32:35.540
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

32:35.741 --> 32:43.397
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

32:44.583 --> 32:51.076
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

32:51.277 --> 32:55.766
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

32:55.967 --> 32:58.314
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

32:58.515 --> 33:02.468
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

33:03.697 --> 33:07.671
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

33:07.871 --> 33:12.585
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

33:15.897 --> 33:18.945
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

33:19.145 --> 33:22.505
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

33:22.710 --> 33:26.338
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

33:26.538 --> 33:31.952
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

33:33.046 --> 33:36.046
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

33:36.247 --> 33:38.893
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

33:39.093 --> 33:43.194
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

33:48.415 --> 33:53.927
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

33:54.127 --> 34:01.147
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

34:01.836 --> 34:04.384
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

34:04.585 --> 34:08.467
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

34:08.668 --> 34:11.404
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

34:11.604 --> 34:17.291
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

34:17.492 --> 34:21.194
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

34:21.395 --> 34:24.213
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

34:24.413 --> 34:27.349
we have to respect each other as saints.

34:27.549 --> 34:31.752
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

34:31.953 --> 34:35.663
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

34:36.499 --> 34:40.912
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

34:41.139 --> 34:46.887
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

34:47.087 --> 34:52.890
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

34:55.733 --> 35:03.007
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

35:05.520 --> 35:09.911
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

35:10.111 --> 35:12.133
Christ has gone to this extent to say

35:12.333 --> 35:17.044
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

35:17.244 --> 35:21.054
With Romans there was no other way out.

35:26.360 --> 35:30.520
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

35:30.720 --> 35:34.632
throughout He preached humility.

35:34.832 --> 35:37.345
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

35:37.546 --> 35:39.983
You need not be humble to others, because

35:40.184 --> 35:43.979
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

35:44.180 --> 35:47.280
but you be humble to each other.

35:50.444 --> 35:55.632
Humble in your demands of life.

35:55.862 --> 35:58.932
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

35:59.133 --> 36:02.914
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

36:03.115 --> 36:08.567
of a strange characters, you see,

36:08.768 --> 36:14.371
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

36:14.572 --> 36:22.225
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

36:22.650 --> 36:26.540
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

36:26.740 --> 36:30.189
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

36:30.390 --> 36:35.077
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

36:35.982 --> 36:38.866
adjust yourself.

36:39.133 --> 36:41.008
If somebody has one room you should say,

36:41.218 --> 36:44.999
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

36:45.285 --> 36:48.176
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

36:48.377 --> 36:52.371
to the room which has the attached bath.

36:52.604 --> 36:55.333
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

36:55.533 --> 37:00.327
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

37:02.722 --> 37:08.499
Better give up. Better give up.

37:08.954 --> 37:12.247
See now? Better give up.

37:12.448 --> 37:17.273
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

37:17.474 --> 37:20.725
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

37:20.925 --> 37:24.374
but need not ask for attached bath.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.523
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

37:33.723 --> 37:38.569
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

37:41.356 --> 37:46.573
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

37:46.773 --> 37:51.395
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

37:51.596 --> 37:57.181
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

37:57.382 --> 38:03.905
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

38:04.250 --> 38:10.183
Christ was given the crib of a manger

38:10.383 --> 38:15.308
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

38:15.508 --> 38:21.892
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

38:22.092 --> 38:28.715
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

38:28.915 --> 38:35.445
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

38:35.645 --> 38:38.134
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

38:38.334 --> 38:42.436
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

38:42.763 --> 38:49.765
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

38:51.925 --> 38:58.336
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

38:58.537 --> 39:03.108
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

39:04.390 --> 39:08.473
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

39:08.673 --> 39:12.030
Here you must have gloves.

39:13.253 --> 39:17.269
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

39:17.469 --> 39:21.087
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

39:21.288 --> 39:24.858
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

39:30.357 --> 39:34.468
But He was a very clean person.

39:40.266 --> 39:46.194
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

39:47.405 --> 39:49.912
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

39:50.112 --> 39:55.319
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

39:55.548 --> 39:58.694
and sometimes with one.

40:00.077 --> 40:05.975
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

40:10.237 --> 40:14.374
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

40:14.575 --> 40:18.361
that we are the saviours today,

40:18.562 --> 40:25.721
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

40:25.921 --> 40:31.384
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

40:31.584 --> 40:34.044
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

40:34.245 --> 40:37.133
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

40:37.334 --> 40:42.218
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

40:42.419 --> 40:49.255
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

40:49.455 --> 40:56.429
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

40:56.629 --> 41:00.955
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

41:01.155 --> 41:03.591
If you are the emperor of this world,

41:03.791 --> 41:06.031
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

41:06.232 --> 41:10.839
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

41:11.040 --> 41:17.185
What material thing can charm such
a person?

41:17.385 --> 41:22.101
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

41:22.301 --> 41:28.209
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

41:28.410 --> 41:33.587
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

41:33.788 --> 41:39.168
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

41:39.368 --> 41:46.093
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

41:48.489 --> 41:55.507
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

41:57.985 --> 42:00.401
Beauty is the comfort,

42:00.601 --> 42:04.262
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

42:04.462 --> 42:09.100
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

42:09.438 --> 42:12.686
how comforting is the beauty.

42:14.955 --> 42:20.070
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

42:20.270 --> 42:30.222
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

42:30.423 --> 42:34.319
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

42:34.960 --> 42:38.843
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

42:39.044 --> 42:42.022
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

42:42.223 --> 42:46.053
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

42:46.254 --> 42:53.811
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

42:54.758 --> 43:00.718
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

43:00.919 --> 43:03.434
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

43:03.634 --> 43:09.190
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

43:09.390 --> 43:12.663
And once you ask for that,

43:14.150 --> 43:19.020
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

43:19.221 --> 43:25.790
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

43:25.991 --> 43:30.545
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

43:30.745 --> 43:34.591
is to rejoice in our

43:36.813 --> 43:46.340
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

43:46.541 --> 43:50.655
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

43:50.855 --> 43:54.090
you do not hanker, do you?

43:54.683 --> 43:59.213
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

43:59.413 --> 44:09.668
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

44:09.869 --> 44:13.272
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

44:13.473 --> 44:16.880
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

44:17.080 --> 44:23.671
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

44:25.387 --> 44:31.284
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

44:31.484 --> 44:35.155
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

44:35.356 --> 44:38.684
“Mother, he has bitten me.

44:39.942 --> 44:46.418
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

44:48.511 --> 44:52.926
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

44:55.228 --> 44:59.276
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

44:59.477 --> 45:05.596
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

45:08.359 --> 45:14.871
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

45:15.072 --> 45:20.832
The shepherds, simple people,

45:21.033 --> 45:27.840
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

45:28.041 --> 45:32.584
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

45:32.832 --> 45:36.379
who are leading a humble life,

45:36.767 --> 45:43.098
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

45:44.734 --> 45:47.617
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

45:47.817 --> 45:50.469
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

45:50.669 --> 45:54.483
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

45:54.683 --> 45:59.077
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

45:59.278 --> 46:04.504
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

46:04.910 --> 46:12.141
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

46:12.341 --> 46:19.309
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

46:23.244 --> 46:26.754
And another are the wise.

46:28.551 --> 46:34.715
Only the wise can understand the star.

46:38.565 --> 46:41.817
So many must have seen the star.

46:43.493 --> 46:45.845
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

46:46.046 --> 46:50.090
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

46:50.290 --> 46:53.909
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

46:54.109 --> 47:00.793
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

47:05.847 --> 47:10.840
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

47:11.347 --> 47:19.825
East is left side and West is right side.

47:20.442 --> 47:29.403
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

47:29.817 --> 47:33.577
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

47:33.778 --> 47:39.952
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

47:40.153 --> 47:43.281
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

47:43.481 --> 47:48.756
But those who know and are left-sided,

47:48.956 --> 47:59.464
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

47:59.665 --> 48:03.698
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

48:03.898 --> 48:11.078
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

48:11.278 --> 48:15.626
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

48:15.827 --> 48:20.981
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

48:21.386 --> 48:23.676
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

48:23.876 --> 48:33.970
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

48:34.171 --> 48:38.888
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

48:39.088 --> 48:46.468
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

48:46.635 --> 48:48.964
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

48:49.164 --> 48:51.364
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

48:51.565 --> 48:56.918
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

48:57.446 --> 49:03.325
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

49:03.533 --> 49:10.022
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

49:10.223 --> 49:12.983
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

49:13.184 --> 49:20.182
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

49:20.383 --> 49:23.756
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

49:23.957 --> 49:28.192
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

49:28.393 --> 49:32.366
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

49:32.567 --> 49:35.343
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

49:35.543 --> 49:39.711
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

49:39.911 --> 49:44.192
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

49:47.441 --> 49:52.559
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

49:56.665 --> 49:59.660
See the vibrations.

50:09.218 --> 50:13.121
Because They only can recognize,

50:16.207 --> 50:22.942
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

50:26.685 --> 50:29.598
So They came.

50:29.964 --> 50:34.832
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

50:35.590 --> 50:41.801
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

50:42.002 --> 50:45.829
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

50:46.030 --> 50:49.145
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

50:50.651 --> 50:55.628
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

50:55.828 --> 50:59.389
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

50:59.589 --> 51:07.604
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

51:07.804 --> 51:16.559
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

51:17.631 --> 51:22.729
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

51:22.930 --> 51:27.340
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

51:27.730 --> 51:31.107
Is a center of gravity,

51:31.307 --> 51:34.666
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

51:34.866 --> 51:42.012
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

51:50.533 --> 51:53.254
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

51:53.454 --> 52:00.647
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

52:00.848 --> 52:06.567
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

52:07.792 --> 52:12.950
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

52:13.151 --> 52:18.101
and understanding of Your Being.

52:20.718 --> 52:23.848
No problems.

52:25.913 --> 52:30.107
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

52:30.308 --> 52:34.692
after the same pattern as I made Ganesha.

52:35.285 --> 52:40.028
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

52:40.640 --> 52:46.411
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

52:48.592 --> 52:53.085
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

52:53.286 --> 52:56.388
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

52:56.588 --> 53:00.608
He would never be upset, no question!

53:00.808 --> 53:02.246
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

53:02.447 --> 53:09.598
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

53:13.640 --> 53:19.270
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

53:21.741 --> 53:25.343
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

53:25.544 --> 53:28.775
problems and upset.

53:33.349 --> 53:37.119
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

53:37.320 --> 53:41.309
No problems, only solutions.

53:45.004 --> 53:48.520
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

53:48.720 --> 53:54.497
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

53:54.697 --> 54:00.551
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

54:04.007 --> 54:13.121
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

54:13.322 --> 54:18.512
is the greatest mantra that I use.

54:19.320 --> 54:23.986
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

54:24.186 --> 54:31.607
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

54:31.807 --> 54:37.825
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

54:38.025 --> 54:40.960
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

54:41.160 --> 54:45.499
behold it, accept it, understand.

54:45.699 --> 54:49.401
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

54:49.601 --> 54:52.715
that should exist between us.

54:53.432 --> 54:59.043
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

55:01.818 --> 55:04.616
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

55:04.817 --> 55:11.085
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

55:11.286 --> 55:15.002
must be given up for a change.

55:15.202 --> 55:23.008
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

55:23.209 --> 55:25.725
All these things must be given up.

55:25.925 --> 55:29.725
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

55:29.925 --> 55:34.278
He never had a holiday, never.

55:37.676 --> 55:40.848
This is holidaying.

55:44.318 --> 55:48.061
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

55:48.261 --> 55:52.370
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

55:52.571 --> 55:57.725
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

56:00.581 --> 56:01.775
So they must have brought it down,

56:01.975 --> 56:11.022
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

56:11.222 --> 56:18.649
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

56:18.849 --> 56:21.550
and jumping into ditches directly.

56:21.750 --> 56:26.174
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

56:26.374 --> 56:35.557
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

56:35.757 --> 56:42.530
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

56:42.730 --> 56:47.430
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

56:47.630 --> 56:50.367
Ask Him for wisdom.

56:50.568 --> 56:55.809
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

56:57.329 --> 57:01.794
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

57:01.995 --> 57:04.506
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

57:04.707 --> 57:10.045
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

57:10.246 --> 57:18.609
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

57:20.304 --> 57:25.716
That awe, that respect, that humility,

57:25.916 --> 57:31.467
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

57:31.668 --> 57:36.332
Is so close, but complete understanding.

57:39.871 --> 57:45.422
That oneness has to be developed.

57:45.622 --> 57:49.162
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

57:49.362 --> 57:52.947
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

57:53.147 --> 57:56.098
in the right direction.

57:57.278 --> 58:03.559
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

58:03.760 --> 58:05.342
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

58:05.543 --> 58:13.559
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

58:14.775 --> 58:17.754
is been blessed,

58:19.986 --> 58:24.611
think of all the nice things we have
done together

58:24.812 --> 58:29.530
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

58:29.731 --> 58:33.263
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

58:33.464 --> 58:39.707
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

58:39.941 --> 58:44.088
So Christ who is the present Christ,

58:44.973 --> 58:51.613
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

58:52.322 --> 58:57.468
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

58:57.669 --> 59:02.192
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

59:05.346 --> 59:11.105
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

59:11.306 --> 59:15.849
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

59:16.049 --> 59:24.278
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

59:25.513 --> 59:28.819
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

59:29.020 --> 59:34.462
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

59:34.662 --> 59:39.879
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

59:41.239 --> 59:44.020
He’s a collective being.

59:44.220 --> 59:52.567
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

59:57.127 --> 01:00:02.077
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

01:00:02.278 --> 01:00:07.457
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

01:00:07.657 --> 01:00:12.967
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

01:00:13.168 --> 01:00:17.406
to understand to give up all the strives,

01:00:17.606 --> 01:00:24.184
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:30.301
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:35.998
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

01:00:36.198 --> 01:00:40.903
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

01:00:41.668 --> 01:00:46.650
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.776
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

01:00:50.976 --> 01:01:00.114
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:10.631
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:20.559
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

01:01:24.679 --> 01:01:29.820
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.624
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:39.294
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

01:01:39.494 --> 01:01:43.639
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:49.309
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:54.215
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

01:01:54.416 --> 01:02:00.740
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:07.525
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

01:02:07.726 --> 01:02:10.723
May God bless you.

01:03:32.838 --> 01:03:34.535
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

01:03:34.735 --> 01:03:39.249
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:46.092
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

01:03:46.293 --> 01:03:50.791
all that is created, as peace.

01:03:51.634 --> 01:03:57.905
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.
