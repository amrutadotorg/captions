WEBVTT

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:15.290
Today, we have decided to have a Vishnumaya
Puja. In this context, one has to know who

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:27.419
is this Vishnumaya and what is Her – you
can call it mythological [Shri Mataji laughs

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.699
gently] – but a historical relationship.
I have told you that America is the country

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:43.169
of Shri Krishna and He’s Kubera, as well
as He’s Yama. Because He’s Kubera, people

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:49.819
have got their affluence, they are rich people,
they have money, more than anywhere else,

00:00:49.819 --> 00:01:04.249
but if you do not remember, that you have
to have balance, and that Shri Krishna’s

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:20.939
power is of Mahalakshmi. So Mahalakshmi Principle
is such that where seeking is important, Vishnu

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:30.740
Principle is there when Shri Lakshmi is His
power. After getting the Lakshmi up to a certain

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.150
point, then you jump into a new awareness
or a new sort of a seeking which is the seeking

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.980
of the spirit where the Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the central path.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.919
That far, of course, in America it started,
the Mahalakshmi Principle, but people did

00:01:53.919 --> 00:02:05.969
not know, they had no discretion to know which
way to go for their seeking and so many got

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:13.189
enamoured by false advertisements, by all
kinds of promises, claims and things and I

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:21.049
came here long time back at that moment where
I knew that the seeking now is showing results

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:28.559
and that all the people from all over the
world will try to come down here because there

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:39.059
was a market for them and their marketing
will start in such a manner that these people

00:02:39.059 --> 00:03:09.889
who are used to marketing will fall into it.
I came here, I think I was the first to arrive,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:16.079
I warned them, I told them names of the people
who will be doing all this kind of work. Also

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.310
I told them what were they in their last lives,
what kind of a thing they did, what kind of

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.310
work they did, what are their negatives powers
and how they tried to manipulate. But nobody

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.439
would listen to me. Because these people found
out that the weaknesses of Americans, if you

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:44.849
can pamper them, pamper their ego, and tell
them that this is something very important,

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:58.840
that you should do something – ah- that
is very superficial but something looks fantastic

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.080
as I told you that they said : you can fly
three feet height. And the Americans took

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.800
to it. All such absurd ideas, they took to
it because they thought it was something new,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.439
something different and they wouldn’t listen
to Me because I said I won’t take money.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:25.150
And they told Me very clearly that “Nobody
will understand you if you don’t take money.”

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.370
So I said how much will you pay Me which is
so invaluable? How much money are you going

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.950
to pay Me?” And they had no answer.
So those people who were still money-oriented,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.640
so the Mahalakshmi Principle was not in them
to understand that if you have to seek the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.409
truth, you cannot pay for it. They couldn’t
understand that and that is how they had to

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:56.420
go through all this circle of facing all kinds
of false gurus, all types, all superficial

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.499
things.
Ultimately now, I think, first year I feel

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:15.650
everything has come up very well, but one
of the chakras of this Vishuddhi is, as you

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:23.110
know, very important, is the Left Vishuddhi.
And the Left Vishuddhi is the centre, if it

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:31.280
is caught up, you get angina, you get spondylitis
and also you get lethargic organs. So this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:41.150
Left Vishuddhi has been a sort of a fashion
with the Western people, maybe because of

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.069
Christianity where you had to confess and
you have to say you’re a sinner and you’re

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.430
a born sinner, an original sinner all kinds
of things.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.990
So, as you are branded as sinner, you see,
you always felt guilty and that guilt was

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:04.569
built in, in the Left Vishuddhi. I think this
is one of the greatest drawbacks, even today,

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:13.879
that people in America feel extremely guilty
for very small things, because they have no

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:19.909
confidence in themselves. Firstly, they think
that “We are a very young nation. We had

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:27.560
no tradition – basically”. They may look
arrogant, they may look to be very show-offs,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.259
but basically inside, they feel that “We
have had no tradition. We are a very young

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:42.879
nation.” Like they think that the English
are too over sophisticated or the French are

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.330
very sophisticated and we are not, compared
to them. We are primitive.” This kind of

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:57.620
funny ideas they have. And because of this,
you see, they try to make up. To make it up,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:06.640
the path they followed ended up into all kinds
of things and it built up a very huge Left

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:18.020
Vishuddhi in them. That’s why Americans
are having so many problems of the Left Vishuddhi.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:26.150
First of all, this centre catches when you
do not want to face your mistakes. “I’ve

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.120
committed this mistake all right, I’ve committed
it, now I’m not going to do it, and why

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.770
I commit it and why it happened, just face
it.” They don’t want to. They will feel

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.990
guilty that we have done this or I’ll put
it here. [Shri Mataji puts Her hand on Her

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:45.250
left shoulder, close to the neck] Like, they
go on amassing, like very black clouds of

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:55.250
guilt.
Then this Vishnumaya, who is the thunder,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:06.870
we can call, who is the electrical charge,
which is liberated by the friction of these

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:18.750
black clouds, which actually is a catalyst
for rain. It’s a catalyst for rain. This

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:33.850
starts acting on such people, that is, they
suddenly get a shock. They become extremely

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:45.920
sensitive people. They get nervous and this
nervousness can make, makes them think “Why

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.190
are we nervous? What is the problem?” Like
the exposure of their guilt comes through

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.600
the Vishnumaya Power.
Now I have to tell you about also the origin

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.110
of Vishnumaya, which is very interesting.
Vishnumaya was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:10.130
who was born after Shri Krishna was born.
Actually She was not His own sister, but She

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:20.210
was a daughter of Nanda. And when Shri Krishna
was taken over and was put in the care of

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:28.440
Nand and Yeshoda they gave their own daughter
in His place and the father of Shri Krishna

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:36.960
brought it back [in the castle]. So when Kamsa
came – the uncle- you all know about the

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.960
story – to ask about the eighth child, they
said, “This is the child.” He said, “But

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:51.160
this’s not a man. This is a woman.” He
took the child in his hand and did like this

00:09:51.160 --> 00:10:01.690
and threw it in the sky. And there She went
and there She announced that : “Shri Krishna

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:12.160
is already incarnated, He is living and He
is your killer.” So She is the announcer.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.130
She is the announcer of the incarnations.
She is the announcer of something good that

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:34.650
is going to happen to you. Also She’s the
one who can burn things, which are not spiritually

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:42.510
all right.
At the time of Mahabharata, She was born as

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:54.040
Draupadi and this Draupadi was the sister
of Shri Rama and when, as you know in Mahabharata

00:10:54.040 --> 00:11:01.000
– all of you know the story of Mahabharata,
I need not tell that – Duryodhana tried

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.070
to take out Her clothes. Then She called for
Krishna. First She said, “Kri.” She had

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:14.370
put Her teeth like this [Shri Mataji holds
her own sari with her teeth]. Till She had

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:19.550
said, “Krish,” [the sari] it was there.
Because She was thinking if She said “shna,”

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:28.230
the thing will fall down and She ‘ll become
exposed. As soon as She said, “Krishna,”

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:35.760
the thing fell down and that’s the time
Shri Krishna came all the way from Dwarika

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.250
and Tulsida has here described it very well
in Hindi language : “Dwarika me Shabad gayo

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:49.510
[message went to Dwarika]”. In Dwarika,
there was a big – big noise, you can call

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:59.270
it or what I don’t know. “Shor bhayo,
shor bhayo bhare [caused comotion ; shora:

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:04.410
noise, bhare : to fill] – tremendous, what
you call the – thunder, you can call it,

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:11.280
because She was the one who’s responsible
for thunder. “Shor bhayo bhare, Shankha

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:18.650
(conch) Chakra (disc) Gada Padma (weapon)
Garuda le sidhare” With the shankar, with

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:27.700
Chakra, with Garuda, with Padma, all of them,
He came on the Garuda. With all His weapons,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:38.610
He came on a Garuda to help Her. He started
supplying the saris to Her and this Duryodhana

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:47.070
got absolutely – Dushansana did that – got
absolutely tired and he fell on the ground.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:54.590
So now here, Vishnumaya is the one who is
the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:13:03.130
but She exists in all the five elements as
shown that She married five Pandavas and that

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:20.850
this power of virginity in Her used to expose
people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:31.710
who were going to rule and destroy the dharma.
So She stood back and She is the one who said

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:37.760
that “You have to fight. You have to fight
for dharma, whatever may happen” and Krishna

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.560
always supported Her. So as a brother, Shri
Krishna supported Her, so the relationship

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:52.390
between brother and sister are very important
in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:58.140
because we have raki bandhan. You also have
what you call the bhaiya duj [Hindi; Bhau

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:04.460
bij in Marathi], where on Diwali day we tie
up a raki to the Brother. Now this raki is

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.340
nothing but the Vishnumaya’s power, which
protects the brother. Actually, there the

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:16.070
brother protected Her and now the sister’s
love protects the brother. So the relationship

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:22.310
between brother and sister is much more important
than any other relationship because it’s

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:30.410
so pure, it’s so protective, it’s so loving
and also it is of an equal age.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:37.570
For example, between the parents and the children,
cannot be that or say, between the grandparents

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:43.700
and the children can be quite imbalanced also.
But between the brother and sister they’re

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:50.520
of the same age group, same understanding
and this relationship is maintained by this

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:56.990
Vishnumaya.
We have a very good incident of that in India,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:04.520
which I must tell you, how this Rakhi Bandhan
or this relationship between brother and sister

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:11.210
is respected. I mean nobody will believe because
in these countries where there is no relationship

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:17.690
which is respected, we won’t understand.
But when Alexander the Great came to India,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:24.640
he conquered our country quite a lot. But
there was one king Poru, who defeated him

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:33.770
and put him in jail. Alexander had married
an Indian lady. So it was a day of this Rakhi

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:42.070
Purnima. She put one rakhi in one plate and
covered it up and sent it to this king Poru.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:47.180
So they said : “a rakhi has come.” So
the King said : “All right, tie up the rakhi.”

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:52.450
He didn’t know whose rakhi it was and it
was tied. He said, “Who’s rakhi it was?”

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.160
“It’s your sister’s.” “Who is my
sister?” “She is the wife of this King

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:04.680
Alexander.” “Oh, my God! How could I do
such a thing? He is my brother-in-law.”

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:13.210
He immediately went to the jail and prostrated
before him. He said, “I’m sorry. Whatever

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:20.519
I -”. This is the graciousness, you understand.
“How could I be – how could I be so stupid

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:27.109
as to arrest you?” Alexander was flabbergasted.
He couldn’t understand this reaction. He

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:36.619
said, “What’s this going on?” And he
said that “Now, I ask for your forgiveness

00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:42.649
and please come out.” With great pomp and
show, with ornaments for his sister and all

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:49.369
that, he sent the brother-in-law home. Now
this Alexander could not understand. He went

00:16:49.369 --> 00:16:55.060
in and his wife was smiling. He said, “What’s
the matter? How am I here?” She said, “Do

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.899
you know, I have saved you with one thread?”
She showed him a rakhi. “With this thread

00:17:00.899 --> 00:17:07.030
you saved me? How?” She said, “You know
what is today? Is a day when a sister can

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:14.639
tie this to a brother and the brother has
to do what sister wants. So I said I sent

00:17:14.639 --> 00:17:23.300
it to this Poru, the king, and he has released
you.” Alexander thought, “What sort people

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.430
these Indians are? On one thread they release
such an enemy like me. How can I rule this

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:33.160
people? They’ll put me out any time, so
symbolic they are.” He said, “All right,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:39.580
I am sorry.” He took one fellow called Bardai,
Chanda Bardai, took him down – he was a

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.960
poet with him, and he said, : “Now, you
write poetry because Indians are very subtle

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.950
people and I can’t understand how can they
release such a horrible enemy like me, only

00:17:49.950 --> 00:18:01.340
on a thread?” Such trust, such understanding
of a brother for a sister and the sister has

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:08.170
to keep the trust also.
So now when we go deeper into it and see for

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:19.119
ourselves, our Vishuddhi problems is this
that we always try, in the West, to feel guilty

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:29.160
and get out of our mistakes. For small, small
things feel guilty, people, because the norms

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.340
in the West – Western life are so rigid,
like if you put a spoon on the other side,

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:42.290
finished. I mean what does it matter? You
can take it on this side and eat it. If you

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:51.710
spill some coffee, then that guilt will last
all your life. After all coffee is to be spilt.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:58.660
[big laughs] If it is hot, it can happen,
some accident can take place. And the guilt

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:05.989
business is so great that nobody corrects
oneself, just go on feeling guilty, guilty,

00:19:05.989 --> 00:19:14.019
guilty, guilty. And all the subtleties of
life you start missing. In Sahaja Yoga, specially,

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:20.960
to feel guilty means all your left side is
caught up. You cannot feel the vibrations

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.430
properly because this is the cervical nerve
on which your guilt is sitting and it’s

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:33.249
just clamping it, you cannot feel the left
side. You start catching on the left side

00:19:33.249 --> 00:19:42.489
till you receive some sort of a horrible disease,
then you realize.

00:19:42.489 --> 00:19:52.509
The subtler part of this Vishnumaya is that
She knows the truth. When She shines you can

00:19:52.509 --> 00:20:03.170
see everything out of Her. Even for a short
time, She exposes in the darkness everything.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:12.749
In the same way, when Vishnumaya starts acting
on you, then She exposes the truth to you.

00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:22.210
But supposing you continue with your left
Vishuddhi too much, then She just disappears.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:29.070
She’s not there to correct you, to help
you in any way or to expose you. Then you

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:35.869
don’t feel anything. You become numb on
the left side, absolutely numb on the left

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:47.300
side and the left side is, know, is the indicator
of all kinds of left side diseases. This is

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:54.170
one of the reasons that we have the maximum
number of left-sided diseases in the West

00:20:54.170 --> 00:21:02.550
than in India. Indian diseases are from right
side while the left-sided diseases come from

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:11.960
this left Vishuddhi. So to feel guilty, itself
is wrong and is a mythical thing.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:21.160
Now you feel guilty for something. What’s
the use of feeling guilty? It’s just a myth.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:28.099
It’s an empty thing you are carrying upon
yourself. No use feeling guilty. If you think

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:33.859
you have done something wrong, just face it.
That I have done this wrong and I will not

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:39.280
do it again. But if you feel guilty, then
you see, it’s like a stored up stuff there

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.999
and then again you do the same mistake. Again
you do the same mistake and you become immune,

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:52.790
immune to your development. Then you start
not even feeling that it is wrong, you know.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:59.940
People do wrong things even without thinking
that it is wrong. Even that consciousness

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:06.729
or, you can say, that alertness is finished.
Then you think, “What’s wrong?” For

00:22:06.729 --> 00:22:13.050
anything, this is a very good answer, “What’s
wrong?” It’s like a drunkard, he starts

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:16.960
drinking. First he feels, “Oh, I should
not have done.” Then he starts little bit

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.849
more, then little bit more, little bit more.
Ultimately, he’ll say “What’s wrong?

00:22:21.849 --> 00:22:22.749
If I’m drinking is perfect.”

00:22:22.749 --> 00:22:32.589
Anything of that kind starts with left Vishuddhi
because we do not face the mistake. It’s

00:22:32.589 --> 00:22:40.729
not true that because your tradition has been
very short or anything, it’s only thing

00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:48.989
your attitude. Because it is Krishna’s place,
especially for Americans, it is very important

00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:54.499
to face their mistakes and to admit, “All
right, I have done this mistake and I’m

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:57.680
not going to do it.”

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:04.749
So because they do not want to admit, they
put up this arrogant behavior. I know underneath

00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:16.550
this arrogant there’s somebody who is very
guilty. They are, actually, here very collective,

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:25.849
also, very collective in the sense they will
be worried about Vietnam, Korea, everything.

00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:30.989
Anything happens in the world they are worried
about. They are, they are the ones who started

00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:37.499
UN and every sort of thing, you see. Everything
is there. But despite all that, this guilt

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:46.209
business makes them very insensitive, very
insensitive to things which are reality.

00:23:46.209 --> 00:23:54.889
Anything which is negative, they should face
that thing as negative that they don’t face.

00:23:54.889 --> 00:24:00.859
They will support a country which is despotic
despite the fact they are democratic country.

00:24:00.859 --> 00:24:07.700
All such things, not only in politics, but
also in day to day life. Then the whole thing

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:18.899
becomes such a lifestyle. It becomes a lifestyle.
The whole thing becomes collective. Nobody

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:24.690
ever can come and say that this is something
we are doing wrong and we should stop it.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:29.060
If somebody says that or they say he’s mad,
he’s no good.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:35.690
For Freud, I was telling you that Freud was
denounced by many people and people gave some

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:42.410
papers, everything happened, but nobody would
listen to them. And the same thing happened

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:49.739
with Sahaja Yoga also. They would not listen
to Me because they have developed a immunity

00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:59.800
against reality. In everything, whatever is
real they become immune to it. They do not

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:10.570
want to face it. ‘That’s too much, much
too much for me.’ With this kind of an attitude,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:17.080
they had to work out something else and in
that they have gone to the right side. With

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:23.089
that they have developed all kind of machinery,
science, all this, everything. But science

00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:30.790
is not conclusive. It cannot give you the
totality. It cannot give the reality.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:40.839
So this Vishnumaya shows Her strength. She
does lots of things by which people are frightened.

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:54.570
She can enter into any, any element. She can
permeate. Supposing She enters into a water

00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:04.139
element, She can create a typhoon. She can
create any kind of disasters. She can enter

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:15.519
into Mother Earth and She can create a earthquake.
She can do anything because She has a power

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:19.989
to enter into anything. You know that She
can enter into Mother Earth very easily. She

00:26:19.989 --> 00:26:26.040
can enter into water very easily and when
She gets into it, She becomes the catalyst.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:35.339
And all these problems that you are facing
today in America are because of left Vishuddhi,

00:26:35.339 --> 00:26:36.729
because of Vishnumaya.

00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:44.399
I’m happy today’s program has been arranged
for Vishnumaya because this is the power which

00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:54.229
you Sahaja Yogis should be able to harness
and should be able to worship so that She

00:26:54.229 --> 00:27:01.269
sees all of you there and She looks after
you and She maintains your life and looks

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:05.180
after you.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:18.379
Now the most difficult thing is to convince
people in America that money’s not everything.

00:27:18.379 --> 00:27:28.989
You may have any amount of money, you may
have any amount of so-called pleasures, everything,

00:27:28.989 --> 00:27:36.550
but still, you can never be satisfied and
you can never be at peace with yourself and

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:46.599
you cannot generate peace. Money cannot replace
reality. It’s just there.

00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:57.599
Now the problem is that people become so addicted
to this money that all value systems start

00:27:57.599 --> 00:28:13.570
going down. I was surprised I knew somebody
here who took his own sister for prostitution.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.889
So I said, “What’s this? What are you
doing?”

00:28:16.889 --> 00:28:20.420
“What’s wrong? We’ll get money.”

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:27.999
So whatever can get money, they indulge into.
So there’s no chastity which is the basics,

00:28:27.999 --> 00:28:39.379
which is the foundation of human beings. As
a result, when you insult this virginity of

00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:49.300
Vishnumaya, then the Maya – means the – Her
play is that you get AIDS, you get all kinds

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.989
of other diseases which are incurable and
which are what you can call as the secret

00:28:54.989 --> 00:29:09.259
diseases. Because She’s the virgin and because
She respects the virginity. And those who

00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:16.410
go against, not that virginity is meant only
for women, also meant for men, because everybody

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:23.170
has here left Vishuddhi. Here the idea is
that only the virginity is word used for women

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:32.019
only. It’s not. Even the men who do not
respect their virginity, their chastity are

00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:38.519
attacked by Vishnumaya in different ways.
I’m not surprised that Los Angeles, they

00:29:38.519 --> 00:29:45.709
say, is in danger all the time, because of
your cinemas you produce, all these things

00:29:45.709 --> 00:29:49.859
you produce.

00:29:49.859 --> 00:29:57.109
Of course, I mean now with the Sahaja Yoga
being established very well in Los Angeles,

00:29:57.109 --> 00:30:04.699
thing may be averted, but still it’s very
dangerous. It’s one of the most powerful

00:30:04.699 --> 00:30:19.099
Shakti is this of Vishnumaya because She plays
the illusion. She creates the Maya also. Also

00:30:19.099 --> 00:30:28.579
She breaks the Maya and She can burn anything.
Your forest is burning now. Sixty-five hectares

00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:38.540
of land is burning. Who has done this? Is
nothing but Vishnumaya. Nobody has to take

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:46.969
any matchbox for that. She can burn anything
and is Her burning gives you the feeling that

00:30:46.969 --> 00:30:57.449
if there’s an electrical charge, as if burnt
with electrical charge. This is very true

00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:04.739
in so many cases I’ve seen. Those who came
to Me with problems of left Vishuddhi, that

00:31:04.739 --> 00:31:09.170
they said that, “We think that there’s
some electrical charge coming out of here.”

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:19.290
As if it’s the burning of an electrical
shock. This is Vishnumaya’s doing and She’s

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:28.550
the one who is the corrector. She corrects.
Don’t feel guilty. Face your problems. It’s

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:39.899
sort of when we hide our mistakes in the name
of guilt, when we try to camouflage it, She’s

00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:52.940
the one who exposes it on individual level,
on collective level, on national level, international

00:31:52.940 --> 00:32:02.839
level. Because She can permeate into anything
and this permeation of Hers gives Her such

00:32:02.839 --> 00:32:16.329
subtleties. But people cannot relate disaster
to their mistakes. They cannot. They don’t

00:32:16.329 --> 00:32:23.019
understand why such a disaster has taken place,
what has happened.

00:32:23.019 --> 00:32:34.690
There was a big typhoon that came, came up
to a point and suddenly turned towards Kauai.

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:41.479
Now what was the reason for that, to go and
hit Kauai? In Kauai there is a Swayambu of

00:32:41.479 --> 00:32:49.790
Shiva, is a fact. People are making money
out of it, quite a lot of money and deceiving

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:59.259
people. There’s big business going on in
the name of Shiva. So Kauai was hit, not Hawaii

00:32:59.259 --> 00:33:05.979
so much as Kauai, and it turned suddenly,
no one can understand that.

00:33:05.979 --> 00:33:12.560
So all these thundering things that are coming
from nature, anything, whether it is earthquake

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:22.150
or it is landslide or it could be floods or
it could be typhoon, anything is the work

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:30.530
of this Vishnumaya or we can say all natural
catastrophes are brought about by this Vishnumaya.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:37.009
She has this power to do it. This is the only
way they can shock people, but despite all

00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:44.460
that shocking, people have to relate these
disasters so their mistakes that they have

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:50.610
committed and have nicely kept it here, not
facing it.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:57.530
I’ve heard from some Indian students that
when they came to America some boys asked

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:02.770
them to take drugs and do all other things
also. So they wouldn’t do. They said, “You

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:06.290
are goody-goodies,” this, that. You know,
they just pumped it into their head that,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:13.340
“You have to do it. You are cowards. You
cannot do it.” And all that. So some of

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.650
them said, “All right, we’ll try.” But
what surprised them that they knew it was

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.260
wrong while those who were telling them never
thought it was wrong. They thought they have

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:28.990
been great martyrs or they have been liberators
and they have got liberties. They couldn’t

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.410
understand this.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:39.530
This kind of liberty that they were boasting
of was so destructive. They’d never understood

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:47.900
that this is destructive. So once your left
Vishuddhi is absolutely jammed, you lose complete

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:57.320
discretion of the chakra here which we call
as Hamsa chakra and then you do not know what

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.680
is destructive, what is constructive. You
start accepting mostly the destructive thing

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:14.750
if your left Vishuddhi is bad. Escape. “So
what. What wrong?” That is how violence

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:24.680
has come. That is how all kind of cheating,
corruption has come. “What’s wrong?”

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.570
Because if you do anything wrong you put it
there. Finished. Stored up.. Again, you do

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:35.870
anything, you put it there and till you become
absolutely immune to all destructive action,

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.400
you go on doing.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:50.010
So to get out of it, what to do. To get out
of this horrible state where you do not feel

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:57.870
anything wrong, what is the thing is only
is to take to Sahaja Yoga in a right fashion.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:12.500
First of all, you must face yourself. If you
start facing yourself, you’ll realize that

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:20.130
you have committed a mistake. “So this is
the mistake I have committed. Doesn’t matter.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:25.670
I am not going to feel guilty about it. If
I ever have to do this, I will not do it and

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:30.510
I’m not guilty for whatever has happened.
Is the past. Finished.”

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:39.730
With this faith in yourself, you can definitely
get rid of your left Vishuddhi. The problem

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:47.110
is even if I tell you something, I am worried
that you start feeling guilty about it also.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:51.770
I mean, I am telling you for something for
your correction. Then you start guilty that,

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:57.920
“Oh, I – Mother is saying, so you see,
I did this and -” that you did. At this

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:05.780
moment what I am telling you, never to do
it again. And face it. Whatever you did is

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:15.580
finished and gone and is forgiven completely,
otherwise Vishnumaya will take over. This

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:25.920
is very important because one side is the
leela, it’s a play and it’s all the world

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:32.760
is beautiful. The another side is the guilt.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:38.750
So we think that by just feeling guilty, we
are solving all our problems and this side

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:44.730
we are enjoying ourselves and this, the guilt
part, is just like a storehouse of a garbage

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:53.020
we put there. But we never think this garbage
what it is wrong, it is doing to us. And this

00:37:53.020 --> 00:38:01.970
is what it is that Vishnumaya has to burn
this garbage, then She works in Her own ways,

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.240
in Her own Maya ways and so many things happen.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:12.690
Like there was a lady and she was very right-sided.
She used to dominate everyone, but nobody

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:18.000
dared tell her that because, if you tell her,
she would come back on you. So nobody wanted

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.130
to tell her what’s wrong with her. They
said, “All right. Let it be.” But I told

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:27.100
her, “That you see you are very right-sided.
You are dominating everyone. Everybody’s

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.040
frightened of you.” So she said, “No,
Mother, I’m not.” I said, “All right

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:38.640
I’m telling you. You better believe Me or
really you are in for trouble.” And that

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:45.050
very day she was getting down from the staircase
and she fell from top to bottom she did and

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:50.460
all her right side. She came to Me, “Mother,
you see.” Her right hand is broken. “My

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:57.470
right leg is broken. This is broken. That
is broken.” I said, “Then you know what

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:04.640
happened.” “I now know why it has happened.”
Then I cured her. She was all right. But what

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:11.350
I am trying to tell you that she wouldn’t
listen to Me. So the right-sided people have

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:20.270
a special capacity to put everything here.
So I always say that it is the by-product

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:33.240
of ego. Those people who try to dominate,
who try to be angry, try to control everyone,

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:44.000
they put it down there and then the whole
thing works against them. This is to be understood

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.260
in a very serious manner, that feeling guilty
is not that you are harming yourself, but

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.750
you are harming all others.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:40:04.140
Also this Vishnumaya gets very upset with
two other things. One of the things is smoking.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:13.130
If you smoke too much, then this Vishnumaya
gets very angry. She is the one who then causes

00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:22.060
cancer. She can spoil your throat. I mean,
all kinds of ear, nose, throat problems can

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:31.320
come in with the smoking because She doesn’t
like that smoke. She – once, twice, thrice

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:38.240
– but once you start smoking and after some
time, “Oh, what’s wrong?” They will

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:44.990
quote such and such man who is eighty-three,
he still smokes. See, quoting like this, they

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:51.010
have ideals like this. Then you have also
some cinema heroes. “Such and such man,

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:58.370
see, he murdered his wife. He’s not – see,
he’s going along.” So we should also murder.

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:03.660
We should also smoke. So the all ideals which
have destroyed themselves become our ideals

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:12.170
and we start exactly doing what they are doing
without knowing that how they are destroyed,

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.310
we’ll be also destroyed.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:26.430
So this understanding about Vishnumaya’s
powers should be there with us. That if we

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:39.080
try to continue with our mistakes and putting
them here, then first thing we become vulnerable

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:48.910
to all kinds of diseases. With that if you
are smoking, you can become also very much

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:58.850
vulnerable to cancer of the throat. Another
thing which people do not know is the mantras.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:04.700
If you go on saying any mantra – I mean
in India there are people who will every day,

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:12.820
morning get up and say some mantra for about,
say, hundred times, some say it at least three

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:18.250
hundred times, five hundred times. They go
on measuring, mantra, mantra, mantra, mantra,

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:26.490
like that. Now She’s the mantrika. She’s
the one who gives the power to the mantra.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:35.060
Now if you are not connected to this Divine
Power, then there’s a short-circuiting takes

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:40.390
place and if you go on saying this mantra,
you develop all the troubles of the throat,

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:46.610
throat cancer. You can develop also stomach,
in the stomach, problems because it is Krishna

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:56.210
and Vishnu are the same. You might develop
also the problem of Virata. Because you are

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:04.800
reciting a mantra like this, you see – a
telephone, if it is not connected, I go on

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.790
using it, the telephone will go out of order.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:17.330
In the same way, if you are doing wrong mantras
in the sense that the mantras which are said

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:24.560
before you have connection with the Divine,
then they can spoil your left Vishuddhi, like

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:33.230
this. This is the style they use in India.
Supposing you are a business man in India.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:38.250
Now a big business man, you have made a lot
of money, now you feel guilty about it because

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:44.540
you have made by bad means, also by all kinds
of black-market and all that sort of things.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:54.020
So they’ll make a big temple of Vishnu,
not Vishuddhi but they’ll make a very big

00:43:54.020 --> 00:44:01.920
temple of Shri Vishnu and they will create
a kind of image that they are great religious

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.780
people. Or they’ll have khairat, means they
will distribute food to people or distribute

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:15.020
some things to people and feel satisfied.
Here you go on committing any amount of sins,

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:25.340
any amount of nonsense and then out of that
money you make a little contribution to Shri

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:31.800
Vishnu thinking that Shri Vishnu will be very
happy and will not punish them. But He’s

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.990
Kubera, what can you give it to Him. He’s
the Kubera. He gives you all the money. He

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:47.310
does everything. So how can you give anything
to Kubera who is Himself the Lord of wealth.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:53.370
It’s a very common thing in India, like
there was a bhudan [donating land] thing.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:45:00.050
I knew of a man who was very corrupt, very
bad person, I mean really, he was really very,

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:05.460
very bad man and he had taken away so much
land from the poor farmers and all that. So

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:14.630
he gave one land to Mahatma Gandhi and this
land, this bhudan land was no good, it was,

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:21.630
you know, I think why he gave. This land was
so bad that you could not put even cactus

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:30.290
there and he was telling everybody, “I have
given so much land to bhudan. I have given

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:34.960
so much land to bhudan.” So trying to sort
of justify himself for taking all the land

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:43.100
from the poor and flinching them and then
to do this kind of a generosity.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:52.160
So this is another escape people have, that
do what you like and ultimately be generous.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:46:02.550
This kind of gracious covering of your mistakes
can be very misleading. It doesn’t work

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:09.100
with Vishnumaya. She knows you out and out
and if you try all these tricks with Her,

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:16.740
She will show Her own powers. I would say
all our left side problems come because of

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:26.640
Vishnumaya power. She punishes you, as well
as She exposes, as well as She gives you light,

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.250
as well as She corrects you.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:40.760
With all these powers of Vishnumaya, we should
be very thankful that today we are celebrating

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:47.100
Her special puja because I think it is one
of the curses of the West, especially of Americans

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.280
to feel guilty.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:56.010
So today you all have to promise in your heart
that the mantra is – now She also understands

00:46:56.010 --> 00:47:02.990
English perhaps – you can say that, “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.” That’s all. If

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:07.030
that is said, She will be very happy. “I’m
not guilty at all. I’m not going to feel

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:13.310
guilty.” Once you stop feeling guilty you
will not do wrong things because how will

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:18.120
you manage. Because you are not doing, you
cannot put it as guilt, so what’s the use

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.850
of doing anything wrong. If you do wrong,
it comes on your head, you cannot put it in

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:30.630
your left Vishuddhi, so you won’t do anything
wrong. You will immediately understand that

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:35.890
if I have to do wrong, I have to face it.
But if there’s a space here, kept where

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:43.620
you can put your guilt for your wrong doings
available, then you don’t mind so much.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:47.360
Supposing somebody has a small house, no place
to store, then somebody brings something.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:56.980
Says, “No, no, no, no space here. I am all
ready very full.” It’s like that.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:03.850
So the best thing is to have no guilt at any
cost. I will have no guilt. If I have done

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:09.680
mistake, all right I’ll admit I have done
the mistake and I’ll have no guilt at all

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.730
about it. I’ll face it. You’ll be surprised.
You’ll stop doing wrong things. Definitely

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:19.160
you’ll stop because there’s no space left.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:27.790
So this is very important today to do Vishnumaya’s
thing and I am sure now very happy with the

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:33.780
tour of America. This time I’m really happy
because I think it has worked in most of the

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:41.670
places very well, and if it has not worked,
one should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:49.900
why it has not worked and the problem lies
with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. You shouldn’t

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:57.110
blame anybody else for it. Just see yourself,
what mistakes you must have committed. Could

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:04.320
be a small or big mistake. Whatever it is,
face it. There’s no harm in saying, “I

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:10.560
have done mistake.” But if you say, “Sorry,”
means it goes there, straight off. No, “I

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:19.420
have committed a mistake.” To admit that
is very gracious, very beautiful and very

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.500
kind to yourself for your benevolence.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:28.590
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras
for all the Western people. They should all

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:36.970
the time say to all the trees, all the nature
around, “I am not guilty”. Your ecological

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:45.020
problem will improve because then you won’t
do wrong things to spoil your ecology. You’ll

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:49.410
be careful because you spoil it and you’ll
feel guilty, “Oh, I should not have done

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:54.710
this. Oh, I should not.” But why did you
do in the first place is the point. So now,

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.820
next time you are not going to do it.

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:05.090
So many of our problems will be solved if
you face them and correct them boldly. It’s

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:10.480
possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are
separated from your being, you’re away from

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:16.300
it. You can see your body, you can see your
mind, you can see your ego, you can see all

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:22.790
of those things and you know how to put them
right. You are not that, you know, so you

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:29.970
are the spirit and with the light of the spirit
you can correct all these things. But this

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:36.450
guilt is something where it stops you completely
from correcting or doing anything better about

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:42.200
it or bringing any constructive thing to your
own mind.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:51.200
This will solve many problems for America,
as well as for all the Western world. Same

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:57.130
with the Indians, that they should not think
that if they are generous a little bit they

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.460
can get rid of their mistakes. See, they have
to face it. It’s a different style. Indians

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:09.760
are very clever, you know, they know how to
find excuses and escapes. But after all, it

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:17.030
is Vishnumaya. She will show you that there
is no escape, just face it. There’s no need

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:24.610
to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way,
degrade yourself or to feel inferior, but

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:30.220
to be superior as the spirit, I see. Like
I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.820
you very well now, you did this.” Separate
yourself from yourself. You can talk on the

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:43.030
mirror. You can go to the river and talk there
or you can go to an ocean and tell them that,

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:48.750
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m
not going to do it.” You can make promises

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.580
to all of these elements.

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:57.400
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya
will receive the message and She won’t enter

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.040
into any one of these elements to disturb
you. So you have to go and tell the ocean

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:09.810
that, “All right, America is not guilty
for whatever they have done.” Say like that.

00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:15.070
If you say is all right, not other people
because I told your genetics are changed.

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:21.930
You are different people. Whatever you say,
Vishnumaya will always believe in and everything

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.470
will work out very well.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:30.850
But this is a special time, as I told you
before where we call it is the Krita Yuga,

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:36.720
where between the Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga
this time is so important that whatever mistakes

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:41.100
we have committed, we have to pay for it.
Is a karmaphala [consequences of past deeds].

00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:45.330
It won’t work out by just putting it here.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:54.000
So one has to get to realization, change the
genetics completely and then you can go and

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.310
tell the nature that, “All right, we are
not guilty now. We have got our realization.”

00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:05.750
And it will work, I am sure. So many of catastrophes
of this country can be avoided by you Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.910
May God bless you!
