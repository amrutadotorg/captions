00:00.000 --> 00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

00:03.880 --> 00:07.540
Today we have assembled here

00:09.750 --> 00:12.880
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:17.460 --> 00:22.920
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:29.840 --> 00:36.670
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.710
And though' he is

00:41.960 --> 00:48.040
such a young, little boy,

00:51.040 --> 00:55.630
he can fight the whole world,

00:58.790 --> 01:04.790
he can destroy all the negativity.

01:06.790 --> 01:11.040
That's the sign of innocence.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.000
There have been stories

01:18.790 --> 01:22.040
that children who have fallen from a very great height

01:23.840 --> 01:27.040
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

01:30.460 --> 01:36.880
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

01:39.750 --> 01:42.880
that it doesn't harm anyone

01:44.710 --> 01:47.500
who is not to be harmed.

01:50.630 --> 01:53.340
It has all the wisdom of the world,

01:54.540 --> 01:56.920
all the understanding of the world;

01:58.630 --> 02:05.540
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

02:06.750 --> 02:10.420
the world, the whole world –

02:11.540 --> 02:17.420
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

02:17.880 --> 02:20.540
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

02:21.040 --> 02:25.880
but they all stand, stand up against

02:26.590 --> 02:32.540
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

02:36.420 --> 02:40.750
You can see in your own lives

02:41.710 --> 02:46.750
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

02:48.000 --> 02:51.670
all of the them, whatever they are,

02:52.500 --> 02:54.540
whatever they are coming from,

02:55.040 --> 02:57.750
whatever maybe their nationality,

02:58.420 --> 03:02.670
they all jump, all jump to control

03:03.710 --> 03:05.880
and to safeguard that child.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.420
What is it?

03:10.790 --> 03:16.000
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

03:17.920 --> 03:21.590
to protect the innocence?

03:23.960 --> 03:28.500
It's really a shame,

03:29.040 --> 03:31.420
a great shame for us,

03:32.340 --> 03:37.500
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

03:39.710 --> 03:45.000
Anything else can be tolerated.

03:45.880 --> 03:50.040
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

03:51.040 --> 03:56.750
those who have no malice,

03:58.540 --> 04:05.460
who are living like little children, I should say,

04:07.380 --> 04:09.750
if they are attacked by anyone –

04:13.710 --> 04:18.040
not that the whole world reacts to that –

04:20.750 --> 04:27.630
but everyone of them cannot bear

04:29.460 --> 04:34.840
any innocent person or 'innocent being' being harmed.

04:37.340 --> 04:41.040
We don't realise that within us

04:44.040 --> 04:48.750
there is the ocean of love

04:50.590 --> 04:55.630
and ocean of understanding for children.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.840
Why? Why should it be?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.460
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.040
Especially for innocence?

05:10.000 --> 05:15.540
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

05:16.750 --> 05:19.000
innocent children, there are.

05:19.960 --> 05:24.710
But no-one wants to support them.

05:26.790 --> 05:32.710
No-one thinks that it's proper to ill-treat children.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.880
And those who have done this have to suffer.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.460
They all suffer as a reaction.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.790
What is it within us

05:46.040 --> 05:49.630
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

05:50.670 --> 05:53.920
against innocence?

05:54.750 --> 05:57.590
For example if there is a regular war,

05:58.540 --> 06:00.590
and if there are people fighting;

06:01.380 --> 06:06.460
in a regular war, they don't have much sympathy.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.710
In the world also, they say “Alright,

06:11.380 --> 06:15.040
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

06:15.670 --> 06:21.750
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.040
That's what human beings have.

06:26.790 --> 06:32.710
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

06:34.630 --> 06:38.710
which gives you that feeling,

06:40.420 --> 06:45.380
that capacity, that understanding

06:46.670 --> 06:51.040
that you have to protect innocent,

06:52.040 --> 06:56.670
innocent children, innocent people.

06:57.500 --> 07:02.460
And the whole world can rise against all such people

07:02.710 --> 07:05.790
who are trying to kill the innocent.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.420
There cannot be any doubt.

07:13.540 --> 07:18.750
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

07:19.420 --> 07:21.590
or criticise such a thing,

07:22.000 --> 07:25.790
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

07:28.540 --> 07:36.040
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
and can give up anything,

07:41.710 --> 07:45.460
but they cannot give up the feeling

07:46.040 --> 07:48.340
they have for innocence.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.670
It's very remarkable. We don't realise

07:54.420 --> 08:00.420
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

08:00.960 --> 08:02.920
for the innocent.

08:06.790 --> 08:10.840
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

08:11.790 --> 08:17.920
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.000
That's the beauty of human beings.

08:23.880 --> 08:28.000
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

08:28.540 --> 08:32.460
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
But when it comes to children,

08:37.750 --> 08:39.880
and to innocent people,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.500
everyone feels his responsibility.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.880
It's difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

08:55.340 --> 09:03.000
because they have a kind of an understanding

09:05.630 --> 09:08.920
that they are something great,

09:09.840 --> 09:14.840
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

09:15.590 --> 09:19.420
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

09:19.790 --> 09:24.000
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

09:25.420 --> 09:28.420
and they can give explanation for that, doesn't matter –

09:28.840 --> 09:34.920
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

09:35.840 --> 09:39.710
and they can never be honoured

09:40.460 --> 09:41.920
for the thing they are doing.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.540
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

09:45.880 --> 09:50.710
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.710
You might feel a little bit cheated,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.630
you might feel a little bit dominated,

09:57.920 --> 10:00.540
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

10:00.790 --> 10:04.960
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

10:05.790 --> 10:08.960
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

10:10.630 --> 10:12.920
They should not feel dejected

10:13.920 --> 10:18.500
if they are being used, insulted,

10:18.880 --> 10:22.790
tortured, dominated, it's alright.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.710
They should not try to destroy

10:27.960 --> 10:32.750
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

10:34.380 --> 10:38.500
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

10:38.960 --> 10:43.880
that when innocence is challenged,

10:45.590 --> 10:50.710
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

10:52.420 --> 10:59.040
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.500
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

11:05.340 --> 11:09.920
– have been tortured,have been killed.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.960
At that time, all over the world,

11:17.420 --> 11:20.880
it's a big support for them.

11:22.380 --> 11:28.460
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

11:29.380 --> 11:33.920
is anxious to look after

11:34.960 --> 11:38.790
those who have done this crime.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.750
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

11:43.040 --> 11:45.840
they may not be belonging to the same country,

11:46.590 --> 11:50.000
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

11:50.790 --> 11:56.750
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

11:57.590 --> 12:02.880
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

12:04.380 --> 12:07.540
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

12:07.750 --> 12:11.380
that 'you cannot attack innocent people'.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.340
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

12:15.750 --> 12:20.460
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

12:21.790 --> 12:25.420
We should not, in no way punish them.

12:27.340 --> 12:32.000
Our main achievement

12:32.790 --> 12:37.790
should be that loving attention for children.

12:38.540 --> 12:42.840
All over the world, whether he belongs

12:43.040 --> 12:46.670
to your family or to some other family,

12:46.960 --> 12:49.420
or has some sort of

12:54.040 --> 12:58.380
detached attention with you,

12:59.420 --> 13:03.960
still because he's a child, he's innocent,

13:05.000 --> 13:10.920
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.040
will try to protect.

13:15.380 --> 13:22.040
It's very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

13:22.840 --> 13:29.920
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.750
Children should never be attacked.

13:35.710 --> 13:38.670
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

13:39.540 --> 13:43.460
But you shouldn't waste your energy on something

13:43.630 --> 13:48.750
that is extremely inauspicious,

13:49.590 --> 13:55.840
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

13:58.790 --> 14:03.540
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

14:04.590 --> 14:09.000
I have not come across anyone so far who says

14:09.500 --> 14:11.750
that they don't love children – luckily!

14:12.590 --> 14:18.040
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

14:18.710 --> 14:22.750
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.670
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.920
You love nature – why?

14:30.380 --> 14:32.630
Because it is innocent.

14:33.040 --> 14:38.840
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

14:39.460 --> 14:42.920
who are Sahaja Yogis.

14:47.540 --> 14:51.000
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

14:51.670 --> 14:55.590
It's very easy to be clever.

14:57.670 --> 15:01.420
But to be wise, one should understand

15:01.960 --> 15:04.630
the beauty of being innocent.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.920
Possibly one may say “Mother,

15:08.040 --> 15:10.960
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.710
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

15:16.590 --> 15:18.500
They may believe that they have done this,

15:18.630 --> 15:22.420
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

15:23.790 --> 15:27.000
It is like a rock.

15:28.380 --> 15:33.840
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

15:34.040 --> 15:38.790
any ocean of anger

15:39.750 --> 15:44.920
or any kind of revenge.

15:46.880 --> 15:51.750
It's the rock that is being looked after

15:52.590 --> 15:55.880
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.880
I've told you before also,

16:00.380 --> 16:04.750
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

16:05.630 --> 16:08.840
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

16:10.460 --> 16:14.040
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

16:15.380 --> 16:18.960
but it does not get,

16:19.710 --> 16:21.790
it cannot get it.

16:25.590 --> 16:28.540
After innocence.

16:29.710 --> 16:35.790
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

16:38.340 --> 16:42.880
We play with our innocence very much.

16:43.880 --> 16:48.590
We think that by behaving any way we like,

16:49.420 --> 16:53.960
“It's alright, after all it's my own desire, my wish”.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.670
And we'll go on, we go on all the time

17:01.750 --> 17:05.750
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

17:06.380 --> 17:10.710
or covering our power of innocence.

17:11.590 --> 17:15.460
And we think that we have done a great job,

17:16.380 --> 17:22.630
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.710
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.880
It is not self-sufficient.

17:32.840 --> 17:38.340
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

17:39.880 --> 17:47.710
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

17:48.670 --> 17:50.960
which is the greatest faith,

17:51.960 --> 17:54.750
the greatest help

17:55.040 --> 17:59.420
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

17:59.790 --> 18:04.540
Those people who do not respect their innocence

18:05.040 --> 18:08.000
because they think it makes you weak,

18:10.380 --> 18:13.420
have not seen the power of innocence –

18:14.000 --> 18:16.670
how it works, how it acts.

18:17.340 --> 18:22.960
From all over the world, it reacts.

18:24.840 --> 18:31.840
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

18:32.630 --> 18:34.670
power of innocence.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.590
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.840
And it acts

18:45.040 --> 18:49.960
as if the whole understanding,

18:52.630 --> 18:58.420
whole working-out of the be-ing

18:59.840 --> 19:02.670
is so beautifully achieved.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.880
Now you see in this world

19:07.590 --> 19:13.590
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

19:15.840 --> 19:20.670
It is respected the high ideals.

19:22.040 --> 19:29.670
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

19:29.960 --> 19:37.590
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.460
of very good nature'

19:41.420 --> 19:46.840
– all these people may have been harmed

19:47.460 --> 19:49.540
may have been killed –

19:49.790 --> 19:53.670
but because of their innocence they shine,

19:53.920 --> 19:56.590
and shine through ages.

19:57.790 --> 20:03.340
You can see the life of all great men like that;

20:03.880 --> 20:09.500
they are all very simple,

20:11.380 --> 20:16.710
they are not deliberating anything –

20:17.840 --> 20:24.750
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.000
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

20:32.630 --> 20:36.420
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.420
Have faith in that.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.790
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

20:42.460 --> 20:45.960
and that 'yourself' is nothing but innocence.

20:47.460 --> 20:51.420
You may say that 'innocent people get cheated'.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.630
Nobody can cheat innocence,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.710
because that is something of very eternal value.

21:00.590 --> 21:03.540
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

21:03.880 --> 21:08.500
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.460
And you will be the most successful person

21:13.710 --> 21:18.630
in life when you are absolutely innocent

21:18.880 --> 21:21.630
and your are looking after your innocence.

21:22.420 --> 21:26.460
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

21:26.710 --> 21:30.420
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

21:30.630 --> 21:34.540
by ill-doing, it might be covered for the time being.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.790
But if you can take out the clouds

21:38.460 --> 21:42.750
away from the sky of innocence,

21:43.040 --> 21:46.500
the whole thing becomes so obvious

21:46.710 --> 21:49.630
that you have won the whole world.

21:50.500 --> 21:54.460
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

21:54.840 --> 21:58.380
he was insulted, he was tortured.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.540
Those who did this, where are they?

22:02.710 --> 22:06.630
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.460
Nobody is even bothered about them.

22:09.790 --> 22:13.670
A single one person was so much used

22:13.960 --> 22:15.790
and was so much tortured.

22:16.040 --> 22:21.460
But despite that, what has happened?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.540
He has got the respect from the whole world.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.880
The whole world respects.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.380
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

22:35.750 --> 22:38.000
what has he done …' Nothing of the kind.

22:39.590 --> 22:44.630
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

22:44.880 --> 22:50.540
the essence of complete innocence.

22:52.460 --> 23:00.420
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

23:01.590 --> 23:07.460
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

23:09.040 --> 23:16.380
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

23:17.460 --> 23:20.540
and we don't want to even remember that, we don't want to even

23:20.920 --> 23:23.750
consider that it's a wrong thing to do,

23:25.460 --> 23:29.790
we do not know what is ahead of us.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.420
What happened to Hitler also?

23:33.420 --> 23:36.540
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

23:36.750 --> 23:40.340
he can manage to kill so many people

23:40.540 --> 23:45.420
and still he will remain a very great personality.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.920
They are stupid not to understand

23:48.540 --> 23:50.920
who are the people really respected.

23:51.750 --> 23:56.960
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.380
He didn't understand if you wanted to have

24:00.590 --> 24:03.000
really the power over the world,

24:03.540 --> 24:07.460
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

24:07.670 --> 24:10.040
he should have followed the great people.

24:10.790 --> 24:14.590
And the great people are those who are innocent.

24:15.710 --> 24:20.630
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.840
I don't know how to say that this power acts,

24:27.460 --> 24:29.590
because it acts in so many ways.

24:30.380 --> 24:35.960
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

24:36.590 --> 24:41.420
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

24:41.630 --> 24:46.000
simple and wise

24:48.670 --> 24:53.420
is remembered all your life.

24:54.040 --> 24:58.000
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

24:59.590 --> 25:01.750
I used to go to the library

25:03.000 --> 25:07.790
and read about the lives of great men

25:08.590 --> 25:13.880
who have created some great things for us.

25:14.540 --> 25:16.420
So many of them.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.460
And I was so impressed

25:20.420 --> 25:26.790
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

25:28.380 --> 25:31.710
For example Abraham Lincoln

25:33.000 --> 25:36.920
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

25:38.380 --> 25:40.880
was a man tortured by his wife also.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.500
She said “You don't know, you are very clumsy,

25:44.710 --> 25:50.340
you don't know how to dress up, you don't know how to behave”.

25:52.750 --> 26:00.040
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

26:01.540 --> 26:04.630
Ultimately he was also killed.

26:05.500 --> 26:10.040
So one can say, “You see, what's the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

26:12.710 --> 26:17.920
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

26:19.880 --> 26:22.630
Until today, all over the world,

26:22.880 --> 26:26.590
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.670
They don't know his wife – maybe.

26:36.500 --> 26:40.340
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

26:41.630 --> 26:46.000
Clumsy man, according to her,

26:47.960 --> 26:51.500
and all sorts of degradation for him.

26:52.710 --> 26:58.340
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.710
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

27:05.500 --> 27:10.460
Why? 'Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

27:10.630 --> 27:14.710
that shows that he had no strength to survive' –

27:15.920 --> 27:19.040
but he survived through ages!

27:21.500 --> 27:25.960
So many years have passed, still he's surviving.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.540
Take the case of all the great people

27:31.840 --> 27:34.340
who have been innocent;

27:34.920 --> 27:37.380
and that's why they had ideals.

27:38.340 --> 27:41.630
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

27:41.960 --> 27:45.670
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.840
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

27:50.000 --> 27:52.460
comes only from your innocence.

27:52.750 --> 27:57.670
That's the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

27:58.790 --> 28:00.840
how you should exist;

28:01.790 --> 28:05.040
what kind of a life you should lead.

28:05.960 --> 28:12.630
It is not important that you have big authorities,

28:12.840 --> 28:19.590
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

28:20.340 --> 28:22.840
There have been so many who came and died.

28:24.420 --> 28:27.420
They had so many people with ambitions

28:28.380 --> 28:33.380
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

28:33.920 --> 28:37.420
Nobody's bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

28:39.710 --> 28:43.500
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

28:43.670 --> 28:45.500
'No, no, we don't want to see this man'.

28:46.590 --> 28:50.420
But if there's a little boy, innocent child,

28:50.710 --> 28:53.960
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.460
the whole world admires that child.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.880
And these great men are, really,

29:02.420 --> 29:05.880
they are the symbols of that innocence.

29:06.790 --> 29:12.420
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

29:13.380 --> 29:16.840
Ganesha's main quality is his wisdom.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.880
He knew what was success, through his,

29:24.960 --> 29:27.790
I should say, innocent qualities.

29:28.670 --> 29:32.340
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

29:32.670 --> 29:34.750
quality of innocence.

29:35.840 --> 29:42.040
It's very surprising how the quality of innocence

29:42.500 --> 29:46.540
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

29:47.040 --> 29:49.590
who may be very

29:55.960 --> 30:02.040
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

30:03.380 --> 30:06.040
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

30:06.630 --> 30:13.000
they are innocent! That's were ends all the glory of human beings.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.630
To be innocent –

30:17.540 --> 30:18.670
What's the matter?

30:24.420 --> 30:28.540
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

30:28.880 --> 30:34.590
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

30:35.710 --> 30:43.590
Firstly, you can see for yourself

30:44.710 --> 30:46.540
how your mind works.

30:50.420 --> 30:54.460
What does it do? How it reacts.

30:55.670 --> 30:59.420
This is what one has to watch,

30:59.750 --> 31:02.000
which I call as 'introspection'.

31:03.960 --> 31:09.500
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

31:10.380 --> 31:16.000
What does it think is the best?

31:16.920 --> 31:19.710
In that thinking, thought process,

31:20.840 --> 31:28.340
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

31:31.040 --> 31:35.460
The first and the foremost is that

31:36.540 --> 31:39.380
you should know how you react to someone.

31:41.590 --> 31:47.420
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

31:49.670 --> 31:52.040
It is very easy to see yourself,

31:52.590 --> 31:54.710
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

31:55.670 --> 31:59.920
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

32:01.040 --> 32:07.750
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

32:09.790 --> 32:13.960
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

32:15.500 --> 32:17.500
What is your behaviour?

32:18.880 --> 32:23.960
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

32:24.750 --> 32:29.500
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

32:29.750 --> 32:32.340
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.790
Absolutely stupid.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.590
And when they are doing stupid things,

32:38.710 --> 32:40.630
why should we bother about them?

32:40.960 --> 32:43.750
Why should we waste our energy about them?

32:44.840 --> 32:51.670
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

32:52.710 --> 32:58.340
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

32:58.790 --> 33:01.380
they are treated with contempt.

33:01.750 --> 33:04.040
People don't even want to take their names,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.670
they don't want to have their photographs,

33:08.590 --> 33:11.790
they don't want to have anything to do with them.

33:13.380 --> 33:16.630
At this time, at such a juncture,

33:17.710 --> 33:21.750
what happens is the people who are crooks,

33:22.540 --> 33:29.540
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

33:30.630 --> 33:34.960
they start following them because it suits them better.

33:35.460 --> 33:39.960
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

33:40.960 --> 33:43.710
and that's how a new group is formed –

33:44.040 --> 33:46.960
which we can call 'a satanic group'.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.040
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

33:52.460 --> 33:56.380
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

33:57.420 --> 33:59.040
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

34:00.630 --> 34:04.460
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

34:05.000 --> 34:08.380
'It cannot be killed by any weapon'.

34:09.460 --> 34:14.500
Nainam dahanti pavaka – 'No fire can burn it'.

34:15.380 --> 34:19.630
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

34:20.000 --> 34:25.540
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

34:25.960 --> 34:28.380
'Wind cannot also suck it',

34:28.750 --> 34:33.630
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

34:35.420 --> 34:39.500
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.920
I told you, nature is innocent.

34:42.790 --> 34:46.630
It understands and it acts

34:47.420 --> 34:53.420
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

34:53.960 --> 35:01.000
who is trying to malign

35:01.590 --> 35:04.380
or trouble an innocent person.

35:06.960 --> 35:12.670
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.710
I know sometimes one feels

35:15.960 --> 35:18.380
that you are dominated because of that.

35:19.420 --> 35:24.920
Sometimes one feels sad that  'Why you are put to this kind

35:25.420 --> 35:27.460
of a treatment by others'.

35:27.790 --> 35:30.420
All kinds of things come to your mind.

35:30.880 --> 35:33.590
But if you worship your innocence,

35:33.840 --> 35:37.880
then you will be always a happy person,

35:38.710 --> 35:43.380
always a kind person, always be humble person.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.920
So, one has to be careful.

35:47.420 --> 35:49.040
You are your own destroyer!

35:49.710 --> 35:51.880
You are the one who kills, you see

35:52.460 --> 35:54.040
What do you say to it?

35:54.500 --> 35:57.040
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

35:57.460 --> 36:00.790
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

36:01.340 --> 36:04.790
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.380
So, you kill yourself –

36:08.920 --> 36:12.460
through this you can save yourself

36:12.880 --> 36:17.460
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

36:17.790 --> 36:20.670
Have faith in the power of innocence.

36:21.670 --> 36:27.460
What is important is, how you show in your own life

36:28.040 --> 36:33.040
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

36:33.540 --> 36:37.040
and that is what is what, is what I call 'the love'.

36:38.590 --> 36:41.500
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

36:42.380 --> 36:44.630
you have this attitude towards yourself.

36:45.630 --> 36:48.630
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

36:48.840 --> 36:52.790
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

36:53.000 --> 36:57.750
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

36:57.960 --> 36:59.500
through your character.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.000
It's such a transparent thing in a human being

37:04.040 --> 37:09.000
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

37:09.500 --> 37:16.460
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

37:16.710 --> 37:21.920
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

37:22.790 --> 37:27.340
and your strength of your innocence.

37:27.790 --> 37:32.040
I'm sorry for today's programme being so late,

37:32.960 --> 37:35.710
but you know I was ready to come

37:37.340 --> 37:42.880
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.500
Because it came so late,

37:47.000 --> 37:50.460
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

37:50.960 --> 37:55.420
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we'll stop it.

37:56.380 --> 38:01.630
You must send your applications

38:02.960 --> 38:08.340
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

38:08.630 --> 38:15.540
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

38:16.630 --> 38:18.920
and you cannot increase those!

38:20.040 --> 38:23.500
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

38:23.790 --> 38:28.380
that if you want to settle your marriage,

38:28.920 --> 38:35.040
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.670
Otherwise I'll leave it to others to decide.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
If you like, it can be done.

38:42.630 --> 38:45.500
So a simple thing is this to understand,

38:45.790 --> 38:48.340
that marriage is a very important thing.

38:49.380 --> 38:52.000
You can create innocent children if you are married.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.040
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

38:58.840 --> 39:04.040
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

39:04.750 --> 39:10.340
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

39:10.790 --> 39:14.840
if you send your applications so late.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.920
It should be within one week's time,

39:19.590 --> 39:21.710
I hope you'll understand that.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.340
Thank you very much.
