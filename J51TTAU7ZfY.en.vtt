00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.540
Today we have assembled here

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.880
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.920
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.670
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.710
And though' he is

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.040
such a young, little boy,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.630
he can fight the whole world,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.790
he can destroy all the negativity.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.040
That's the sign of innocence.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.000
There have been stories

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.040
that children who have fallen from a very great height

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.040
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.880
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.880
that it doesn't harm anyone

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.500
who is not to be harmed.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.340
It has all the wisdom of the world,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.920
all the understanding of the world;

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.540
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.420
the world, the whole world –

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.420
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.540
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.880
but they all stand, stand up against

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.540
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.750
You can see in your own lives

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.750
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.670
all of the them, whatever they are,

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.540
whatever they are coming from,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.750
whatever maybe their nationality,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.670
they all jump, all jump to control

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.880
and to safeguard that child.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.420
What is it?

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.000
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.590
to protect the innocence?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.500
It's really a shame,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.420
a great shame for us,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.500
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.000
Anything else can be tolerated.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.040
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.750
those who have no malice,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.460
who are living like little children, I should say,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.750
if they are attacked by anyone –

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.040
not that the whole world reacts to that –

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.630
but everyone of them cannot bear

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.840
any innocent person or 'innocent being' being harmed.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.040
We don't realise that within us

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.750
there is the ocean of love

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.630
and ocean of understanding for children.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840
Why? Why should it be?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.460
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.040
Especially for innocence?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.540
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.000
innocent children, there are.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.710
But no-one wants to support them.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.710
No-one thinks that it's proper to ill-treat children.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.880
And those who have done this have to suffer.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.460
They all suffer as a reaction.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.790
What is it within us

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.630
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.920
against innocence?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.590
For example if there is a regular war,

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.590
and if there are people fighting;

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.460
in a regular war, they don't have much sympathy.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.710
In the world also, they say “Alright,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.040
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.750
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.040
That's what human beings have.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.710
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.710
which gives you that feeling,

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.380
that capacity, that understanding

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.040
that you have to protect innocent,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.670
innocent children, innocent people.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.460
And the whole world can rise against all such people

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.790
who are trying to kill the innocent.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.420
There cannot be any doubt.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.750
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.590
or criticise such a thing,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.790
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:36.040
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500
and can give up anything,

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.460
but they cannot give up the feeling

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.340
they have for innocence.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.670
It's very remarkable. We don't realise

00:07:54.420 --> 00:08:00.420
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.920
for the innocent.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.840
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:17.920
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.000
That's the beauty of human beings.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.000
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:32.460
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But when it comes to children,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.880
and to innocent people,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.500
everyone feels his responsibility.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.880
It's difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:03.000
because they have a kind of an understanding

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.920
that they are something great,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.840
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.420
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.000
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.420
and they can give explanation for that, doesn't matter –

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.920
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.710
and they can never be honoured

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.920
for the thing they are doing.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.540
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.710
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.710
You might feel a little bit cheated,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.630
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.540
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.960
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.960
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.920
They should not feel dejected

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.500
if they are being used, insulted,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.790
tortured, dominated, it's alright.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.710
They should not try to destroy

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.750
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.500
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.880
that when innocence is challenged,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.710
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:59.040
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.500
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.920
– have been tortured,have been killed.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.960
At that time, all over the world,

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.880
it's a big support for them.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.460
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.920
is anxious to look after

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.790
those who have done this crime.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.750
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.840
they may not be belonging to the same country,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.000
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:56.750
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.880
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.540
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.380
that 'you cannot attack innocent people'.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.340
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.460
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.420
We should not, in no way punish them.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.000
Our main achievement

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.790
should be that loving attention for children.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:42.840
All over the world, whether he belongs

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.670
to your family or to some other family,

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.420
or has some sort of

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.380
detached attention with you,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.960
still because he's a child, he's innocent,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.920
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.040
will try to protect.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:22.040
It's very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.920
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.750
Children should never be attacked.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.670
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.460
But you shouldn't waste your energy on something

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.750
that is extremely inauspicious,

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:55.840
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.540
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.000
I have not come across anyone so far who says

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.750
that they don't love children – luckily!

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:18.040
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:22.750
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.670
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.920
You love nature – why?

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.630
Because it is innocent.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.840
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.920
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.000
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.590
It's very easy to be clever.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:01.420
But to be wise, one should understand

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.630
the beauty of being innocent.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.920
Possibly one may say “Mother,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.960
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.710
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.500
They may believe that they have done this,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.420
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.000
It is like a rock.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.840
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.790
any ocean of anger

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.920
or any kind of revenge.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.750
It's the rock that is being looked after

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.880
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.880
I've told you before also,

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.750
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.840
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.040
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.960
but it does not get,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.790
it cannot get it.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.540
After innocence.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:35.790
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.880
We play with our innocence very much.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.590
We think that by behaving any way we like,

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.960
“It's alright, after all it's my own desire, my wish”.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.670
And we'll go on, we go on all the time

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.750
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.710
or covering our power of innocence.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.460
And we think that we have done a great job,

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:22.630
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.710
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.880
It is not self-sufficient.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.340
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:47.710
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.960
which is the greatest faith,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.750
the greatest help

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.420
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.540
Those people who do not respect their innocence

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.000
because they think it makes you weak,

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.420
have not seen the power of innocence –

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.670
how it works, how it acts.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.960
From all over the world, it reacts.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.840
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.670
power of innocence.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.590
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.840
And it acts

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.960
as if the whole understanding,

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:58.420
whole working-out of the be-ing

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.670
is so beautifully achieved.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.880
Now you see in this world

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:13.590
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.670
It is respected the high ideals.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:29.670
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:37.590
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.460
of very good nature'

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:46.840
– all these people may have been harmed

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.540
may have been killed –

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.670
but because of their innocence they shine,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.590
and shine through ages.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:03.340
You can see the life of all great men like that;

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:09.500
they are all very simple,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.710
they are not deliberating anything –

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.750
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:32.000
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.420
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.420
Have faith in that.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.790
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.960
and that 'yourself' is nothing but innocence.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.420
You may say that 'innocent people get cheated'.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.630
Nobody can cheat innocence,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.710
because that is something of very eternal value.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.540
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.500
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.460
And you will be the most successful person

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:18.630
in life when you are absolutely innocent

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.630
and your are looking after your innocence.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.460
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.420
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.540
by ill-doing, it might be covered for the time being.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.790
But if you can take out the clouds

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.750
away from the sky of innocence,

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.500
the whole thing becomes so obvious

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.630
that you have won the whole world.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.460
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.380
he was insulted, he was tortured.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.540
Those who did this, where are they?

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.630
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.460
Nobody is even bothered about them.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:13.670
A single one person was so much used

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.790
and was so much tortured.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.460
But despite that, what has happened?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.540
He has got the respect from the whole world.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.880
The whole world respects.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.380
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.000
what has he done …' Nothing of the kind.

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:44.630
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.540
the essence of complete innocence.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:23:00.420
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:07.460
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.380
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.540
and we don't want to even remember that, we don't want to even

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.750
consider that it's a wrong thing to do,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.790
we do not know what is ahead of us.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.420
What happened to Hitler also?

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.540
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.340
he can manage to kill so many people

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.420
and still he will remain a very great personality.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.920
They are stupid not to understand

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.920
who are the people really respected.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.960
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.380
He didn't understand if you wanted to have

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.000
really the power over the world,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.460
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.040
he should have followed the great people.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.590
And the great people are those who are innocent.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.630
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:26.840
I don't know how to say that this power acts,

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.590
because it acts in so many ways.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.960
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:41.420
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.000
simple and wise

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.420
is remembered all your life.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.000
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.750
I used to go to the library

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.790
and read about the lives of great men

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.880
who have created some great things for us.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.420
So many of them.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.460
And I was so impressed

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:26.790
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.710
For example Abraham Lincoln

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.920
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.880
was a man tortured by his wife also.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.500
She said “You don't know, you are very clumsy,

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:50.340
you don't know how to dress up, you don't know how to behave”.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:26:00.040
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.630
Ultimately he was also killed.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.040
So one can say, “You see, what's the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:17.920
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.630
Until today, all over the world,

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.590
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.670
They don't know his wife – maybe.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.340
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.000
Clumsy man, according to her,

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.500
and all sorts of degradation for him.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:58.340
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.710
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.460
Why? 'Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:14.710
that shows that he had no strength to survive' –

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.040
but he survived through ages!

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.960
So many years have passed, still he's surviving.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.540
Take the case of all the great people

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.340
who have been innocent;

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.380
and that's why they had ideals.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.630
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:45.670
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.840
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.460
comes only from your innocence.

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:57.670
That's the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.840
how you should exist;

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.040
what kind of a life you should lead.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:12.630
It is not important that you have big authorities,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:19.590
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.840
There have been so many who came and died.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.420
They had so many people with ambitions

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:33.380
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.420
Nobody's bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.500
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.500
'No, no, we don't want to see this man'.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.420
But if there's a little boy, innocent child,

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.960
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.460
the whole world admires that child.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.880
And these great men are, really,

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.880
they are the symbols of that innocence.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:12.420
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.840
Ganesha's main quality is his wisdom.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.880
He knew what was success, through his,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.790
I should say, innocent qualities.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.340
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.750
quality of innocence.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.040
It's very surprising how the quality of innocence

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.540
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.590
who may be very

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:02.040
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.040
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:13.000
they are innocent! That's were ends all the glory of human beings.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.630
To be innocent –

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.670
What's the matter?

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.540
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.590
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:43.590
Firstly, you can see for yourself

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:46.540
how your mind works.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.460
What does it do? How it reacts.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.420
This is what one has to watch,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.000
which I call as 'introspection'.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.500
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.000
What does it think is the best?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.710
In that thinking, thought process,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:28.340
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.460
The first and the foremost is that

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.380
you should know how you react to someone.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:47.420
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.040
It is very easy to see yourself,

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.710
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:59.920
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:07.750
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:13.960
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.500
What is your behaviour?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.960
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.500
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:32.340
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.790
Absolutely stupid.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.590
And when they are doing stupid things,

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.630
why should we bother about them?

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.750
Why should we waste our energy about them?

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:51.670
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:58.340
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.380
they are treated with contempt.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:04.040
People don't even want to take their names,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.670
they don't want to have their photographs,

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.790
they don't want to have anything to do with them.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.630
At this time, at such a juncture,

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.750
what happens is the people who are crooks,

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:29.540
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:34.960
they start following them because it suits them better.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.960
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.710
and that's how a new group is formed –

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.960
which we can call 'a satanic group'.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.040
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.380
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.040
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:04.460
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.380
'It cannot be killed by any weapon'.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:14.500
Nainam dahanti pavaka – 'No fire can burn it'.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.630
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.540
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.380
'Wind cannot also suck it',

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.630
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.500
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.920
I told you, nature is innocent.

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.630
It understands and it acts

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:53.420
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:35:01.000
who is trying to malign

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:04.380
or trouble an innocent person.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.670
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.710
I know sometimes one feels

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.380
that you are dominated because of that.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.920
Sometimes one feels sad that  'Why you are put to this kind

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.460
of a treatment by others'.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.420
All kinds of things come to your mind.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.590
But if you worship your innocence,

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.880
then you will be always a happy person,

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:43.380
always a kind person, always be humble person.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.920
So, one has to be careful.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.040
You are your own destroyer!

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.880
You are the one who kills, you see

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.040
What do you say to it?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.040
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.790
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.790
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:08.380
So, you kill yourself –

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.460
through this you can save yourself

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.460
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.670
Have faith in the power of innocence.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:27.460
What is important is, how you show in your own life

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.040
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.040
and that is what is what, is what I call 'the love'.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:41.500
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.630
you have this attitude towards yourself.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.630
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.790
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.750
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.500
through your character.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.000
It's such a transparent thing in a human being

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.000
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:16.460
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:21.920
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:27.340
and your strength of your innocence.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:32.040
I'm sorry for today's programme being so late,

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.710
but you know I was ready to come

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.880
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.500
Because it came so late,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.460
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.420
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we'll stop it.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:01.630
You must send your applications

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.340
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:15.540
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.920
and you cannot increase those!

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.500
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:28.380
that if you want to settle your marriage,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:35.040
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.670
Otherwise I'll leave it to others to decide.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
If you like, it can be done.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.500
So a simple thing is this to understand,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.340
that marriage is a very important thing.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.000
You can create innocent children if you are married.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.040
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:04.040
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:10.340
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:14.840
if you send your applications so late.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.920
It should be within one week's time,

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.710
I hope you'll understand that.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.340
Thank you very much.
