00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:10.377
"In the heart there are four hadis"

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:19.813
But today I'm going to tell you something
more which we have to know.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:30.324
It's very important to know, because
as was described by people

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:36.416
that they practice Sahaja Yoga
as they go to church,

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.016
but it's not from their heart.

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:47.413
And heart is the abode of the spirit –

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.813
is the Shiva within us.

00:00:54.405 --> 00:01:01.864
So we have to know more about heart,
and that is very important.

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:09.022
You know about these three nadis
we have: Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:13.187
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:21.735
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:27.960
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara
it goes to hell.

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:32.798
That's why they say that Shiva
is a destroyer.

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.195
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:44.805
And when you ask for your destruction,
you have it.

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:52.605
Even if it destroys everything,
as I was telling,

00:01:52.838 --> 00:02:00.973
it's like when a fruit has to come,
the petals look as if they're destroyed –

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:03.986
as I have destroyed, I would say,
many of your things:

00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:09.713
you can call it like your conditionings,
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:13.223
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:19.609
This has to be destroyed for the beauty
to come out.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:32.659
So when your maryadas you cross
beyond certain point,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.804
you go to your destruction.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.695
In four directions there are destructions
built, as there are four nadis.

00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:51.208
So now, what is to be done?

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.919
How are we to stop this destruction

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.861
of the, through the first nadi,
going to hell?

00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:05.929
One of the qualities of Shiva is that
He's innocence.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.352
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent
like a child. He is innocence personified.

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:24.377
So we have to put

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:31.552
our carnal desires, dissolve them,

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:41.370
dissolve them into the innocence,
the ocean of innocence.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.143
You have to dissolve it in the ocean
of innocence.

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:55.372
Innocence is something

00:03:55.581 --> 00:04:01.471
to be appreciated, to be understood,
to be enjoyed.

00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:05.748
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:15.123
you see children, they're innocent;
flowers, they're innocent.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:24.424
Divert your attention to all these things.

00:04:28.515 --> 00:04:32.395
You see, on walking on the street,

00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:39.651
what is there to see best is all
at three feet height.

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:47.139
You see at three feet height all
the flowers, all the beautiful grass,

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.187
all the children who are about three feet
are the best.

00:04:52.664 --> 00:04:56.302
You need not see people who are above that.

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:03.031
Just see on three feet level.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.818
You can see the legs of somebody,
that's all right.

00:05:13.034 --> 00:05:19.333
But you don't see the eyes of a person
who are not innocent.

00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:28.109
So dissolve this desire into innocence.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:38.926
And this Mooladhara which is innocent
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:45.458
it is righteous, it is Shri Ganesha's
qualities,

00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:51.735
it's pure. So even if you are
in this world,

00:05:51.936 --> 00:05:57.895
even if you are living like a human being,
even if you have children,

00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:01.084
still you are innocent.

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:08.097
(...) The second nadi, the second channel

00:06:08.298 --> 00:06:12.604
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:16.869
That's why Buddha has said that
desirelessness is the only way

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:25.703
that people do not get old, nor sick,
nor worried.

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:36.139
Now this desire that we have,
“I want this,”

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:39.826
in the West is much more than anywhere else

00:06:40.027 --> 00:06:44.499
because the entrepreneurs are every day
producing new things.

00:06:45.393 --> 00:06:49.939
(...) Desires can be of any kind,
not only material.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:57.895
The desires could be also quite mental,

00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:06.630
“I must possess this woman, I must
possess this child.”

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:12.413
All kinds of possessions that work
into you as desires.

00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:16.881
But I wouldn't say it is because
of attachment.

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:23.942
It's not attachment, but it is just
to have more.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:36.894
Go on adding up things, getting things –

00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:44.814
still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:57.882
What is the reason for this kind
of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:02.253
It's an impure desire. It's an impure desire,
and when such a desire starts working

00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:07.615
you can go any far, like Saddam Hussein,
like Hitler, like anything

00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:18.729
is nothing but absolutely desire
beyond any limitations.

00:08:19.658 --> 00:08:26.836
You want to dominate others is also
another desire.

00:08:29.232 --> 00:08:37.069
All these desires lead you ultimately
to a destruction,

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:43.789
because there's no joy, there's
no happiness.

00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:52.411
For example, now I want to have a sari,

00:08:54.729 --> 00:08:58.138
so I want to buy a sari.

00:08:58.729 --> 00:09:01.152
All my attention will be how will I get
that sari,

00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:09.126
I must get that sari, this thing, that
thing. The attention becomes polluted,

00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:13.611
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing
like a sari.

00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:23.110
The attention, which has to enjoy,
which has to enjoy the spirit,

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:34.586
which has to nourish the spirit, becomes
disturbed because of desires.

00:09:34.914 --> 00:09:43.238
In the first place the attention is
disturbed because we are not innocent.

00:09:43.619 --> 00:09:53.121
In the second place the attention gets
into turmoil because we have desire.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:03.522
So what should we do as far as
the desire is concerned?

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.229
The desire for beautiful things –

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:19.288
we can shift our desire, material desire
into aesthetics,

00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:24.844
and have one thing but which is really
aesthetically rich.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.855
(...) So whatever you desire, if you start
working it out,

00:10:34.153 --> 00:10:41.094
desiring for something aesthetically
handmade, nice thing,

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:49.700
gradually you'll find you'll end up
with vibrations,

00:10:49.901 --> 00:10:54.038
because all beautiful things have
vibrations.

00:10:55.715 --> 00:11:01.028
And to have the vibrations you'll have
to go to pure desire.

00:11:02.197 --> 00:11:08.012
So this desire which is madness,
which makes you mad,

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:17.115
which is so much dull and boring
becomes pure desire,

00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:22.177
because you have to dissolve all
your desires into vibration.

00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:26.487
You start desiring nothing but vibrations
after some time.

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:34.083
(...) So if you have vibrations that doesn't
mean that they are something dry, you see?

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:41.945
No, it means the joy of bhakti.

00:11:43.576 --> 00:11:47.072
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration,
this, that.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:53.282
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:11:53.483 --> 00:11:58.257
You just get drenched into it. There's
no words to it.

00:12:02.224 --> 00:12:09.848
And that is what when you feel,
you must know that you have taken

00:12:10.049 --> 00:12:18.076
the spirit as a real connection

00:12:18.277 --> 00:12:25.306
between you and your Mother,
or your Father.

00:12:27.305 --> 00:12:33.604
There's no differentiation.

00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:41.767
You are one in that ocean, drenched
in the ocean.

00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:48.609
 You are the drop, you are the ocean.
You are one in that bhakti.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.663
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:12:56.407 --> 00:12:59.628
because not man-made.

00:13:02.518 --> 00:13:07.964
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:13:08.502 --> 00:13:16.491
you must know that it's not dry vibrations
only, but is the bhakti.

00:13:16.692 --> 00:13:21.682
That is the joy of Shiva's quality,

00:13:21.883 --> 00:13:29.605
the quality of joy that He adds
to our life.

00:13:29.806 --> 00:13:36.334
Everything seems to be surrounded,
resounding. Same thing the joy,

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:45.479
that “I'm loved so much by God, that God
loves me, that I have a meaning in life.”

00:13:46.468 --> 00:13:52.157
Then the ego drops out, first of all,

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:59.022
and also the conditionings drop out.

00:14:02.517 --> 00:14:06.322
Now the third nadi:

00:14:11.187 --> 00:14:19.104
third nadi is the nadi by which
we feel attached,

00:14:20.653 --> 00:14:27.738
attached to someone. Like this is my child,
this is my husband,

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:37.681
this is my family, this is my wife,
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.846
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga
of everyone,

00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:52.151
when they are just the beginners,
so they talk about their whole family,

00:14:52.352 --> 00:14:57.535
“My father is like this, my mother is sick,
my mother's sister's brother's this,

00:14:57.736 --> 00:15:03.039
that's real, this thing, is not well.”

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:11.727
As if, you see, we all have taken
a contract. What should I do?

00:15:13.127 --> 00:15:18.194
(...) So now this so-called limited love,
what is the solution

00:15:18.443 --> 00:15:24.182
which takes you to destruction
is the unlimited love.

00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:30.958
Because Shiva is nothing but love,
He's love.

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:44.927
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,
that wants your benevolence.

00:15:45.848 --> 00:15:51.247
That's what Shiva is. It wants your
benevolence.

00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:56.391
It looks after your benevolence.

00:15:56.592 --> 00:16:07.672
So when you are looking after
the benevolence of others with love,

00:16:09.697 --> 00:16:13.293
then the whole life changes,

00:16:15.331 --> 00:16:18.900
the whole pattern changes,

00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:23.921
and you really enjoy it because you
become one with so many,

00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:30.615
concerned with so many families, so many
things, so many problems of others,

00:16:30.816 --> 00:16:34.816
and you just feel you are one with so many.

00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:44.040
(...) All this is the most enjoyable thing.
I mean, why all this is for there?

00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:49.381
After all, think about yourself,
“Why am I here?

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:58.853
I'm here to enjoy everyone – everyone.
They are all realized souls,

00:16:59.053 --> 00:17:03.009
such beautiful lotuses.

00:17:03.215 --> 00:17:10.771
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.
Now I am a lotus.”

00:17:13.351 --> 00:17:23.843
That is the way you open the heart,
the lotus of your heart.

00:17:24.052 --> 00:17:32.715
And the fragrance of such a person
is so beautiful, is so beautiful.

00:17:36.128 --> 00:17:41.600
So you are no more divisive, you do
not want to separate from each other.

00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:46.279
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable
to that;

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.329
you don't think that it should be done
here or there or there,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:56.118
but anywhere – but should be all of us
together.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.092
So the small attachments that are with you

00:18:02.393 --> 00:18:09.051
have to be dissolved into this ocean
of love, which is Shiva.

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:21.740
Fourth one is the most important for all
of us is to know

00:18:21.941 --> 00:18:28.856
that there's a nadi which passes through
left Vishuddhi into the heart.

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:35.552
Starts from the heart, goes up, passes
through Agnya.

00:18:35.753 --> 00:18:40.521
It has four petals, and opens up.

00:18:44.517 --> 00:18:52.183
This is the one which gives you the state
which is called as turya.

00:18:52.384 --> 00:18:56.510
We live in three states.

00:18:56.711 --> 00:19:02.192
In the living – in the awakened state,
jagruti,

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:07.748
our attention goes to this, that,
and all that; we spoil our attention.

00:19:09.905 --> 00:19:16.430
But the second one is the one what
we call is that we sleep.

00:19:16.631 --> 00:19:19.927
When we sleep also

00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:27.316
all these things that have happened come
to us from our past and things like that.

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:32.430
But then we go to the deeper sleep
called as sushupti.

00:19:33.649 --> 00:19:40.585
Is a state where you have deep sleep,

00:19:40.786 --> 00:19:49.245
and you dream of something that is
reality also. You may dream about Me.

00:19:49.446 --> 00:19:54.049
Like it's the ethereal part
of the subconscious,

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:00.193
where some beautiful informations
are passed on.

00:20:00.394 --> 00:20:03.027
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

00:20:03.228 --> 00:20:06.163
Italians might know in their sushupti
that I have come here,

00:20:06.364 --> 00:20:09.969
or maybe anybody might know – depends on.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.706
But the fourth state is called as turya.
There are two more states.

00:20:13.907 --> 00:20:17.948
You are in the turya state, it’s
the fourth, “turya” means fourth.

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:25.934
Fourth state is where that you are
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:20:27.114 --> 00:20:32.575
When there is no thought – just think
of it –

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:37.721
when there is no thought, you have
to be innocent.

00:20:37.922 --> 00:20:43.147
When there is no thought, you have
to have vibrations.

00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:47.907
When there is no thought, you cannot
be attached to anyone.

00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:52.705
So into that thoughtless state you have
come now, is the “turya sthiti.”

00:20:52.906 --> 00:20:56.615
And in this state when you are,

00:20:58.374 --> 00:21:07.326
these four petals which are within you
have to open out in your brain.

00:21:08.596 --> 00:21:12.570
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:21:15.514 --> 00:21:20.844
And that is when

00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:29.732
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:39.932
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:45.701
That is the time when

00:21:47.743 --> 00:21:52.779
one receives the real knowledge.

00:21:58.536 --> 00:22:03.846
But unless and until these four petals
open, one may fall back,

00:22:04.047 --> 00:22:12.094
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis
who are still meddling with things

00:22:12.295 --> 00:22:21.771
that they should not do, go down. And
they don't understand what is God is.

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:26.998
But it’s not the understanding – in a way
you understand this one little point,

00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:35.655
that it comes from your heart into your
brain, not from brain to your heart.

00:22:37.323 --> 00:22:48.772
It comes as if the ambrosia of your
bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

00:22:50.995 --> 00:22:54.440
(...) I wish you all to achieve that state.

00:22:54.648 --> 00:22:57.422
May God bless you.
