WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:10.377
"In the heart there are four hadis"

00:14.979 --> 00:19.813
But today I'm going to tell you something
more which we have to know.

00:21.710 --> 00:30.324
It's very important to know, because
as was described by people

00:30.525 --> 00:36.416
that they practice Sahaja Yoga
as they go to church,

00:36.906 --> 00:41.016
but it's not from their heart.

00:43.352 --> 00:47.413
And heart is the abode of the spirit –

00:48.979 --> 00:52.813
is the Shiva within us.

00:54.405 --> 01:01.864
So we have to know more about heart,
and that is very important.

01:03.194 --> 01:09.022
You know about these three nadis
we have: Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

01:09.223 --> 01:13.187
but in the heart there are four nadis.

01:16.243 --> 01:21.735
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

01:23.776 --> 01:27.960
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara
it goes to hell.

01:28.161 --> 01:32.798
That's why they say that Shiva
is a destroyer.

01:32.999 --> 01:37.195
Actually you ask for your destruction.

01:38.665 --> 01:44.805
And when you ask for your destruction,
you have it.

01:48.245 --> 01:52.605
Even if it destroys everything,
as I was telling,

01:52.838 --> 02:00.973
it's like when a fruit has to come,
the petals look as if they're destroyed –

02:01.174 --> 02:03.986
as I have destroyed, I would say,
many of your things:

02:04.187 --> 02:09.713
you can call it like your conditionings,
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

02:09.914 --> 02:13.223
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

02:13.424 --> 02:19.609
This has to be destroyed for the beauty
to come out.

02:20.623 --> 02:32.659
So when your maryadas you cross
beyond certain point,

02:32.860 --> 02:36.804
you go to your destruction.

02:39.049 --> 02:46.695
In four directions there are destructions
built, as there are four nadis.

02:47.811 --> 02:51.208
So now, what is to be done?

02:51.409 --> 02:54.919
How are we to stop this destruction

02:55.120 --> 02:59.861
of the, through the first nadi,
going to hell?

03:00.935 --> 03:05.929
One of the qualities of Shiva is that
He's innocence.

03:06.130 --> 03:13.352
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent
like a child. He is innocence personified.

03:15.632 --> 03:24.377
So we have to put

03:25.004 --> 03:31.552
our carnal desires, dissolve them,

03:32.911 --> 03:41.370
dissolve them into the innocence,
the ocean of innocence.

03:44.060 --> 03:49.143
You have to dissolve it in the ocean
of innocence.

03:50.932 --> 03:55.372
Innocence is something

03:55.581 --> 04:01.471
to be appreciated, to be understood,
to be enjoyed.

04:01.672 --> 04:05.748
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

04:06.345 --> 04:15.123
you see children, they're innocent;
flowers, they're innocent.

04:15.440 --> 04:24.424
Divert your attention to all these things.

04:28.515 --> 04:32.395
You see, on walking on the street,

04:32.651 --> 04:39.651
what is there to see best is all
at three feet height.

04:41.176 --> 04:47.139
You see at three feet height all
the flowers, all the beautiful grass,

04:47.340 --> 04:52.187
all the children who are about three feet
are the best.

04:52.664 --> 04:56.302
You need not see people who are above that.

04:59.215 --> 05:03.031
Just see on three feet level.

05:06.360 --> 05:11.818
You can see the legs of somebody,
that's all right.

05:13.034 --> 05:19.333
But you don't see the eyes of a person
who are not innocent.

05:20.351 --> 05:28.109
So dissolve this desire into innocence.

05:29.512 --> 05:38.926
And this Mooladhara which is innocent
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

05:39.704 --> 05:45.458
it is righteous, it is Shri Ganesha's
qualities,

05:46.983 --> 05:51.735
it's pure. So even if you are
in this world,

05:51.936 --> 05:57.895
even if you are living like a human being,
even if you have children,

05:58.096 --> 06:01.084
still you are innocent.

06:02.917 --> 06:08.097
(...) The second nadi, the second channel

06:08.298 --> 06:12.604
that can take you to destruction is desire.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.869
That's why Buddha has said that
desirelessness is the only way

06:17.070 --> 06:25.703
that people do not get old, nor sick,
nor worried.

06:29.749 --> 06:36.139
Now this desire that we have,
“I want this,”

06:36.346 --> 06:39.826
in the West is much more than anywhere else

06:40.027 --> 06:44.499
because the entrepreneurs are every day
producing new things.

06:45.393 --> 06:49.939
(...) Desires can be of any kind,
not only material.

06:50.140 --> 06:57.895
The desires could be also quite mental,

06:59.984 --> 07:06.630
“I must possess this woman, I must
possess this child.”

07:06.831 --> 07:12.413
All kinds of possessions that work
into you as desires.

07:12.687 --> 07:16.881
But I wouldn't say it is because
of attachment.

07:18.136 --> 07:23.942
It's not attachment, but it is just
to have more.

07:29.300 --> 07:36.894
Go on adding up things, getting things –

07:39.429 --> 07:44.814
still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

07:46.000 --> 07:57.882
What is the reason for this kind
of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

07:58.083 --> 08:02.253
It's an impure desire. It's an impure desire,
and when such a desire starts working

08:02.454 --> 08:07.615
you can go any far, like Saddam Hussein,
like Hitler, like anything

08:07.816 --> 08:18.729
is nothing but absolutely desire
beyond any limitations.

08:19.658 --> 08:26.836
You want to dominate others is also
another desire.

08:29.232 --> 08:37.069
All these desires lead you ultimately
to a destruction,

08:38.398 --> 08:43.789
because there's no joy, there's
no happiness.

08:45.229 --> 08:52.411
For example, now I want to have a sari,

08:54.729 --> 08:58.138
so I want to buy a sari.

08:58.729 --> 09:01.152
All my attention will be how will I get
that sari,

09:01.353 --> 09:09.126
I must get that sari, this thing, that
thing. The attention becomes polluted,

09:09.327 --> 09:13.611
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing
like a sari.

09:13.812 --> 09:23.110
The attention, which has to enjoy,
which has to enjoy the spirit,

09:24.067 --> 09:34.586
which has to nourish the spirit, becomes
disturbed because of desires.

09:34.914 --> 09:43.238
In the first place the attention is
disturbed because we are not innocent.

09:43.619 --> 09:53.121
In the second place the attention gets
into turmoil because we have desire.

09:57.270 --> 10:03.522
So what should we do as far as
the desire is concerned?

10:06.510 --> 10:10.229
The desire for beautiful things –

10:11.544 --> 10:19.288
we can shift our desire, material desire
into aesthetics,

10:19.489 --> 10:24.844
and have one thing but which is really
aesthetically rich.

10:26.240 --> 10:31.855
(...) So whatever you desire, if you start
working it out,

10:34.153 --> 10:41.094
desiring for something aesthetically
handmade, nice thing,

10:44.458 --> 10:49.700
gradually you'll find you'll end up
with vibrations,

10:49.901 --> 10:54.038
because all beautiful things have
vibrations.

10:55.715 --> 11:01.028
And to have the vibrations you'll have
to go to pure desire.

11:02.197 --> 11:08.012
So this desire which is madness,
which makes you mad,

11:08.213 --> 11:17.115
which is so much dull and boring
becomes pure desire,

11:17.316 --> 11:22.177
because you have to dissolve all
your desires into vibration.

11:22.378 --> 11:26.487
You start desiring nothing but vibrations
after some time.

11:27.195 --> 11:34.083
(...) So if you have vibrations that doesn't
mean that they are something dry, you see?

11:34.510 --> 11:41.945
No, it means the joy of bhakti.

11:43.576 --> 11:47.072
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration,
this, that.

11:47.273 --> 11:53.282
It's the ocean of love that is God.

11:53.483 --> 11:58.257
You just get drenched into it. There's
no words to it.

12:02.224 --> 12:09.848
And that is what when you feel,
you must know that you have taken

12:10.049 --> 12:18.076
the spirit as a real connection

12:18.277 --> 12:25.306
between you and your Mother,
or your Father.

12:27.305 --> 12:33.604
There's no differentiation.

12:35.133 --> 12:41.767
You are one in that ocean, drenched
in the ocean.

12:41.968 --> 12:48.609
You are the drop, you are the ocean.
You are one in that bhakti.

12:49.220 --> 12:53.663
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

12:56.407 --> 12:59.628
because not man-made.

13:02.518 --> 13:07.964
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

13:08.502 --> 13:16.491
you must know that it's not dry vibrations
only, but is the bhakti.

13:16.692 --> 13:21.682
That is the joy of Shiva's quality,

13:21.883 --> 13:29.605
the quality of joy that He adds
to our life.

13:29.806 --> 13:36.334
Everything seems to be surrounded,
resounding. Same thing the joy,

13:36.535 --> 13:45.479
that “I'm loved so much by God, that God
loves me, that I have a meaning in life.”

13:46.468 --> 13:52.157
Then the ego drops out, first of all,

13:53.110 --> 13:59.022
and also the conditionings drop out.

14:02.517 --> 14:06.322
Now the third nadi:

14:11.187 --> 14:19.104
third nadi is the nadi by which
we feel attached,

14:20.653 --> 14:27.738
attached to someone. Like this is my child,
this is my husband,

14:27.939 --> 14:37.681
this is my family, this is my wife,
this is my father, this is my mother.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.846
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga
of everyone,

14:43.047 --> 14:52.151
when they are just the beginners,
so they talk about their whole family,

14:52.352 --> 14:57.535
“My father is like this, my mother is sick,
my mother's sister's brother's this,

14:57.736 --> 15:03.039
that's real, this thing, is not well.”

15:03.240 --> 15:11.727
As if, you see, we all have taken
a contract. What should I do?

15:13.127 --> 15:18.194
(...) So now this so-called limited love,
what is the solution

15:18.443 --> 15:24.182
which takes you to destruction
is the unlimited love.

15:25.411 --> 15:30.958
Because Shiva is nothing but love,
He's love.

15:33.932 --> 15:44.927
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,
that wants your benevolence.

15:45.848 --> 15:51.247
That's what Shiva is. It wants your
benevolence.

15:52.677 --> 15:56.391
It looks after your benevolence.

15:56.592 --> 16:07.672
So when you are looking after
the benevolence of others with love,

16:09.697 --> 16:13.293
then the whole life changes,

16:15.331 --> 16:18.900
the whole pattern changes,

16:19.101 --> 16:23.921
and you really enjoy it because you
become one with so many,

16:24.122 --> 16:30.615
concerned with so many families, so many
things, so many problems of others,

16:30.816 --> 16:34.816
and you just feel you are one with so many.

16:35.727 --> 16:44.040
(...) All this is the most enjoyable thing.
I mean, why all this is for there?

16:44.241 --> 16:49.381
After all, think about yourself,
“Why am I here?

16:51.649 --> 16:58.853
I'm here to enjoy everyone – everyone.
They are all realized souls,

16:59.053 --> 17:03.009
such beautiful lotuses.

17:03.215 --> 17:10.771
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.
Now I am a lotus.”

17:13.351 --> 17:23.843
That is the way you open the heart,
the lotus of your heart.

17:24.052 --> 17:32.715
And the fragrance of such a person
is so beautiful, is so beautiful.

17:36.128 --> 17:41.600
So you are no more divisive, you do
not want to separate from each other.

17:41.801 --> 17:46.279
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable
to that;

17:46.480 --> 17:49.329
you don't think that it should be done
here or there or there,

17:49.530 --> 17:56.118
but anywhere – but should be all of us
together.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.092
So the small attachments that are with you

18:02.393 --> 18:09.051
have to be dissolved into this ocean
of love, which is Shiva.

18:15.366 --> 18:21.740
Fourth one is the most important for all
of us is to know

18:21.941 --> 18:28.856
that there's a nadi which passes through
left Vishuddhi into the heart.

18:29.057 --> 18:35.552
Starts from the heart, goes up, passes
through Agnya.

18:35.753 --> 18:40.521
It has four petals, and opens up.

18:44.517 --> 18:52.183
This is the one which gives you the state
which is called as turya.

18:52.384 --> 18:56.510
We live in three states.

18:56.711 --> 19:02.192
In the living – in the awakened state,
jagruti,

19:02.393 --> 19:07.748
our attention goes to this, that,
and all that; we spoil our attention.

19:09.905 --> 19:16.430
But the second one is the one what
we call is that we sleep.

19:16.631 --> 19:19.927
When we sleep also

19:21.292 --> 19:27.316
all these things that have happened come
to us from our past and things like that.

19:28.146 --> 19:32.430
But then we go to the deeper sleep
called as sushupti.

19:33.649 --> 19:40.585
Is a state where you have deep sleep,

19:40.786 --> 19:49.245
and you dream of something that is
reality also. You may dream about Me.

19:49.446 --> 19:54.049
Like it's the ethereal part
of the subconscious,

19:54.250 --> 20:00.193
where some beautiful informations
are passed on.

20:00.394 --> 20:03.027
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

20:03.228 --> 20:06.163
Italians might know in their sushupti
that I have come here,

20:06.364 --> 20:09.969
or maybe anybody might know – depends on.

20:10.170 --> 20:13.706
But the fourth state is called as turya.
There are two more states.

20:13.907 --> 20:17.948
You are in the turya state, it’s
the fourth, “turya” means fourth.

20:18.149 --> 20:25.934
Fourth state is where that you are
in a thoughtless awareness state.

20:27.114 --> 20:32.575
When there is no thought – just think
of it –

20:32.933 --> 20:37.721
when there is no thought, you have
to be innocent.

20:37.922 --> 20:43.147
When there is no thought, you have
to have vibrations.

20:43.348 --> 20:47.907
When there is no thought, you cannot
be attached to anyone.

20:48.108 --> 20:52.705
So into that thoughtless state you have
come now, is the “turya sthiti.”

20:52.906 --> 20:56.615
And in this state when you are,

20:58.374 --> 21:07.326
these four petals which are within you
have to open out in your brain.

21:08.596 --> 21:12.570
They come from your heart to your brain.

21:15.514 --> 21:20.844
And that is when

21:22.834 --> 21:29.732
you absolutely understand what is God,

21:33.650 --> 21:39.932
absolutely you know what is God is.

21:40.495 --> 21:45.701
That is the time when

21:47.743 --> 21:52.779
one receives the real knowledge.

21:58.536 --> 22:03.846
But unless and until these four petals
open, one may fall back,

22:04.047 --> 22:12.094
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis
who are still meddling with things

22:12.295 --> 22:21.771
that they should not do, go down. And
they don't understand what is God is.

22:22.709 --> 22:26.998
But it’s not the understanding – in a way
you understand this one little point,

22:27.199 --> 22:35.655
that it comes from your heart into your
brain, not from brain to your heart.

22:37.323 --> 22:48.772
It comes as if the ambrosia of your
bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

22:50.995 --> 22:54.440
(...) I wish you all to achieve that state.

22:54.648 --> 22:57.422
May God bless you.
