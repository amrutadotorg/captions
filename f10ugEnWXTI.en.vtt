00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:13.838
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:27.968
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:36.076
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:55.998
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

00:00:55.998 --> 00:01:00.218
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

00:01:00.218 --> 00:01:13.578
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:25.927
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

00:01:25.927 --> 00:01:35.468
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

00:01:37.894 --> 00:01:41.790
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:43.979
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.951
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:53.125
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.701
to bend our ways.].

00:01:54.908 --> 00:02:06.227
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:19.968
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:29.325
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.790
as far as the hinsa is concerned.

00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:40.878
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:43.379
mosquitoes of Delhi.

00:02:43.451 --> 00:03:02.278
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

00:03:02.278 --> 00:03:16.898
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

00:03:16.898 --> 00:03:23.613
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.”

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:32.188
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:34.862
Because they were not enlightened people,

00:03:34.887 --> 00:03:38.772
are already dead people their eyes are not open.

00:03:39.034 --> 00:03:42.979
Whom are You going to kill here?

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:49.428
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma."

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:56.469
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.973
sort of a ism; it is not.

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:08.128
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:10.558
ten valencies in a human being.

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:17.238
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

00:04:19.336 --> 00:04:26.358
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:39.198
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:43.238
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

00:04:43.238 --> 00:05:01.308
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:15.747
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

00:05:15.772 --> 00:05:26.465
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your  .”

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:33.708
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:42.574
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:48.856
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.190
what was He doing at that time?”

00:05:53.237 --> 00:05:57.736
And Arjuna killed Karna.

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:03.375
This is Dharma.

00:06:06.517 --> 00:06:17.451
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:23.188
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:27.907
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent

00:06:27.932 --> 00:06:30.432
because you do not agree with some people.

00:06:31.444 --> 00:06:36.926
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:47.027
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

00:06:47.027 --> 00:06:52.926
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

00:06:55.147 --> 00:07:04.713
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:11.907
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

00:07:15.408 --> 00:07:20.403
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

00:07:20.428 --> 00:07:23.087
That is not Krishna’s message.

00:07:25.132 --> 00:07:30.423
He showed His love by killing the demons.

00:07:32.848 --> 00:07:41.740
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

00:07:41.765 --> 00:07:45.465
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.144
with some new subject matters.

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:54.168
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

00:07:54.168 --> 00:07:57.497
point one should try to see.

00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:13.247
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

00:08:13.247 --> 00:08:20.762
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

00:08:21.818 --> 00:08:30.630
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

00:08:31.138 --> 00:08:41.128
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

00:08:41.128 --> 00:08:44.678
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:44.678 --> 00:08:49.798
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:59.588
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:07.948
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:15.498
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:22.014
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated,

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:24.629
intellectuals, whatever you may call them.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:32.655
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:41.698
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

00:09:41.698 --> 00:09:47.021
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:50.193
Thank God we are not that advanced.

00:09:54.336 --> 00:10:00.829
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:08.650
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:13.990
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

00:10:14.015 --> 00:10:17.458
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:22.448
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

00:10:22.448 --> 00:10:27.778
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:31.324
consuming everyone.

00:10:33.188 --> 00:10:40.319
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

00:10:40.628 --> 00:10:46.012
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

00:10:46.669 --> 00:10:53.253
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:56.872
some far fetched places like Peru.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:05.116
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:12.888
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:18.758
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:22.901
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this,

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:24.328
we are going to that.

00:11:24.328 --> 00:11:28.058
What about going inside in the ascent?

00:11:31.728 --> 00:11:40.015
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:45.087
But you are seeing it from the outside.

00:11:45.112 --> 00:11:50.852
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

00:11:52.098 --> 00:11:56.882
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:58.993
to find what?

00:12:00.858 --> 00:12:08.738
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:11.688
Awareness reached there also.

00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:17.918
Then it has gone further.

00:12:17.918 --> 00:12:25.608
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:32.438
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:34.748
Creator Brahmadeva.

00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:45.619
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:48.428
is the support of human life.

00:12:48.428 --> 00:12:54.558
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:12:54.558 --> 00:13:02.238
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:09.509
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points,

00:13:09.534 --> 00:13:11.589
I can tell you.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:21.086
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth

00:13:21.111 --> 00:13:23.308
beyond Ganesha.

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:29.928
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

00:13:29.928 --> 00:13:35.935
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:42.913
Where our awareness is going today?

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:49.368
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

00:13:49.368 --> 00:13:56.488
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

00:13:56.488 --> 00:14:00.188
What about the urdvagati?

00:14:00.188 --> 00:14:04.820
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:10.238
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

00:14:10.238 --> 00:14:15.498
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:18.808
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

00:14:18.808 --> 00:14:25.929
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:34.118
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that

00:14:34.118 --> 00:14:36.306
sixth chapter is tabooed.

00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:40.136
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:45.866
Why?

00:14:46.024 --> 00:14:51.801
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

00:14:52.197 --> 00:14:57.228
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:08.088
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

00:15:08.088 --> 00:15:18.868
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:25.268
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

00:15:25.268 --> 00:15:27.903
He did not say; that was not the time.

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:34.118
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

00:15:34.118 --> 00:15:38.378
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:46.390
Marx   said that we would like to have a country
without State.

00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:47.287
How?

00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:49.274
How will you have?

00:15:49.502 --> 00:15:55.908
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

00:15:55.908 --> 00:16:02.208
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

00:16:03.152 --> 00:16:04.430
Free?

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:05.819
Abandonment.

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:09.488
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

00:16:09.488 --> 00:16:14.454
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:16.448
nobody can help you.

00:16:16.448 --> 00:16:24.438
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

00:16:24.438 --> 00:16:32.089
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:36.738
It has not given what it had promised.

00:16:36.738 --> 00:16:50.944
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:54.127
life beyond life.

00:16:55.309 --> 00:17:05.382
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.348
How, is the point?

00:17:09.348 --> 00:17:18.767
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:21.237
talked about the Resurrection.

00:17:21.237 --> 00:17:24.747
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:26.636
Who’s bothered about that?

00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:30.517
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:37.632
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:40.295
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

00:17:40.422 --> 00:17:42.504
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:49.267
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:53.617
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:18:01.186
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all

00:18:01.211 --> 00:18:02.978
fighting about it.

00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:14.698
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:28.085
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.804
of the whole.

00:18:30.173 --> 00:18:33.222
It’s not just a mental conception.

00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:35.767
This is the point we miss every time.

00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:44.470
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections

00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:46.144
of human beings.

00:18:46.684 --> 00:18:55.718
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

00:18:55.718 --> 00:18:57.527
you are caught up.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.396
You have to get out of it.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:09.808
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:11.027
Saundarya Lahiri.

00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:12.314
Who says that?

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:14.268
Intellectuals again.

00:19:16.117 --> 00:19:18.587
What makes them think that he did not write?

00:19:18.738 --> 00:19:21.078
They have explanations for everything.

00:19:21.103 --> 00:19:27.971
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

00:19:28.517 --> 00:19:35.808
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:39.307
and not through discussions.

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:49.658
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

00:19:49.658 --> 00:19:51.348
awakened within us.

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:54.867
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:59.917
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

00:19:59.917 --> 00:20:02.238
talk about Self-Realization”.

00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:04.568
Same with Mahavira.

00:20:04.568 --> 00:20:07.064
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

00:20:07.089 --> 00:20:08.230
God alone knows.

00:20:08.255 --> 00:20:10.416
Where are they?

00:20:13.438 --> 00:20:23.338
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:29.047
A special time is a time of real blossom.

00:20:29.047 --> 00:20:33.478
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

00:20:33.478 --> 00:20:41.188
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

00:20:41.188 --> 00:20:51.128
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

00:20:51.128 --> 00:20:56.198
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

00:20:56.198 --> 00:20:58.328
heads and they just finish off there.

00:20:58.328 --> 00:21:04.957
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

00:21:05.243 --> 00:21:09.157
They do not want to go any further.

00:21:12.223 --> 00:21:18.833
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

00:21:18.858 --> 00:21:22.848
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:31.878
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

00:21:31.878 --> 00:21:39.988
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

00:21:39.988 --> 00:21:49.232
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

00:21:49.978 --> 00:21:55.828
The left we use when we desire.

00:21:55.828 --> 00:21:59.958
The right we use when we act.

00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:07.107
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

00:22:07.107 --> 00:22:12.958
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:24.138
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

00:22:24.138 --> 00:22:32.590
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:40.598
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

00:22:40.598 --> 00:22:45.718
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

00:22:45.718 --> 00:22:47.328
other things took place.

00:22:47.328 --> 00:22:50.518
And afterwards we are today human beings.

00:22:51.644 --> 00:22:53.479
But why?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.657
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

00:22:59.833 --> 00:23:02.423
To seek what?

00:23:02.448 --> 00:23:06.914
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:12.134
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

00:23:12.907 --> 00:23:22.828
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:27.257
But you are the Spirit.

00:23:27.257 --> 00:23:34.088
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

00:23:34.088 --> 00:23:35.998
without Self-Realization.

00:23:36.078 --> 00:23:41.328
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:43.188
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:47.117
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

00:23:47.117 --> 00:23:55.348
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:57.345
What does He say?

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:03.346
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:06.988
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:09.221
means you are a realized soul.

00:24:09.246 --> 00:24:14.208
Logically let us see what does it mean?

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:19.907
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:23.548
The connection has to be established.

00:24:23.581 --> 00:24:27.427
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on

00:24:27.452 --> 00:24:29.558
supporting Him doing anything you like.

00:24:29.558 --> 00:24:36.856
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

00:24:39.068 --> 00:24:41.887
Something in the air.

00:24:41.887 --> 00:24:45.147
‘Ananya bhakti’.

00:24:45.147 --> 00:24:47.988
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

00:24:47.988 --> 00:24:52.417
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

00:24:52.417 --> 00:25:04.572
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing

00:25:04.597 --> 00:25:07.008
at the Lotus Feet   of the Lord.

00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:13.909
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:17.164
Before Realization you cannot do this.

00:25:17.189 --> 00:25:21.858
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:27.367
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.792
What does that mean?

00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:38.884
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:48.287
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

00:25:48.287 --> 00:25:54.667
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.”

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:59.657
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

00:26:00.657 --> 00:26:06.588
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

00:26:06.588 --> 00:26:10.377
a very rich man and all those things.

00:26:10.377 --> 00:26:12.661
So he could not get his Realization.

00:26:12.963 --> 00:26:16.188
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.”

00:26:16.215 --> 00:26:17.398
I said, “You give him.”

00:26:17.423 --> 00:26:19.913
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.”

00:26:20.429 --> 00:26:25.419
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

00:26:25.753 --> 00:26:28.953
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:33.062
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.”

00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:38.127
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:39.127
I said, “That’s it.

00:26:39.127 --> 00:26:46.558
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

00:26:46.558 --> 00:26:50.758
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.”

00:26:50.886 --> 00:26:52.513
She agreed there.

00:26:52.538 --> 00:26:56.088
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

00:26:56.088 --> 00:27:01.007
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

00:27:01.007 --> 00:27:03.308
You don’t say that you are doing it.

00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:09.750
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

00:27:10.012 --> 00:27:14.450
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.”

00:27:14.562 --> 00:27:17.837
In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

00:27:18.107 --> 00:27:24.622
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

00:27:26.257 --> 00:27:31.867
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:41.114
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

00:27:41.139 --> 00:27:45.178
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

00:27:45.178 --> 00:27:50.969
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

00:27:52.548 --> 00:27:56.848
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

00:27:56.848 --> 00:28:07.127
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

00:28:07.127 --> 00:28:16.772
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:24.925
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.552
with little subtler feelings about it.

00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:37.667
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:42.315
formless and here is standing in the form.

00:28:42.577 --> 00:28:46.318
Where do you find these talks these days?

00:28:46.318 --> 00:28:52.517
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

00:28:52.517 --> 00:29:04.297
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:08.047
– the formless and here it is in the form.

00:29:08.352 --> 00:29:10.232
But he was a tailor.

00:29:10.257 --> 00:29:14.575
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

00:29:15.237 --> 00:29:27.228
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

00:29:27.228 --> 00:29:34.078
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:43.925
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

00:29:44.044 --> 00:29:50.048
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

00:29:50.048 --> 00:29:58.480
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

00:29:58.512 --> 00:30:02.478
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

00:30:02.478 --> 00:30:09.848
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

00:30:09.848 --> 00:30:18.048
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

00:30:18.073 --> 00:30:22.980
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

00:30:23.448 --> 00:30:29.928
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:37.356
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

00:30:37.381 --> 00:30:38.907
has to work out.

00:30:38.907 --> 00:30:48.545
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:56.568
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

00:30:56.568 --> 00:31:03.027
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

00:31:03.027 --> 00:31:12.117
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

00:31:12.117 --> 00:31:19.407
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

00:31:19.407 --> 00:31:25.472
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

00:31:25.941 --> 00:31:31.887
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

00:31:31.887 --> 00:31:33.907
accelerate the third one.

00:31:33.907 --> 00:31:46.948
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:54.987
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

00:31:54.987 --> 00:31:58.527
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

00:31:58.527 --> 00:32:03.861
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

00:32:03.886 --> 00:32:06.276
is the power of love of God.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:16.138
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

00:32:16.138 --> 00:32:17.138
First He said ‘yoga’.

00:32:17.138 --> 00:32:19.587
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

00:32:19.936 --> 00:32:26.636
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

00:32:26.937 --> 00:32:30.237
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

00:32:30.237 --> 00:32:35.036
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

00:32:35.061 --> 00:32:44.745
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:49.344
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means,

00:32:49.369 --> 00:32:52.415
how many saints there are in your country.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:59.582
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

00:32:59.607 --> 00:33:02.667
day show its merit to the whole world.

00:33:02.667 --> 00:33:13.407
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:19.167
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

00:33:19.167 --> 00:33:22.448
no idea as to where you are born?

00:33:22.448 --> 00:33:24.669
What is your heritage?

00:33:24.788 --> 00:33:30.556
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

00:33:32.607 --> 00:33:46.897
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

00:33:46.897 --> 00:33:56.627
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

00:33:56.627 --> 00:34:03.008
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

00:34:03.008 --> 00:34:07.018
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:20.248
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

00:34:20.248 --> 00:34:37.777
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:43.628
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

00:34:43.628 --> 00:34:51.128
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

00:34:51.153 --> 00:34:55.740
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

00:34:55.765 --> 00:34:57.618
May God bless you all.

00:34:57.618 --> 00:35:09.258
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

00:35:09.258 --> 00:35:10.679
Try to understand.

00:35:10.704 --> 00:35:17.566
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:21.738
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

00:35:21.738 --> 00:35:26.248
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

00:35:26.248 --> 00:35:31.888
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

00:35:31.888 --> 00:35:35.577
God is not going to fall at your feet.

00:35:35.577 --> 00:35:39.658
You have to ask for it.

00:35:39.658 --> 00:35:43.522
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

00:35:43.776 --> 00:35:51.978
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

00:35:51.978 --> 00:36:00.625
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.849
Saab and Shri Krishna.

00:36:02.913 --> 00:36:05.282
They are all one together.

00:36:05.536 --> 00:36:10.507
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

00:36:10.837 --> 00:36:12.448
” Who wants to see that?

00:36:13.369 --> 00:36:15.928
Who are those?

00:36:15.928 --> 00:36:23.438
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

00:36:23.438 --> 00:36:29.128
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

00:36:29.128 --> 00:36:31.765
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

00:36:31.877 --> 00:36:36.638
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

00:36:36.638 --> 00:36:38.678
But not in our villages.

00:36:38.678 --> 00:36:45.688
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

00:36:45.688 --> 00:36:49.178
all this and this, My Indian English.

00:36:49.178 --> 00:36:55.557
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

00:36:55.582 --> 00:36:59.498
went inside or maybe under their feet.

00:36:59.982 --> 00:37:05.898
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

00:37:05.898 --> 00:37:12.329
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

00:37:12.354 --> 00:37:17.438
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

00:37:17.438 --> 00:37:20.557
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

00:37:20.557 --> 00:37:23.068
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

00:37:23.093 --> 00:37:24.780
Humko atma gyan.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:32.068
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

00:37:32.068 --> 00:37:37.671
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:40.651
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

00:37:40.676 --> 00:37:46.350
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

00:37:46.453 --> 00:37:49.342
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

00:37:49.375 --> 00:37:55.132
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

00:37:55.157 --> 00:37:59.913
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

00:37:59.938 --> 00:38:03.974
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:05.609
We should be transformed.

00:38:05.634 --> 00:38:11.542
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

00:38:11.947 --> 00:38:19.996
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:23.630
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized;

00:38:23.655 --> 00:38:26.880
when they were here we were better off.

00:38:27.229 --> 00:38:40.057
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

00:38:40.082 --> 00:38:48.674
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

00:38:48.699 --> 00:38:52.741
done as a yogi.

00:38:53.297 --> 00:39:00.606
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:09.793
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

00:39:09.818 --> 00:39:21.447
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

00:39:21.472 --> 00:39:25.729
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:26.990
that, maybe.

00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:31.765
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:36.696
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

00:39:36.721 --> 00:39:37.971
[pratigya?

00:39:38.073 --> 00:39:40.777
May God bless you.
