WEBVTT

00:03.198 --> 00:13.838
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:13.838 --> 00:27.968
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

00:27.968 --> 00:36.076
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

00:39.060 --> 00:55.998
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

00:55.998 --> 01:00.218
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

01:00.218 --> 01:13.578
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

01:13.578 --> 01:25.927
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

01:25.927 --> 01:35.468
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

01:37.894 --> 01:41.790
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

01:41.815 --> 01:43.979
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

01:44.004 --> 01:48.951
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

01:48.976 --> 01:53.125
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

01:53.150 --> 01:54.701
to bend our ways.].

01:54.908 --> 02:06.227
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

02:07.778 --> 02:19.968
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

02:19.968 --> 02:29.325
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him

02:29.350 --> 02:33.790
as far as the hinsa is concerned.

02:35.848 --> 02:40.878
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

02:40.878 --> 02:43.379
mosquitoes of Delhi.

02:43.451 --> 03:02.278
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

03:02.278 --> 03:16.898
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

03:16.898 --> 03:23.613
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.”

03:24.018 --> 03:32.188
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

03:32.188 --> 03:34.862
Because they were not enlightened people,

03:34.887 --> 03:38.772
are already dead people their eyes are not open.

03:39.034 --> 03:42.979
Whom are You going to kill here?

03:43.074 --> 03:49.428
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma."

03:50.428 --> 03:56.469
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

03:56.469 --> 03:59.973
sort of a ism; it is not.

03:59.998 --> 04:08.128
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

04:08.128 --> 04:10.558
ten valencies in a human being.

04:10.558 --> 04:17.238
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

04:19.336 --> 04:26.358
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

04:26.358 --> 04:39.198
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

04:39.198 --> 04:43.238
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

04:43.238 --> 05:01.308
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

05:01.308 --> 05:15.747
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

05:15.772 --> 05:26.465
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your  .”

05:27.059 --> 05:33.708
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

05:33.708 --> 05:42.574
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

05:42.812 --> 05:48.856
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and

05:48.881 --> 05:52.190
what was He doing at that time?”

05:53.237 --> 05:57.736
And Arjuna killed Karna.

06:00.792 --> 06:03.375
This is Dharma.

06:06.517 --> 06:17.451
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

06:17.476 --> 06:23.188
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

06:23.598 --> 06:27.907
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent

06:27.932 --> 06:30.432
because you do not agree with some people.

06:31.444 --> 06:36.926
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

06:37.647 --> 06:47.027
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

06:47.027 --> 06:52.926
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

06:55.147 --> 07:04.713
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

07:04.738 --> 07:11.907
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

07:15.408 --> 07:20.403
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

07:20.428 --> 07:23.087
That is not Krishna’s message.

07:25.132 --> 07:30.423
He showed His love by killing the demons.

07:32.848 --> 07:41.740
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

07:41.765 --> 07:45.465
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him

07:45.490 --> 07:48.144
with some new subject matters.

07:48.169 --> 07:54.168
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

07:54.168 --> 07:57.497
point one should try to see.

07:59.578 --> 08:13.247
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

08:13.247 --> 08:20.762
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

08:21.818 --> 08:30.630
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

08:31.138 --> 08:41.128
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

08:41.128 --> 08:44.678
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

08:44.678 --> 08:49.798
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

08:51.266 --> 08:59.588
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

08:59.588 --> 09:07.948
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

09:08.694 --> 09:15.498
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

09:15.498 --> 09:22.014
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated,

09:22.039 --> 09:24.629
intellectuals, whatever you may call them.

09:25.010 --> 09:32.655
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

09:32.893 --> 09:41.698
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

09:41.698 --> 09:47.021
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

09:47.529 --> 09:50.193
Thank God we are not that advanced.

09:54.336 --> 10:00.829
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

10:00.829 --> 10:08.650
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

10:09.768 --> 10:13.990
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

10:14.015 --> 10:17.458
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

10:17.458 --> 10:22.448
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

10:22.448 --> 10:27.778
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

10:27.778 --> 10:31.324
consuming everyone.

10:33.188 --> 10:40.319
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

10:40.628 --> 10:46.012
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

10:46.669 --> 10:53.253
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into

10:53.278 --> 10:56.872
some far fetched places like Peru.

10:59.179 --> 11:05.116
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

11:06.086 --> 11:12.888
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

11:14.868 --> 11:18.758
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

11:18.758 --> 11:22.901
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this,

11:22.926 --> 11:24.328
we are going to that.

11:24.328 --> 11:28.058
What about going inside in the ascent?

11:31.728 --> 11:40.015
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

11:40.729 --> 11:45.087
But you are seeing it from the outside.

11:45.112 --> 11:50.852
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

11:52.098 --> 11:56.882
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes

11:56.907 --> 11:58.993
to find what?

12:00.858 --> 12:08.738
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

12:08.738 --> 12:11.688
Awareness reached there also.

12:13.595 --> 12:17.918
Then it has gone further.

12:17.918 --> 12:25.608
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

12:25.608 --> 12:32.438
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

12:32.438 --> 12:34.748
Creator Brahmadeva.

12:34.748 --> 12:45.619
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

12:45.619 --> 12:48.428
is the support of human life.

12:48.428 --> 12:54.558
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

12:54.558 --> 13:02.238
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

13:04.392 --> 13:09.509
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points,

13:09.534 --> 13:11.589
I can tell you.

13:13.060 --> 13:21.086
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth

13:21.111 --> 13:23.308
beyond Ganesha.

13:23.308 --> 13:29.928
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

13:29.928 --> 13:35.935
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

13:37.238 --> 13:42.913
Where our awareness is going today?

13:44.198 --> 13:49.368
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

13:49.368 --> 13:56.488
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

13:56.488 --> 14:00.188
What about the urdvagati?

14:00.188 --> 14:04.820
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

14:04.845 --> 14:10.238
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

14:10.238 --> 14:15.498
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

14:15.498 --> 14:18.808
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

14:18.808 --> 14:25.929
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

14:26.858 --> 14:34.118
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that

14:34.118 --> 14:36.306
sixth chapter is tabooed.

14:36.331 --> 14:40.136
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

14:44.537 --> 14:45.866
Why?

14:46.024 --> 14:51.801
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

14:52.197 --> 14:57.228
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

14:58.398 --> 15:08.088
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

15:08.088 --> 15:18.868
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

15:18.868 --> 15:25.268
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

15:25.268 --> 15:27.903
He did not say; that was not the time.

15:27.928 --> 15:34.118
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

15:34.118 --> 15:38.378
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

15:40.655 --> 15:46.390
Marx   said that we would like to have a country
without State.

15:46.415 --> 15:47.287
How?

15:47.941 --> 15:49.274
How will you have?

15:49.502 --> 15:55.908
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

15:55.908 --> 16:02.208
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

16:03.152 --> 16:04.430
Free?

16:04.525 --> 16:05.819
Abandonment.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.488
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

16:09.488 --> 16:14.454
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood

16:14.479 --> 16:16.448
nobody can help you.

16:16.448 --> 16:24.438
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

16:24.438 --> 16:32.089
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

16:32.366 --> 16:36.738
It has not given what it had promised.

16:36.738 --> 16:50.944
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

16:50.969 --> 16:54.127
life beyond life.

16:55.309 --> 17:05.382
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.348
How, is the point?

17:09.348 --> 17:18.767
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

17:18.767 --> 17:21.237
talked about the Resurrection.

17:21.237 --> 17:24.747
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

17:24.939 --> 17:26.636
Who’s bothered about that?

17:26.661 --> 17:30.517
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

17:33.380 --> 17:37.632
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.295
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

17:40.422 --> 17:42.504
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

17:42.529 --> 17:49.267
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

17:49.267 --> 17:53.617
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

17:54.710 --> 18:01.186
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all

18:01.211 --> 18:02.978
fighting about it.

18:06.631 --> 18:14.698
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

18:14.698 --> 18:28.085
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel

18:28.110 --> 18:29.804
of the whole.

18:30.173 --> 18:33.222
It’s not just a mental conception.

18:33.269 --> 18:35.767
This is the point we miss every time.

18:35.767 --> 18:44.470
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections

18:44.495 --> 18:46.144
of human beings.

18:46.684 --> 18:55.718
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

18:55.718 --> 18:57.527
you are caught up.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.396
You have to get out of it.

19:02.287 --> 19:09.808
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write

19:09.833 --> 19:11.027
Saundarya Lahiri.

19:11.052 --> 19:12.314
Who says that?

19:12.339 --> 19:14.268
Intellectuals again.

19:16.117 --> 19:18.587
What makes them think that he did not write?

19:18.738 --> 19:21.078
They have explanations for everything.

19:21.103 --> 19:27.971
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

19:28.517 --> 19:35.808
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

19:35.808 --> 19:39.307
and not through discussions.

19:39.858 --> 19:49.658
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

19:49.658 --> 19:51.348
awakened within us.

19:51.348 --> 19:54.867
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

19:54.867 --> 19:59.917
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

19:59.917 --> 20:02.238
talk about Self-Realization”.

20:02.238 --> 20:04.568
Same with Mahavira.

20:04.568 --> 20:07.064
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

20:07.089 --> 20:08.230
God alone knows.

20:08.255 --> 20:10.416
Where are they?

20:13.438 --> 20:23.338
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

20:23.338 --> 20:29.047
A special time is a time of real blossom.

20:29.047 --> 20:33.478
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

20:33.478 --> 20:41.188
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

20:41.188 --> 20:51.128
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

20:51.128 --> 20:56.198
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

20:56.198 --> 20:58.328
heads and they just finish off there.

20:58.328 --> 21:04.957
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

21:05.243 --> 21:09.157
They do not want to go any further.

21:12.223 --> 21:18.833
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

21:18.858 --> 21:22.848
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

21:22.848 --> 21:31.878
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

21:31.878 --> 21:39.988
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

21:39.988 --> 21:49.232
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

21:49.978 --> 21:55.828
The left we use when we desire.

21:55.828 --> 21:59.958
The right we use when we act.

21:59.958 --> 22:07.107
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

22:07.107 --> 22:12.958
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

22:12.958 --> 22:24.138
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

22:24.138 --> 22:32.590
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

22:32.590 --> 22:40.598
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

22:40.598 --> 22:45.718
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

22:45.718 --> 22:47.328
other things took place.

22:47.328 --> 22:50.518
And afterwards we are today human beings.

22:51.644 --> 22:53.479
But why?

22:53.840 --> 22:58.657
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

22:59.833 --> 23:02.423
To seek what?

23:02.448 --> 23:06.914
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

23:07.208 --> 23:12.134
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

23:12.907 --> 23:22.828
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

23:22.828 --> 23:27.257
But you are the Spirit.

23:27.257 --> 23:34.088
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

23:34.088 --> 23:35.998
without Self-Realization.

23:36.078 --> 23:41.328
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

23:41.328 --> 23:43.188
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

23:43.188 --> 23:47.117
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

23:47.117 --> 23:55.348
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

23:55.348 --> 23:57.345
What does He say?

23:57.370 --> 24:03.346
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

24:03.371 --> 24:06.988
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

24:06.988 --> 24:09.221
means you are a realized soul.

24:09.246 --> 24:14.208
Logically let us see what does it mean?

24:14.208 --> 24:19.907
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

24:21.239 --> 24:23.548
The connection has to be established.

24:23.581 --> 24:27.427
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on

24:27.452 --> 24:29.558
supporting Him doing anything you like.

24:29.558 --> 24:36.856
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

24:39.068 --> 24:41.887
Something in the air.

24:41.887 --> 24:45.147
‘Ananya bhakti’.

24:45.147 --> 24:47.988
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

24:47.988 --> 24:52.417
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

24:52.417 --> 25:04.572
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing

25:04.597 --> 25:07.008
at the Lotus Feet   of the Lord.

25:07.318 --> 25:13.909
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

25:14.099 --> 25:17.164
Before Realization you cannot do this.

25:17.189 --> 25:21.858
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

25:21.858 --> 25:27.367
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

25:29.910 --> 25:31.792
What does that mean?

25:31.871 --> 25:38.884
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

25:39.471 --> 25:48.287
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

25:48.287 --> 25:54.667
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.”

25:54.667 --> 25:59.657
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

26:00.657 --> 26:06.588
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

26:06.588 --> 26:10.377
a very rich man and all those things.

26:10.377 --> 26:12.661
So he could not get his Realization.

26:12.963 --> 26:16.188
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.”

26:16.215 --> 26:17.398
I said, “You give him.”

26:17.423 --> 26:19.913
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.”

26:20.429 --> 26:25.419
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

26:25.753 --> 26:28.953
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

26:28.978 --> 26:33.062
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.”

26:35.065 --> 26:38.127
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

26:38.127 --> 26:39.127
I said, “That’s it.

26:39.127 --> 26:46.558
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

26:46.558 --> 26:50.758
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.”

26:50.886 --> 26:52.513
She agreed there.

26:52.538 --> 26:56.088
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

26:56.088 --> 27:01.007
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

27:01.007 --> 27:03.308
You don’t say that you are doing it.

27:03.308 --> 27:09.750
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

27:10.012 --> 27:14.450
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.”

27:14.562 --> 27:17.837
In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

27:18.107 --> 27:24.622
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

27:26.257 --> 27:31.867
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

27:31.930 --> 27:41.114
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

27:41.139 --> 27:45.178
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

27:45.178 --> 27:50.969
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

27:52.548 --> 27:56.848
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

27:56.848 --> 28:07.127
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

28:07.127 --> 28:16.772
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

28:19.406 --> 28:24.925
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand

28:24.950 --> 28:29.552
with little subtler feelings about it.

28:30.091 --> 28:37.667
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

28:37.667 --> 28:42.315
formless and here is standing in the form.

28:42.577 --> 28:46.318
Where do you find these talks these days?

28:46.318 --> 28:52.517
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

28:52.517 --> 29:04.297
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

29:04.297 --> 29:08.047
– the formless and here it is in the form.

29:08.352 --> 29:10.232
But he was a tailor.

29:10.257 --> 29:14.575
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

29:15.237 --> 29:27.228
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

29:27.228 --> 29:34.078
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

29:34.078 --> 29:43.925
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

29:44.044 --> 29:50.048
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

29:50.048 --> 29:58.480
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

29:58.512 --> 30:02.478
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

30:02.478 --> 30:09.848
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

30:09.848 --> 30:18.048
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

30:18.073 --> 30:22.980
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

30:23.448 --> 30:29.928
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

30:29.928 --> 30:37.356
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

30:37.381 --> 30:38.907
has to work out.

30:38.907 --> 30:48.545
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

30:48.570 --> 30:56.568
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

30:56.568 --> 31:03.027
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

31:03.027 --> 31:12.117
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

31:12.117 --> 31:19.407
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

31:19.407 --> 31:25.472
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

31:25.941 --> 31:31.887
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

31:31.887 --> 31:33.907
accelerate the third one.

31:33.907 --> 31:46.948
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

31:46.948 --> 31:54.987
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

31:54.987 --> 31:58.527
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

31:58.527 --> 32:03.861
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

32:03.886 --> 32:06.276
is the power of love of God.

32:09.310 --> 32:16.138
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

32:16.138 --> 32:17.138
First He said ‘yoga’.

32:17.138 --> 32:19.587
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

32:19.936 --> 32:26.636
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

32:26.937 --> 32:30.237
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

32:30.237 --> 32:35.036
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

32:35.061 --> 32:44.745
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

32:44.958 --> 32:49.344
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means,

32:49.369 --> 32:52.415
how many saints there are in your country.

32:52.440 --> 32:59.582
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

32:59.607 --> 33:02.667
day show its merit to the whole world.

33:02.667 --> 33:13.407
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

33:13.407 --> 33:19.167
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

33:19.167 --> 33:22.448
no idea as to where you are born?

33:22.448 --> 33:24.669
What is your heritage?

33:24.788 --> 33:30.556
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

33:32.607 --> 33:46.897
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

33:46.897 --> 33:56.627
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

33:56.627 --> 34:03.008
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

34:03.008 --> 34:07.018
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

34:07.018 --> 34:20.248
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

34:20.248 --> 34:37.777
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

34:37.777 --> 34:43.628
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

34:43.628 --> 34:51.128
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

34:51.153 --> 34:55.740
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

34:55.765 --> 34:57.618
May God bless you all.

34:57.618 --> 35:09.258
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

35:09.258 --> 35:10.679
Try to understand.

35:10.704 --> 35:17.566
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

35:17.591 --> 35:21.738
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

35:21.738 --> 35:26.248
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

35:26.248 --> 35:31.888
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

35:31.888 --> 35:35.577
God is not going to fall at your feet.

35:35.577 --> 35:39.658
You have to ask for it.

35:39.658 --> 35:43.522
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

35:43.776 --> 35:51.978
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

35:51.978 --> 36:00.625
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

36:00.650 --> 36:02.849
Saab and Shri Krishna.

36:02.913 --> 36:05.282
They are all one together.

36:05.536 --> 36:10.507
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

36:10.837 --> 36:12.448
” Who wants to see that?

36:13.369 --> 36:15.928
Who are those?

36:15.928 --> 36:23.438
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

36:23.438 --> 36:29.128
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

36:29.128 --> 36:31.765
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

36:31.877 --> 36:36.638
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

36:36.638 --> 36:38.678
But not in our villages.

36:38.678 --> 36:45.688
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

36:45.688 --> 36:49.178
all this and this, My Indian English.

36:49.178 --> 36:55.557
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

36:55.582 --> 36:59.498
went inside or maybe under their feet.

36:59.982 --> 37:05.898
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

37:05.898 --> 37:12.329
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

37:12.354 --> 37:17.438
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

37:17.438 --> 37:20.557
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

37:20.557 --> 37:23.068
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

37:23.093 --> 37:24.780
Humko atma gyan.

37:25.050 --> 37:32.068
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

37:32.068 --> 37:37.671
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

37:37.719 --> 37:40.651
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

37:40.676 --> 37:46.350
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

37:46.453 --> 37:49.342
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

37:49.375 --> 37:55.132
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

37:55.157 --> 37:59.913
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

37:59.938 --> 38:03.974
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

38:04.071 --> 38:05.609
We should be transformed.

38:05.634 --> 38:11.542
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

38:11.947 --> 38:19.996
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

38:20.021 --> 38:23.630
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized;

38:23.655 --> 38:26.880
when they were here we were better off.

38:27.229 --> 38:40.057
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

38:40.082 --> 38:48.674
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

38:48.699 --> 38:52.741
done as a yogi.

38:53.297 --> 39:00.606
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

39:01.159 --> 39:09.793
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

39:09.818 --> 39:21.447
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

39:21.472 --> 39:25.729
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

39:25.770 --> 39:26.990
that, maybe.

39:27.015 --> 39:31.765
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

39:31.790 --> 39:36.696
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

39:36.721 --> 39:37.971
[pratigya?

39:38.073 --> 39:40.777
May God bless you.
