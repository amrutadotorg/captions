00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,960
Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

2
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:14,669
It is a very important Guru Puja today

3
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:24,150
because we have completed twenty-five 
years of Guru Puja.

4
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:33,405
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating 
manner".)

5
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:06,389
Also, it is extremely beautiful

6
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:19,017
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are, 
really have become, very great.

7
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:29,811
It’s a question of understanding what 
Sahaja Yoga is.

8
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:34,834
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

9
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:44,837
that people who were seeking the Truth 
have found it

10
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:55,587
and have now got it absolutely on their 
central nervous system.

11
00:03:57,202 --> 00:04:00,812
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to 
explain

12
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:04,400
how it has happened, how it has worked out

13
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:09,200
and how, in these twenty-five years, we 
have been able

14
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:15,855
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

15
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:27,588
The main thing, I feel, is that you all 
should know

16
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:34,354
that as the tree grows, the roots have 
to grow much deeper

17
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:39,660
and they should spread also. If it doesn't 
happen,

18
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:45,639
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother 
Earth.

19
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,481
So the roots are in your own life, in your 
own heart.

20
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,900
When we say we have become our own Guru,

21
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:07,011
we should really try to find out with our 
introspection:

22
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:11,861
Are we our Guru or not?

23
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,180
Because, before this your mind was on one 
side

24
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:29,226
and your heart was on another side

25
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:34,972
and your attention was in another 
dimension.

26
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:41,732
So these three things were creating 
confusion within you.

27
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:57,146
If you understand a human being, then you 
will be surprised to see

28
00:05:57,347 --> 00:06:05,805
how these three things act separately in a 
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

29
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:10,154
First is your intellect and your mind.

30
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:17,146
Second is your heart, your feelings, your 
emotions.

31
00:06:25,141 --> 00:06:33,555
And the third one is your attention.

32
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:41,232
In these modern times, this confusion is 
the worst

33
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:45,781
because all the time your attention is 
outside.

34
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:52,822
It could be towards beautiful things, or 
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

35
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:59,451
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting 
your energy.

36
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:05,713
Such attention then is absolutely like 
a horse which is let loose.

37
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:08,976
You cannot control such an attention.

38
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:17,064
And this attention runs wild from one 
to another.

39
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:21,131
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very 
popular thing

40
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:25,593
to keep the attention moving all the time.

41
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:31,636
But this attention that has to be towards 
the Divine,

42
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:40,146
towards the Almighty, is just being 
frittered away.

43
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:47,138
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

44
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:54,300
First is to find out about yourself: where 
does your attention go?

45
00:07:54,501 --> 00:08:07,225
What makes you feel like looking after or 
concerned for attention?

46
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:12,229
You see, the attention comes from various 
problems,

47
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:22,797
and could be your upbringing where you are 
not controlled,

48
00:08:27,024 --> 00:08:37,016
could be your education, could be your 
atmosphere in which you live

49
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:42,989
or could be your own ego or your 
conditioning.

50
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:49,628
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold, 
that's why.

51
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:04,167
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

52
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:09,186
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

53
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,539
That's fine".)

54
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:33,446
So, this attention is being attacked

55
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:45,595
by all these outside energies or negative 
forces

56
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:53,174
and it gets entangled - like a river 
flowing

57
00:09:53,375 --> 00:10:02,546
straight into the ocean can get lost 
in a barren place.

58
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:12,450
In the same way this attention, which has 
to go towards the Divine,

59
00:10:12,651 --> 00:10:16,749
gets frittered away and is vanished...

60
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,273
This weak attention cannot take you towards 
the Divine.

61
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:30,213
Ultimately you find that all this attention 
is being completely

62
00:10:30,907 --> 00:10:37,947
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense 
that’s going on.

63
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:43,611
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born 
in these modern times,

64
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:48,963
and in these modern times, as you know, 
it's a very chaotic condition.

65
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:54,164
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know 
what is right and what is wrong.

66
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:59,742
And there are all kinds of attractions,

67
00:10:59,943 --> 00:11:08,858
which can take away your attention and 
reduce the energy of your attention.

68
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,532
It is possible more for the people who are 
very right-sided.

69
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:21,491
Also the left-sided people can be very much 
affected.

70
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:27,299
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to 
a point and become extremely dry,

71
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:34,900
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their 
attention is in aggression,

72
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:41,188
while the people who are on the left side 
are indulging too much

73
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:48,787
into their own whims and their desires and 
their own temptations.

74
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:53,136
Both sides can fritter away your attention

75
00:11:53,337 --> 00:12:00,104
which is the most important thing. It is 
the most valuable thing is your attention.

76
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:04,933
But the attention cannot be controlled by 
a person

77
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:12,845
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak 
heart.

78
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:17,821
Now supposing you take somebody who is 
a very intelligent person.

79
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:22,062
The intelligent person puts all his 
attention

80
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:26,369
in capturing the attention of others.

81
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,247
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of 
a paradox.

82
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:41,396
The person who himself is having such a lot 
of aggressiveness and all that,

83
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:45,766
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very 
nice with people

84
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:54,501
just to keep good relations or, we can say, 
the good behavior

85
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:59,799
towards people so that they pay attention 
to that person.

86
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,949
This is a very subtle thing. They are not 
even aware about it,

87
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:12,087
that we do such a thing just to make others 
pay attention to us.

88
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:15,891
That is how we have seen that in these 
modern times

89
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:21,780
so many stupid things people do just 
to attract the attention of others.

90
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:30,761
Most of the fads that had come up in modern 
times

91
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:39,097
are just to make something stupid so that 
people should pay attention to them.

92
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:46,282
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like 
that. But I am just pointing it out

93
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,562
how, in the modern times, you have to be 
very careful

94
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:56,274
that you should not try to attract 
the attention of others.

95
00:13:56,475 --> 00:14:01,657
Instead of that, what you have to do is 
to pay attention to others

96
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:06,178
in a very subtle way, not with any 
expectation

97
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,325
that if you are paying attention to 
somebody,

98
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:13,725
that person should pay attention to you. 
It’s a very big struggle,

99
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:22,044
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people 
try to, say, become very popular

100
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:30,307
or become very outstanding, or something 
of a very great qualities,

101
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:35,035
to show off that they are something better 
than others.

102
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:40,712
A person who is really in connection with 
the Divine, is least bothered

103
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:45,898
about how people pay attention to that 
person,

104
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:52,674
but automatically the attention of such 
a person is on others,

105
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:56,089
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

106
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,322
You cannot make out that the attention 
of such a person

107
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:06,521
is on you, but it works and it works 
beautifully.

108
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:12,123
We have to understand that we have now come 
to the realm of the Divinity.

109
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:17,220
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are 
divine people.

110
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:21,739
We are very powerful people, but if we 
fritter away

111
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,699
our attention, we become very, very weak 
people.

112
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,696
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja 
Yogis”, “we have done

113
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:37,973
so much of realisation of others” or 
“we have helped so many people.”

114
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:42,033
All this consciousness if it comes within 
you, then know

115
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:46,363
that you are still not fully developed 
Sahaja Yogis.

116
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:52,460
There should be no consciousness of what 
you are doing or what you are committing.

117
00:15:52,661 --> 00:16:00,732
There is no need to boast about it. There 
is no need to advertise it.

118
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:05,250
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen 
by everyone.

119
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:09,198
But even that desire is not needed

120
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,413
because you are doing just for 
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

121
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:20,360
So then, when we come to our heart:

122
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:24,096
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you 
know very well.

123
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:32,008
Now, when it is the heart, which has 
to work over your brain and which can work,

124
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,868
what becomes of you is nothing, but you 
become a source

125
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:40,426
of love and compassion. A source, I am 
saying.

126
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:46,296
You do not assert on others. You do not say 
that, “I’ve done so much for you

127
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:55,660
and what are you doing to me? What is this 
that I should have so much expressed,

128
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,648
in so many ways, and here you are,

129
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:03,225
you are forgetting me and not doing 
anything for me?”

130
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:08,931
So the expectation of reward if it is 
there,

131
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:13,383
then you must know is your mind which is 
giving you these ideas

132
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:20,173
and is working it out that way that you 
just now put attention

133
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:24,106
to the amount of love the other person 
has given you

134
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:31,707
for whatever you have given to another 
person. It's very subtle.

135
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:40,871
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now 
yourself as just a source of love,

136
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:45,012
which is just flowing.

137
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:50,567
In that, you do not say that you have 
to have this or that,

138
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:58,158
or you have to achieve this goal, or you 
have to become that. It's finished now.

139
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:05,234
Once you have become the source, then how 
can you become something?

140
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:11,453
The thing is, those who are receiving from 
the source want to have

141
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:23,414
some sort of a reward or some sort of 
a recognition.

142
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:29,825
In this subtle way if you move, your mind 
is very clever.

143
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:34,952
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever, 
intelligent people.

144
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:42,778
But this mind... You have to be very 
careful because this mind can cheat you.

145
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:49,391
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja 
Yoga?

146
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:54,157
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

147
00:18:55,482 --> 00:19:03,761
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then, 
you have to ask yourself that,

148
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:12,286
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

149
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:19,090
What do I want to achieve? Why I am 
in Sahaja Yoga?"

150
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:24,015
If you ask this question, you will see 
you’ll just dissolve,

151
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:29,497
you'll become thoughtless because there is 
no desire left now.

152
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:33,385
There is no ambition left, no competition.

153
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:38,833
All these qualities are of the brain, or we 
can say, of the intellect,

154
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:44,443
which makes you competitive, which makes 
you also jealous.

155
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:48,694
So jealousy is also a product of this 
competitiveness

156
00:19:48,895 --> 00:19:53,473
because when two persons are competing 
or many are competing

157
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:57,681
and one is selected, others become jealous.

158
00:19:57,882 --> 00:20:03,684
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All 
right. So, one of us has become something,

159
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:06,142
so we should be very happy that he has 
become."

160
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:11,753
On the contrary, the other people feel 
jealous, "Why has he become?

161
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:16,150
Who is he? What does he think of himself?" 
Then they go further.

162
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:21,004
Not you people, but on the whole, people 
go further with it

163
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:26,578
and what do they do is to harm another 
person.

164
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:32,727
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes 
very worried and frightened.

165
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:35,789
There is no need to be worried or 
frightened

166
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:43,128
because now you have become a Sahaja 
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

167
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:49,378
Anybody who tries to touch you will be 
subsided, somehow or other.

168
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:55,659
Of course, I don't do anything as such. 
But today only I heard that in Turkey

169
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,320
there were two newspapers who were after 
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

170
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:09,449
So, the first one met with an accident and 
died. I didn't do that.

171
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,875
The second one had two people, editor 
and sub-editor,

172
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:20,782
were killed and somebody cut their throats. 
Of course, I didn't do that.

173
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,715
Some fundamentalist must have done, or 
somebody must have done.

174
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:28,989
Now, we don't have to worry as to who 
criticizes you, they say it about you

175
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,964
because you must know they are blind 
people.

176
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:38,110
They are absolutely blind, they are not 
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

177
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:42,126
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not 
possible.

178
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:45,684
They go up to a point and then they stop. 
They cannot go further

179
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:48,924
because this dissolution of your being,

180
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:55,306
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

181
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:00,659
It's difficult, specially in the West, 
where there are so many ideas

182
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:08,834
of their own identifications and of their 
own personalities.

183
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:16,537
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we 
don’t want people

184
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:23,597
to dress up indecently or we don’t want 
people to behave indecently.

185
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:28,315
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

186
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:33,757
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say 
you have to completely dissolve,

187
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:37,060
then why should we have this dignity?

188
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:40,678
Why should we worry about having 
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

189
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:44,089
This question is all right. The answer is 
like this:

190
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:56,843
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in 
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

191
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:02,229
If you put some poison, then the whole 
ocean can become poisonous.

192
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:09,197
In the same way, whatever is not congenial 
to the ocean,

193
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:13,833
to this Divine power, should not be done.

194
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:20,369
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it. 
We have had experiences.

195
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,490
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders 
also,

196
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:30,498
and they tried to be quite funny and 
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

197
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:36,873
One person who is not a good person can 
spoil the whole collectivity.

198
00:23:37,074 --> 00:23:44,179
The one who is then a leader, on top 
of that, is even worse.

199
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:50,350
So, one has to understand that, when you 
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

200
00:23:50,551 --> 00:23:56,223
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

201
00:23:56,424 --> 00:24:02,343
In that you should not do something that 
will create repulsion, frustration,

202
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:11,957
or even sometimes it can create a very 
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

203
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:16,902
That is why we have to be decent people, 
decorous people.

204
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:24,255
It is not that in any way we want you to be 
like a dandy people or anything,

205
00:24:24,456 --> 00:24:29,814
but what it means that you must respect 
your body, respect yourself

206
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:34,186
and a respectable personality you should 
have.

207
00:24:34,387 --> 00:24:37,399
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

208
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,913
but it should be such that you should 
respect yourself.

209
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,570
It's very important. If you cannot respect 
yourself

210
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:51,778
you cannot respect at all the Divinity 
within you.

211
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:57,862
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that 
your whole behavior,

212
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:02,900
your whole attire has to be in such a way 
that people should know

213
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,906
that he is a decent man.

214
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:12,726
Indecent things have come out and have 
become now an everyday fashion.

215
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:16,642
And they go on coming one after another 
because of the entrepreneurs,

216
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:19,201
and we are playing into the hands 
of entrepreneurs.

217
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:22,423
But if you know what dress you have to wear

218
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:26,296
and what is good for you, once for all you 
have to decide.

219
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:29,830
Now the attention should not be also wasted

220
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:33,180
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind 
of a sari,

221
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,361
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress, 
third day…",

222
00:25:36,562 --> 00:25:41,730
because that also spoils the attention. 
But if it is a decent thing,

223
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:45,490
it's perfectly alright, and that will 
really make you feel

224
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:49,195
dignified within yourself.

225
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:52,178
In modern times, as the people are, I don't 
think

226
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,798
they have much respect for themselves.

227
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:59,933
You see very highly posted people, highly 
placed people

228
00:26:00,134 --> 00:26:04,087
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like 
cheating,

229
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:14,844
like having relations with people who are 
of dishonorable position.

230
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:18,129
All this is happening. If you see 
in the newspaper, you are shocked

231
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,477
how these people at the helm of affairs 
could be like this.

232
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:27,568
Because they are still not matured enough 
to know where are they,

233
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,565
what is their position, how they have 
to be.

234
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:34,997
If you are matured enough then you will 
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

235
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:40,173
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister, 
how I should be.

236
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:46,181
That all that achievement they have outside 
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

237
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:50,201
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed 
within.

238
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:58,000
It has to be absorbed within so that 
the attention is not wasted too much.

239
00:26:59,572 --> 00:27:05,281
The another part which one has to see is 
the heart.

240
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:14,617
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our 
heart is ruling the head,

241
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:19,892
then we become too much emotional, we get 
too much attached to people,

242
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:28,488
we get, you see, sort of individual 
friendships and things like that."

243
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:34,710
On this point, one has to know that why do 
you get attached to one person?

244
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:41,432
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart. 
You get attached to a person

245
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:49,434
because you have some sort of a, we can 
say, a relationship, maybe.

246
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,682
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that 
person.

247
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:58,162
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

248
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:03,678
Something outside quality is attracting you 
towards that person.

249
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:07,613
It is not something inner quality that is 
attracting.

250
00:28:07,814 --> 00:28:13,340
For example, if you are attached to your 
children too much, you will spoil them.

251
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:18,430
They will not come up to your expectations. 
Anybody you get attached to,

252
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:25,081
you must verify, why are you attached 
to such a person, what is the reason?

253
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:30,694
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached 
to each other very much, I know that.

254
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:36,387
But it is not for any external reason. 
Because somebody is rich,

255
00:28:36,588 --> 00:28:40,004
because somebody is famous, because 
somebody is doing

256
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:45,130
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

257
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:53,926
They are attached to that person because 
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

258
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:59,095
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives 
you joy and it gives you

259
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:06,865
a kind of an immense dissolution of your 
being.

260
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:11,150
So, that happens when you are very much 
there,

261
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:17,268
as I have told you the story of once this 
potter

262
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:26,274
was kneading the clay and his name was 
Gorakumhar,

263
00:29:26,475 --> 00:29:29,771
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

264
00:29:29,972 --> 00:29:36,046
but very well known poet, both of them 
were poets, he went and he saw

265
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:43,269
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was 
not a very respectable work he was doing,

266
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:51,241
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked 
at him and what he says that,

267
00:29:51,442 --> 00:30:00,273
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya, 
to see the formless.

268
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:07,525
But what I find that the formless has got 
into a form."

269
00:30:07,726 --> 00:30:14,004
This only, I always say, is only possible 
between the two Saints of the same level.

270
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:18,557
That the way they appreciate, that the way 
they feel -

271
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:22,926
there are no words for what I want to say - 
but the way they feel

272
00:30:23,127 --> 00:30:28,880
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle 
one between each other.

273
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:35,754
Such a feeling if you have for each other, 
then know that you are

274
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:40,657
really now dissolved and you are in 
the ocean of joy.

275
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:46,560
But on the contrary, those who are sitting 
on the shores cannot feel that way.

276
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:51,602
They judge, they try to find out what’s 
wrong with that person, this is not so.

277
00:30:51,803 --> 00:30:56,452
They can never appreciate another person. 
What they feel is that they have a right

278
00:30:56,653 --> 00:31:02,589
to criticize, to find out faults with others 
and that they are something special.

279
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,883
And the other person also finds some faults 
with this person.

280
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:10,482
So it’s a fault-finding society I find 
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

281
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:16,162
But when you see that the another person 
who is there,

282
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:25,429
the person who is another saint, you feel 
such rapport, such oneness,

283
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,916
such a spontaneous feeling for that person 
which is absolutely pure.

284
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:38,468
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental 
activity to find out

285
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:46,059
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no 
judgment about what he, the person is like,

286
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:56,359
but just oneness with that person you feel, 
and you feel that your quality of your love

287
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,223
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

288
00:32:02,533 --> 00:32:06,960
So it comes to that, what we should 
appreciate within ourselves

289
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:13,691
is the purity of our love. When you are 
pure, the purity is there,

290
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:22,405
you do not get attached to anything, but 
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

291
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:28,636
In attachment you cannot enjoy because 
in that

292
00:32:28,837 --> 00:32:37,359
you are bothered more about the superficial 
relationship with the other person.

293
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,927
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja 
Yoga,

294
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:49,553
you are all very important people - 
extremely important -

295
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:56,558
because in the history of spirituality there 
were not so many saints sitting together.

296
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,851
Never can you see so many people from so 
many countries

297
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:06,798
thinking about Divinity and morality.

298
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:13,501
It is impossible to get so many people 
together, on any point whatsoever,

299
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:20,149
who are feeling the oneness, the...

300
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:28,125
you can say, the most soothing feeling 
with each other.

301
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:34,537
Whether it is comfortable or not,

302
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:45,194
whether it is very much according to 
the norms of comfort,

303
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:53,572
people who are saints are absolutely happy 
with other saints

304
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:59,772
and other saintly people. They rush 
to people who are saints.

305
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:03,349
Once it happened to Me when I was 
in Kolhapur

306
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,063
that they told Me, “There is a saint who 
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

307
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:12,125
They said, “He lives up there and it will 
take at least three hours

308
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:16,125
for You to climb up. He only lives there, 
he doesn't come out.”

309
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:19,004
I said, "All right, I would like to go and 
see him."

310
00:34:19,205 --> 00:34:24,788
So, I was walking and it started raining.

311
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,004
So they said, "Mother, You never go 
to anybody like that,

312
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:34,531
why are You going to him?" I said, "No, 
just I want to go up and see him."

313
00:34:34,732 --> 00:34:38,982
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control 
over rain,

314
00:34:39,183 --> 00:34:46,474
but it was raining, raining, raining very 
heavily, and when I climbed up

315
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:52,132
I saw him sitting down and going on like 
this with great anger.

316
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:57,575
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

317
00:34:57,776 --> 00:35:01,424
because this fellow is now not in a normal 
mood."

318
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:08,763
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and 
there he came. He couldn't walk

319
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:15,113
because his... they say that his legs 
became absolutely lame

320
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:19,897
because of the vibrations that were too 
much in him,

321
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:25,809
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they 
brought him there, he sat down.

322
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:31,733
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why 
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

323
00:35:31,934 --> 00:35:38,052
It was raining so heavily, and when You 
were coming up,

324
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:43,398
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way 
now You are all full of water

325
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:50,928
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this 
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

326
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:57,560
So, did You do it just to control my ego, 
because I must have developed ego

327
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,471
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

328
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:04,077
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

329
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:09,477
you are My son, isn't it? And you have 
bought a sari for Me.

330
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:12,672
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take 
a sari from you

331
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:14,919
because sannyasi dharma is different -

332
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,057
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from 
you.

333
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:22,585
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you 
could give Me a sari."

334
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:28,409
The whole temper, the whole unnatural 
behavior, all dropped out.

335
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:32,981
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes," 
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

336
00:36:33,182 --> 00:36:35,962
"At least," I said, "in love you know 
everything."

337
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:41,802
And then he brought a sari for Me and he 
did Aarti and everything.

338
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:49,283
But, you see, all these things show that 
how the love masters everything so easily.

339
00:36:49,484 --> 00:36:57,201
Small, small things, if you are expert 
in expressing your love,

340
00:36:57,402 --> 00:37:02,885
how it works out. There are so many 
incidents I can give you like this.

341
00:37:03,086 --> 00:37:11,616
But the main thing we have to see within 
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

342
00:37:11,817 --> 00:37:19,989
Do we really have affection and compassion 
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

343
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,240
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also 
the blind people.

344
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:29,688
You should have compassion for them.

345
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:34,321
You should feel that these people are so 
unhappy

346
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:38,029
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

347
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,662
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis, 
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

348
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:47,307
So, you must have real compassion for them.

349
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:53,291
If you have this compassion you might be 
told by people that,

350
00:37:53,492 --> 00:37:57,923
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are 
doing this, you are doing that?"

351
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:03,872
The compassion is actually, unites all 
these things within ourselves.

352
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:08,705
That’s the uniting factor. First is your 
attention,

353
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:13,818
first,  which is very, very important, 
I think.

354
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:19,618
And the second one is your intellect, or 
you can say your mind,

355
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:27,263
and the third one is your heart. They all 
get somehow or other united together

356
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:30,929
once you have this capacity to have 
compassion.

357
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,215
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you 
don't have to think about it.

358
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:39,431
You just, you just feel absolutely at home 
when you are compassionate

359
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:44,196
and with this compassion, you are having 
relations with others.

360
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:50,880
Now, this compassion is not studied out 
or worked out or maneuvered.

361
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:56,752
It is just there. It is there. In that 
compassion it forgives,

362
00:38:56,953 --> 00:38:59,480
it forgets all nonsensical things.

363
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:06,293
The forgiveness is only possible if you 
have this compassion within you.

364
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:09,700
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked 
me,

365
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,920
"Mother, how can we have love and 
compassion?"

366
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:18,380
I mean, this is a question which many have 
asked me.

367
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:24,943
Now, the simple thing is that if you 
develop your thoughtless awareness

368
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:29,120
in your meditation, in thoughtless 
awareness,

369
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:33,459
you watch anything in thoughtless 
awareness, any relationship you see it

370
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,581
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be 
amazed

371
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:42,254
how the gates of this compassion will 
open out.

372
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:46,127
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

373
00:39:46,328 --> 00:39:50,604
but it doesn't go to one person or 
to another person,

374
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,942
but it is throwing lights on all the sides 
of your being.

375
00:39:56,143 --> 00:40:05,267
Everybody is benefited, everybody has 
a divine feeling for you.

376
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:14,744
Because this compassion is not linear, 
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

377
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:18,389
and smoothes and soothes everything

378
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:24,454
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and 
that is painful.

379
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,013
This is what you have now.

380
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:30,217
You know, these things were done by saints 
long time back.

381
00:40:30,418 --> 00:40:34,070
But then nobody liked them, and they 
crucified them - out of jealousy.

382
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:38,941
Because if somebody became a saint, then 
people felt very jealous of that person.

383
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:42,999
So they killed them or tortured them and 
troubled them.

384
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:48,127
The situation is not so bad now. Of course, 
there are some useless people.

385
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:56,434
There are some people who are really 
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

386
00:40:56,635 --> 00:41:03,647
But on the whole, our attitude should be 
that these are blind people.

387
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:08,709
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe, 
something wrong with that person,

388
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,887
may not be good-natured - may be anything. 
But in your heart

389
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:18,901
you should not have any grudge, you should 
not have any complaints about them.

390
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:24,868
You can talk to that person about it. You 
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

391
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:30,583
but you should not try to make an issue 
out of it

392
00:41:30,784 --> 00:41:33,879
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture 
anyone.

393
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,582
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put 
off the fan".)

394
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:51,270
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga, 
those people who came and were troublesome

395
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:57,131
and were not of any worth for us, just 
dropped out by themselves.

396
00:41:57,332 --> 00:41:59,792
We didn't have to do much about it. They 
just dropped out

397
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:06,563
and they have gone into some sort of 
a problematic life.

398
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:10,224
I, even now, receive letters from them 
saying that, “We have this problem,

399
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:13,589
we have that problem and how to solve 
this and solve that."

400
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,562
But it’s automatically happening because, 
after all,

401
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:23,475
there is a big choice going on and 
the Divine s trying to decide

402
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:29,088
who are capable of receiving the blessings 
of the Divine.

403
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:31,722
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

404
00:42:31,923 --> 00:42:35,503
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga. 
Nothing else is important.

405
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:41,423
There are people who are very highly 
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

406
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:46,437
There are people who are regarded as very 
great, famous people,

407
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:52,117
they go into dust. It's all the time is 
happening in your presence.

408
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,448
Every day you read a newspaper and you 
find how they are behaving.

409
00:42:57,649 --> 00:43:02,531
Like today, somebody told Me that in 
the newspaper there was there

410
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:10,400
that now one bishop is going to discotheque, 
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

411
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:14,786
Now, what people must be thinking, they 
must be breaking their heads,

412
00:43:14,987 --> 00:43:19,435
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom 
we call as the bishop and everything,

413
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:22,942
is now going to disco."

414
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:28,009
What they, I mean, all whatever he had 
respect,

415
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,127
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost, 
finished.

416
00:43:32,328 --> 00:43:38,821
Because you see, as they are, they have 
no value of themselves.

417
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:43,822
They just live with their ego, "I am such 
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

418
00:43:44,023 --> 00:43:46,767
They walk in a different way, they talk 
in a different way.

419
00:43:46,968 --> 00:43:49,623
And suddenly how they go down.

420
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:51,903
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

421
00:43:52,104 --> 00:43:55,211
to go to the discotheque, I can’t 
understand?

422
00:43:55,412 --> 00:44:01,966
So, because of this kind of life that he 
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

423
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:06,957
he could never see that, “One day I will 
go down like that.”

424
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:10,008
Another thing, which you should see 
in a very wider way,

425
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:15,220
that he had no feeling why people respected 
him.

426
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:20,349
He never knew why people had respect 
for him.

427
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:27,354
Or he was not conscious of it. At least 
he would have preserved that. He did not.

428
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:33,998
Why should he go to a place about which 
he has been always denouncing

429
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:39,581
and saying that these are bad places, one 
should not go there?

430
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:48,125
So, in your case, you have to be conscious 
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

431
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:52,145
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that 
your consciousness has vanished,

432
00:44:52,346 --> 00:44:57,637
but it has enlarged. You have got 
the consciousness of the ocean.

433
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:03,797
You are not the one who has become like 
a mesmerized person

434
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:09,024
or a person who has no connection with 
oneself.

435
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:14,583
On the contrary, you are connected with 
yourself much more than you were before.

436
00:45:14,784 --> 00:45:18,625
So, when you become the ocean you don't 
loose your personality,

437
00:45:18,826 --> 00:45:22,725
but you expand your personality. You become 
a greater person.

438
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:27,936
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am 
noticing many people are developing

439
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:34,101
that kind of a personality, and they are 
expressing it and manifesting it.

440
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:37,095
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

441
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:42,987
I could see such people who are doing this 
kind of thing.

442
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:48,193
So, whenever you are doing something, 
whatever is your enterprise,

443
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:53,209
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is, 
that’s all outside.

444
00:45:53,410 --> 00:46:00,713
One should not lose your attention, which 
is towards God Almighty.

445
00:46:00,914 --> 00:46:05,233
If that is lost, you are lost. There is 
a very nice poem

446
00:46:05,434 --> 00:46:12,746
Namadeva has written about that there 
was a boy who was flying a kite.

447
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:17,354
And the kite was floating, and this boy was 
looking after the kite.

448
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:23,145
And while he was talking to everybody else, 
but his attention was on the kite.

449
00:46:23,346 --> 00:46:29,714
Then it goes further. He says that a lady 
is having the little child

450
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:36,418
on her body, on the waist, and she is 
cleaning the house.

451
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:42,555
She is cleaning with a little broom. She 
has to move

452
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:46,433
from here to there and after that cleaning, 
she has to do other work also.

453
00:46:46,634 --> 00:46:51,938
But the child is here. So, her attention is 
on the child

454
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:55,499
that he should not fall down, something 
should not happen.

455
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,682
Though she is doing all kinds of work, 
everything,

456
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:05,006
her attention is on the child. In the same 
way, your attention should be

457
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:09,380
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

458
00:47:11,272 --> 00:47:14,947
There’s third one he’s described that there 
are many ladies

459
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:19,198
who are taking water from a river.

460
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:22,952
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their 
heads and walking.

461
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:26,334
And while they are walking, they are 
talking to each other,

462
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:29,123
they are telling stories about each other 
and anything,

463
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:34,117
but their attention was on the pitchers, 
which are on their head.

464
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,934
In the same way, whatever we are doing, 
our attention

465
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:41,863
should be on our Kundalini.

466
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:47,959
We should find out what are we doing. 
As it is we have the light.

467
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:54,094
But you must take light into every corner 
of your life,

468
00:47:54,295 --> 00:48:03,137
every aspect of your thinking, every kind 
of an effort you make.

469
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:07,574
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch 
your attention

470
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:10,904
you will really know what you are doing.

471
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:14,063
It’s the attention to be watched so much

472
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:22,940
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that 
the attention is no more frittering away.

473
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:27,549
Without the attention you cannot work out 
Sahaja Yoga.

474
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:34,282
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga, 
is that your attention has to be

475
00:48:34,483 --> 00:48:39,555
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing 
can work out.

476
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:43,089
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you 
have come to Sahaja Yoga

477
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:46,106
to make money, all right, you will make 
money and get out.

478
00:48:46,307 --> 00:48:49,458
If you have come here to show off your 
knowledge and all that,

479
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:53,661
you will show it and get out. If you have 
come here to show

480
00:48:53,862 --> 00:48:59,829
your power and your authority, you stay 
there and get out.

481
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,644
Like that many people have gone out if you 
know.

482
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:09,527
And this is what is to be really taken 
care of: that you don’t try

483
00:49:09,728 --> 00:49:13,585
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid 
things,

484
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:21,040
which are not permanent, which are not 
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

485
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:29,575
for cleansing yourself, for becoming 
the ocean, the ocean of love.

486
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:36,999
Now, many people also feel that love is 
rather difficult,

487
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,423
because you can be harmed by others, or 
somebody can take advantage of you.

488
00:49:44,624 --> 00:49:52,134
The main thing about love is, if it is not 
a pure love, then it creates problems.

489
00:49:52,335 --> 00:49:55,034
Supposing you trust somebody because 
of money,

490
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:57,604
trust somebody because of somebody… 
relationship

491
00:49:57,805 --> 00:50:00,485
or anything, and you go on indulging 
into it,

492
00:50:00,686 --> 00:50:07,081
ultimately you’ll find that you will be 
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

493
00:50:07,282 --> 00:50:15,685
But supposing you show your love, just 
with purity about that person...

494
00:50:15,886 --> 00:50:25,785
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you, 
built in. It’s there.

495
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:33,149
We have to just open out. Every human being 
is a bundle of love.

496
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:36,957
And when he is afraid of others - specially 
in the West,

497
00:50:37,158 --> 00:50:39,134
there is so many ideas they have created

498
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:44,556
that you are afraid of this kind of love 
and that kind of love and

499
00:50:44,757 --> 00:50:48,438
you see the way the perversion and 
all nonsense is there.

500
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:55,689
But in pure love there is a kind of 
a beautiful light

501
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:03,333
which protects you, which guides you and 
which enlightens your life completely.

502
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:14,961
This light is just nourished and also, we 
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

503
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:22,358
this is the one that is for our 
spirituality: the Love of a person.

504
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,272
You are embodiment of love, take it from 
Me, because you are a human being.

505
00:51:27,473 --> 00:51:31,359
Even the animals are there who know what 
is love is.

506
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:38,668
You see… I know that if you love a tiger, 
the tiger will never harm.

507
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:41,544
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

508
00:51:41,745 --> 00:51:48,020
If you try to love anybody who is very 
cruel and very bad,

509
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:54,180
gradually he will calm down. He will harm 
you little bit, he will do this,

510
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:59,041
he will see things and he might be mean 
with you, do all kinds of things.

511
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:03,381
But then, gradually you find your love 
works, and works, and works.

512
00:52:03,582 --> 00:52:09,200
And ultimately it is your love, which is 
important to that person.

513
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:15,347
Now, your love is really firstly 
appreciated

514
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:21,208
more by innocent people, like children. 
Children know what love is.

515
00:52:21,409 --> 00:52:28,502
If the children see you, and they run away, 
that means something wrong with you.

516
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:33,184
I’ve seen people… like once we were 
in Japan

517
00:52:33,385 --> 00:52:37,732
and there were two foreigners who were 
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

518
00:52:37,927 --> 00:52:40,701
I don't know from which hair-dresser they 
had dressed up themselves

519
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:47,514
and they were very much overly decorated - 
and they came with us, you see.

520
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:55,778
We climbed up a place to see something 
and when we came down

521
00:52:55,979 --> 00:53:01,497
there were some children standing there. 
They had gone before us. So they said,

522
00:53:01,698 --> 00:53:05,994
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?” 
“Which went with you?"

523
00:53:06,195 --> 00:53:09,431
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came, 
you know, we were frightened,

524
00:53:09,632 --> 00:53:13,673
we ran away to our houses. Now we have 
come to tell you they are witches."

525
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:16,469
These small, small little Japanese 
children, you know,

526
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,303
"They are witches, you know, they are 
witches. Be afraid of them."

527
00:53:19,504 --> 00:53:23,799
And they had decorated themselves so much, 
so much hair-dressed up.

528
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,758
They have tried to make such a beautiful 
show of themselves,

529
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:31,712
but the… for the children, they were 
witches and they ran away.

530
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:35,049
And when we came, they came running and 
telling us, “Don't be with them,

531
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,791
they're witches.”

532
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:42,819
So, the judgment of the innocent people 
is the best judgment.

533
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,282
If they are innocent, they are extremely 
well equipped

534
00:53:47,483 --> 00:53:51,325
to judge a person - who has love and who 
does not have.

535
00:53:51,526 --> 00:53:56,010
And they are the best people because they 
will appreciate you the best.

536
00:53:56,211 --> 00:54:00,380
They will understand that these are people 
of some high quality.

537
00:54:00,581 --> 00:54:07,528
But if they are not innocent, cunning, 
some people are extremely cunning -

538
00:54:07,729 --> 00:54:11,422
that’s the intelligence part of it - they 
can never appreciate you.

539
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:18,892
They'll appreciate something which is, 
something very, very abnormal,

540
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:25,252
which from divine part, divine angle,

541
00:54:25,453 --> 00:54:34,617
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they 
will never appreciate you.

542
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:37,816
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may, 
but may not.

543
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:42,504
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate 
yourself.

544
00:54:42,705 --> 00:54:48,779
You have to know that you are not unkind 
to anyone, you are not judging others,

545
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:55,442
and that you are appreciating everything 
in that person -

546
00:54:55,643 --> 00:55:00,804
whatever is good in him as a human being. 
It works.

547
00:55:01,005 --> 00:55:05,500
You have seen, this all has worked through 
My love and compassion.

548
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:10,806
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you 
love or compassion or anything.

549
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,886
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you 
anything.

550
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:21,888
I’m not even conscious as to… I have 
created such a lot of beautiful people.

551
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:25,115
I am not conscious of that. It’s just 
happening.

552
00:55:25,316 --> 00:55:28,679
Just like this tree is here, see, it is 
not conscious

553
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,702
as to what it is and what it looks like. 
It’s just is there.

554
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:40,493
In the same way, if it happens to you, 
I tell you, you become really

555
00:55:40,694 --> 00:55:45,975
the source of such a joy for everyone.

556
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,895
Now, what do we have to do for this world? 
What is needed to be done for this world?

557
00:55:52,096 --> 00:55:55,680
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s 
no need to do anything.

558
00:55:55,881 --> 00:56:00,455
It just… you become a personality of that 
kind -

559
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:06,452
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy 
to others.

560
00:56:06,653 --> 00:56:10,571
Now, this power is within you because it is 
built-in, it's within you.

561
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:16,603
It is in a potential form in every person. 
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

562
00:56:16,804 --> 00:56:29,671
Now, with affection, you may not, but with 
love and feeling that is innate within you.

563
00:56:29,872 --> 00:56:34,631
Because there are no words for such subtle 
things that are within yourself.

564
00:56:34,832 --> 00:56:37,935
Because so far people don’t know what are 
these things

565
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:42,087
that make you feel oneness with others.

566
00:56:42,288 --> 00:56:50,081
All this, all this can happen to you very 
easily, very easily,

567
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:57,169
when you understand that you are not this 
mind, you are not this body,

568
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:03,099
you are not this attention - you are 
the Spirit.

569
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:08,998
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit? 
All right, if I am the Spirit,

570
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,656
what is… what am I doing?"

571
00:57:14,684 --> 00:57:19,066
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel, 
"Why not others?"

572
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:23,573
Out of love and compassion. Not for 
becoming some leaders or anything.

573
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,998
Just out of love. "If I am that why not 
make others like that?"

574
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,066
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread 
so much,

575
00:57:31,267 --> 00:57:35,361
and we have such gems of people, such 
beautiful people

576
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:41,256
that I really never expected so much 
to happen in My lifetime.

577
00:57:41,457 --> 00:57:46,630
It has never happened with any saint, any 
incarnation, any prophet.

578
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:51,256
So now, you people have become absolutely

579
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:56,164
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated 
yourself fully.

580
00:57:56,365 --> 00:57:59,916
The story of Radha and Krishna is very 
beautiful

581
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:06,784
where Radha said that, "Why do You take 
this...

582
00:58:12,297 --> 00:58:14,444
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word 
for Murli’"],

583
00:58:14,645 --> 00:58:18,189
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take 
this?"

584
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,087
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’, 
flute is not so sweet.

585
00:58:22,288 --> 00:58:26,557
"But why do You take this flute to Your 
lips?"

586
00:58:26,758 --> 00:58:31,716
After all… She, She must have been jealous, 
I think so.

587
00:58:32,402 --> 00:58:38,719
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He 
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

588
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,361
So, flute She went and asked, "Why 
Shri Krishna

589
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:46,138
takes you to His lips all the time?"

590
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:50,140
So, he said, she said, "You know,

591
00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:55,434
I have become completely hollow. There’s 
nothing in me.

592
00:58:55,635 --> 00:59:02,931
He puts me to His lips and people say 
that I am playing the tune.

593
00:59:03,132 --> 00:59:08,927
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where 
am I? I’m not there.

594
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:14,239
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is 
passing through me.

595
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:20,805
That is the expression." But then Radha 
told Shri Krishna,

596
00:59:21,006 --> 00:59:25,023
"Why don't You make (me) the same way 
as the flute?"

597
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:30,594
So, this is what you have to be, the flute, 
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

598
00:59:30,795 --> 00:59:37,686
All these little, little things, you know, 
which come into your life are not important.

599
00:59:37,887 --> 00:59:43,637
What is important is - have you become 
completely hollow?

600
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:47,603
This is where, I would say, introspection 
will help.

601
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:52,849
The one who makes the flute is also within 
you.

602
00:59:53,050 --> 01:00:00,401
So let there be a flute made out of you 
by yourself only.

603
01:00:00,602 --> 01:00:07,046
This is the way you make yourself what you 
have to become.

604
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:12,017
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva 
Atmane Shrushta",

605
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:15,840
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

606
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,684
Isn't it very difficult thing to 
understand -

607
01:00:19,885 --> 01:00:23,289
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

608
01:00:23,493 --> 01:00:26,466
But now you can understand what 
Shri Krishna has said

609
01:00:26,667 --> 01:00:32,540
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with 
itself.

610
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:35,889
Then it doesn't require any other 
satisfaction.

611
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,193
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you 
seek the joy of your Spirit,

612
01:00:40,394 --> 01:00:43,521
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

613
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:53,411
You don't even seek, but it is in itself 
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

614
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:58,894
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

615
01:00:59,095 --> 01:01:02,060
There are many people who say, "I am not 
satisfied, you see,

616
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:07,380
this I am not very much satisfied, it is 
not that I am satisfied."

617
01:01:07,804 --> 01:01:13,776
In the same way, the Spirit can say, 
"I am not satisfied."

618
01:01:13,977 --> 01:01:19,900
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit 
only.

619
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:25,420
It’s like the reflection in the mirror. 
When you look at the mirror you see there

620
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:30,814
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is 
not all right, I will say,

621
01:01:31,015 --> 01:01:34,740
"I am not satisfied with what reflection 
we are getting out of this mirror."

622
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,539
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring 
the better mirror,

623
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:42,574
you'll try to get a better picture 
of yourself. In the same way,

624
01:01:42,775 --> 01:01:49,455
the Spirit which is reflected within you, 
wants to see its own image.

625
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:55,128
And then what you do is to… you go on, 
somehow or other,

626
01:01:55,329 --> 01:02:02,725
changing, cleaning, making it all right 
through your meditation

627
01:02:02,956 --> 01:02:07,593
so that your Spirit is satisfied with 
the Spirit.

628
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:11,842
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous 
manner because He was very clever.

629
01:02:11,993 --> 01:02:14,139
He knew human beings cannot take things 
straight,

630
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:16,320
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

631
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:20,896
so that they’ll run around and then 
ultimately they will come to Truth.

632
01:02:21,097 --> 01:02:25,994
But Truth is very simple. Truth is 
extremely simple.

633
01:02:26,195 --> 01:02:29,756
You don't have to go here and there and 
you don't have to stand on your legs

634
01:02:29,957 --> 01:02:35,271
or feet all the time. You don't have 
to fight with anything.

635
01:02:35,472 --> 01:02:42,205
You don't have to take to some sort of 
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

636
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:51,127
Only just you become like a flute. You 
become hollow.

637
01:02:51,328 --> 01:02:55,408
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult 
at all for Sahaja Yogis

638
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:59,975
because already the Kundalini has made 
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

639
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:06,891
But still, I find people deviate. Their 
attention goes here and there.

640
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:10,081
So many people have told Me how their 
problems were solved

641
01:03:10,282 --> 01:03:14,137
without doing anything about it. I said, 
"What did you do?"

642
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:19,352
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus 
feet." I said, "Really?"

643
01:03:19,553 --> 01:03:23,983
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking 
at the problem, what the problem is.

644
01:03:24,184 --> 01:03:29,129
We were standing outside and looking 
at the problem and the problem got solved."

645
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:32,935
Even the most difficult problems that you 
think, can be solved

646
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:40,752
very easily because you have powers. Your 
powers are great.

647
01:03:40,953 --> 01:03:45,884
You are saints, but more than saints,

648
01:03:46,311 --> 01:03:52,447
much more than saints because you are born 
at such a volatile times.

649
01:03:52,648 --> 01:03:58,413
Like supposing, you have a light in 
darkness, you are finding something,

650
01:03:58,614 --> 01:04:02,377
you bump into that and you bump into that.

651
01:04:02,578 --> 01:04:08,425
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

652
01:04:08,806 --> 01:04:16,261
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes 
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

653
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:25,033
But you must get out of this nonsense 
of "me", "my" and "mine".

654
01:04:26,157 --> 01:04:30,213
I don't know how to say you get out - 
It’s not like a swimming pool,

655
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:33,947
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not 
like that.

656
01:04:34,148 --> 01:04:42,580
It is another kind of a very subtle 
understanding that our roots have to grow.

657
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:46,338
And for growing our roots, we have to go 
within ourselves

658
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:54,783
and find out within ourselves what is 
the area we are occupying,

659
01:04:54,984 --> 01:05:02,621
in what areas in our lifestyle we are 
taking these roots inside.

660
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:09,224
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree 
of life has the roots in the brain

661
01:05:09,425 --> 01:05:12,960
and grows downward. It’s very interesting 
to understand

662
01:05:13,161 --> 01:05:16,643
that the roots are growing in the brain.

663
01:05:16,844 --> 01:05:24,971
That means, your own intellect is just 
covered with compassion,

664
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:36,429
it’s just being absolutely one with 
compassion.

665
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,567
I had told you a story about a saint

666
01:05:39,768 --> 01:05:44,255
who was to take to… water for the Deity 
n Gujarat

667
01:05:44,456 --> 01:05:51,512
and he walked one month to go there with 
a pitcher of water.

668
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:59,600
And then at the… because it was a very 
high mountain on which this Deity was,

669
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:05,320
and he reached at the foothill.

670
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:10,659
There he found a little donkey dying 
of thirst

671
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:15,339
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

672
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,109
So those who were with him, they asked, 
"What are you doing?

673
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:22,026
You brought it all the way, and why are 
you putting it for this donkey?"

674
01:06:22,227 --> 01:06:23,195
He said, "You don't know?

675
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:27,305
The God has come all the way down, just 
to meet me here.

676
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:29,601
He doesn't want me to climb up."

677
01:06:29,802 --> 01:06:38,038
This kind of an absolutely simple 
understanding

678
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:46,005
of another's feelings and another's 
problems:

679
01:06:46,206 --> 01:06:50,472
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

680
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,594
And the person will tell you that, "You 
sorted out my problem."

681
01:06:53,795 --> 01:06:59,663
But you will not know how you have solved 
because this love is the power.

682
01:06:59,864 --> 01:07:03,545
This love can see things. It is everything.

683
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:07,591
It’s like a… you see a television, 
all right, it’s a television.

684
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:10,215
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

685
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:18,903
If you see anything you do with the power, 
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

686
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:23,693
You need not have to telephone. I never 
telephone to anyone.

687
01:07:23,894 --> 01:07:27,364
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if 
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

688
01:07:27,565 --> 01:07:30,711
I never telephone. But not to save 
the bill,

689
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:35,272
but I do not telephone because there is 
no need.

690
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:39,585
The whole subtle of the ether is at your 
feet.

691
01:07:39,786 --> 01:07:46,236
Just you want to do something you can just 
do it, just with the vibrations.

692
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:51,454
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this 
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

693
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:57,366
You all can cure, you are so many. You can 
cure anyone you want to,

694
01:07:57,567 --> 01:08:00,882
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not 
needed.

695
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:03,802
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

696
01:08:04,003 --> 01:08:10,211
You can solve all their problems yourself. 
One little Bandhan can solve it.

697
01:08:10,412 --> 01:08:13,979
But for that you should be the source 
of love.

698
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:22,808
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful 
love takes over,

699
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:26,452
"All right, I'll do the job."

700
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:32,246
But for that you have to be the master 
of this beautiful thing.

701
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:37,304
Now, one thing is very different from other 
masteries.

702
01:08:37,505 --> 01:08:41,060
In other masteries, you see people try 
to dominate

703
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:46,480
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

704
01:08:46,681 --> 01:08:55,495
But the mastery of love is that you know 
how to build

705
01:08:56,465 --> 01:09:05,026
a rapport with the Divine love. And this 
Divine love is not only powerful,

706
01:09:05,227 --> 01:09:16,490
but it is such a efficient, I should say, 
such an alert instrument

707
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:19,787
which works out everything in such a manner

708
01:09:19,988 --> 01:09:24,751
that you are amazed how things have worked 
out.

709
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:28,606
And everybody has noticed it. I know you 
all know it.

710
01:09:28,807 --> 01:09:31,304
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

711
01:09:31,505 --> 01:09:36,064
You have to be on the vibratory awareness 
and use that.

712
01:09:36,265 --> 01:09:40,179
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself 
clarifies you.

713
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:47,515
Imagine in your hand there is this great 
power of giving you this balance,

714
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:51,921
this love, this affection and all 
the protection

715
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:56,611
while you can give it to others also. You 
have become now

716
01:09:56,812 --> 01:10:01,951
the part and parcel of the Divine power. 
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

717
01:10:02,152 --> 01:10:06,829
And whatever you want to do can be done 
by this divine power.

718
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:12,064
With all this telling you I still feel, 
sometimes, you are not confident.

719
01:10:12,265 --> 01:10:18,521
You get upset. You feel that, "How can 
this be?"

720
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:22,382
You have no trust in yourself, you have no 
faith in yourself.

721
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:29,749
And also there are some people, sort of, 
who feel they are neglected,

722
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:33,812
or something should have happened to them.

723
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:39,175
Once a lady started crying. So, I said, 
"Why is she crying?"

724
01:10:39,376 --> 01:10:44,380
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile 
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

725
01:10:44,581 --> 01:10:50,005
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know 
why she thinks like that.

726
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:56,494
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me 
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

727
01:10:56,695 --> 01:10:59,782
You are all right? Why should I smile 
at you?"

728
01:10:59,983 --> 01:11:02,784
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

729
01:11:02,985 --> 01:11:06,132
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja 
Yoga,

730
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:11,309
Mother should all the time be only attached 
to you.

731
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:16,066
She cannot get attached, you know. 
It’s a helpless condition I have.

732
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:20,879
There are so many, you don't know, defects 
I have, which you have no idea.

733
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,955
I don't know how to count money.

734
01:11:23,156 --> 01:11:26,325
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it 
two hundred rupees.

735
01:11:26,526 --> 01:11:28,871
You see, I don't know many things. I don't 
know banking;

736
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:32,693
I don't know many things and one of them 
is I don't know

737
01:11:32,894 --> 01:11:38,841
how to put attention to this person or 
to that person. Like politicians would do -

738
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:43,686
"You see, ah, you must look after this man, 
because he is very important." Nothing.

739
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:49,467
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me, 
finished, nothing more than that.

740
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:55,509
So, you see, everybody so should know that 
you are very close to My heart,

741
01:11:55,710 --> 01:12:00,371
you are very much there, I am very proud 
of you. And something,

742
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:06,345
really it’s a miracle that has happened, 
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

743
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:11,444
So on that point also, that how much Mother 
cares for me, what She does...

744
01:12:11,645 --> 01:12:14,242
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right, 
you don't sit here, sit there,"

745
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:17,924
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel 
bad.

746
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:23,812
This kind of a person has no sense of love. 
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

747
01:12:24,013 --> 01:12:26,792
So, at the end of the whole thing I must 
tell you,

748
01:12:26,993 --> 01:12:31,576
that when you are a guru, you are also 
a mother.

749
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:37,747
You have to express yourself like a mother. 
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

750
01:12:37,948 --> 01:12:42,390
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary, 
but in her own sweet way she corrects

751
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:47,139
so the correction takes place - it's not 
that a rebellion starts.

752
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:53,920
So all that wisdom of a mother is within 
you, is already there, so please try to use.

753
01:12:54,105 --> 01:13:00,149
I am sure, it will all work out and as it 
is we are a very beautiful group of people

754
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:11,480
who are something out of the blue, who are 
so much in peace and in joy together.

755
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:14,948
May God bless you all.

756
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:27,440
So, today's Guru Puja will be...

757
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:32,646
Of course, we can - we can have a little 
of Ganesha's Atharva Sheersha,

758
01:13:32,847 --> 01:13:36,085
but Devi Puja will be much less.

759
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:42,288
And for Guru Puja I would request 
the country leaders to come up.

760
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:47,199
Country leaders have to come up. So it is 
in a different way,

761
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:51,295
we can say that the main thing is 
the Guru Puja

762
01:13:51,496 --> 01:13:53,955
where the country leaders have to come up.

763
01:13:54,156 --> 01:14:00,225
The Devi Puja will be followed after that, 
which is very short.

764
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:05,183
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
