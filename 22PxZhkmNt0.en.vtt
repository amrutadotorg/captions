00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.840
All of us are looking for something in life,

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:06.059
whether it's happiness,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.769
power,

00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:07.940
self-realization,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.380
spiritual feeling.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.140
There's a woman joining us now who's one of the few female gurus in the world.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.469
She is known as Shri Mataji in translation that means holy mother,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.190
and she has been all over the world.

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:19.805
Saying,

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.475
that there are things we need to look at in this world,

00:00:22.684 --> 00:00:24.155
things that really need to change,

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:27.374
kind of revolution in a way.

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:29.114
It is delight to have you here Mother.

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:30.844
Would you first explain though,

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:33.474
I think we all think we know what a guru is.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.555
Would you tell us what you do?

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.069
You see,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.479
a person who calls himself a guru

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.750
should be able to give you something of your own.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.720
You have everything within yourself.

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.880
And only thing what he has to do is to activate that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.830
so that you become yourself.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.209
And he doesn't take anything from you.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.639
He cannot take money from you,

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:54.709
nothing of the kind.

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:57.189
Just he has to give you what you have.

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:58.349
He's like a banker.

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.840
All right,

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:02.709
you are from India and yet don't you base what you do

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.989
on a belief in Christ and a belief in all religions?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.080
Of course Christ is very important.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.050
He's the gate,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.669
no doubt about it.

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:12.839
What do people who follow your teachings,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:13.199
Mother,

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:14.360
find in themselves?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.199
Is it a feeling of well-being?

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.489
What,

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.029
what do they seek through your teachings?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550
Ah,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.669
lots of things because Spirit is the one within us in our heart,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.230
which is collectively conscious,

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:30.260
so you become your consciousness becomes collectively conscious.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.069
That means on your central nervous system

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.519
you can feel the existence

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:37.313
of the Spirit in your heart,

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:40.623
you can feel the all pervading power that does all the living

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:44.292
work like changing the flowers into fruits and all those things.

00:01:44.422 --> 00:01:45.792
You start feeling that power.

00:01:45.902 --> 00:01:47.172
That's what Christ had.

00:01:47.502 --> 00:01:49.513
When somebody touched his robe,

00:01:49.682 --> 00:01:50.773
he felt some

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:53.333
energy went through him.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:55.462
That's what is the energy you start feeling.

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:56.983
You become empowered.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:02:00.822
That's the sign of a guru who can give you something and take nothing.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.646
You worked with Gandhi in India,

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:04.937
Yes

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:07.755
from my childhood I was with him for quite some time.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:09.716
And what did you learn from his spirit?

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:10.376
He,

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:12.516
is himself a realised soul,

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:15.166
but at that time he felt it was important

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:16.776
to get out of the slavery,

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:21.485
otherwise we can't do any spiritual thing at all because if you are bodily enslaved,

00:02:21.606 --> 00:02:22.425
what can you do?

00:02:22.436 --> 00:02:24.166
And your husband is with the United Nations,

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:26.166
he is the Secretary General.

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:27.800
He's elected

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.509
3 times now as Secretary General of the International Maritime organisation.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.250
You know,

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:39.309
I wonder if people think the way I do Maharishi Yogi was a product of the 60s and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.210
ah I think we think of him in a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.039
way perhaps with a lack of knowledge as anti-establishment.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.820
You are not really anti-establishment,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.410
not at all.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.850
I mean,

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:48.880
this is absolutely untraditional.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.690
It's not like Indian style.

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.089
There's nothing like establishment to be broken.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.880
You have to have your families.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.080
You have to have everything.

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.669
It's all God's own arrangement that we should have good families

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.149
and good children,

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.199
and we should do our own role very

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.029
with complete

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.070
confidence.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.789
You speak a great deal of the power of women.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.160
Yes,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.869
women have the most powerful thing.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.589
They are called a Shakti in India,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.389
but their power is not the way we understand the power.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.320
It's the power.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:19.496
The Mother Earth has,

00:03:19.826 --> 00:03:21.016
she has the power to nourish,

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:24.315
has the power to give us all that we want.

00:03:24.505 --> 00:03:26.046
She's the one who looks after us.

00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.166
She's the one who fills our life with all

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.776
these beautiful seasons as we are having now here.

00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:35.106
The colour is changing because it has got more of minerals in it

00:03:35.106 --> 00:03:38.115
and it changes the beautiful colours just to give us a joy.

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:39.832
So that is a job of a Woman.

00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:43.386
So that's the this is a brief glimpse at you and what you do.

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:44.111
And what you say,

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:44.751
and I know you,

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:46.602
you claim to touch people all over the world,

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.242
and there is an open meeting

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:51.292
that will be held tonight at the Old Cambridge Baptist Church

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:54.522
that's on Mass Ave in Cambridge beginning at 7 o'clock.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:57.722
So for those of you who are interested in knowing more of what Mother is all about,

00:03:58.052 --> 00:03:59.261
perhaps you would like to attend.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.552
Thank you so much for being with us today.

00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:02.462
Shri Mataji,

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:03.451
nice to know you.

00:04:04.042 --> 00:04:06.682
And there is a power in the peacefulness of your face.

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:06.972
Yes.

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.489
Thank you all.
