WEBVTT

06:26.015 --> 06:33.965
Today you have come here to worship me
as Shri Ganesha.

06:34.622 --> 06:42.470
We have been singing the praise
of Shri Ganesha before every puja.

06:43.230 --> 06:51.888
And we have such tremendous respect
for Shri Ganesh

06:52.089 --> 06:57.381
because we have found out that unless
and until Shri Ganesha,

06:57.582 --> 07:04.748
who is the symbol of our innocence,
is not awakened within us,

07:04.949 --> 07:11.869
we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

07:12.070 --> 07:18.642
And even to stay there and to enjoy
the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

07:18.843 --> 07:27.172
we have to have our innocence fully
blossoming.

07:29.015 --> 07:36.325
So we praise Him and He is very easily
praised.

07:36.526 --> 07:41.965
And whatever we might have done wrong
before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

07:42.166 --> 07:46.482
He completely forgives

07:48.425 --> 07:52.508
because He is the eternal child.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.687
You have seen children,

07:57.446 --> 08:02.457
when you slap them, sometimes get angry
with them,

08:02.680 --> 08:08.875
they forget it. They only remember
the love

08:10.954 --> 08:18.086
and not what they have suffered
at your hands.

08:18.476 --> 08:27.598
Till they grow up, they do not have memory
of bad things done to them.

08:29.165 --> 08:31.628
From the very beginning,

08:32.774 --> 08:36.765
a child is born to a mother,

08:37.045 --> 08:40.650
he doesn’t know what he has gone through.

08:40.851 --> 08:45.445
Then gradually the memory starts working

08:45.646 --> 08:50.175
and he starts restoring things within
himself.

08:51.040 --> 08:57.654
But in the beginning, only he remembers
what nice things have happened to him.

08:57.855 --> 09:03.701
So we always like to ponder about
our childhood,

09:03.902 --> 09:07.563
what we enjoyed in our childhood.

09:07.764 --> 09:13.330
But as we start growing up, we start
remembering all the miseries

09:13.531 --> 09:19.942
and all the tribulations we had to go
through.

09:20.143 --> 09:26.829
All the ordeals, through which we have
passed, we try to magnify it.

09:27.030 --> 09:30.900
In childhood, the children only remember
the people who have loved them

09:31.101 --> 09:36.345
and not the people who have hurt them.
They don’t want to remember perhaps.

09:36.546 --> 09:42.089
It looks like that. But when they grow up,

09:44.187 --> 09:50.497
they only try to remember those people
who have harmed them or have troubled them

09:50.712 --> 09:54.960
and that’s how they make themselves
very miserable.

09:55.980 --> 10:04.085
But the principle of Ganesha is extremely
subtle, is the subtlest of subtle.

10:04.286 --> 10:13.014
And it exists in everything, that it exists
in the matter, in the form of vibrations.

10:13.215 --> 10:17.918
There is no matter, which is without
vibrations.

10:18.119 --> 10:27.008
It has vibrations, which are seen even
in the atoms

10:27.209 --> 10:33.786
and also in the molecules of all matter
that is existing.

10:33.987 --> 10:40.380
So Shri Ganesha is the first one who
was established in the matter, as well.

10:40.581 --> 10:44.078
As a result, we can see, He exists
in the sun,

10:44.279 --> 10:47.174
He exists in the moon, He exists
in the whole universe,

10:47.375 --> 10:53.282
in the whole creation, and He continues
to exist in human beings also.

10:53.483 --> 10:56.830
Only the human beings have capacity

10:57.031 --> 11:03.166
to somehow or other cover up your –
the innocence.

11:03.367 --> 11:09.005
Otherwise, animals are innocent.

11:09.478 --> 11:13.481
Human beings have the freedom; if they
want, they can cover up

11:13.682 --> 11:19.367
their innocence, they can shut down
the doors of Shri Ganesha

11:19.568 --> 11:24.185
and say that He does not exist. They can
cloud it.

11:24.537 --> 11:27.729
And that is why we find among human
beings,

11:27.930 --> 11:31.840
that they are doing so many horrible
things,

11:32.041 --> 11:36.622
avoiding the existence of Shri Ganesh.

11:36.823 --> 11:42.751
But He acts. He acts in a way

11:43.211 --> 11:48.515
that He shows natural results of our
wrongdoings.

11:50.700 --> 12:00.471
Like if you do things, which are not
pleasing to Shri Ganesh,

12:00.672 --> 12:04.350
He goes up to a point, forgives you up
to a point,

12:04.551 --> 12:11.835
and then He starts emerging out
as diseases, as physical diseases,

12:12.036 --> 12:16.366
and in women, it becomes a mental disease.

12:16.567 --> 12:23.496
Also, it can create problems in the nature.

12:25.456 --> 12:28.959
The natural catastrophes are, also,

12:30.427 --> 12:34.153
only the curse of Shri Ganesha.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.791
When people start doing wrong things,

12:39.564 --> 12:44.524
behaving in a wrong manner, collectively,

12:44.725 --> 12:49.761
then the natural catastrophes come
to teach them a lesson.

12:49.962 --> 12:54.597
So in His essence, though He exists
in everything,

12:54.798 --> 13:03.422
also in that, He has capacity to assert
His will,

13:03.623 --> 13:08.171
to bring forth the destruction of the whole
world.

13:08.884 --> 13:15.041
We have Shri Ganesha’s idea as
a minute thing.

13:15.242 --> 13:20.800
We think, He can go on a little mouse,
so He must be very minute.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.726
He is as minute as He is great.

13:24.927 --> 13:31.827
He surpasses all the Deities because
of His wisdom.

13:32.028 --> 13:37.361
He is the giver of wisdom. He gives
us wisdom. He makes us learn.

13:37.562 --> 13:40.729
He is our Guru, in that respect, Mahaguru,

13:40.930 --> 13:44.235
because He teaches us how we should
behave.

13:44.436 --> 13:49.492
If you try to surpass Him and try
to misbehave,

13:49.693 --> 13:53.468
even the Mother won’t support you,

13:53.669 --> 13:59.259
because She knows, that those who surpass
Shri Ganesha

13:59.460 --> 14:03.963
are also the people who will never respect
the Mother.

14:04.164 --> 14:09.999
So He is the epitome of respect for Mother.
Epitome.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.435
He does not know any other gods. He does
not know Sadashiva.

14:13.636 --> 14:17.611
He doesn’t know anybody else, but He only
respects the Mother.

14:17.812 --> 14:25.005
So He is the one who is the power of
devotion and complete surrender to Mother,

14:25.206 --> 14:29.996
and that’s why He is the most powerful
Deity among all the Deities

14:30.197 --> 14:35.317
and nobody can surpass Him in His powers.

14:36.540 --> 14:41.220
We have to understand that as children
are growing,

14:41.421 --> 14:46.877
Shri Ganesha starts growing in them also,

14:47.078 --> 14:51.626
but as they are human beings they can,
somehow or other, try

14:51.827 --> 14:58.261
to overpower Shri Ganesha. So is the duty
of parents who are sahaja yogis to see

14:58.462 --> 15:02.984
that they look after their children
in a way, in a detached way,

15:03.185 --> 15:06.382
to see that Shri Ganesha in them
is settled.

15:06.583 --> 15:10.894
The first sign of Shri Ganesha in a child
is wisdom.

15:11.095 --> 15:17.777
If the child is not wise, if he is
troublesome,

15:17.978 --> 15:22.893
if he does not know how to behave, then
that shows that the Shri Ganesha

15:23.094 --> 15:26.455
is being attacked by him.

15:27.444 --> 15:32.809
And these days in the modern times, as
it is, children are very much under attack.

15:33.010 --> 15:34.941
Innocence is under attack.

15:35.142 --> 15:38.863
And it is very difficult for people to make
a fine line

15:39.064 --> 15:44.252
as to how far to go with children and
how far not to go.

15:44.453 --> 15:51.242
Today’s lecture would be more concerning
about how far to go with Shri Ganesha

15:51.443 --> 15:57.639
as far as children are concerned because
that’s a very important point.

15:58.744 --> 16:04.346
Because He is the giver of wisdom.
So the parents must understand

16:04.547 --> 16:10.279
that, “If He is the giver of wisdom, there
should be wisdom, wisdom within me.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.681
And if I have the wisdom, then I have
the balance,

16:14.882 --> 16:17.415
and I don’t lose tempers with children,

16:17.616 --> 16:24.029
but I try to correct them, but in such
a manner that they get corrected.”

16:24.230 --> 16:29.371
On the contrary, if you try to be very
harsh with your children,

16:29.572 --> 16:33.539
they might react and they might go astray.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.851
Or you try to restrict them too much,

16:36.052 --> 16:38.737
then also they will behave in the same
manner.

16:38.938 --> 16:43.099
So one thing is to be taught to your
own children,

16:43.300 --> 16:48.239
as Shri Ganesha Himself does, that
“respect your Mother.”

16:48.820 --> 16:52.997
Your Mother means your Holy Mother
and your own mother.

16:53.198 --> 16:59.529
That is very important. If the father
doesn’t make the child respect the mother,

16:59.730 --> 17:02.256
the child can never be all right.

17:02.457 --> 17:07.828
Because the authority comes from the father
no doubt, but mother must be respected.

17:08.029 --> 17:13.974
But for that, it is very important that
mother must respect the father.

17:14.175 --> 17:17.623
So in the presence of children, if you
start fighting with each other,

17:17.824 --> 17:22.989
misbehaving, and talking in a manner
that is not proper,

17:23.190 --> 17:29.221
also will have a very bad effect on
the Ganesha Tattwa of the child.

17:30.980 --> 17:34.524
This upbringing is a very important thing
in Sahaja Yoga

17:34.725 --> 17:38.739
because by God’s grace you all have got
realised children.

17:38.940 --> 17:42.183
So you must know how far to go
with your children

17:42.384 --> 17:48.039
to make them wiser, to be moral, to be
righteous.

17:48.240 --> 17:52.281
First thing is that you should try
to preserve their wisdom.

17:52.482 --> 17:56.326
If they say something wise, you must
appreciate.

17:56.527 --> 18:00.956
But they should not also say out of place,
out of grace.

18:01.157 --> 18:05.851
So the misbehaviour is also not to be
tolerated, in the sense,

18:06.052 --> 18:11.906
that whatever is wisdom within, has to be
expressed outside as light.

18:12.344 --> 18:18.051
Now we go further with it to see how far
Shri Ganesha acts.

18:18.363 --> 18:23.667
As I said, in the subtlest of subtlest He
exists, but you have to awaken Him.

18:23.868 --> 18:28.408
For example, you have seen the water,
which is vibrated – means what?

18:28.609 --> 18:36.295
Vibrated means the Ganesha Tattwa is been
enlightened in that water.

18:36.496 --> 18:42.010
So when that water goes into your stomach,
or into your eyes,

18:42.211 --> 18:46.914
or wherever you want to put it, it acts;
acts in a way

18:47.115 --> 18:55.155
that it excites the Shri Ganesha Tattwa
into anything that you put it.

18:55.356 --> 18:59.734
Now you have seen, we have got miracles
of agriculture, to begin with.

18:59.935 --> 19:05.632
Miracles of agriculture is such that people
are amazed,

19:05.833 --> 19:12.580
but it’s very simple. Once you start
exciting the Ganesh Principle

19:12.781 --> 19:21.269
into the seed, it becomes ten times,
sometimes hundred times.

19:21.470 --> 19:25.871
Even the Mother Earth, which we think
to be something dead,

19:26.072 --> 19:31.273
can be vibrated.

19:31.474 --> 19:38.319
Supposing, you sahaja yogis walk
bare feet on the ground,

19:38.557 --> 19:41.362
the Mother Earth gets vibrated.

19:41.563 --> 19:48.905
Such Mother Earth will act on the trees,
on the grass, on the flowers, on everything.

19:49.106 --> 19:53.451
As it is, the sahaja yogis have been
telling me that in their ashrams

19:53.652 --> 19:57.770
all the flowers that grow, are out of size
and very fragrant.

19:57.971 --> 20:03.343
Like daisies never had fragrance in London
or in England, never.

20:03.544 --> 20:07.116
Now, the daisy size was so small;
it has become so big,

20:07.317 --> 20:11.815
and you see them everywhere, so fragrant.
And it is a miracle; the first time

20:12.016 --> 20:16.156
when I told somebody that the daisies
are fragrant, they couldn’t believe it.

20:16.357 --> 20:19.179
And when they saw the fragrance;
they were surprised.

20:19.380 --> 20:26.419
In the same way, Ganesha Tattwa
understands, thinks, organises, works out

20:27.078 --> 20:31.197
if it is awakened. If it is not, it is
sleeping, then it does not.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.678
So it acts, it works out.

20:33.879 --> 20:38.992
Like a little seed when it sprouts,
at the tip of the seed,

20:39.193 --> 20:45.218
there is a little cell, which has got
the Ganesh Tattwa, which is been awakened.

20:45.419 --> 20:48.849
So it knows how to go down, how to go
around a stone,

20:49.050 --> 20:54.205
and how to embed itself, and how to reach
the source of water.

20:54.406 --> 21:01.258
But it has only the sense how far to go to
exist, how far to go to nourish yourself,

21:01.459 --> 21:07.335
on a very material plane, how to allow
the tree to grow.

21:07.536 --> 21:14.210
But this Ganesh Tattwa starts becoming
very, very subtle and subtlest

21:14.444 --> 21:17.410
at the point of Agnya chakra.

21:17.611 --> 21:21.077
At the time of Agnya chakra, it understands

21:21.278 --> 21:26.923
that it has now the spiritual dimension.

21:27.124 --> 21:32.374
The same Ganesha Tattwa, which acted
in a small little tip of a root,

21:32.575 --> 21:35.765
now acts for the spiritual thing.

21:35.966 --> 21:38.876
That’s why people close their eyes
when they meditate –

21:39.077 --> 21:43.053
because they don’t want to see anything
else, but they want Shri Ganesha just

21:43.254 --> 21:49.868
to act for the meditative process
of their Kundalini.

21:50.931 --> 21:57.958
This process of meditation, when we close
our eyes, acts,

21:58.159 --> 22:01.192
but if you see, if somebody is sleeping
and he is dreaming,

22:01.393 --> 22:04.281
you will see, there will be, the eyes
will be all the time moving,

22:04.482 --> 22:07.454
they will be moving eyes.

22:08.887 --> 22:13.719
This Ganesh Tattwa is now acted
by your attention.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.930
If you have an attention, which is all the
time going from this place to that place,

22:18.131 --> 22:21.940
to that place, to that place, then it is
affected,

22:22.141 --> 22:28.365
specially in the case when we start looking
at men, looking at women, all the time.

22:28.566 --> 22:35.203
Then the – also our Ganesha Tattwa gets
very much destroyed.

22:35.404 --> 22:41.380
Such people are difficult for rising
in their ascent

22:41.581 --> 22:45.109
because Agnya itself goes out.

22:45.310 --> 22:50.150
Then this Ganesha Tattwa can also be
reduced if you are very materialistic,

22:50.351 --> 22:53.877
always worried about your things... like

22:54.078 --> 22:58.113
you have something in the house you are
worried about, and looking at everything,

22:58.314 --> 23:04.314
all the time trying to correct it and all
the time worried about the matter.

23:04.515 --> 23:07.494
Then also, this Ganesha Tattwa can be lost

23:07.695 --> 23:10.707
because you are all the time worried
about these things.

23:10.908 --> 23:14.582
Like we are going to the shop and we are
seeing everything,

23:14.783 --> 23:17.824
“What is there? What is there? What
should I buy? What should I buy?”

23:18.025 --> 23:20.452
Like that also if you do too much,
it will be.

23:20.653 --> 23:25.361
But supposing you are buying something
out of beauty, for beauty.

23:25.562 --> 23:28.078
You want to buy something for beautifying
your house.

23:28.279 --> 23:32.546
That means, you are trying to do something
to please others.

23:32.747 --> 23:36.895
You are doing it to make others very happy.

23:37.096 --> 23:45.731
Then, it acts the other way round,
then it increases your ascent.

23:45.932 --> 23:52.335
But if it is done only to create a kind
of a joy for others,

23:52.536 --> 23:59.625
sharing of the beauty of whatever you
have bought or you have taken.

24:00.779 --> 24:06.892
But supposing, you are buying anything
for making others feel jealous –

24:07.093 --> 24:12.618
that also I’ve recently learned, that
there is a capacity like that for people

24:12.819 --> 24:19.050
to buy something to make others jealous,
not to make somebody feel happy.

24:19.251 --> 24:23.100
If there are people who buy things just
to make others feel jealous,

24:23.301 --> 24:28.044
then also their Ganesha Tattwa can be
destroyed.

24:28.245 --> 24:32.405
What you should buy? Anything,
you should make a beautiful house.

24:32.675 --> 24:34.395
When somebody comes to your house,

24:34.596 --> 24:37.502
you should say, “Oh, what a nice thing
we have seen.”

24:37.703 --> 24:42.275
Not attachment to the thing, but attachment
to the thing how people feel,

24:42.476 --> 24:45.657
how they feel nice and relaxed, and

24:45.858 --> 24:51.231
they feel their Shri Ganesha within
them, which is beauty.

24:51.432 --> 24:55.743
When this feeling comes in, then we
should say there is Ganesh Tattwa.

24:55.944 --> 25:00.062
And is a very motherly feeling it is.
Like a mother always wants to give

25:00.263 --> 25:03.955
sweet things to her children, beautiful
things to her children.

25:04.156 --> 25:08.535
In the same way, in that you have
that vatsalya, as is called,

25:08.736 --> 25:13.700
is the feeling of the mother for the child.
That subtle feeling you have that,

25:13.901 --> 25:17.001
“People have come to my house. Now see
how they are happy,

25:17.217 --> 25:21.700
they are enjoying this and they are
appreciating it.”

25:22.645 --> 25:26.896
In that way, you also satisfy a very great
Ganesha Principle,

25:27.097 --> 25:32.481
is that you have taken note of the artists.

25:32.856 --> 25:39.792
Though the artists are creating their
all beautiful things out of matter

25:39.993 --> 25:44.391
through the Swadisthana, but without
Swadisthana being governed

25:44.592 --> 25:48.026
by Shri Ganesha, it cannot be beautiful.

25:49.006 --> 25:52.399
These days, as you see, the artists
are taking to all sorts

25:52.600 --> 25:55.481
of grotesque things and very immoral
things.

25:55.682 --> 25:58.852
And these things are of no eternal value.

25:59.053 --> 26:02.551
Today people will buy them and tomorrow
they will throw away.

26:02.752 --> 26:07.519
Only the things, which have got the subtle
Ganesh Principle in it acting,

26:07.720 --> 26:14.870
which makes you soothe down, which
makes you feel peaceful,

26:15.071 --> 26:21.051
which makes you feel happy, is the one
that is appreciated.

26:21.252 --> 26:27.195
So Shri Ganesha establishes within you
the higher Self.

26:27.396 --> 26:32.552
So the baser self, which enjoys all baser
things of lives,

26:32.753 --> 26:35.478
are being curtailed down,

26:35.679 --> 26:40.687
being cut down, sometimes completely
destroyed by Shri Ganesha.

26:40.888 --> 26:43.961
I’ll give you an example of Mona Lisa.
If you see Mona Lisa –

26:44.162 --> 26:46.914
I mean I don’t know, she cannot be
an actress,

26:47.115 --> 26:50.699
she cannot win any beauty contest,
I think.

26:50.900 --> 26:58.430
She… her face is very serene, very
motherly, very pure, her eyes.

26:58.631 --> 27:02.782
And why is it that she’s eternally
so much appreciated?

27:02.983 --> 27:06.779
The reason is, there is Ganesha Principle
in her. She’s a mother.

27:06.980 --> 27:12.088
And the story about that one is that
this lady had lost her child

27:12.289 --> 27:14.719
and she would never smile, she would
never cry.

27:14.920 --> 27:19.066
And one little child was brought to her,
and when she saw the child,

27:19.267 --> 27:23.603
then the smile that came on her face
of that love for the child,

27:23.804 --> 27:26.653
is been depicted by this great artist.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.275
And that’s why people are appreciating it.
And you have seen in the West,

27:30.476 --> 27:36.466
though the people don’t show much interest
in the mother-child relationships,

27:36.667 --> 27:40.893
anywhere you go, is the mother and child
theme is the best.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.552
They’ll show you a photograph, “This is
mother and child,

27:43.753 --> 27:45.368
this is Christ’s Mother and Child.

27:45.569 --> 27:47.785
When the Christ was brought down,
the Mother is there,”

27:47.986 --> 27:51.289
They have to have Mother and the Child
Principle acting,

27:51.490 --> 27:55.577
otherwise, that picture is not regarded
as something great.

27:55.778 --> 28:02.043
Or you have to have, actually, Christ who
is a Ganesha Principle Himself to be shown.

28:02.244 --> 28:07.197
I haven’t seen any picture as such
of those days

28:07.398 --> 28:11.272
where these principles are not there.
Even Picasso has used it.

28:11.473 --> 28:15.552
Even people who have been quite modern,
had to use this principle

28:15.753 --> 28:20.135
to popularise. But some people have used
to popularise,

28:20.336 --> 28:24.673
not the Ganesh Principle, just anti-Ganesh
principles.

28:24.874 --> 28:29.165
All such things have vanished into
thin air, and I see now, gradually,

28:29.366 --> 28:32.694
it’s all going down and down and down
and down.

28:32.895 --> 28:36.763
Despite the fact, people have lost
their morals, but still,

28:36.964 --> 28:41.046
they would like to have Rembrandt,
they’d like to have Leonardo da Vinci,

28:41.247 --> 28:46.602
they would like to have such artists,
who have done Mother and Child.

28:46.803 --> 28:51.495
Is very surprising. Even I went to Austria
this time, I said,

28:51.696 --> 28:56.797
“What statues you have?” Said, “We have
got beautiful Madonna and the Child.”

28:57.352 --> 29:01.432
So this principle is the most pleasing
principle.

29:02.131 --> 29:05.547
Is the most pleasing principle for human
beings

29:05.748 --> 29:09.957
to see the children, to play with them,
to enjoy their company.

29:10.158 --> 29:14.549
Why? Because it has that sweetness
of a child.

29:14.750 --> 29:18.863
It’s really, I should say, tickles joy
within you when you see a child.

29:19.064 --> 29:21.935
Immediately the face becomes different.

29:22.136 --> 29:27.220
I have told you that I’ve seen even
a crocodile cracking her eggs.

29:27.421 --> 29:29.044
I mean, they showed it in a film,

29:29.245 --> 29:33.096
and you should have seen the eyes
of the crocodile at that time,

29:33.297 --> 29:38.398
how carefully she was cracking.
So beautiful her eyes were,

29:38.599 --> 29:42.465
full of – such love pouring out
of her eyes.

29:42.666 --> 29:47.172
And you can’t believe, these are the eyes
of the same crocodile.

29:47.879 --> 29:52.076
And so slowly she’s cracking with her mouth
all the eggs

29:52.277 --> 29:57.242
and the little, little crocodiles coming
out. And then she brings them on the shore

29:57.443 --> 30:00.585
and washes them in the mouth all the time,

30:00.786 --> 30:06.837
so carefully, like a bathroom, she uses
her mouth, you see.

30:07.736 --> 30:11.851
You should see how animals also act
to their children.

30:12.052 --> 30:16.308
But when you become sort of modern,
so-called,

30:16.509 --> 30:21.162
your actions are very funny. There are
people who are killing children,

30:21.363 --> 30:26.265
there are people who are abusing children.
I mean, it is worse than rakshasas.

30:26.466 --> 30:31.999
Even rakshasas have not done, pishakshas
have not done. The Ganas are surprised –

30:32.200 --> 30:35.697
“What sort of these new creatures
have come up from where,

30:35.898 --> 30:39.976
that they have no love for their children,
that they can kill their children,

30:40.177 --> 30:44.595
murder them, break their hands. These are
their own children.

30:44.796 --> 30:48.968
If they do this to their own children,
what will they do to other’s children?”

30:49.169 --> 30:53.815
So love for your child has to be absolutely
important,

30:54.016 --> 30:56.912
but you should not as sahaja yogis

30:57.113 --> 31:01.542
have only attachment for your child,
first thing.

31:01.743 --> 31:06.009
And the second thing is, you must know
how to give

31:06.210 --> 31:11.872
a complete margin to your love. The margin
is benevolence:

31:12.073 --> 31:16.081
“Is it benevolent for my child?
Am I spoiling my child?

31:16.282 --> 31:21.386
Am I too much encouraging my child?
Am I playing into the hands of my child?

31:21.587 --> 31:24.644
Or I am managing the child alright?”

31:24.845 --> 31:28.911
Because in childhood, the father and
mother have to manage the children.

31:29.112 --> 31:31.831
They have to tell children and children
have to be obedient

31:32.032 --> 31:36.210
and they have to listen to parents. But
these days children are not obedient.

31:36.411 --> 31:40.839
They are not because there is – they find
that the parents among themselves

31:41.040 --> 31:42.998
are not obedient to each other.

31:43.199 --> 31:47.820
Also, they find the society is such, that
where children go on

31:48.021 --> 31:51.812
pestering the parents so they also become
like that. But doesn’t matter,

31:52.013 --> 31:56.111
you are sahaja yogis, so you should bring
up your children, who should be obedient,

31:56.312 --> 31:58.903
who should be wise, who should be sensible,

31:59.104 --> 32:05.461
with the same love that the crocodile has
for her little crocodiles.

32:07.449 --> 32:11.907
Now, when we come to the subtler side
of Ganesha Tattwa,

32:12.108 --> 32:15.519
that is, it expresses in our eyes.

32:16.207 --> 32:19.464
When I see some things,

32:20.166 --> 32:25.530
I see it as a joy-giving thing,
just joy-giving.

32:25.731 --> 32:29.931
And if I want to buy something, then
I think, “Alright,

32:30.132 --> 32:33.318
I can buy it for certain person. He will
like it” -

32:33.519 --> 32:38.350
because I’ll know what they like, so
I’ll buy that thing for that person.”

32:38.551 --> 32:42.847
Or else if I’m buying something for
my family, I think the same.

32:43.048 --> 32:46.479
Like I’ve built a house now where I’m going
to put all the things,

32:46.680 --> 32:49.152
the presents you have given, everything,
like a museum,

32:49.353 --> 32:52.285
and I’m going to ask all the villagers
to come and see it.

32:52.486 --> 32:56.719
Because they have never seen such things.
They can’t travel to Switzerland,

32:56.920 --> 32:59.797
leave alone England. So we have to –

32:59.998 --> 33:03.946
I’m thinking of making that house in such
a manner that these villagers,

33:04.147 --> 33:07.732
who have never seen beautiful things,
should come and see.

33:07.933 --> 33:12.240
In India, it’s not a case very much with
the simple people to have jealousies.

33:12.441 --> 33:17.335
Only the new materialistic people have
developed this habit of jealousy.

33:17.536 --> 33:21.241
But otherwise, they will always say,
“What a nice thing!

33:21.442 --> 33:24.232
How beautiful it is! How they are!”

33:24.433 --> 33:31.864
Like you were singing songs about Sahaja
Yoga in Poona.

33:32.341 --> 33:35.819
Actually, you have really picked up
very well, I must say,

33:36.020 --> 33:39.874
but there were masters of this music
sitting there, watching you singing.

33:40.075 --> 33:47.214
They were the masters of drama and play,
very well-known artists in India.

33:47.415 --> 33:50.745
And then they said that…

33:50.946 --> 33:54.870
where you went to see their play, also
in Poona if you remember.

33:55.071 --> 33:59.149
So they offered Me, “Mother, that we want
to celebrate Your birthday.”

33:59.350 --> 34:03.193
I said, “It’s very difficult because you’ll
be so far away.” “No, no, we’ll come!”

34:03.394 --> 34:05.558
The whole night they travelled

34:05.759 --> 34:09.065
and the whole day, practically. They came
about five o’clock, imagine.

34:09.266 --> 34:13.917
They finished their drama about, say,
3 o’clock or 4 o’clock,

34:14.118 --> 34:17.437
and then they travelled all the day,
arrived at about 5 o’clock

34:17.638 --> 34:23.004
from somewhere called Belgam, and 6:30
was the programme.

34:23.205 --> 34:27.338
So they were all dressed up, came,
and what a comparing they did!

34:27.539 --> 34:31.292
They said, “We were ashamed. We used
to think that we Maharashtrians

34:31.493 --> 34:34.731
are very good at music, very good at talas
and this.

34:34.932 --> 34:39.149
But we were ashamed the way these
foreigners sang

34:39.350 --> 34:44.004
our music so well. We cannot sing
like them.

34:44.205 --> 34:48.367
Though their music we cannot sing, while
they sang our music

34:48.568 --> 34:51.715
and we were all very much ashamed
and embarrassed.

34:51.916 --> 34:55.835
How could they sing so well?” And
the appreciation was so great

34:56.036 --> 34:59.446
that I was myself embarrassed, the way
they were saying,

34:59.647 --> 35:03.245
“How it has happened to these people?
What is – their guru – have done?

35:03.446 --> 35:07.092
What have they done to these people,
that they can sing so well?”

35:07.293 --> 35:12.103
So the appreciation and the whole thing
enamoured. We have a tape of that, I think.

35:12.304 --> 35:14.831
Audio tape; I don’t know if you have
video tape or not,

35:15.032 --> 35:17.962
but if you have, please get it.
It’s very interesting the way

35:18.163 --> 35:21.328
they appreciated my children, the way
they were singing.

35:21.529 --> 35:24.867
And to them, I felt in their saying
and all that,

35:25.068 --> 35:27.538
because they are such masters and

35:27.739 --> 35:31.502
so developed in their – the way
they were appreciating,

35:31.703 --> 35:34.832
as if they were appreciating children
singing something great.

35:35.033 --> 35:41.006
See the – in that the rapport was that
of a – a very sweet rapport of vatsalya,

35:41.207 --> 35:46.591
is the feeling of a motherliness,

35:46.792 --> 35:50.441
that, “Look at these children, are singing
so well.”

35:50.642 --> 35:55.698
It’s happened with many people I have
seen, when some artists came, as you know,

35:55.899 --> 36:00.630
that when they saw you people appreciating
and singing, they had the same feeling,

36:00.831 --> 36:04.229
“How could these children – how could
these people sing so well?

36:04.430 --> 36:10.438
How did they know so well?”.
I mean, all that beautiful feeling

36:10.639 --> 36:14.881
and all that appreciation created
such a nice atmosphere,

36:15.082 --> 36:18.933
as we had some very great artists
and how they appreciated you,

36:19.134 --> 36:21.927
instead of saying that, “Oh, what,
what are these,

36:22.128 --> 36:24.899
are no good for music and.” Nothing!

36:25.100 --> 36:26.883
They have so much appreciated that
these people

36:27.084 --> 36:30.150
who have never known Indian music
are singing so well.

36:30.351 --> 36:35.004
So in that appreciation also, that
fatherliness, that motherliness was there,

36:35.189 --> 36:40.114
that vatsalya was there, and the situation
was so beautiful.

36:40.315 --> 36:45.812
Even, say, when a person like Ravi Shankar
has to play with Yehudi Menuhin.

36:46.013 --> 36:50.740
Yehudi Menuhin is a child before him.
But I have seen how he looks after him

36:50.941 --> 36:55.713
and how he protects him, as we say
in my Hindi language “samhala”.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.705
All the time is looking after him
and managing it.

36:59.906 --> 37:06.267
And also, we have seen in the music part,
when supposing a tabla-wallah is sitting,

37:06.468 --> 37:09.956
and a very senior musician is sitting,
Master is sitting.

37:10.157 --> 37:13.555
He’ll say, “Please look after me, Samhala,
look after me,”

37:13.756 --> 37:20.021
always with very great feeling of a child
that, “You look after me.”

37:20.222 --> 37:24.204
All these things are very important in life
to create good relationships

37:24.421 --> 37:28.253
between ourselves also. Those who are
younger to us,

37:28.454 --> 37:33.841
those who are not so well-off, or those
who are not so much talented,

37:34.042 --> 37:40.794
or those who are not so much equipped
in knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

37:40.995 --> 37:44.508
or who are not so much senior in Sahaja
Yoga.

37:44.698 --> 37:49.350
We have to look after the others, like
in a very fatherly manner

37:49.551 --> 37:53.981
or, we can say, as a motherly manner,
that they are not equipped. So alright.

37:54.182 --> 37:57.393
We have a Ganesha Tattwa, so excite
their Ganesha Tattwa.

37:57.594 --> 38:04.943
They should feel dependant on us
for achieving the mastery,

38:05.144 --> 38:08.498
or achieving the higher state. As the Guru
Principle

38:08.699 --> 38:12.038
is absolutely bound by Ganesha Principle.

38:12.239 --> 38:14.327
If a guru does not have a Ganesh Principle,

38:14.528 --> 38:19.032
he becomes a horrid, horrid, horrid fellow
and nobody wants to stick onto him

38:19.233 --> 38:22.696
and they all run away from him. Though
he might punish,

38:22.897 --> 38:28.276
he might also get angry with the disciples.
But basically what he thinks,

38:28.477 --> 38:32.769
“He is my progeny, I am developing him,
I’m building up.”

38:32.970 --> 38:35.418
But in the modern thinking is that,

38:35.619 --> 38:38.419
“Let them be individuals, let them
be independent.”

38:38.620 --> 38:42.543
So the father and mother do not look
after their children in that manner

38:42.744 --> 38:47.610
that they should. “That see, this is my
son, I’ve got a talent. I must teach him,

38:47.811 --> 38:53.393
he must come up, he is the one who is
a continuation of my own self.”

38:53.594 --> 38:56.959
So this idea of having every individual,
you are individual,

38:57.160 --> 39:01.107
at eighteen years you get out of the house,
you do what you like, stand on your legs.

39:01.308 --> 39:07.214
No, life is a continuous basis. It is
not just “you stand on your legs”,

39:07.415 --> 39:12.969
but is a question of one has to be
all the time connected with the whole.

39:13.170 --> 39:17.428
Unless and until you are connected
completely,

39:17.629 --> 39:21.351
we cannot understand collectivity
of innocence.

39:21.552 --> 39:25.111
The collectivity of innocence, I see
sometimes, I’m very happy

39:25.312 --> 39:30.486
that a child of somebody is in the lap
of somebody, sitting very sweetly,

39:30.687 --> 39:34.916
coming as if he is your own father, coming
and sitting just on your lap,

39:35.116 --> 39:37.732
without knowing that, “He is not
my father.”

39:37.933 --> 39:41.402
But still, that consciousness is not there.

39:41.714 --> 39:44.858
So this breaks the feeling of my
and possession,

39:45.059 --> 39:47.309
that, “This is mine, this is mine,
this is mine.”

39:47.510 --> 39:54.287
And what makes you - the feeling that
we are now a means,

39:54.537 --> 39:57.318
a means, we can say, an instrument,

39:57.519 --> 40:02.023
a media, by which we express the Ganesha
Tattwa all over,

40:02.224 --> 40:07.397
that is vibrations. So the vibrations
itself, about which you are asking,

40:07.598 --> 40:11.639
these vibrations themselves are nothing
but the Principle of Shri Ganesha.

40:11.840 --> 40:15.012
He is Omkara. And when it is,
then what is it,

40:15.213 --> 40:19.098
that feeling as I told you, the vatsalya,

40:19.299 --> 40:23.737
the feeling of love between a child
and a mother.

40:23.938 --> 40:29.392
That feeling, it is the one that is
vibrations,

40:29.593 --> 40:36.590
between the child and the mother.
The distance between the two is vibrations,

40:36.791 --> 40:39.251
and that’s what one has to feel –

40:39.452 --> 40:47.940
that he’s a child still and there’s the
mother and mother is bringing the child,

40:48.141 --> 40:52.701
giving all the powers to the child,
bringing up, loving the child,

40:52.902 --> 40:57.765
understanding the limitations of the child,
looking after, all that.

40:57.966 --> 41:04.725
All the sweetness, all the wisdom
of the child to be appreciated.

41:04.926 --> 41:08.877
That is vibrations. And if you see
the subtle side of this,

41:09.078 --> 41:14.798
it’s not “my” child. Should not – this is
not only a limited thing,

41:14.999 --> 41:20.505
because it is eternal, it’s everywhere,
so you cannot have it limited.

41:20.706 --> 41:28.062
In everything you do, I have seen, people
the way they handle things in the West –

41:28.263 --> 41:31.992
we Indians have to learn also from them.

41:34.973 --> 41:37.428
What’s happening?

41:39.088 --> 41:43.612
So we have to accept for them what is -

41:43.813 --> 41:48.176
what is the way to handle also beautiful
things,

41:48.377 --> 41:54.571
how to look after beautiful things, how
to manage beautiful relationships.

41:54.772 --> 41:59.990
See, you shouldn’t be harsh, you shouldn’t
be unkind, you shouldn’t say things,

42:00.191 --> 42:05.061
which are insulting to others, so that
the relationships are broken.

42:05.262 --> 42:09.267
So all the relationships that are between
human beings and God,

42:09.468 --> 42:14.862
are through the Ganesha Principle. So
when it becomes the relationship

42:15.063 --> 42:19.513
between you and God, then there are
vibrations.

42:19.714 --> 42:25.095
And then that same relationship should
extend to everything that you do.

42:25.296 --> 42:30.873
You should see what things are good,
whatever has got vibrations.

42:31.074 --> 42:34.473
Today I want to tell you something
very important

42:34.674 --> 42:37.972
about this all-pervading power we heard
about.

42:38.173 --> 42:43.531
These are nothing but vibrations. This
Paramachaitanya is nothing but vibrations,

42:43.732 --> 42:46.222
where all identities are lost –

42:46.423 --> 42:49.423
where the mother is lost, father is lost,
we can say,

42:49.624 --> 42:59.663
nothing remains, then it is just these
vibrations, this subtle vatsalya exists.

42:59.864 --> 43:04.024
That’s all. And this is the only thing,

43:04.225 --> 43:09.046
out of which everything comes and remains
in itself.

43:09.247 --> 43:12.172
Like we can say that the sun’s rays
come out

43:12.373 --> 43:16.907
and then they try to create chlorophyll.

43:17.696 --> 43:21.442
So it’s not that we cannot compare sun
with that.

43:21.643 --> 43:27.230
Or we can say, from the ocean the clouds
come out

43:27.431 --> 43:34.612
and they try to nourish the Mother Earth.
That’s also not – cannot be compared.

43:34.813 --> 43:36.809
Everything is inside that.

43:37.010 --> 43:40.725
This Paramachaitanya has got everything
inside this.

43:40.926 --> 43:45.773
So we can say that everything is nothing
but knowledge,

43:45.974 --> 43:49.303
is nothing but truth, is nothing but light.

43:49.504 --> 43:53.765
But when the folds of these come out,

43:54.335 --> 44:01.074
then we get into the folds of that
Chaitanya and then we become ignorant.

44:01.275 --> 44:06.602
But there is nothing like ignorance.
It doesn’t exist, it doesn’t exist.

44:06.803 --> 44:10.197
Like there is darkness because there’s
no light.

44:10.398 --> 44:16.637
Once light comes, it doesn’t exist, doesn’t
exist. So ignorance doesn’t exist.

44:16.838 --> 44:25.604
But what happens that the folds of this
ocean, into that people go and it is lost.

44:26.370 --> 44:29.016
Thus we understand one thing very clearly:

44:29.217 --> 44:33.740
that we are in Paramachaitanya.
We are made by Paramachaitanya,

44:33.941 --> 44:37.267
all the time we are surrounded by it.
Only thing is,

44:37.468 --> 44:40.840
we are sometimes lost in the folds.

44:41.041 --> 44:43.965
And why? Why we are lost in the folds

44:44.166 --> 44:55.814
is because of our own – our own
unawareness.

44:56.015 --> 45:02.633
This awareness has to come: that we are
part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya.

45:02.834 --> 45:11.009
The whole thing is called as chidvilasa,
is the vilas,

45:11.755 --> 45:18.210
is the playful enjoyment of God’s
Attention.

45:19.059 --> 45:21.088
Now you will say, “How can that be?”

45:21.289 --> 45:25.865
For example, we see the sun –just to give
a simile closer to it,

45:26.066 --> 45:31.836
we see the sun and then we see the water.
We see the water in the lake, alright?

45:32.037 --> 45:35.914
There is water – because of the sun,
we can see the water there.

45:36.115 --> 45:39.497
Then supposing, we see the mirage.

45:39.698 --> 45:44.123
We see the mirage and then we think
this is water,

45:44.324 --> 45:49.802
we go run after the water. But the whole
thing is the play of the sun:

45:50.200 --> 45:54.826
whether it’s a mirage, whether it’s
a water, whether it’s the sun.

45:56.814 --> 46:00.264
In the same way, this Paramachaitanya acts

46:00.465 --> 46:06.339
and what we get lost is, in our awareness,
that we are Paramachaitanya.

46:06.540 --> 46:09.572
That’s why the play starts, the play starts

46:09.773 --> 46:15.351
like yesterday’s – day before yesterday’s
Puja, what did we do?

46:15.828 --> 46:19.406
We were sitting there and it started
raining.

46:19.607 --> 46:26.502
So - to prove, to prove that I can control
rain.

46:26.807 --> 46:30.165
So it rained. Some people were
covering up, some thing, this thing.

46:30.366 --> 46:34.451
I gave a bandhan. After some time,
the rain moved out

46:34.652 --> 46:39.953
from the Puja to the back side. It was
not raining where you were sitting.

46:40.154 --> 46:44.576
And after that, it became a sun and
it was so clouded.

46:44.777 --> 46:47.018
Sun came, it was, became sunny,

46:47.219 --> 46:53.068
so that’s how you have to become aware
of the powers of Chaitanya.

46:53.269 --> 46:58.202
Now when you give bandhan, what you do
is to put the Chaitanya into action,

46:58.403 --> 47:01.688
“Now act here, act there, act here.”

47:01.889 --> 47:08.290
Though you are, supposing, in the ocean,
but the ocean acts on you all the time.

47:08.491 --> 47:11.470
You cannot act on the ocean, you cannot
ask water

47:11.671 --> 47:15.155
to do this and do that. But as realised
souls, you are empowered,

47:15.356 --> 47:20.370
now you can ask water, “Alright, you
dissolve this, you do this, you do that.”

47:21.405 --> 47:23.940
But for that, it is important to be
the masters.

47:24.141 --> 47:28.527
And to become the masters, you see -
like a matter becomes a human being,

47:28.728 --> 47:32.090
and from human being, you have to become
the masters of the matter

47:32.291 --> 47:35.540
and you handle the matter.  So we come
back to the same.

47:35.741 --> 47:38.868
Like agriculture, we can handle, just
vibrating it.

47:39.069 --> 47:41.486
We can handle water, we can handle
the sun,

47:41.687 --> 47:44.032
we can handle moon - because there’s
a rapport.

47:44.233 --> 47:47.850
Now we are aware, a rapport has been
established.

47:48.051 --> 47:52.216
So all this play is extremely beautiful
to me. I see it.

47:52.417 --> 47:59.415
But now you all have to know that you
all have become realised souls

47:59.616 --> 48:05.732
and you have those powers. So all
other nonsensical things that you learn,

48:05.933 --> 48:09.447
all nonsensical things you indulge into,
you’d better give up.

48:09.648 --> 48:14.131
There’s no sense in it. Whatever is
sensible you should do

48:14.332 --> 48:17.782
because there’s Shri Ganesha within you,
who is absolutely sensible.

48:17.983 --> 48:21.015
He is nothing but sense. He is the giver
of sense,

48:21.216 --> 48:24.538
so He is the killer of the demons,
as they say.

48:24.739 --> 48:27.785
He is the one who removes all the ordeals.
By how?

48:27.986 --> 48:30.351
By improving our awareness.

48:30.552 --> 48:35.531
Though ordeals do not remain because
you give a bandhan, it works out.

48:35.732 --> 48:40.201
Now I asked somebody – Phil – I asked
him to write down about the miracles,

48:40.402 --> 48:44.536
and he says now it has become like
a voluminous book.

48:44.737 --> 48:48.511
It will be because before realization

48:48.712 --> 48:52.988
whatever looked like miracle is no more
a miracle. Miracle has lost its meaning.

48:53.189 --> 48:55.584
Because now you are empowered
and you can do it.

48:55.785 --> 49:00.240
It works in everything: in your talent,
in your understanding,

49:00.441 --> 49:03.714
in your education, in every way. Like
there are some boys who said,

49:03.915 --> 49:07.349
“Mother, You see, we couldn’t solve
one problem so we gave a bandhan.

49:07.550 --> 49:11.688
Immediately the whole thing came onto us
and we wrote it down” and they stood first.

49:11.889 --> 49:16.945
It has happened with many. So in every
action, in everything,

49:17.146 --> 49:22.022
whatever you do, you should know it is
the Paramachaitanya that acts.

49:22.223 --> 49:26.154
Only thing you have to be aware
of yourself, and aware of it, it acts;

49:26.355 --> 49:31.276
and you just jump into that awareness
and it works.

49:32.217 --> 49:37.398
And that you have seen. But still,
so many people do not know.

49:37.816 --> 49:41.521
So many people still, though they know
through their brains,

49:41.722 --> 49:44.071
do not know in their hearts. And so many
people,

49:44.272 --> 49:47.850
even if they know in their hearts,
they do not act in their attention.

49:48.051 --> 49:51.909
So only these three things you have
to improve: is one is your head,

49:52.110 --> 49:54.953
another is your heart and third is
your liver.

49:55.154 --> 49:59.124
If you can improve these three organs,
this Paramachaitanya will act.

49:59.325 --> 50:02.059
But then, all this attention about money.

50:02.260 --> 50:06.739
So many people, money this, that.
There’s nothing to worry.

50:07.224 --> 50:10.115
Paramachaitanya will create everything
for you, whatever you want.

50:10.316 --> 50:13.753
It may not create money because it
doesn’t have a mint, but it will create

50:13.954 --> 50:16.255
possibilities –

50:19.988 --> 50:25.389
possibilities. And this is something to be
understood very well, and it’s so blissful

50:25.590 --> 50:28.504
to know that now you are aware
of the Paramachaitanya

50:28.705 --> 50:32.965
and you can master it. Master it
in the sense not that you dominate it,

50:33.166 --> 50:35.480
but you ask him like a jinn. You know,
you can say,

50:35.681 --> 50:40.366
“All right, do this, do that”, with
respect. With respect it works.

50:40.567 --> 50:44.510
But the way sometimes we do not pay
respect to Paramachaitanya

50:44.711 --> 50:49.618
is also something surprising. The way we
act all the time, the way we are behaving.

50:49.819 --> 50:54.317
Like in my presence, people will sit down
and close their eyes,

50:54.518 --> 50:59.674
or they will start worshipping
the photograph instead of me.

50:59.875 --> 51:03.326
Sometimes, the way they handle
their Kundalini,

51:03.527 --> 51:07.341
sometimes, the way they behave towards
themselves and others -

51:07.542 --> 51:09.274
all these things are to be understood,

51:09.475 --> 51:12.225
now that we have entered into the Kingdom
of God,

51:12.426 --> 51:19.940
means Paramachaitanya, and that we are
very important citizens of that.

51:20.141 --> 51:26.034
If one can understand this, then I think,
Sahaja Yoga can be very successful.

51:26.235 --> 51:30.058
Everything will work out. It, miraculously,
everything will work out.

51:30.259 --> 51:33.349
And all those who are not aware

51:33.550 --> 51:36.671
about the possibilities as to what they
can reach,

51:36.872 --> 51:39.536
they are thrown out, in the sense,
in the fold,

51:39.737 --> 51:43.392
in the ignorance, so-called, into
the darkness.

51:43.593 --> 51:47.221
Again they can come back to light
when they have sense.

51:47.422 --> 51:50.811
So be forgiving about them. It can happen
to you also

51:51.012 --> 51:52.908
if you understand that way.

51:53.109 --> 51:57.812
I hope, today’s lecture you have been
able to assimilate within yourself.

51:58.013 --> 52:02.793
That’s very important to assimilate, to
know that you are in the Paramachaitanya.

52:02.994 --> 52:08.874
And that’s how you’ll become very sweet,
you’ll become very considerate,

52:09.075 --> 52:17.175
and very loving, affectionate and wise.
That’s very important.

52:18.175 --> 52:21.027
May God bless you.

52:46.877 --> 52:50.875
The point, about which some leaders
have said, that

52:51.076 --> 52:55.750
you people don’t buy individually my tapes.

52:55.951 --> 53:00.049
And then, you come to the ashrams and
want to listen to my tapes again and again.

53:00.250 --> 53:02.715
And you spoil the tapes. This is wrong.

53:02.916 --> 53:06.106
You are all sahaja yogis, you must
respect.

53:06.307 --> 53:12.330
And all of you must try to get the tapes
properly,

53:12.531 --> 53:20.013
in proper manner, and should use your own
tapes carefully and with respect.

53:20.214 --> 53:25.447
Because some people are taking away also
the tapes from the ashrams and using them.

53:25.648 --> 53:30.216
No, it’s very precious. All of you should
treat it as a very precious thing.

53:30.417 --> 53:37.329
And all of you should take tapes which have
been created by the ashram and use them.

53:37.530 --> 53:41.179
But in the ashram you can use it once
in a while.

53:41.380 --> 53:45.990
But for your house, for your car -

53:46.191 --> 53:50.622
or I have seen that in other horrible
false guru’s people, they just take

53:50.823 --> 53:54.713
the tapes, never play any music, nothing,
they are just playing the tapes.

53:54.914 --> 53:57.557
So in the same way, you can have that,

53:57.758 --> 54:02.429
because it’s not easy to understand
my lecture in one first shot.

54:02.630 --> 54:05.713
You have to individually sit down
and listen to it

54:05.914 --> 54:08.975
and decode it and see for yourself,
what it is.

54:09.176 --> 54:14.314
Because my - I myself when I listen
to my lectures, I get lost.
