00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.434
1991-09-01 Shri Krishna puja - The technique of the play, Cabella, Italy

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:40.234
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:48.434
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:54.334
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.167
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:05.267
But also yoga has another meaning which means yukti.

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:10.167
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:17.033
We can call it as... Yukti means the trick.

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:26.167
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:31.400
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:35.067
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:43.000
But one can say it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:49.067
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.067
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

00:04:55.534 --> 00:05:02.067
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.434
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:15.067
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.100
At Krishna's level when we reach

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:25.067
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:32.300
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

00:05:32.334 --> 00:05:47.067
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:56.067
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.334
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:08.067
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:19.534
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.234
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:27.567
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:31.100
So Shri Krishna had to come -

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:34.567
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

00:06:35.267 --> 00:06:44.067
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:55.534
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.067
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:06.067
you have electrical communications.

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:11.434
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:16.500
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

00:07:17.133 --> 00:07:21.067
Supposing only you know all the technique,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.067
then it becomes quite a headache,

00:07:27.033 --> 00:07:30.067
because all the time you think you are doing it.

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:33.434
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:39.067
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

00:07:40.067 --> 00:07:42.200
You get tired and bored.

00:07:43.234 --> 00:07:50.200
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:57.067
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.067
And that is what is Leela, that's why He is called 'Leeladhara' -

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:11.067
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:20.067
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:33.067
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:40.334
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:47.067
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:54.067
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

00:08:57.467 --> 00:08:59.500
In the morning you get up.

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:06.334
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:12.400
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.067
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:24.033
And at that time you sit down for your dhyaan.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:32.033
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.300
But for that you have to be a master.

00:09:39.067 --> 00:09:44.067
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:47.334
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:53.067
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

00:09:54.167 --> 00:09:59.067
so that it becomes your play.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:09.067
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:18.300
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:22.300
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:28.467
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:34.067
It looks, very childlike.

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:41.067
Like when the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

00:10:41.334 --> 00:10:44.500
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:50.033
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:54.067
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:08.067
They're coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:13.067
Already there are vibrations, you see - raising their Kundalini.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.133
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.000
which have also got vibrated water in.

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:33.133
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

00:11:34.267 --> 00:11:38.267
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.467
See the play of a child,

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:50.067
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

00:11:51.267 --> 00:11:59.067
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:05.500
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:11.300
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' .

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:15.267
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:19.500
So the "Dha Re Di Sa Dharmaha"  as they say.

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:25.067
In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:32.367
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.234
I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

00:12:38.534 --> 00:12:44.300
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.300
Just feel very happy.

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:50.067
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:59.067
for joy or at the most happiness.

00:13:00.133 --> 00:13:03.133
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

00:13:03.334 --> 00:13:09.067
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:12.067
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

00:13:12.067 --> 00:13:15.067
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:22.334
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:26.133
to all the people with whom He was connected.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.067
So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do Rasa.

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:35.067
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.033
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

00:13:39.267 --> 00:13:44.200
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:49.234
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.067
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.000
So this was another play that He had.

00:13:58.167 --> 00:14:02.067
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:08.267
But in modern times it's very difficult,

00:14:10.367 --> 00:14:15.033
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:23.334
I mean, nobody will understand also.

00:14:26.234 --> 00:14:33.067
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.400
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.234
and also empowering the person with

00:14:41.534 --> 00:14:46.367
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

00:14:48.033 --> 00:14:50.567
And that's why we had to find out these methods

00:14:51.067 --> 00:14:55.067
by which we could give realization to people.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:04.033
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

00:15:04.367 --> 00:15:07.067
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

00:15:07.067 --> 00:15:11.033
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

00:15:11.267 --> 00:15:18.067
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

00:15:18.067 --> 00:15:24.334
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

00:15:24.334 --> 00:15:28.367
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:37.200
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:46.133
The first is that His character was 'madhuriya', meaning the sweetness.

00:15:47.434 --> 00:15:54.067
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

00:15:56.434 --> 00:16:03.067
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:13.067
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:20.067
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:27.400
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

00:16:30.367 --> 00:16:34.033
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

00:16:34.067 --> 00:16:42.067
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.067
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:52.267
the communication between human beings

00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:58.167
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:03.067
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:06.267
which is not true.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.334
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:20.067
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

00:17:20.067 --> 00:17:24.234
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:32.000
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:38.067
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

00:17:39.334 --> 00:17:46.067
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

00:17:46.267 --> 00:17:50.267
that trick one has to learn:

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.500
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:02.334
This is one of His special qualities,

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:09.400
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.067
in a very sweet manner, and

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:23.300
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.067
Now there are many tricks

00:18:27.534 --> 00:18:34.067
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:38.267
First of all you must always show

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:42.067
that you are less intelligent than another person.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.300
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:54.067
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:19:02.067
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.400
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

00:19:15.334 --> 00:19:21.067
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.400
Musician feels very happy.

00:19:24.434 --> 00:19:29.067
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:36.067
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:45.067
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:51.267
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

00:19:51.334 --> 00:19:57.067
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:07.467
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

00:20:09.267 --> 00:20:13.067
but I would like to hear" this is first.

00:20:14.067 --> 00:20:17.400
The first quality of communication is to be

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.400
extremely humble about yourself.

00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:24.067
The other person should not know who you are.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.067
And there's a lot of fun in it.

00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:37.100
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.400
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

00:20:42.067 --> 00:20:47.067
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

00:20:47.267 --> 00:20:52.067
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

00:20:52.234 --> 00:20:54.067
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

00:20:54.067 --> 00:20:58.000
just a useless, small, little place

00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:01.067
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:05.234
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:07.234
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:11.234
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:19.133
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:22.067
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:26.200
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.033
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.300
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

00:21:32.467 --> 00:21:35.067
She had started looking down upon Me,

00:21:35.067 --> 00:21:38.067
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

00:21:43.234 --> 00:21:51.067
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

00:21:52.234 --> 00:21:54.200
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

00:21:54.234 --> 00:21:59.067
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.067
This boastfullness is of no use.

00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:06.567
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:10.067
But if you want I can try."

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:24.434
So play down as much as you can. Practice this at home,

00:22:26.067 --> 00:22:29.067
first practice and then do it.

00:22:30.167 --> 00:22:36.000
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.100
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:43.334
there's one is very important thing.

00:22:43.334 --> 00:22:46.167
He says "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:51.167
You see among all the worst things that we have -

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.067
according to Him we have six enemies.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.200
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:06.067
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:14.434
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

00:23:15.434 --> 00:23:21.067
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.234
He can make you dance like this.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.067
What is the need to lose your temper?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.400
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

00:23:34.234 --> 00:23:38.434
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:43.400
and something starts barking,

00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:49.234
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:56.000
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

00:23:58.467 --> 00:24:03.500
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.067
from one to another to another to another.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.400
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:22.367
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

00:24:23.033 --> 00:24:25.167
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

00:24:25.567 --> 00:24:29.067
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:34.300
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

00:24:35.067 --> 00:24:39.500
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

00:24:40.234 --> 00:24:46.067
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.200
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.467
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.067
Many people I have seen people say

00:24:57.067 --> 00:24:59.334
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:02.434
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

00:25:03.067 --> 00:25:05.267
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

00:25:05.267 --> 00:25:07.334
No, no I'm very good."

00:25:08.334 --> 00:25:14.067
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

00:25:15.133 --> 00:25:18.067
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:25.067
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

00:25:25.067 --> 00:25:28.067
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:32.067
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

00:25:32.067 --> 00:25:36.234
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:42.267
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:50.400
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:53.067
There is no need to take to temper.

00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:56.234
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

00:25:57.067 --> 00:25:58.567
Why are you doing that way?"

00:25:59.033 --> 00:26:02.067
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:04.067
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:11.067
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:16.067
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

00:26:19.534 --> 00:26:23.334
If you just stop at a point,

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:30.067
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

00:26:30.167 --> 00:26:33.334
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

00:26:33.567 --> 00:26:37.067
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:41.067
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

00:26:41.334 --> 00:26:45.334
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:50.467
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:55.067
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.167
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:06.534
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.200
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.167
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:23.000
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:28.067
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.067
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:35.067
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.234
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:46.467
you'll never feel guilty.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.067
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:53.000
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.267
Next time you won't do it.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.400
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

00:28:03.167 --> 00:28:09.400
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

00:28:11.033 --> 00:28:12.067
And I'm very much worried about

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:17.067
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.367
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:28.067
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:35.133
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

00:28:35.267 --> 00:28:39.033
and when you touch them it becomes water.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:46.334
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:50.300
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

00:28:50.467 --> 00:28:56.067
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

00:28:59.334 --> 00:29:01.500
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:04.534
But women don't, they keep it there

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:09.400
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:14.534
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:19.133
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

00:29:19.267 --> 00:29:23.067
but it's tears just to impress another person that

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:26.067
you are very sad or something.

00:29:36.334 --> 00:29:42.100
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

00:29:42.434 --> 00:29:46.067
and the third one is how to master

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:53.067
the temper of others - that's even better.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.000
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

00:29:58.067 --> 00:30:01.067
Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.000
He is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.067
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

00:30:07.234 --> 00:30:09.067
so he was sitting in the water

00:30:09.067 --> 00:30:14.434
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.000
I never saw the tiger, of course.

00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:20.300
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

00:30:20.334 --> 00:30:22.300
so I went to see him.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:28.067
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:31.100
for about one and a half hours.

00:30:31.467 --> 00:30:35.033
And as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:38.300
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

00:30:39.234 --> 00:30:41.200
so he felt very challenged!

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.334
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:47.067
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:52.100
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:56.500
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

00:30:59.033 --> 00:31:01.067
He touched my feet, everything he did and then he said,

00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:05.067
"You tell me now - why did you not allow me to stop the water?

00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:10.334
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.133
But why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:20.033
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.234
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

00:31:29.067 --> 00:31:33.400
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.033
that too of an orange colour, and I would

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.400
not take the orange colour sari from you.

00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:41.367
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

00:31:42.067 --> 00:31:45.067
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

00:31:45.267 --> 00:31:53.067
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master.

00:31:56.534 --> 00:32:04.534
First of all how to melt him and secondly the master of his mind.

00:32:06.067 --> 00:32:12.267
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

00:32:13.267 --> 00:32:16.334
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.467
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:25.067
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:29.334
But if you try just to know about a person -

00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:34.067
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

00:32:34.334 --> 00:32:38.067
So first try to understand a person.

00:32:40.334 --> 00:32:43.334
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:47.167
and a very humorous person.

00:32:48.334 --> 00:32:51.067
And one day My brother told me, Babamama,

00:32:51.067 --> 00:32:54.067
that he has a friend who sings very well.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.267
So I asked my father "How does he sing?"

00:32:57.367 --> 00:33:01.434
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

00:33:02.067 --> 00:33:05.200
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:11.000
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.500
"He's very courageous you see.

00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:15.500
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:19.567
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him -

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:21.334
he said "He's courageous" -

00:33:21.434 --> 00:33:24.067
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

00:33:24.067 --> 00:33:27.234
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

00:33:27.267 --> 00:33:31.067
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.067
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:44.067
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

00:33:45.033 --> 00:33:47.067
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

00:33:47.067 --> 00:33:51.067
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.067
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:04.067
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

00:34:04.067 --> 00:34:06.067
with all his qualities, with everything

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:10.067
and accepting that person as he is.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.267
If that mastery you can have.

00:34:15.033 --> 00:34:19.100
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.133
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

00:34:25.133 --> 00:34:30.167
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

00:34:30.167 --> 00:34:35.167
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:40.267
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:47.267
Little additional swara (musical note) is added to his character.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:53.267
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You'll really enjoy.

00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:57.367
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

00:34:58.033 --> 00:35:00.234
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:03.200
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:05.500
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

00:35:06.033 --> 00:35:12.067
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

00:35:12.534 --> 00:35:18.534
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:25.067
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

00:35:25.267 --> 00:35:27.534
or the defects of that person.

00:35:28.567 --> 00:35:31.601
But you need not say directly something to him.

00:35:34.267 --> 00:35:39.400
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400
that the person will understand.

00:35:43.167 --> 00:35:51.167
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:58.234
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.567
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:05.601
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

00:36:06.133 --> 00:36:11.267
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

00:36:11.534 --> 00:36:15.601
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

00:36:16.467 --> 00:36:24.100
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

00:36:25.067 --> 00:36:26.300
that's no good.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.067
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

00:36:31.267 --> 00:36:33.334
but you are lost forever for that person.

00:36:33.567 --> 00:36:37.067
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:42.400
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:42.634 --> 00:36:47.067
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

00:36:47.067 --> 00:36:49.334
that it doesn't hurt the person,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.067
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

00:36:58.234 --> 00:37:02.067
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

00:37:04.601 --> 00:37:15.067
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.400
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:25.100
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

00:37:25.634 --> 00:37:29.234
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

00:37:29.267 --> 00:37:33.667
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:38.234
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:46.067
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:49.200
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.234
For example, if you want to say that:

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:55.133
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:58.234
should be there at the right time.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.300
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.601
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:06.334
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:10.067
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.000
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

00:38:15.033 --> 00:38:18.234
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.167
for the time being. So transfer it.

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:30.267
And this transference is 'astantar' as they call it.

00:38:30.434 --> 00:38:37.200
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:42.067
There is a story about Him.

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:47.067
He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:51.200
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

00:38:52.033 --> 00:38:56.400
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

00:38:56.467 --> 00:39:01.300
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:05.067
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

00:39:05.067 --> 00:39:08.067
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

00:39:09.267 --> 00:39:13.534
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

00:39:14.334 --> 00:39:19.267
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:26.000
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:32.067
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

00:39:32.067 --> 00:39:34.100
and if I open my eyes

00:39:34.467 --> 00:39:40.100
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma."

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:46.500
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

00:39:47.334 --> 00:39:51.300
So He started running away from the field.

00:39:51.434 --> 00:39:54.300
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

00:39:54.634 --> 00:40:02.334
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

00:40:02.601 --> 00:40:09.067
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

00:40:10.067 --> 00:40:14.067
and hid himself in the cave.

00:40:15.033 --> 00:40:18.400
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:21.167
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:24.300
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

00:40:24.467 --> 00:40:27.033
And he started waking [him] up.

00:40:27.234 --> 00:40:32.400
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

00:40:33.434 --> 00:40:41.100
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:48.601
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:52.601
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.400
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:03.634
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:08.100
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:13.200
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

00:41:13.434 --> 00:41:18.267
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

00:41:20.634 --> 00:41:23.634
And so many tricks He played.

00:41:29.534 --> 00:41:37.434
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:45.067
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:58.267
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:05.067
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:07.400
He told Arjuna not himself;

00:42:07.534 --> 00:42:14.067
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - Sarathi.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:22.500
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:29.000
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

00:42:30.567 --> 00:42:41.400
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:47.367
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:56.400
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.267
How are you going to save them?

00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:07.167
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:10.500
while Arjuna was his disciple.

00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:37.434
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:41.367
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:50.634
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

00:43:51.234 --> 00:43:55.534
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

00:43:56.067 --> 00:44:00.067
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

00:44:00.067 --> 00:44:06.234
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

00:44:07.267 --> 00:44:11.133
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

00:44:12.167 --> 00:44:20.133
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

00:44:22.133 --> 00:44:26.267
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

00:44:27.534 --> 00:44:33.200
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

00:44:33.434 --> 00:44:35.400
To get rid of the ill -

00:44:35.567 --> 00:44:39.234
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

00:44:39.234 --> 00:44:44.200
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:49.100
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:55.100
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

00:44:56.033 --> 00:44:58.133
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.601
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.334
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:15.033
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

00:45:15.534 --> 00:45:20.033
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

00:45:20.434 --> 00:45:24.667
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

00:45:25.167 --> 00:45:30.267
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:37.267
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:39.500
Without weapons also He can do everything.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.067
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:55.067
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.267
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.000
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

00:46:04.267 --> 00:46:06.234
because I don't want them to see.

00:46:06.434 --> 00:46:11.167
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:15.067
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

00:46:15.634 --> 00:46:18.133
and you know what they are playing with you.

00:46:18.334 --> 00:46:23.601
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.400
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:34.234
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:38.300
will improve very much with others.

00:46:39.267 --> 00:46:43.500
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:50.234
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.167
What is bhootish?"

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:57.200
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.033
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

00:47:02.067 --> 00:47:05.367
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:12.334
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

00:47:13.067 --> 00:47:17.067
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.100
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

00:47:21.467 --> 00:47:25.234
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:28.000
then it's even more important.

00:47:28.234 --> 00:47:31.200
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

00:47:31.234 --> 00:47:33.067
We'll have to take it out."

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:38.300
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

00:47:38.334 --> 00:47:42.601
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

00:47:43.067 --> 00:47:45.400
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

00:47:46.067 --> 00:47:48.267
because you know he is cunning.

00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:50.667
What's the use of playing with that?

00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:53.500
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

00:47:53.567 --> 00:47:58.067
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

00:48:00.033 --> 00:48:06.133
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:08.334
Not the whole world.

00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:14.267
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:20.467
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.300
It's not meant for ordinary people.

00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:29.067
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.400
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.267
and we find that they create problems for us.

00:48:39.367 --> 00:48:43.100
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:46.334
as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and Gopis;

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.400
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

00:48:53.167 --> 00:48:59.467
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

00:49:00.634 --> 00:49:04.634
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:05.367 --> 00:49:08.400
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

00:49:09.334 --> 00:49:13.300
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

00:49:16.033 --> 00:49:19.167
And He did it because He was such a master.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.601
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

00:49:25.033 --> 00:49:27.267
to master himself, because He knew himself,

00:49:27.434 --> 00:49:31.467
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

00:49:32.601 --> 00:49:34.300
When you know everything

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.400
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:42.267
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:53.067
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.601
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

00:49:58.667 --> 00:50:03.067
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

00:50:05.067 --> 00:50:10.434
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.500
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:19.601
As I must have told you so many examples

00:50:20.133 --> 00:50:22.100
that the western negativity is like this

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:26.467
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.367
They don't like to work anyway.

00:50:31.534 --> 00:50:39.234
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:43.067
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

00:50:43.234 --> 00:50:48.334
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:52.400
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

00:50:53.334 --> 00:50:58.400
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:04.067
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

00:51:04.234 --> 00:51:08.367
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.100
Except for your brain everything works.

00:51:13.367 --> 00:51:15.500
But the other way around it is:

00:51:16.234 --> 00:51:20.100
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.267
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.367
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.267
I must do something."

00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:38.234
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

00:51:38.467 --> 00:51:44.334
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

00:51:45.434 --> 00:51:48.067
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

00:51:48.133 --> 00:51:50.267
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:52.634
if that is not available do this.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.601
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

00:51:57.567 --> 00:52:03.334
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:06.467
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

00:52:07.067 --> 00:52:11.067
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:14.067
the Master of Masters we should say.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:21.067
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.634
She thought of Shri Krishna.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:29.434
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

00:52:29.601 --> 00:52:32.100
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

00:52:32.267 --> 00:52:35.400
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

00:52:36.033 --> 00:52:38.067
So She was holding on.

00:52:38.434 --> 00:52:41.234
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

00:52:42.267 --> 00:52:49.133
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

00:52:52.067 --> 00:52:58.234
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:04.067
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:10.167
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

00:53:10.267 --> 00:53:14.434
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

00:53:15.267 --> 00:53:24.400
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.100
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

00:53:29.334 --> 00:53:33.100
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:39.067
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

00:53:39.467 --> 00:53:42.500
to save the chastity of His sister -

00:53:43.267 --> 00:53:48.234
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:53.434
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

00:53:55.667 --> 00:54:01.367
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

00:54:01.467 --> 00:54:03.300
which are too many!

00:54:03.634 --> 00:54:09.567
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:13.267
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

00:54:13.367 --> 00:54:15.500
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

00:54:16.067 --> 00:54:19.567
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:29.033
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

00:54:29.067 --> 00:54:34.334
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

00:54:35.667 --> 00:54:40.000
But if you believe in yourself

00:54:40.434 --> 00:54:47.467
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:54.067
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

00:54:55.601 --> 00:55:01.567
then I'm sure you can become masters.

00:55:02.167 --> 00:55:06.100
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.267
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

00:55:11.067 --> 00:55:14.267
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

00:55:14.367 --> 00:55:18.067
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:20.100
Nobody has been to university.

00:55:24.367 --> 00:55:27.367
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

00:55:27.534 --> 00:55:30.167
Krishna never went into university,

00:55:30.267 --> 00:55:35.033
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

00:55:36.067 --> 00:55:40.234
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

00:55:40.634 --> 00:55:43.267
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

00:55:43.367 --> 00:55:47.067
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

00:55:48.801 --> 00:55:52.033
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

00:55:52.067 --> 00:55:56.133
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

00:55:56.467 --> 00:55:58.234
what will it look like?

00:55:58.667 --> 00:56:01.567
But it's not that you dominate

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.067
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:12.300
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

00:56:13.067 --> 00:56:15.133
This is the mastery you have to get.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:19.667
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

00:56:20.067 --> 00:56:22.434
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

00:56:22.467 --> 00:56:25.067
is that we have to master ourselves.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.801
But then immediately people say

00:56:28.167 --> 00:56:33.200
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.300
I can't understand this.

00:56:38.434 --> 00:56:43.067
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

00:56:44.434 --> 00:56:49.367
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

00:56:49.801 --> 00:56:55.601
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

00:56:55.734 --> 00:56:58.067
why can't you correct your own property?

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.067
It should be the easiest thing to do

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:04.167
but you're not sure that this is your own,

00:57:04.434 --> 00:57:08.100
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:12.601
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

00:57:14.033 --> 00:57:17.734
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

00:57:18.033 --> 00:57:24.067
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

00:57:26.133 --> 00:57:28.701
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

00:57:29.067 --> 00:57:32.234
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:40.000
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

00:57:40.467 --> 00:57:44.434
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

00:57:44.734 --> 00:57:47.701
This is happening? Put it that way.

00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:53.067
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

00:57:53.067 --> 00:57:56.467
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

00:57:59.467 --> 00:58:02.534
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

00:58:03.033 --> 00:58:06.300
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:11.467
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.400
the whole world, to emancipate them.

00:58:14.534 --> 00:58:17.367
To bring them out of their ignorance.

00:58:17.767 --> 00:58:21.100
So for that we have to develop this mastery

00:58:23.434 --> 00:58:26.434
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

00:58:27.067 --> 00:58:29.067
but this mastery has to be developed.

00:58:29.067 --> 00:58:33.200
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

00:58:34.067 --> 00:58:38.067
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

00:58:39.067 --> 00:58:42.100
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

00:58:42.434 --> 00:58:48.067
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.067
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

00:58:53.133 --> 00:58:59.634
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

00:59:00.067 --> 00:59:04.300
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

00:59:04.534 --> 00:59:08.067
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

00:59:11.033 --> 00:59:13.701
And the last, but not the least,

00:59:14.367 --> 00:59:23.100
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:33.067
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

00:59:35.067 --> 00:59:37.400
In these three forms you should see yourself.

00:59:37.734 --> 00:59:43.767
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

00:59:44.267 --> 00:59:47.234
how I'm acting here!"

00:59:47.667 --> 00:59:50.367
Then you become the spectator also.

00:59:50.801 --> 00:59:54.067
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

00:59:54.701 --> 00:59:59.133
then you will realize what you are doing,

01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:02.701
how you are working out everything.

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:09.067
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

01:00:10.033 --> 01:00:11.567
will just run away.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:16.067
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

01:00:16.467 --> 01:00:20.067
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:25.067
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:32.067
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

01:00:32.534 --> 01:00:34.467
"let me face it."

01:00:35.067 --> 01:00:38.767
But also there is another way out, people find out.

01:00:39.067 --> 01:00:40.767
I mean, there are ways and ways.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:45.033
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

01:00:45.067 --> 01:00:47.400
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

01:00:48.234 --> 01:00:51.334
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:55.067
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

01:00:57.534 --> 01:01:00.400
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

01:01:00.467 --> 01:01:03.234
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:09.434
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

01:01:09.567 --> 01:01:13.234
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.400
So what next?

01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:19.334
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

01:01:19.734 --> 01:01:23.000
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:27.734
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

01:01:28.033 --> 01:01:33.667
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.701
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.067
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:49.300
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:54.367
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

01:01:57.334 --> 01:02:03.367
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:09.067
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

01:02:09.234 --> 01:02:14.400
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

01:02:14.801 --> 01:02:16.367
you can correct yourself.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:22.334
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:26.567
and you are so detached that you can see it.

01:02:27.067 --> 01:02:35.167
The attachment to all the things are finished

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:40.167
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

01:02:40.234 --> 01:02:43.634
and acting on these attachments also.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:52.200
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:55.567
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.567
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:01.067
It's the other way around.

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:04.434
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:04.601 --> 01:03:08.067
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

01:03:09.033 --> 01:03:14.234
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.133
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

01:03:19.167 --> 01:03:22.200
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:28.300
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:30.667
I'm talking at the time of peace.

01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:37.000
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

01:03:37.367 --> 01:03:40.534
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

01:03:40.601 --> 01:03:44.167
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.667
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

01:03:49.767 --> 01:03:53.067
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.067
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.267
but you are part and parcel of it.

01:03:58.067 --> 01:04:00.434
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

01:04:01.033 --> 01:04:07.667
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

01:04:08.434 --> 01:04:12.734
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:18.667
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

01:04:19.067 --> 01:04:22.167
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:26.267
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:31.567
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:35.734
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

01:04:36.334 --> 01:04:42.767
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:46.234
that you should have for all the other people

01:04:47.234 --> 01:04:48.701
and immediately they'll recognize.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.067
I have seen small children are like that.

01:04:52.601 --> 01:04:55.234
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:57.234
They see their parents and this and that.

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:03.267
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:06.334
after all God is there to look after you."

01:05:08.167 --> 01:05:14.000
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.067
they will neutralize the whole thing.

01:05:16.234 --> 01:05:19.067
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

01:05:19.267 --> 01:05:22.067
from all the little babies that we have

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:29.067
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

01:05:29.067 --> 01:05:31.701
with innocence we should work it out.

01:05:32.067 --> 01:05:35.734
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:40.167
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.667
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.067
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.234
May God bless you.
