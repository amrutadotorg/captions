00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:10.985
I am really over-delighted that in France we have

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:16.639
so many visitors as well as
French Sahaja Yogis for this Puja.

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.050
That shows the collectivity.

00:00:20.765 --> 00:00:26.844
The collectivity which attracts
all of you from all over the places,

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:32.160
and that you try to enjoy that collectivity.

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:36.228
But the basis of collectivity,

00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:40.335
the foundation of collectivity

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:45.014
is very deep.

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:51.740
And the deep understanding can only tell you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.420
that the basis of collectivity

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:01.620
is detached love.

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.607
Love is the only way.

00:01:08.196 --> 00:01:16.040
It's not possible to have collectivity unless and
you have -unless and until you have detached love.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.512
French have been good at so many types
of love that they have been talking about.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.823
And they have written books after books,
novels after novels and have created lots of romantic

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:36.687
and unromantic and all kinds of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.970
atmospheres to talk of love.

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:49.719
But the pure love as we understand in Sahaja Yoga

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:56.032
is to be now expressed by Sahaja Yogis among themselves.

00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:07.932
After all, we are all human beings made by one God.

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:15.328
And that we are all Sahaja Yogis

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:19.270
created by one Mother.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:28.548
So there should be no misunderstanding between us of any kind.

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:36.100
But we must know what sometimes makes us,

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.114
little different.

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:44.853
If we can understand the problems that we face,

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:51.215
then it would be much easier for us to see why our love

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.011
becomes so attached and not so detached.

00:02:59.198 --> 00:03:02.190
Starts becoming smaller and smaller,

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:09.660
then a person just starts loving oneself only.

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.433
One of the main reasons,

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:21.768
that we have this problem is because of our conditionings.

00:03:23.692 --> 00:03:27.029
We are conditioned the way,

00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.924
that we don't know how to love.

00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:38.273
When I see the advertisements in the West,

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:44.878
I don't know from where the West starts
and where it ends and from where the East ends.

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.770
They talk of West and East, but I
don't know which is the demarcating line.

00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:52.063
Can anybody tell Me that?

00:03:53.582 --> 00:03:56.304
Where do we start East and West,

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:59.299
because it's one round world, you see?

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:09.914
But somehow or other there is
some line, unknown line, underlying line

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:15.414
which creates sometimes this East and West

00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:19.472
- two types of conditionings.

00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:25.683
So, when I see some advertisements

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.959
they show about, recently I saw, about James Bond

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.692
that he is free to kill

00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:44.610
and the best film for revenge

00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:48.078
this is the advertisement.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.612
If revenge is the best way of fulfillment,

00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:00.830
then how can we love someone?

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:08.979
So, this kind of conditioning comes to us from outside.

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:15.136
That we should not forgive anyone,

00:05:16.368 --> 00:05:18.616
we should take the revenge.

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:26.556
And if you do not take the revenge
then you are not worthy your name.

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:30.586
So, if you cannot take the revenge,

00:05:31.578 --> 00:05:37.064
like a duel that they used to have in
France quite a lot between the two persons.

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:40.670
They would take two guns and kill each other.

00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:45.506
I mean, what a stupid idea it
was! Just think of it in modern times.

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:47.871
But it was so.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.599
So, if the revenge is not taken

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.500
then it was thought to be something,

00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:02.807
very sly, very low level.

00:06:03.174 --> 00:06:06.053
So, a person must take revenge.

00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:12.112
History shows also the same things that

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:18.620
one had to take a revenge of

00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.261
another person

00:06:23.888 --> 00:06:27.241
who has harmed you in any way, troubled you.

00:06:27.442 --> 00:06:30.848
I think it's the quality of a snake, they say.

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:34.149
That if you step onto any snake,

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.733
it follows you all his life to take the revenge.

00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:46.113
The only thing that it does all
its life is to run after that person

00:06:46.314 --> 00:06:52.565
who has by mistake put the foot on its body.

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:58.653
In the same way a human endeavor, I have seen in so many novels

00:06:58.853 --> 00:07:03.171
it's suggested how a man gets after a person

00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:07.436
who has some way or other harmed.

00:07:08.576 --> 00:07:12.935
If we go on like this, there's no end to it.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:20.218
Firstly, it is absolutely absurd.

00:07:22.273 --> 00:07:25.498
For that, I will give you an example of Buddha,

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:31.300
very much I have been impressed by the way he said once

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:38.870
to somebody who insulted Him and
abused Him and said all kinds of horrible words.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.898
Then Buddha went to another village.

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:48.353
Now, this fellow felt the remorse and he went back, and back,

00:07:48.578 --> 00:07:54.814
and said, "Sir, I'm sorry. I have said
these things to you. I'm really very sorry."

00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:58.738
He said, "What? When?"

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:03.655
He said, "Yesterday." He said, "Yesterday is finished now.

00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:06.684
You are now with Me today.

00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:12.883
So, why are you talking about yesterday? It's finished."

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:21.806
So, with this kind of idea that somebody has
harmed us, somebody is horrid to us we linger on

00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:25.672
in the past.

00:08:30.728 --> 00:08:39.155
Now, I'm told they are celebrating
the French Revolution that took place.

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:45.904
If you ask Me there was no need to have revolution of that kind

00:08:46.132 --> 00:08:49.529
to kill Marie Antoinette. It was not necessary.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.480
If they had killed or not killed, it would have been all right.

00:08:55.277 --> 00:08:58.349
But they had to kill her. Why?

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:05.056
Because according to them she spent lot of money in Versailles

00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:07.963
and created some beautiful furniture.

00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:13.738
Today only they are showing that furniture
only. What is there to show in this France?

00:09:13.939 --> 00:09:17.505
As soon as you come, they say, "Have you seen her palace?"

00:09:17.706 --> 00:09:19.909
I said, "Really?"

00:09:21.298 --> 00:09:24.774
First time when I came to France, this was the first question.

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:32.846
"You must go and see this. Impossible, you cannot get such
beautiful things anywhere created. It's an impossible situation."

00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:38.895
I said, "Impossible?" "Yes,
because you cannot make such nice things."

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:45.299
She made such nice beautiful things.
She was not going to carry it with her.

00:09:45.463 --> 00:09:53.075
Now, when you murdered her, then you
ask Me to go and see those beautiful things.

00:09:54.482 --> 00:09:58.244
We have to learn from history that it was stupid to kill her.

00:09:58.445 --> 00:10:00.381
What was the need to kill her?

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:04.999
When you have taken over the government, all right, stop at that point

00:10:05.076 --> 00:10:08.268
and then you start governing.

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:12.122
With that revolution you think world has improved for us?

00:10:12.323 --> 00:10:16.501
Anywhere in the world, do you think things have improved?

00:10:20.006 --> 00:10:23.464
Also, the revolution should have been

00:10:24.334 --> 00:10:27.404
to change the government. All right!

00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:31.474
But to go to that limit was not necessary.

00:10:31.675 --> 00:10:37.323
So, the second conditioning that
comes to us that we cross all limits

00:10:37.893 --> 00:10:41.155
of humanity when we take revenge.

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:47.626
They would not have been satisfied that she
was still living. "Oh God, we have to kill her!"

00:10:52.443 --> 00:11:00.824
Of course, I don't say that somebody who
has done any harm to the country, to the nation,

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:05.435
should be allowed to go on like that.

00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:11.086
But how far you go with that is to be seen.

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:16.224
So, the wisdom of Sahaja Yoga is in understanding

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:21.424
the limitations up to which you can go to express your anger,

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:28.550
to express your revenge, so called,

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:31.113
on anyone whatsoever.

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:38.968
But the best thing would be to leave it to the Divine power,

00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:43.239
because everything is done by Divine power.

00:11:43.428 --> 00:11:47.192
We all exist inside the Divine power.

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:51.662
We cannot think of anything else of that kind.

00:11:51.863 --> 00:11:55.047
I cannot give you an analogy how Divine power works.

00:11:55.248 --> 00:11:59.336
For example, if there were no

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:05.649
rays of the sun coming out of the sun,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.559
staying inside the sun, and all things working out,

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:16.999
then we would have said, "It's something like Divine power."

00:12:17.418 --> 00:12:20.318
Nothing is outside that,

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:24.357
everything is inside.

00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:29.795
And this Divine power is the power of compassion and love,

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.179
which does everything.

00:12:33.522 --> 00:12:37.537
But when we take up responsibility,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.571
and when we decide we have to do something,

00:12:41.938 --> 00:12:44.818
and that we are something,

00:12:45.688 --> 00:12:49.763
and try to go against that Divine power,

00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:54.281
we become stupid people as we have seen.

00:12:56.873 --> 00:13:00.568
So, to leave it in the hands of Divine power,

00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:05.520
and to be just an instrument of that Divine power

00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:08.492
is the way a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:16.823
Because the compassion, the love of Divine power

00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:22.189
is so great that it is wisdom, complete wisdom.

00:13:23.646 --> 00:13:27.450
A person who has no compassion cannot be wise.

00:13:28.272 --> 00:13:33.327
He could be worldly wise but he could not be really wise.

00:13:33.671 --> 00:13:39.246
So, those who believe that they have to be,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.765
they have to be very

00:13:49.826 --> 00:13:51.826
accurate

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:59.060
must know that your accuracy

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.428
will be challenged by the Divine power.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:09.751
There has to be lot of relaxed

00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:16.563
and a mobile temperament a person should have.

00:14:16.764 --> 00:14:22.659
For example, now I have come, suddenly perhaps you were not told,

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.486
people were not ready absolutely in the formal manner,

00:14:27.687 --> 00:14:31.709
lined up together like a military.

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:35.803
It's all right, makes no difference.

00:14:38.365 --> 00:14:40.365
Makes no difference.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:46.701
I am in no way disturbed, no way
unhappy. I was very happy to see you all.

00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:53.703
Because after all, you all love Me and I love you.

00:14:53.904 --> 00:15:00.551
It's a family and there's nothing
like being very formal about things.

00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:07.283
No formality between you and God Almighty, there cannot be.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:15.476
But there has to be understanding as to what we are doing.

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:24.747
I find suddenly human beings either become

00:15:25.358 --> 00:15:28.074
extremely relaxed,

00:15:28.412 --> 00:15:32.644
extremely lazy,

00:15:34.348 --> 00:15:38.051
extremely confused.

00:15:39.074 --> 00:15:41.165
You ask them their name,

00:15:41.306 --> 00:15:48.500
they'll say ten times, "Ah ... Ah". I said,
"What's your name?" They will say, "Ah ...".

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.860
"I just asked your name."

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:56.436
"What You asked me, my name?" "Yes, your name."

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:58.913
"Ah, I see."

00:16:02.596 --> 00:16:05.108
So the - I mean,

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.809
least bothered as to even remember

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.492
your own name or to say it.

00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:18.407
Like a drug acting on that person. That's going too far.

00:16:18.619 --> 00:16:23.092
Another style is where too much of formalities.

00:16:23.986 --> 00:16:26.768
That, supposing now,

00:16:28.121 --> 00:16:34.652
Mother is coming and we have to give
Her something, and something is missing.

00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:36.678
All right, doesn't matter.

00:16:37.203 --> 00:16:41.047
After all, this is Paris.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.685
Lots of things were missing once upon a time.

00:16:44.886 --> 00:16:48.954
If there is something missing,
doesn't matter. It's not so important,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.058
you should not be in tension.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.312
If you are in tension you cannot absorb My vibrations.

00:16:57.446 --> 00:17:02.305
Or if you are lethargic also you cannot absorb My vibrations.

00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:04.902
So, you have to be in the center.

00:17:05.346 --> 00:17:09.630
Center, in a receptive mood like a child is

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:16.924
that you have to absorb the vibrations with that feeling of,

00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:23.039
expectation and joy.

00:17:24.946 --> 00:17:27.052
We have to receive Mother.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:32.408
But not with tension that,
"This is not done, that is not done."

00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:35.618
I see each and every thing so beautifully done.

00:17:35.819 --> 00:17:40.498
So beautiful are these flowers, everything done so well!

00:17:43.969 --> 00:17:48.322
And so many ideas. I can see them so clearly.

00:17:48.523 --> 00:17:53.329
It's all expressive of not your tension but your love.

00:17:55.153 --> 00:18:00.103
So, are we expressing our love or our tension?

00:18:01.896 --> 00:18:05.700
What is that we are doing?

00:18:08.114 --> 00:18:15.002
Are we trying to be tense because we are over-alert,

00:18:15.203 --> 00:18:22.945
or we are trying to neglect
everything because we want to escape?

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.870
Between the two lies Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:33.164
You are very anxious, very much waiting.

00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:39.007
You want to do something with your heart

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.543
and then, when there is fulfillment, you can enjoy.

00:18:44.838 --> 00:18:51.163
But you are tense, I come in,
what I find you all have headaches.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:57.116
So, first I have to tell you, "Remove
your headaches first, then I'll talk to you."

00:18:57.724 --> 00:19:02.101
So, it has to be a very relaxed rapport between us,

00:19:02.302 --> 00:19:05.811
but relaxed never means lethargic.

00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:12.214
It doesn't mean, if you are lethargic you'll be
sleeping off and nothing will go onto your ears.

00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:23.625
So, what we see that our
conditioning, one conditioning we have that

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:31.213
either we want people to be over-alert or
we want that they should not be at all alert.

00:19:31.495 --> 00:19:37.660
So, the underlying problem - of all these things is this

00:19:37.963 --> 00:19:43.679
- that we want extremes.

00:19:45.336 --> 00:19:48.763
In our conditionings we go to extremes.

00:19:48.964 --> 00:19:53.494
We go to extremes of this or extremes of that.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:20:01.647
If you are absolutely lethargic,

00:20:01.847 --> 00:20:05.887
lenient, disheveled,

00:20:06.587 --> 00:20:10.976
we can say absolutely confused,

00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:14.789
you are not in the center.

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:20.069
And on the contrary, if you are very strict, like a

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.055
Rock of Gibraltar

00:20:26.122 --> 00:20:33.629
and after all like a big Hitler-like behavior

00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:39.867
"You should be in time, everybody must
have proper steps, must walk properly."

00:20:40.187 --> 00:20:42.410
That's not being Sahaj.

00:20:43.517 --> 00:20:46.731
That's not being Sahaj. Now, look at these flowers.

00:20:47.422 --> 00:20:50.337
See one by one how beautiful they are.

00:20:51.104 --> 00:20:58.513
Everyone is different, even one leaf of
one flower will not match with another.

00:20:59.524 --> 00:21:01.927
One petal won't match with another.

00:21:02.128 --> 00:21:08.303
They're all different, but so relaxed, creating beauty,

00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:12.060
giving us so much of joy.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:17.560
All different. Placed in different
manner, moving in different manner.

00:21:17.761 --> 00:21:20.940
Everyone has a different angle.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.915
But there is unison.

00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:29.966
There is oneness in them that they all want to give us joy.

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:36.939
But with tension you cannot give
joy. I mean if there is somebody tense,

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.251
I think I better run away from that person.

00:21:40.452 --> 00:21:45.760
God knows if he is tense, if the
tension increases he might beat you.

00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:52.020
Or might throw you out, or might himself be hurt.

00:21:52.864 --> 00:22:00.542
So, the tension part of it is very common
in the West and that conditioning has come

00:22:00.742 --> 00:22:07.585
because of certain, lifestyles that we have had.

00:22:07.985 --> 00:22:12.391
Now, there's not going to be a war of Waterloo anymore.

00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:20.301
So, we can say that Waterloo war
was won because they reached in time.

00:22:21.462 --> 00:22:23.462
That's not the thing.

00:22:24.034 --> 00:22:29.003
The war was won because it was to be won by the Divine power.

00:22:29.583 --> 00:22:32.646
Even if they had reached late, they would have won it.

00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:37.427
Whatever happens is by the Divine power.

00:22:38.644 --> 00:22:42.574
So, there is no need to be tense.

00:22:42.785 --> 00:22:46.574
Then you will say, "All right. Then,
let us sit down and have a nice time.

00:22:46.774 --> 00:22:50.001
Everything will be done by the Divine power."

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:56.967
No! Divine power is going to
work through your institutions,

00:22:58.261 --> 00:23:00.376
through your medium.

00:23:00.577 --> 00:23:02.650
So, you have to be alert.

00:23:04.609 --> 00:23:08.976
I hope you understand what I am trying to say

00:23:09.358 --> 00:23:15.265
that a person who is relaxed need not be a person

00:23:16.056 --> 00:23:22.399
who is lethargic, but alert.

00:23:24.604 --> 00:23:27.100
Alert you can be

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.816
as well as you can be relaxed
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:35.621
You are not like other people.

00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:38.890
Other people, you take the name of the airport

00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:42.724
and I don't know what goes wrong
in their brains. Suddenly, they go off.

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:46.545
They are off their heads, they go mad.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:54.837
Like today, we were going to the airport.

00:23:55.038 --> 00:24:00.321
Thank God everything nobody was on the
road. "They must be having these hangovers", I said,

00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:05.677
"last night. And today that the streets were all right."

00:24:05.877 --> 00:24:10.067
I said, "Let's go easily. After all, there is no problem."

00:24:12.502 --> 00:24:16.020
At home everybody was thinking I'll be late.

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:20.841
I said, "I am not going to be late."
We reached there. There was a big queue.

00:24:22.378 --> 00:24:27.073
And nobody could get into the plane because there was such a big queue.

00:24:27.245 --> 00:24:29.909
Nobody could even book the seat.

00:24:31.343 --> 00:24:35.799
So, what was the need to be tense?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.835
And supposing you are tense, take a position.

00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:45.197
And then you do not get the plane. So what?

00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:49.464
At the most only there is one mishappening,

00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:54.242
which is going to take place,
is our death. That is inevitable.

00:24:54.468 --> 00:24:57.578
Because we are born, so this body has to die.

00:24:58.498 --> 00:25:02.133
That's all! The rest of it is just a joke.

00:25:05.435 --> 00:25:10.420
So, even if you are tense or not tense makes no difference.

00:25:11.079 --> 00:25:16.994
I think sometimes people stand at the same point
and start running thinking they are going to the airport.

00:25:18.242 --> 00:25:21.047
No movement - tense.

00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:28.774
So, first of all we have to know that if
we can reduce our tensions, heart will open.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.340
Heart has to open.

00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:36.856
After all, we are now in the ocean of joy and bliss.

00:25:37.722 --> 00:25:40.113
Why should we have any tension?

00:25:41.566 --> 00:25:46.871
But when we are in the ocean of

00:25:49.597 --> 00:25:54.245
joy and bliss, we are not drowning. - We are swimming,

00:25:55.672 --> 00:25:57.672
so we have to swim.

00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:04.636
And this part, I think is not understood by many people.

00:26:05.705 --> 00:26:10.975
Now, we have conditionings of
countries, of different, different styles.

00:26:11.176 --> 00:26:14.574
Every country has different styles of conditionings.

00:26:16.097 --> 00:26:21.620
Let's think of France has got conditionings

00:26:23.755 --> 00:26:27.028
that you should never look happy.

00:26:28.702 --> 00:26:35.413
You can make out a French man. A French lady
sitting in front of Me, she was looking so miserable,

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.669
I was about to ask, "Who has died in your family?"

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:50.997
She was well dressed. She had made all
make-up, hairstyle, everything fine she must have been.

00:26:51.939 --> 00:26:58.054
But her face was so miserable that I didn't
understand how these two things combine.

00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:01.460
She has taken good care to look, appear very,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.622
nice with her paints and all that,
and here she is looking so miserable.

00:27:06.823 --> 00:27:10.376
She's put up a show that she was very miserable.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:17.491
Now, the conditioning is so stupid, so stupid

00:27:17.828 --> 00:27:24.257
that according to them whatever is ugly has become beautiful.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:30.917
The ugliest of ugly women they'll choose
and give her the first prize as the beautiest.

00:27:31.408 --> 00:27:37.011
I don't know for what, which angle they
saw this lady that they called her beauty.

00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:42.245
You'll find the lady is caught up, she is bhootish,

00:27:42.445 --> 00:27:47.015
giving horrible vibrations and they say, "She is beauty."

00:27:49.684 --> 00:27:56.247
So, because of this tensed oblique visions

00:27:56.448 --> 00:27:59.630
that we have either this way or this way,

00:28:01.953 --> 00:28:04.422
we never see the reality.

00:28:04.644 --> 00:28:11.888
And, what we accept is absolutely
whatever is unreal and worry about it.

00:28:12.089 --> 00:28:14.089
It's like a bubble.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.537
We are worried about a bubble,

00:28:19.058 --> 00:28:23.550
as if it's an atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb.

00:28:24.377 --> 00:28:28.462
So, unimportant things we worry too much.

00:28:28.735 --> 00:28:33.306
As a result of that, when we worry, worry, worry,

00:28:33.508 --> 00:28:37.516
anybody who comes near us, we jump on that person.

00:28:38.004 --> 00:28:40.004
What are you worried about?

00:28:41.402 --> 00:28:43.486
What's the problem?

00:28:44.797 --> 00:28:50.848
I tell you the only worry I have, if I have any, is this:

00:28:51.048 --> 00:28:56.505
that My children should love each other.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.529
So, I talk of friendship

00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:06.614
- is to have a friend.

00:29:06.815 --> 00:29:14.688
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends but not to persons of acquaintance.

00:29:14.888 --> 00:29:20.647
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way,

00:29:20.848 --> 00:29:24.697
but to our friends, and so friendship.

00:29:26.935 --> 00:29:30.614
Even if you are a leader, you are a friend of the people.

00:29:33.213 --> 00:29:36.457
Friendship is such that

00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:43.143
you could share your secrets,

00:29:43.352 --> 00:29:47.891
you could share your problems. You do that with Me.

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:50.665
And why not with each other?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:59.681
It's a question of understanding that
Sahaja Yogis are all really friends to each other.

00:30:00.056 --> 00:30:06.561
I think relationship of friendship is even
higher than any other relationship we could think of,

00:30:06.762 --> 00:30:10.379
because there is nothing to be gained out of our friendship.

00:30:11.074 --> 00:30:16.857
It never ceases and you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:20.951
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.

00:30:22.464 --> 00:30:28.213
You could be little joking with another person,

00:30:28.414 --> 00:30:33.067
making fun of another person. It's all right, it's friendship.

00:30:34.106 --> 00:30:37.358
But this is the purest form

00:30:37.559 --> 00:30:42.115
of understanding our relationships with each other.

00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:51.700
And a friend is the one who is always,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.047
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his friend.

00:30:58.144 --> 00:31:02.464
Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have only one friend

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.676
or at the most two. Three meant a crowd,

00:31:07.877 --> 00:31:11.109
cannot have three persons as your friends.

00:31:11.673 --> 00:31:18.128
But in Sahaja Yoga we are all friends, pure friendship.

00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:23.414
Friendship of a very beautiful nature

00:31:23.852 --> 00:31:29.171
- that you enjoy the joy of another person.

00:31:30.429 --> 00:31:32.499
In vibrations you do.

00:31:34.163 --> 00:31:38.358
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja Yogi, you really enjoy.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.075
I have seen this kind of friendship

00:31:49.756 --> 00:31:55.740
when we were young because that
time people were more open hearted

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.911
as my father had his friends.

00:32:01.677 --> 00:32:05.934
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of his

00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:12.500
and he was the chairman of an
organization all over the country.

00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:18.529
And the school that, one of
the schools where I was studying,

00:32:19.685 --> 00:32:23.829
that organization was running. So, he was the big boss in that school.

00:32:24.543 --> 00:32:31.956
So, My father had to go for a case
far away and he took all his family

00:32:32.157 --> 00:32:34.549
and he sent Me to the hostel.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:41.159
He wrote to his friend that, "I'm going away
and my daughter has to appear for her final exams.

00:32:41.359 --> 00:32:47.569
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my
family with me. But this is a nice chance."

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:51.290
So, the friend wrote, "All right,
doesn't matter. You can go away.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.745
I'm going to look after your daughter."

00:32:53.946 --> 00:32:56.896
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.

00:32:57.114 --> 00:33:00.818
Took a room there in the hostel. We all were there.

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:04.619
He was a Brahmin, he would
not touch an egg. He was a Brahmin.

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.083
But he knew that I eat eggs and I am a non-veg.

00:33:10.703 --> 00:33:14.616
So, this was about summertime had started.

00:33:14.817 --> 00:33:21.492
But he would still put on his
overcoat or a raincoat and walk out.

00:33:21.792 --> 00:33:26.079
I don't know from where he used to get eggs in the morning,

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:30.103
bring it in his room because it was a Brahmin school,

00:33:30.493 --> 00:33:36.993
and secretly cook the eggs
for Me, and then he would call Me,

00:33:37.353 --> 00:33:41.055
and give Me the eggs to eat. I said,
"I don't need them." "No, no, no you have to have.

00:33:41.255 --> 00:33:44.802
You know, Your father has gone
away, I have to look after You." So sweetly!

00:33:45.003 --> 00:33:53.438
And he was the head of heads there, breaking his own
rules and regulations for Me that he was making non-veg food.

00:33:53.639 --> 00:33:56.300
And then he would take all the,

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.966
see, shells of the eggs in a paper,

00:34:02.167 --> 00:34:09.536
put it in the pocket in a big overcoat,
walked out and throw them somewhere.

00:34:11.453 --> 00:34:15.979
Then he would come with Me to leave Me for My exams.

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.414
Evening again, he was there, waiting for Me.

00:34:19.663 --> 00:34:23.674
He was such a big man, such a
great man, very much respected.

00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:26.686
I mean, he was the head of the heads.

00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:35.954
And everyday I was very
much surprised at this friendship.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:44.393
And nothing - I mean, I didn't
see them talking about anything or

00:34:44.986 --> 00:34:50.763
I mean, they had nothing in
common as such. Was just friendship!

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:57.521
My father was a literary person, as you
know, and this one was a social worker.

00:34:57.722 --> 00:35:02.918
I mean there was,
My father was busy with politics.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.614
And such friends I have seen, My father would go to jail,

00:35:07.815 --> 00:35:14.465
so his friends would come and take us away to their
houses and their wives will look after us, give us bath.

00:35:14.666 --> 00:35:19.606
No difference. I never felt any
difference between their children and Me.

00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:24.995
Moreover, we felt that they were
looking after us more than their own children.

00:35:25.196 --> 00:35:27.198
First they will give us bath.

00:35:28.851 --> 00:35:34.289
In friendship one can really enjoy!

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.453
You need a very large heart
to be a friend, very large heart.

00:35:40.179 --> 00:35:45.985
If you look after your own child, support your
own child then you are a gone case for Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:46.823 --> 00:35:52.393
but if you have that kind of a largeness of friendship.

00:35:54.478 --> 00:35:58.378
There is a nice story My father used to tell us about friends

00:35:58.565 --> 00:36:01.819
because My brother was, had lots of friends,

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.464
they used to go about gallivanting, this, that.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:12.245
And then used to always criticize
that what father your friends come in.

00:36:12.446 --> 00:36:17.611
They just look after your lawn
sometimes because somebody is fond of lawn.

00:36:17.812 --> 00:36:21.480
Then another does that. And you don't people discuss,

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.843
argue anything - just, I don't know
how you enjoy each other's company.

00:36:26.048 --> 00:36:30.671
He said, "No, we talk, it's not
that. No, no, we enjoy very much."

00:36:31.138 --> 00:36:34.982
So, My father told him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

00:36:35.228 --> 00:36:41.030
That there was a father who had
a friend and the son had a friend.

00:36:41.421 --> 00:36:46.514
Modern times, I mean modern
these days is also old times, I should say.

00:36:46.715 --> 00:36:51.966
So, the father said to the son that,

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:55.764
"You see, friendship is where,

00:36:55.964 --> 00:37:01.821
you can always rely on your
friend and your friend can rely on you."

00:37:04.769 --> 00:37:08.912
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so.

00:37:09.113 --> 00:37:11.832
"Oh, my friends I can rely",

00:37:13.151 --> 00:37:19.542
the boy said, "I can rely on my
friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

00:37:20.192 --> 00:37:27.584
So, father said, "All right, let's
test your friends and my friends."

00:37:27.785 --> 00:37:31.096
So, they went down, they asked.

00:37:31.818 --> 00:37:37.319
The father went with the son,
and went to these friends of the son.

00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:40.725
And the son thought

00:37:41.614 --> 00:37:47.519
- he told the son that, "You have to say
that I have murdered someone and help me."

00:37:47.995 --> 00:37:49.813
He said, "All right".

00:37:50.556 --> 00:37:55.702
So, they went to one friend.

00:37:55.935 --> 00:38:00.181
That friend said, "You murdered?
Baba, you get out!" He closed the door.

00:38:00.572 --> 00:38:02.864
Another one they went to, he closed the door.

00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:07.852
Third one he said, "No, no don't say that you have
come to my house. I have nothing to do with you."

00:38:08.053 --> 00:38:10.896
All his twenty friends said, "No".

00:38:11.276 --> 00:38:16.033
He said, "All right, now let me go to
one friend of mine." They went there.

00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:20.003
So, they knocked at the door,
knocked at the door. Door would not open.

00:38:20.204 --> 00:38:25.606
Then he shouted, "I am here." So, the boy started
saying, "Look at this. Your friend is not even coming."

00:38:25.807 --> 00:38:28.442
He said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

00:38:28.742 --> 00:38:35.369
So, about ten minutes later the friend came and
opened the door, and took him inside. "What's the matter?"

00:38:36.217 --> 00:38:41.988
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody" -
the father said - "and so we have come to you for help".

00:38:42.189 --> 00:38:49.625
"I knew something must be there
because why will you come at this hour?

00:38:49.951 --> 00:38:53.615
So, I was collecting all the ornaments of my wife.

00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:58.887
I mean, if you need money, I better give
you the ornaments. So, that's why I was late."

00:38:59.088 --> 00:39:02.680
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it doesn't matter.

00:39:02.998 --> 00:39:05.057
Now, you've got children, I don't have.

00:39:05.257 --> 00:39:11.402
So, you better tell them I have murdered. Tell me how
the murder took place, I'll take the murder upon myself."

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:14.500
And the son was surprised.

00:39:14.802 --> 00:39:16.695
He said, "No, take this."

00:39:17.435 --> 00:39:20.547
Then the father said, "See now, this is my friend.

00:39:20.748 --> 00:39:24.521
You had twenty friends and I have only one friend.

00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:30.021
This is his friendship." And this kind of a
friendship, we Sahaja Yogis should have.

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:34.702
I mean with a friend you cannot be tense. Cannot be.

00:39:35.631 --> 00:39:42.099
That is first sign. And with your friend sitting
there, you won't doze off, and you won't sleep.

00:39:42.674 --> 00:39:44.674
But you enjoy.

00:39:44.933 --> 00:39:52.418
Once I was traveling by train and we had two compartments.

00:39:52.684 --> 00:39:56.019
So, in one compartment myself and one old lady were there.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:00.272
I mean, I was older than her but she though she was older.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.040
And she was trying to sleep.

00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:11.171
And in the other compartment were two
friends. They had met. Ahh! So they were enjoying.

00:40:11.372 --> 00:40:13.780
He was hitting him and he was hitting him.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.665
He said, "Aye, you!" And like that going on.

00:40:16.866 --> 00:40:20.687
So, this lady said, "Look at these
people. They are not allowing us to sleep."

00:40:20.888 --> 00:40:25.280
So she went and shouted at
them, "Will you stop this nonsense?

00:40:25.481 --> 00:40:29.660
What is going on?" He said, "We have met
after a long time, you see, so, we are enjoying."

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.968
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you hitting each
other if you are enjoying? And don't talk loudly." She went away.

00:40:35.169 --> 00:40:37.660
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am here.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.010
Don't say anything. I'll lock
the door. This lady won't come."

00:40:41.211 --> 00:40:45.188
They were surprised. I said, "I am
enjoying the way you are enjoying each other."

00:40:45.389 --> 00:40:49.743
They said, "You don't want to sleep?"
"No, no, I want to hear what you say to each other."

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:56.296
And they were surprised how I was enjoying the way
they were hitting each other and enjoying each other.

00:40:57.799 --> 00:40:59.543
So, this is how,

00:41:00.579 --> 00:41:04.164
I have to tell you that we have to be friends.

00:41:04.321 --> 00:41:08.202
We have to share, enjoy sharing.

00:41:08.514 --> 00:41:13.410
There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend?

00:41:13.611 --> 00:41:17.649
Just relaxed enjoying each other's company.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.903
Even if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:25.009
Even if you have a different view, it's all right.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:31.382
But, you should not try to impose yourself on your friend,

00:41:31.583 --> 00:41:35.708
nor your friend should try to impose. But try to understand each other.

00:41:37.534 --> 00:41:40.091
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.

00:41:40.292 --> 00:41:43.255
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

00:41:43.456 --> 00:41:47.471
For example, I learnt so much from French you'll be surprised.

00:41:47.594 --> 00:41:52.049
Learnt lot of things from French, the way they have their art,

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:56.719
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.059
Lots of things to be learnt.

00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:06.216
So, you have friends in India, you have friends
everywhere, you have friends now in South America.

00:42:07.337 --> 00:42:14.050
Everywhere you have friends.
You just go ahead with My badge. Finished.

00:42:14.251 --> 00:42:17.719
Oh! They will all jump for you, they will do anything for you.

00:42:19.929 --> 00:42:21.833
So, this friendship,

00:42:22.483 --> 00:42:27.813
just think of it in this world we have
thousands and thousands of friends,

00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:30.320
everywhere we go.

00:42:31.472 --> 00:42:35.737
And this is what we have to know within ourselves

00:42:35.938 --> 00:42:43.391
that we have to be ourselves
very, very friendly type, very friendly.

00:42:43.592 --> 00:42:47.983
There is an openness between one friend and another friend.

00:42:48.184 --> 00:42:53.655
There is no closeness. There is no tension. There is no formality.

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:56.255
And reliance.

00:42:56.455 --> 00:43:02.300
So much so that you can talk to them about what you want,

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:08.694
what is your need and what problems you have.

00:43:10.799 --> 00:43:17.175
I hope you understand that love means
complete freedom,

00:43:17.613 --> 00:43:20.017
to yourself and to others.

00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:26.973
If you love someone, then there is
complete freedom and understanding.

00:43:27.174 --> 00:43:30.309
But this love has to be very, very pure.

00:43:30.612 --> 00:43:32.491
Complete understanding.

00:43:33.191 --> 00:43:40.198
You have to feel that friendship.

00:43:40.411 --> 00:43:44.295
And, you will feel very proud that you have so many friends.

00:43:44.496 --> 00:43:48.785
And real friends! You have so many friends who are real friends.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.980
You will be so very -

00:43:55.769 --> 00:44:01.900
feeling a thing as if you
are a great personality

00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:06.279
that you have so many friends in this world.

00:44:07.126 --> 00:44:09.030
You are not alone.

00:44:09.377 --> 00:44:17.698
Imagine before this what we had, so
many saints, so many great souls were born

00:44:18.554 --> 00:44:23.991
and they were treated like singular people

00:44:24.757 --> 00:44:28.412
and tortured, killed, poisoned.

00:44:28.613 --> 00:44:30.613
They were alone.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.290
But you are not.

00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:39.545
You are all - are friends to each other

00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:44.417
and the greatest friend you have is the Divine power,

00:44:44.717 --> 00:44:49.097
which is looking after you and doing everything for you.

00:44:50.709 --> 00:44:53.927
If you have that kind of a relaxed,

00:44:54.474 --> 00:44:57.337
beautiful alertness within you,

00:44:57.611 --> 00:45:00.038
you are going to enjoy life.

00:45:00.209 --> 00:45:07.939
You are going to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and you are
going to get many, many more people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:14.851
And, if you don't have this among
yourselves then people are going to say,

00:45:15.128 --> 00:45:21.244
"Oh Mother, whatever You may
say but Sahaja Yogis are no good."

00:45:23.856 --> 00:45:31.697
So, for today, in this country of
France where we have got liberation,

00:45:31.974 --> 00:45:36.843
where we have fought for liberation, let us take to real liberation,

00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:45.029
the real liberation of the soul of our spirit to enjoy.

00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:51.123
Enjoy everything that is available with understanding.

00:45:53.202 --> 00:45:55.165
May God bless you all!
