00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.200
Today you all have gathered here

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.640
to do the Guru Puja.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.080
Your Guru is a Mother first and then a Guru

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.320
and that has given Me a greater help.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.720
We have had before also many Guru Pujas,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.480
mostly in England.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.520
And you should wonder why

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.520
Mother always somehow is doing Guru Puja in London.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.000
The time falls in such a way that it is in Guru Puja,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.040
I am here, during that time I have to be in London.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.960
So many years we have been doing Guru Puja in England.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.280
All things happen if according to ritambhara pragya

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.400
then there must be some reason

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.480
why Mother is here in England for a Guru Puja.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.800
It is stated in the Puranas that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.440
the Adi Guru Datattreya

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.800
worshipped Mother

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.800
along the banks of the river Tamasa.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.200
Tamasa is the same as your Thames

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.800
and He himself came and worshipped here.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.120
And the druids, those who had

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.080
the manifestation of the Stonehenge and all that,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.560
are originated from that time in this great country of Shiva,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.560
of the Spirit.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.440
So the Spirit resides here as in the heart of human beings,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.240
and the Sahasrara

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.360
is in the Himalayas where Sadashiva exists at the Kailasha.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.240
This is the great secret

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.960
of we having so many Guru Pujas here.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.240
To culminate it today and to this special type of Guru Puja

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400
in the year of the sixtieth birthday of your Mother

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.840
is, has a special, very, very special significance

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.280
because is the Guru Sashti -

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.360
is the sixty years of your Guru has been celebrated today.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.720
And that's how it's a very big occasion that you all have gathered

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.200
under the influence of again ritambhara pragya.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.640
So all that has happened has happened by the nature's own gift to you

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.520
and everything has worked out so well

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.040
because that was the desire of the Divine

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.280
and the design of the Divine.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.920
So the river Thames, which we call Her as Thames -

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.240
you see, English have a method of making everything English.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.800
Like Bombay they made it - Mumbai was Bombay,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.200
you see, like Calcutta, like all other words just like that.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.120
Like Varanasi was made into Benares,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.000
River Thames which was really Tamsa was called as Thames.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.520
Now from the name Tamsa one should know

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.600
that is a place of Tamo Guna.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.440
Is a place where left-sided resided since long.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.120
So people were very worshipful, left-sided people, emotional type,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.360
and they worshipped God more

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.360
than that they went into yagyas and all that.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.080
And Datattreya lived here

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.960
and meditated on the banks of River Thames.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.960
That's why Guru puja here has to give us a great background

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.120
for your awakening of the Guru Principle.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.880
We have to go to the roots of everything

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.920
so that we understand the importance of it.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.320
Unless and until you know the roots and the traditions behind

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.720
you cannot understand the depth,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.520
the gravity, the intensity of any puja.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.000
Today we have gathered here to do the Guru Puja, again.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.160
The reason is we have got a Guru Principle within ourselves

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.160
as I told you last time

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.200
and also I have given elaborately

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.560
the Ten Commandments as expressed within us

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.040
which are describing the different

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.360
the different types of essences within us.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.320
The essence of Guru Puja has to be awakened within us.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.400
That's how we are having this program here.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.640
Now it is important

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.960
that we have to establish

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.240
the dharma within us.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.840
Without the dharma you cannot have the ascent.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.920
And as I have told you before that the cleanliness

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.080
of your being

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.240
depends on how much dharma you follow, religiously.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.200
At the time of Moses

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.520
it was worked out

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.280
and all the rules and regulations

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800
were created for realized souls.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.400
But as I read in one of the books - it was very good,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.280
because if I had said this, people would not have believed -

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.120
that it had to be changed.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.560
I think during the speech the children should not be here,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.480
it's better to take them out.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.520
After the speech you can bring them along - those who make noises.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800
Those who are quiet it's all right,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.160
but those who are making noises you better bring them out.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.520
If they are going to make noises, better to be out or near the door

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.080
so that if they make noises you can get out,

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.560
so there is no disturbance.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.840
And during the puja is all right, you could be at the gate,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.520
door or some place from where you can go.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.520
So the laws and regulations that were given to human beings

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.560
were actually for the realized souls who would understand.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.720
But when Moses must have discovered the way human beings are,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.000
He must have changed them to very strict rules,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.920
because with human beings as they are,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.480
one has to be extremely strict.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.320
They can't understand anything but fear.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.200
If you have

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.680
a stick in your hand, you can put them right.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.320
Without that stick human beings won't listen.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.240
They are only all right if there's a fear.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.360
Now if you see

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.920
the today condition of all the nations,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.800
those who are having leaders, or prime ministers, or presidents

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.200
they are all people extremely strict,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.840
very dominating and very dry.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.640
And normally people like such people.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.160
Even Hitler succeeded because of that nature.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.040
So the character of a guru so far

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.240
has been of a very strict nature

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.760
for people who are not realized.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.120
Normally a guru doesn't - a good guru, Satguru,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.320
He doesn't like to talk to people much.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.640
They throw stones

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.440
or they don't like to talk to people

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.960
who are not realized.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.520
But if they are realized then these Gurus change their attitude

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.320
towards the people who want to see them.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.240
There is a tremendous difference

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.680
between a person who is a realized and non-realized

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.160
in the protocol of God.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.520
A man may be the king or anything, he'll be asked to sit outside.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.880
It has nothing to do with what position you enjoy.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.320
As long as he is a realized soul and not possessed

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.080
he is given the highest position.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.040
But if you are possessed then also the Guru will tell him

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.560
that "You get out from here,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.760
first get rid of your possession and then come."

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.840
And all these strict rules were there,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.720
that such and such person must be killed,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.320
such and such person must be given a punishment

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.720
of cutting the hands, cutting the feet,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:37.160
even absolutely destroying the eyes.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.040
This was done because they were not realized souls.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.240
It was the great realization of Moses, I think,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.240
that He took to another kind of law which is known as Sharia now

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.520
and that's what the Muslims are following.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.440
In a way it's good I think,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.960
because people who are now normal people really deserve such a rule,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.400
but it should not be so fanatical that you cannot discriminate

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.400
between a realized soul and a non-realized soul.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.000
Now the Guru within you

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.400
will be awakened if you are strict with yourself.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.600
That's one point is very important.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.200
Unless and until you are strict with yourself

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.960
the Guru will not be awakened within you.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.560
People who are lazy lumps, who cannot sacrifice anything,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.880
who are very fond of comfort can never be gurus, take it from Me.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.920
They can be good administrators, they can be anything,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.560
but never a guru.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.160
A guru should be willing to live the way he has to live.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.240
He should be able to sleep on stones,

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.280
he should be able to sleep under any circumstances.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.840
Not that the disciple should force on him,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.160
but it should be his own nature, that he can adjust himself.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.280
Comfort cannot crawl on a guru.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.760
Now those who want your Guru Principle to be awakened

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.160
must know that you should not ask for comfort.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.680
Even for a thing like that, yesterday you saw the dancing,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.480
one has to do real tapasya.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.720
Intensive tapasya you have to do,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.520
you cannot learn even a thing like dancing

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.720
without going into a penance about it.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:34.000
So a guru has to go through all penances is important.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.200
Sahaja Yogi need not go, but a guru Sahaja Yogi has to do it.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.520
We have to have penances,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.960
and the penance can be any kind of desire you have.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.560
Say, supposing you are very fond of food,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.600
just don't eat the food that you want to eat.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.200
If you are very fond of sweet food,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.360
then eat something very bitter, raised to power hundred and eight.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:08.040
And if you are fond of some sort of a very ...

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.000
- as Indians are, sometimes -

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.480
... very spicy food then eat so bland the food, without salt.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.200
Teach your tongue to behave itself.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.640
It doesn't behoove a guru to put his attention to food.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:27.720
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, they are all right

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.400
when the food is there, quite concentrated,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.080
but when it comes to the programme they have no concentration.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.520
Such a sad thing, such people cannot be gurus. They can be cooks, good,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.440
or could be food-tasters or something like that.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.000
Will suit them better, but if they have to be gurus

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.720
they must learn to control their tongue and their desires.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.520
I mean, fasting is a good thing for such people, fasting is very good.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.280
All the time they are worried, what are we going to have for lunch,

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.280
what are we going to have for dinner?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.520
Such people cannot have their Guru Principle awakened,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.000
neither they can be gurus. So please be careful.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.080
The guru must have control over the tongue.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.360
He must know when to get angry

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.040
and when to be gentle.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.760
He must know what to say when,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.680
how much to say.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:38.560
That's why many gurus have been more effective by not speaking.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.480
Silence is the best way you can help others,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.520
but when it comes to explaining Sahaja Yoga, you should speak.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.680
But I have seen with some people they are very eloquent

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.120
when it comes to nonsensical things,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.280
but when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, they don't know anything

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.000
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.800
So you have to be the master of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.600
if you have to be a Guru,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.360
not only in talking, but in your behaviour, in everything.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.400
And the karamat

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.680
is the ...

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.280
I don't know if you use charismatic-word, charismatic they call it

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.240
or you say, the one how to do it

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.320
how to raise the Kundalini, how to put it at the Sahasrara,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.720
how to break the Sahasrara, all these things you must know,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.600
how to spend your knowledge is viniyoga in Sanskrit.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.560
Guru principle is awakened in a person

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.840
when he himself has achieved something.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.240
Imagine a half-baked guru going along talking as a Guru.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.960
He'll end up as a disciple ultimately.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.880
So you have to be master of your own,

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.440
but when the Guru Principle comes in

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.440
you have to give it to others,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.560
it's a question of giving it to others.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.280
So you have to be at a higher level to give it to others,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.960
have to be at a very high level.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.520
If you are attached to money, if you are attached to food,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.160
if you are attached to mundane things of life, you cannot give.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:22.520
Now the higher state than that can be achieved,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.160
which is naturally in Me, but can be achieved,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.320
is that you don't have to have any dependence like that,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.840
that any rules and regulations,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.520
like saying that I will have no worry about food,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.440
I should fast, this, that -

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:49.360
it all ends up. When you eat but don't eat,

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.600
that's the state one should have,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.320
that you are eating the food

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.720
and if you ask, "Did you have your lunch?"

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.720
"I don't know ..."

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.080
"Will you have your lunch?"

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.880
"I don't know ..."

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:17.080
Absolutely indifferent to the problems of the body.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.120
"Where did you sleep?"

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.240
"I don't know ..."

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.600
"What did you eat, what will you have?"

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.480
"I don't know ..."

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.240
This kind of a state is called ateeta state where you go beyond

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.440
and whatever you do, you are doing it

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.360
because it is to be done. Without paying any attention to it,

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.960
is automatic.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.760
Nothing is important, but this is -

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.160
before becoming ateeta you have to steady yourself,

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.360
"Nothing is important," you see, is a, avir bhava

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.920
they call it, is a kind of a drama you have to put in.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.000
"Oh, nothing is important, this carpet is not important,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.840
I should try to sleep on the cement."

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.520
First you have to do that.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.400
But after some time it happens

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.240
that you don't remember whether you slept on the cement

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.520
or on a cot, "Where did I sleep? I don't know."

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.920
That is the ateeta state.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:32.240
And that state is to be achieved now by many Sahaja Yogis-

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.680
in a state where you go beyond.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.440
Say there is somebody who is before you and you have to get angry.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.960
All right, you give them left, right, left, right nicely

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.960
and then you are smiling next moment.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.840
Did you get angry with that person? "I don't know, did I?"

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.600
Like Buddha once said something

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.000
in one village

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.000
and there was a horrible fellow who got up

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.880
and said lots of things to him.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.640
And when He went to the next village the fellow felt

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.680
that "Oh, I should not have done that," Left Vishuddi, perhaps.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.960
So he went down and said, "I am sorry Sir, I have said so

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.720
and I should not have said it,

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.480
I didn't know You are the enlightened one,

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.200
so it happened, so forgive me."

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.120
He said "When, where did you say?"

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.080
He said, "In the last village."

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.520
"Oh, everything in the last village I have left there alone

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.560
I don't take with me."

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.320
That is the ateeta state that you have to reach.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.080
So even not to feel, it's not important.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.760
These identifications when they drop out completely

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.720
then you are doing things in akarma state,

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.320
where, like sun is shining it doesn't know it is shining.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.600
When the vibrations are flowing you don't know it is flowing.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.160
Already it has started working in you.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.720
You are surprised, you raise the hands and the Kundalini is rising.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.920
You don't know you are raising the Kundalini actually.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.760
How do you raise it?

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.160
You don't know, that's it.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.280
That state has already started ateeta in you,

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.120
but get it established in every walk of life,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.000
everything, that you go beyond.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.040
And if you can manage that,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.240
that's the highest that you have to reach.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.880
Now with the incarnations it's very different,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.120
it's the other way round.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.760
Everything is the other way round.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.880
They don't have to do any tapasya.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.440
They don't have to starve, they don't have to cleanse themselves,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.400
whatever they do is the punya.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.040
They don't have to collect punyas either.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.880
If they kill somebody it is dharma.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.240
If they hit somebody it is the dharma.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.960
Nothing they do wrong.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.160
They are absolutely immaculate.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.680
If they deceive someone, they cheat someone,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.200
it's perfectly all right.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.000
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goals.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.080
It's justified in our day-to-day life you'll see,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.880
that when you are defending your country,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.200
there is an enemy on you, if you have to defend your country

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.800
you can slay him.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.760
You can cheat him, diplomatically you can befool him.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.600
Is allowed, why?

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.040
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goal.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.800
But for an incarnation it is always the higher goal.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.200
He is not bothered about smaller goals at all.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.960
He doesn't have to weigh, think, rationalize

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.600
or to train himself or do some drama or anything, it's all done.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.440
Even the movement, every movement, every movement of an incarnation

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.640
has a ripple in it, which is for the good.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.880
There is nothing, not even a moment is such

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.560
which is not for the good of the world.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.160
So the incarnation is a very different thing,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.560
that is not to be achieved, that has to be.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.800
Now for example

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.960
the incarnation is the bhokta, is the enjoyer,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.080
He is the enjoyer of everything.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.240
Many people, say, have created,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.120
now we have a carpet here from Turkey.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.000
These carpets were created by Turkish peoples

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.240
some time back for an incarnation to sit.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.400
So the ritambhara pragya will bring it round in such a way

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.160
that at least I see it,

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.920
or I have it,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.720
so that their souls will be blessed,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.440
so that they feel nice.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.120
Like Michelangelo has made that not for popes, I can tell you.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.560
and not for all the rubbish people who go there.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.240
Neither Blake did all that work

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:35.080
for the useless people who want to go and see nude artists.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.280
It was all done for the incarnation to see.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.440
That's the way they have blessed the most,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.640
because they are beyond, nothing touches them, nothing is important,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.560
but it's not rational or anything that they have trained themselves,

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.560
but it is automatically they have.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.960
Like Shri Krishna had to marry sixteen thousand women.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.320
Can you imagine?

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.800
In those days of monogamy he would be prosecuted hundred times.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:14.160
The reason was he has sixteen thousand powers

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.920
and He was to be born

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.480
with those sixteen thousand powers on this Earth

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.120
and five elements became His queens.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:36.120
He had to do some justification to have them around.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.880
And as I have now Sahaja Yogis whom I have,

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.960
I mean, given Realization.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.360
So automatically I am your Mother, is established.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.400
But for Him there was no way out

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.320
but to marry His sixteen thousand powers.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.640
And so He married, but He was never married,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.720
He was a bachelor out and out all His life.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.840
Because He is Yogeshwara and He is a brahmacharya.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.520
Who can marry ... Him?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.800
So for Them all these worldly things are just a drama,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.040
has no meaning at all.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.640
It's just a drama.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.040
A person

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:39.320
who is not an incarnation should not try to be.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.880
That's not the right of a human being.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.560
Like a policeman standing on the road,

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.120
if he puts his hands right, left - we follow it.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.640
But you ask some mad man to go and stand there, he will be arrested.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.400
So for normal people, even you are a guru

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.280
you shouldn't allow them to touch your feet.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.320
Only an incarnation's feet must be touched

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.040
and nobody else's feet must be touched.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.040
Of course in samayachara

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.320
like as we have in India the custom to touch the feet of the father,

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.480
but because the father is a representative of the father

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.960
in you, that's why - or the mother.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.160
But that's symbolic,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.840
but in reality you are not to surrender yourself to anybody else,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.200
but to an incarnation.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.160
Also if there's a teacher in your,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.400
any art or in anyway the master, you must touch his feet.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.760
Even to take his name you have to pull your ears.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.520
But nobody

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.880
who is a human being should make touch your feet,

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.640
especially the Sahaja Yogis should not.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.120
Nobody should ask anyone to touch your feet.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.280
As an elder you may,

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.760
that's a different point, but not as a guru.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.240
Is a very dangerous thing,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.280
once you start it, you know what it happens, with so many,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.800
they have just gone out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.560
So to develop the Guru Principle within you

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.680
first of all you must develop yourself, fully.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.400
Now how to develop yourself a Guru Principle, one must see.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.880
We have got the ten principles within you, as I told you before

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.680
and we should develop these all ten principles in such a way,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.560
that we stand out from others.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.840
Yesterday as I told you that when we do dhyana-dharana-samadhi

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.560
and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragya,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.280
then put that whole thing

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.880
onto different areas

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.040
as called as desh or bhoomi.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.360
How you spend them is the point - is through mantras,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.240
cleanse it through mantras,

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.800
cleanse it through your attention,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.040
every day you must know which chakra to be cleared out.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.880
You must know about yourself, where is the problem,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.760
how it is to be cleansed,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.880
how we have to clear it out.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.320
Do not take it for granted.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.880
Many people who have got, say, left-sided problem,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.080
you will just bring them lemon and chillis

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.080
and think that Mother has done the job.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:52.000
I can only do the job temporarily,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.400
but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.280
You see ...

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.520
these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.240
So to take out that vacuum is your job

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.960
and for that you have to religiously get

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.640
after all your defects.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.840
That's the most important thing for all of you.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:21.720
And try to put full attention to all these different deshas

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.080
- is the nations, they are called like this.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.960
And once you have cleared it,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.160
it is enlightened, is full of light,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.640
then you call it pradesh,

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.840
means the desha has been enlightened.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.680
Once that has achieved

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.840
then you have reached the point you can become a guru,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.840
but still you are not a Satguru.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:55.080
To become the Satguru you must achieve the state of ateeta.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.960
The ateeta state is such

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:04.120
that the person who is not a good man will tremble before you.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.640
A man who is a liar,

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.080
who has cheated others will lose his tongue.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.600
A man who has adulterous eyes,

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:24.960
who is a man without, no control,

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.320
without any control over his mind

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.360
as far as the women are concerned or men are concerned,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.000
such a person will have shaking in his eyes.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.040
Some of them will shake,

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.560
those who have been possessed will be shaking with it.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:46.960
They'll be all exposed before the light of a Sat Guru.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.560
When you achieve that you don't have to fight them,

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:53.320
they will themselves be exposed

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.560
and you won't have to do anything.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.760
One day I was told

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.360
that there is a servant, lady-servant

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.240
who is a very possessed person, in the family.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.080
So I said "Get rid of her."

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.200
I went to the airport. On My way I stopped at that house

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.360
and the maid-servant just walked in, you see

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.560
and there was a big gutter flowing,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.880
I mean not a gutter but a open sort of a thing

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.360
and she saw Me and she fell in that.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.440
I said, "Oh God,"

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.200
so I told the driver to take the car a little ahead.

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.800
And she fell in. It happens.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.080
I was traveling by plane one day

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.360
and the gentleman in front started just jumping.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.600
So a Sahaja Yogi asked, "Are you from TM?" He said, "How do you know?"

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.400
He said, "We know." So I sat back.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.120
It may be they may all have ...

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.840
A day may come when they might start jumping like that.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.960
Or a pilot might start jumping.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.120
It's a big problem for Me.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:22.120
Even the lights ...

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.320
... you enter into a church

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.680
and suddenly you find all the lights going off like this.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.760
Even in big banquets, I find, when I am sitting there

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.480
and suddenly everybody comes and sit down

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.840
and all their bhoots come around,

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.600
they start jumping and then people start looking, "What's happening,

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.680
is there a fire on?"

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.680
So many things can happen,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.440
like there was a gentleman very much possessed in a war

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.280
and we were going to a ship

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.760
and there was a little  platform on which we had to first jump

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.240
and the platform started doing like this, like that

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.040
and the fellow didn't know what to do with it,

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.960
he didn't understand why it was doing this.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.480
So when you reach that state you don't have to argue or do anything,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.640
even if you lift your eye

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.520
it happens that the person gets into problems.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.960
Or there could be some ego-oriented people, they'll melt down.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.120
First you have to do the drama of a guru,

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:31.000
dress up in a way which is simple,

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.760
you have to behave in a way which is very gentle,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.280
because you have to attract them.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.240
"Come along, come along, come along."

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.800
That's advertising, Advertising Department.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.360
And once it is done, that drama is done

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.800
it can be exposed very soon, if they will find out that you are not good,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.040
you are just a dramatist.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.400
Once the drama has been done then

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.720
very cleverly you can bring out your real self before them.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:09.400
So first you don't show them that you are a real, hard taskmaster.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.320
Never.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.240
First use all your sweet qualities.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.840
The more they are difficult the more I am gentle with them.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.440
Then they come inside.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.560
Then you put to the mill and you can cure them.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.480
First prepare them. First of all sometimes they are so frightened,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.280
they are so nervous, they are so upset, sometimes too much of ego.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.800
So be gentle.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.680
Gradually they'll strengthen themselves also in your company

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.560
and then, even if you hit them they are all right.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.240
That's how it has to be done very cleverly.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.960
and if you see the way I manage My Gurudom

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.640
you can also manage.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.680
But the key to Guru is patience,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.440
a complete patience and complete dependence on God Almighty.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.560
That's the key, complete patience.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.560
First you tell them that this should be such,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.680
but they will not accept. They will argue -

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:21.240
how, why, this, that. All right, go ahead.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.720
Then they will come back with a black eye.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.880
Or they may come back with a punched nose.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.440
Then you say, "All right, I'll soothe it down." You soothe it down,

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.160
and then tell them.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.160
So is the wisdom, the discretion of Yogeshwara you should have.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.960
How to deal with people is very important,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.360
why I say Yogeshwara.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:51.520
Because at the guru state you have to give it on a collective level.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.680
Individual level finishes and you jump into collective,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.640
once you start becoming a guru.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.360
So all these methods which I explained the other day to Modi,

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:15.040
you can understand that the ten of

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.200
your problems at the void

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.960
- once solved -

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.800
you solve the sixteen problems of the Vishuddhi.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:34.880
And once sixteen problems are crossed you come to Agnya.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.680
And at the Agnya Chakra

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.080
there is such a tremendous sacrifice

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.000
without feeling the sacrifice, is awaiting.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.920
And one has to see what you can sacrifice

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.520
in that ateeta state, because you don't sacrifice anything.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.800
Everything is already sacrificed, what is there to sacrifice?

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.560
And such a state should be achieved

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.200
by realizing that you are realized souls.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.520
You are not ordinary people

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.560
and you cannot have ordinary,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.280
mundane types

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.960
of rules and regulations.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.440
Like yama and nyama,

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.360
the nyamas are for yourself, yamas for others, nothing.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.040
There should be absolute truths with you.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:50.400
So much so that you should manifest them

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.360
and all these truths have powers.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:59.320
By every truth that is within you established,

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.080
you don't have to do anything, they work out themselves.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.560
So first of all you must get your chakras all right.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.760
On the chakras you must put your attention.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.120
After the samadhi state you will start opening them out properly.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.680
Clear them out. Know what are the chakras that are bad.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.600
I have seen people who have very bad few chakras

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.880
and many good chakras,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.840
but they will be only enjoying the good chakras

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.920
and will not worry about the bad ones.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.680
Pay attention to your bad chakras, cleanse them, cleanse them.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.840
Put all your attention to that.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:45.680
Put the attention of the God,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.280
of the Deity whom you worship

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.120
and you'll get the ...

00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:00.320
... complete manifestation of their power within yourself.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.960
So clear all the chakras,

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.480
all the pradeshas to be established

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.600
and after the establishment of the pradeshas

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.000
you'll have to establish the rapport with others

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.160
on the collective level.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.680
Then a state when you become a complete spirit at the Agnya Chakra.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.800
It's a, easiest in Sahaja Yoga and I have told

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.600
you the reason, because you are such fortunate people.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.160
The easiest of easiest is Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.840
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is that it's the easiest thing to do.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.640
And that is why we should take full

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.000
advantage of that easiest method,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.640
made easy, absolutely for you.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.360
This is the blessing of Guru Puja for you

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:17.560
that you all should become gurus by next year.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.600
Just you have to dedicate and say today in your heart,

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.800
to promise Me in your heart that Mother, not we'll try but we will be

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.200
and thrice you should say, "We will be, we will be."

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.560
Now last of all I want to tell you

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:59.880
that now I have completed My sixtieth year

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.440
and no more celebrations of My birthday, this is the last.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.840
Please remember this.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.600
I have accepted whatever you said,

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.040
because of sixtieth birthday is very auspicious.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:17.080
After this no more celebration of My sixtieth birthday.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:41.160
You have already thought of giving Me some present

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.920
from all Europeans.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.320
On the sixtieth birthday I have accepted,

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:53.880
but no more of this kind of planning should be done anymore

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.240
for the sixtieth birthday, which is over now.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.880
I am telling you very frankly, all right?

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.480
So nobody is going to celebrate My sixtieth birthday anymore.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.960
I hope it's clear to you.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.880
So the protocol

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:27.840
of the Guru and the Mother

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:34.640
is to be understood in Sahaja Yoga mostly by experiencing it.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.720
But that doesn't mean

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.040
that you go out of the way to experience the other side of it.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.320
By being protocolish more and more

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.960
you will find you will receive much more help.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.080
Like Nick one day I told him, he will tell you that,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.600
there were two ladies who wanted to go to Belgium.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.520
I told them they are going tomorrow.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.600
And the ladies said, "No, we are going today."

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.720
He said, "The Mother has said that you are going tomorrow,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.360
so you go tomorrow, whatever it is."

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.680
They said, "No, we are going today.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.640
How is it Mother has said that we are going tomorrow?"

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:18.800
He said, "But She said it" -  they wouldn't listen.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.880
So we sent them to the airport

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.120
and they found they had to go next day.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.640
So that is how it is, that the protocol should be that,

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.720
"Yes, Mother has said it, doesn't matter.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.600
It may go wrong, doesn't matter.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.200
Whatever She says, let's obey and see."

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.120
By experiencing only you will know,

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.680
but in the beginning only you will say,

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.280
"No, we'll not do this and that," - it's not good.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:54.120
So the protocol is the simplest of simple to do,

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.160
So that's the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.000
the simplest of the simple is the protocol.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.480
If you understand the protocol

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.400
you don't have to do anything, you will grow by it automatically.

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.640
But you lack in protocol and that's how you do not grow.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.080
This is the point is, that to grow best in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.960
is to know the protocol, which you can ask others.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.640
With experienced people you can ask,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.080
or if you want to have your own experience you can have.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.120
But some people try the other way round, like answering Me back,

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.520
by saying all kinds of things

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.160
they think "Let's experiment what happens."

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.840
And then they break their necks and come to Me for curing.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.680
So that should not happen. Experience should be for betterment.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.800
And that's how if you can ask others, take their advice,

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:48.160
those people who are rising higher then normal,

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.120
what is the protocol?

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.480
And put your attention to it, how can you improve your protocol,

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.280
what should we do to observe protocol,

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.160
what wrong are we doing, where are we going wrong?

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.080
Because the essence of Sahaja Yoga today is the protocol,

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.840
which should be the simplest.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.760
Should be the simplest thing to do

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:17.080
and once you know the protocol that "If She has said it,

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.160
if it is meant, then it's all right."

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.520
But some people are so funny

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.640
that they start using Me as a quotation.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.840
"Mother has said everybody must fast."

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.000
I told somebody that "You'd better fast."

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.160
So a thin man comes next day fainting, I said, "What happened?"

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:46.120
When I say something to a particular person they just circulate it,

00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.400
because they think, "Why should I fast alone, everybody must fast."

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.800
Is a big problem, that they always quote Me.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.720
Nobody is to quote Me to others,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.560
because one thing is important,

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.640
whatever you have to say you put it on the notice board

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.720
maybe with My signature, better - for general things.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.520
and for particular whatever I say, you should do it for particular.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.680
At least that much discretion we all should have.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.360
And try. You'll be very much helped,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:32.040
you will be surprised, you'll be very much helped,

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.560
because it is for, everything is for your betterment

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.080
and a special grace,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.440
if you understand the essence of protocol.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.760
So I am taking you to that point

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.640
where you'll start understanding

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.800
that nothing is to be surrendered to Mother as such,

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.960
because She doesn't take anything, nothing goes to Her.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.160
Is only your surrendering yourself,

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:03.680
by leaving all that is not wanted.

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:11.360
It's a very beautifying process which one should take.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.680
You all have come up so much and you have to grow very much further,

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.760
I am sure you will go ahead and will become great Gurus

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.160
as you have promised today, by next year.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:43.400
So I don't know what is the procedure of the puja today is,

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:47.760
whatever is the procedure, let's start.

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.720
So now the first, the twenty-one names of Shri Vishnu,

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.600
because it is for the sustainance.

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.960
Then is the Ganesha Puja, Ganesha's Puja.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.440
Then the third thing ...

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.800
Then sankalpa. Sankalpa is the

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.880
dedicated vow -

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.120
for what are you doing this Puja, that is to be said by all of you.

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.960
Then the Ganesha Puja.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:07.600
After Ganesha's Puja then

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:13.640
you do the Guru Puja

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.920
and after the Guru Puja

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.280
after the Guru Puja we will be doing Devi Puja.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.920
After the Devi Puja we will be going out for our Havana,

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:32.320
then after that

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.440
- if you are not worried, I'll tell you - is lunch.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.320
So just now put all your attention to the puja.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.720
A little suggestion is that

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.960
these are the mantras for your central path of Sushumna Nadi.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.040
Every mantra has a very great meaning and deep significance.

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.280
The resonance must help your chakras to open out.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.560
First and foremost thing, you must say it from your heart.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:01.640
Not from your tongue but from your heart.

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.880
Say it from your heart, then the intensity will be great.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.840
We are not ordinary people who are just saying ordinary mantras.

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:15.400
We are realized souls, we have to say it from our heart.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.840
This is the part called sankalpa

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.120
where you have to have the dedicated

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.960
declaration to Me why you are doing this Puja.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.760
It's to all the world, to everyone,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.600
to all the directions, all the Gods,

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:44.000
every word is noted down in the historical documentation.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.480
So you have to say why you are doing this Puja

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:50.320
on this day, at this time, where ...

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.080
What’s the name of the river here? You tell him.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.999
Arun.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:57.960
All they say, some day in 24-th of July 1983,

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.440
at Lodge Hill and west bank of the river Arun

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.040
in the county of Sussex, in country of England

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:10.800
in Europe, in the summer season,

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:15.960
at 10:25 in the morning, when the sun is in the Leo

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.080
and the moon is in Aquarius.

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.440
we are doing this Guru Puja to our Mother Shri Adi Shakti.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:26.440
On the full moon day.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:31.200
On the full moon day,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.120
the Guru Purnima.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.840
We do this Puja on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.000
from all the countries of the world.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.760
And according to all religious Scriptures, all of us

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.400
with all of our families, pray now for wellbeing,

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.080
the spiritual wellbeing,

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:57.640
the victory over all obstacles, the fearlessness,

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.920
for longevity, for the longevity of our Guru,

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:06.480
for health, for wealth,

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.840
for nullification of all the baddhas of the Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:13.999
to be the master of eight siddhis,

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.200
to give peace to all, whether on two legs or on four.

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:25.520
We pray for the health, satisfaction and auspiciousness,

00:59:25.999 --> 00:59:28.480
for all those who are now handicaped,

00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:31.999
for the emancipation, for all the people.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.640
to give them the highest knowledge.

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:41.320
And whatever is our powers, whatever our knowledge,

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.800
whatever offerings we could bring,

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:49.160
through meditation or by whatever means, are given sixteen times,

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.440
these we surrender in the Puja.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.520
And to the seat of the Mother, to the water jar,

00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.920
the conch and the bell, we are doing Puja to all of them.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.640
We request all the rivers to cleanse our bodies.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.720
Above all we worship MahaGanapati

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:18.080
and request Him to continue this Puja without any hindrance.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.960
And we invite the Goddess,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.080
oh, Mother who has all the thousand purushas in Her

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.400
You have a thousand eyes and you have surpassing powers,

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.360
we request You, invite You very humbly,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.720
be present for this occasion on Puja.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.640
You tell about this water.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.000
Just stand up and tell what you have got it for.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.720
SY: This is rose water.
SM: Loudly.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.720
Rose water, made from rose petals. They fell in Scotland

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.960
on Guru day, today, three days ago, on Thursday.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.800
And from Highland spring water.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.240
so that we bow with washing Mother's Feet with this rose water

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.520
offering the Guru tatwa of Scotland and all nations.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.480
with Mother's blessings.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.440
Put it in that water so that....

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.080
Let our ears hear that which is true,

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.400
let our eyes see that which is pure,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.400
let our beings praise that which is divine,

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.560
and let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.120
Let us worship with the same song, the same strength

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.880
and the same knowledge and let our meditation enlighten and enrich.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.520
Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.680
Now the prayer:

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.280
Salutation to Shrī Ganesh, sākshāt Shrī Jesus

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.480
Sākshāt Shrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.280
It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.600
It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.720
are being done, and will be done.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.840
It is You who supports all things that are supported.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.040
It is You who protects all things that are protected.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.960
It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit,

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160
God’s divine energy.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.200
Think clearly brain, speak only the truth.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.680
Let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, speak;

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.160
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, listen;

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.920
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, bless;

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.720
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, protect;

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.760
let Your presence, awakened by Kundalini in us,

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.640
Your disciples, be the disciple.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.320
You are the essence of all the sacred literature and holy words

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.440

You are the earth, You are the water, You are the fire,

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.640
You are the air, and You are the space above the air.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.320
You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.680
You are the body and You are beyond the body.

You are the essence of time and You are beyond time.

You and only You exist at the Muladhara chakra.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.880
You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit;

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.920

one holding a rope, the second a goad,

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.360

Sākshāt Mātājī Nirmalā Devī,

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.680
who is unending joy, salutations to You.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.000
Now the Sanskrit verses

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.920
which are being translated in English as you heard it

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.560
will be said, at the time when they'll be pouring water on My Feet,

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.800
called as abhisheka.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.480
Loud speak.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.840
Slowly.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.280
You have to put hand, to hold it up.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.520
See now viniyoga, the word has come -

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.160
the spending of it.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.040
What is the spending of the name of Shri Ganesha?

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.280
When you remember Him, then where do you spend it?

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.360
Viniyog, is a very good word.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.520
All right. The girls come.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.120
No, unmarried.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.999
Now they will read about Shri Mahavishnu in English,

01:15:08.999 --> 01:15:12.280
who was an incarnation,

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.920
came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.120
How He was created

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.960
and the essence of it was that of ....

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.520
That when, was the One,

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.440
had the essence of Shri Ganesha

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.080
and He came on this earth ultimately as Shri Lord Shri Jesus Christ.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.880
But how He became Mahavishnu

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.999
and what were His blessings we should say,

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.680
who was the Son of Shri Krishna.
