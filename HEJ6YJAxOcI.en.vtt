00:00.320 --> 00:05.200
Today you all have gathered here

00:06.320 --> 00:09.640
to do the Guru Puja.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.080
Your Guru is a Mother first and then a Guru

00:20.480 --> 00:24.320
and that has given Me a greater help.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.720
We have had before also many Guru Pujas,

00:31.920 --> 00:35.480
mostly in England.

00:35.680 --> 00:38.520
And you should wonder why

00:38.720 --> 00:44.520
Mother always somehow is doing Guru Puja in London.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.000
The time falls in such a way that it is in Guru Puja,

00:50.200 --> 00:56.040
I am here, during that time I have to be in London.

00:57.240 --> 01:03.960
So many years we have been doing Guru Puja in England.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.280
All things happen if according to ritambhara pragya

01:15.480 --> 01:17.400
then there must be some reason

01:17.600 --> 01:23.480
why Mother is here in England for a Guru Puja.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.800
It is stated in the Puranas that

01:32.040 --> 01:37.440
the Adi Guru Datattreya

01:38.200 --> 01:41.800
worshipped Mother

01:42.760 --> 01:47.800
along the banks of the river Tamasa.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.200
Tamasa is the same as your Thames

01:54.280 --> 01:58.800
and He himself came and worshipped here.

02:00.800 --> 02:05.120
And the druids, those who had

02:05.560 --> 02:11.080
the manifestation of the Stonehenge and all that,

02:11.560 --> 02:17.560
are originated from that time in this great country of Shiva,

02:18.400 --> 02:21.560
of the Spirit.

02:24.480 --> 02:30.440
So the Spirit resides here as in the heart of human beings,

02:31.200 --> 02:35.240
and the Sahasrara

02:36.560 --> 02:42.360
is in the Himalayas where Sadashiva exists at the Kailasha.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.240
This is the great secret

02:47.440 --> 02:52.960
of we having so many Guru Pujas here.

02:55.200 --> 03:00.240
To culminate it today and to this special type of Guru Puja

03:00.600 --> 03:04.400
in the year of the sixtieth birthday of your Mother

03:04.760 --> 03:09.840
is, has a special, very, very special significance

03:10.080 --> 03:12.280
because is the Guru Sashti -

03:12.480 --> 03:18.360
is the sixty years of your Guru has been celebrated today.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.720
And that's how it's a very big occasion that you all have gathered

03:24.920 --> 03:29.200
under the influence of again ritambhara pragya.

03:34.680 --> 03:40.640
So all that has happened has happened by the nature's own gift to you

03:41.240 --> 03:43.520
and everything has worked out so well

03:43.720 --> 03:48.040
because that was the desire of the Divine

03:48.240 --> 03:51.280
and the design of the Divine.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.920
So the river Thames, which we call Her as Thames -

03:56.120 --> 04:00.240
you see, English have a method of making everything English.

04:00.920 --> 04:04.800
Like Bombay they made it - Mumbai was Bombay,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.200
you see, like Calcutta, like all other words just like that.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.120
Like Varanasi was made into Benares,

04:13.520 --> 04:19.000
River Thames which was really Tamsa was called as Thames.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.520
Now from the name Tamsa one should know

04:24.800 --> 04:28.600
that is a place of Tamo Guna.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.440
Is a place where left-sided resided since long.

04:33.840 --> 04:39.120
So people were very worshipful, left-sided people, emotional type,

04:39.640 --> 04:41.360
and they worshipped God more

04:41.560 --> 04:45.360
than that they went into yagyas and all that.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
And Datattreya lived here

04:50.640 --> 04:55.960
and meditated on the banks of River Thames.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.960
That's why Guru puja here has to give us a great background

05:01.280 --> 05:07.120
for your awakening of the Guru Principle.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.880
We have to go to the roots of everything

05:11.080 --> 05:13.920
so that we understand the importance of it.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.320
Unless and until you know the roots and the traditions behind

05:18.640 --> 05:21.720
you cannot understand the depth,

05:22.040 --> 05:27.520
the gravity, the intensity of any puja.

05:28.320 --> 05:33.000
Today we have gathered here to do the Guru Puja, again.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.160
The reason is we have got a Guru Principle within ourselves

05:37.360 --> 05:39.160
as I told you last time

05:39.360 --> 05:41.200
and also I have given elaborately

05:41.400 --> 05:46.560
the Ten Commandments as expressed within us

05:46.880 --> 05:50.040
which are describing the different

05:50.240 --> 05:54.360
the different types of essences within us.

06:01.160 --> 06:06.320
The essence of Guru Puja has to be awakened within us.

06:06.600 --> 06:12.400
That's how we are having this program here.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.640
Now it is important

06:22.000 --> 06:27.960
that we have to establish

06:28.680 --> 06:31.240
the dharma within us.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.840
Without the dharma you cannot have the ascent.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.920
And as I have told you before that the cleanliness

06:42.280 --> 06:46.080
of your being

06:46.440 --> 06:51.240
depends on how much dharma you follow, religiously.

06:51.880 --> 06:55.200
At the time of Moses

06:56.560 --> 06:59.520
it was worked out

07:00.640 --> 07:04.280
and all the rules and regulations

07:04.800 --> 07:08.800
were created for realized souls.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.400
But as I read in one of the books - it was very good,

07:12.600 --> 07:15.280
because if I had said this, people would not have believed -

07:15.600 --> 07:21.120
that it had to be changed.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.560
I think during the speech the children should not be here,

07:25.840 --> 07:27.480
it's better to take them out.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.520
After the speech you can bring them along - those who make noises.

07:30.800 --> 07:31.800
Those who are quiet it's all right,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.160
but those who are making noises you better bring them out.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.520
If they are going to make noises, better to be out or near the door

07:38.800 --> 07:41.080
so that if they make noises you can get out,

07:41.280 --> 07:42.560
so there is no disturbance.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.840
And during the puja is all right, you could be at the gate,

07:46.040 --> 07:49.520
door or some place from where you can go.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.520
So the laws and regulations that were given to human beings

07:56.800 --> 08:00.560
were actually for the realized souls who would understand.

08:01.040 --> 08:06.720
But when Moses must have discovered the way human beings are,

08:09.400 --> 08:13.000
He must have changed them to very strict rules,

08:13.200 --> 08:15.920
because with human beings as they are,

08:16.160 --> 08:18.480
one has to be extremely strict.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.320
They can't understand anything but fear.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.200
If you have

08:25.000 --> 08:28.680
a stick in your hand, you can put them right.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.320
Without that stick human beings won't listen.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.240
They are only all right if there's a fear.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.360
Now if you see

08:38.560 --> 08:42.920
the today condition of all the nations,

08:43.200 --> 08:48.800
those who are having leaders, or prime ministers, or presidents

08:49.000 --> 08:54.200
they are all people extremely strict,

08:54.880 --> 09:00.840
very dominating and very dry.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.640
And normally people like such people.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.160
Even Hitler succeeded because of that nature.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.040
So the character of a guru so far

09:13.240 --> 09:16.240
has been of a very strict nature

09:16.440 --> 09:19.760
for people who are not realized.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.120
Normally a guru doesn't - a good guru, Satguru,

09:24.520 --> 09:28.320
He doesn't like to talk to people much.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
They throw stones

09:30.840 --> 09:34.440
or they don't like to talk to people

09:34.640 --> 09:39.960
who are not realized.

09:40.360 --> 09:45.520
But if they are realized then these Gurus change their attitude

09:45.760 --> 09:49.320
towards the people who want to see them.

09:49.680 --> 09:51.240
There is a tremendous difference

09:51.440 --> 09:54.680
between a person who is a realized and non-realized

09:54.880 --> 09:58.160
in the protocol of God.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.520
A man may be the king or anything, he'll be asked to sit outside.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.880
It has nothing to do with what position you enjoy.

10:06.160 --> 10:10.320
As long as he is a realized soul and not possessed

10:10.520 --> 10:12.080
he is given the highest position.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.040
But if you are possessed then also the Guru will tell him

10:15.240 --> 10:16.560
that "You get out from here,

10:16.760 --> 10:19.760
first get rid of your possession and then come."

10:20.680 --> 10:22.840
And all these strict rules were there,

10:23.040 --> 10:25.720
that such and such person must be killed,

10:25.920 --> 10:29.320
such and such person must be given a punishment

10:29.560 --> 10:31.720
of cutting the hands, cutting the feet,

10:31.920 --> 10:37.160
even absolutely destroying the eyes.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.040
This was done because they were not realized souls.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.240
It was the great realization of Moses, I think,

10:44.600 --> 10:49.240
that He took to another kind of law which is known as Sharia now

10:49.440 --> 10:51.520
and that's what the Muslims are following.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.440
In a way it's good I think,

10:53.640 --> 10:58.960
because people who are now normal people really deserve such a rule,

10:59.440 --> 11:02.400
but it should not be so fanatical that you cannot discriminate

11:02.600 --> 11:06.400
between a realized soul and a non-realized soul.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.000
Now the Guru within you

11:12.480 --> 11:15.400
will be awakened if you are strict with yourself.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.600
That's one point is very important.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.200
Unless and until you are strict with yourself

11:22.480 --> 11:24.960
the Guru will not be awakened within you.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.560
People who are lazy lumps, who cannot sacrifice anything,

11:29.800 --> 11:34.880
who are very fond of comfort can never be gurus, take it from Me.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.920
They can be good administrators, they can be anything,

11:38.120 --> 11:40.560
but never a guru.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.160
A guru should be willing to live the way he has to live.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.240
He should be able to sleep on stones,

11:48.480 --> 11:52.280
he should be able to sleep under any circumstances.

11:52.680 --> 11:55.840
Not that the disciple should force on him,

11:56.160 --> 12:00.160
but it should be his own nature, that he can adjust himself.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.280
Comfort cannot crawl on a guru.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.760
Now those who want your Guru Principle to be awakened

12:08.000 --> 12:11.160
must know that you should not ask for comfort.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.680
Even for a thing like that, yesterday you saw the dancing,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.480
one has to do real tapasya.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.720
Intensive tapasya you have to do,

12:19.920 --> 12:24.520
you cannot learn even a thing like dancing

12:24.800 --> 12:28.720
without going into a penance about it.

12:29.160 --> 12:34.000
So a guru has to go through all penances is important.

12:34.400 --> 12:39.200
Sahaja Yogi need not go, but a guru Sahaja Yogi has to do it.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.520
We have to have penances,

12:41.720 --> 12:45.960
and the penance can be any kind of desire you have.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.560
Say, supposing you are very fond of food,

12:48.840 --> 12:53.600
just don't eat the food that you want to eat.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.200
If you are very fond of sweet food,

12:56.480 --> 13:01.360
then eat something very bitter, raised to power hundred and eight.

13:02.160 --> 13:08.040
And if you are fond of some sort of a very ...

13:08.840 --> 13:11.000
- as Indians are, sometimes -

13:11.200 --> 13:16.480
... very spicy food then eat so bland the food, without salt.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.200
Teach your tongue to behave itself.

13:19.480 --> 13:23.640
It doesn't behoove a guru to put his attention to food.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.720
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, they are all right

13:27.960 --> 13:30.400
when the food is there, quite concentrated,

13:30.600 --> 13:34.080
but when it comes to the programme they have no concentration.

13:34.280 --> 13:39.520
Such a sad thing, such people cannot be gurus. They can be cooks, good,

13:42.520 --> 13:46.440
or could be food-tasters or something like that.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.000
Will suit them better, but if they have to be gurus

13:50.200 --> 13:54.720
they must learn to control their tongue and their desires.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.520
I mean, fasting is a good thing for such people, fasting is very good.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.280
All the time they are worried, what are we going to have for lunch,

14:02.520 --> 14:04.280
what are we going to have for dinner?

14:04.480 --> 14:08.520
Such people cannot have their Guru Principle awakened,

14:08.840 --> 14:13.000
neither they can be gurus. So please be careful.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.080
The guru must have control over the tongue.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.360
He must know when to get angry

14:20.560 --> 14:24.040
and when to be gentle.

14:24.760 --> 14:29.760
He must know what to say when,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.680
how much to say.

14:33.040 --> 14:38.560
That's why many gurus have been more effective by not speaking.

14:38.880 --> 14:43.480
Silence is the best way you can help others,

14:43.800 --> 14:47.520
but when it comes to explaining Sahaja Yoga, you should speak.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.680
But I have seen with some people they are very eloquent

14:50.880 --> 14:53.120
when it comes to nonsensical things,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.280
but when it comes to Sahaja Yoga, they don't know anything

14:55.480 --> 14:57.000
about Sahaja Yoga.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.800
So you have to be the master of Sahaja Yoga,

14:59.040 --> 15:00.600
if you have to be a Guru,

15:00.800 --> 15:04.360
not only in talking, but in your behaviour, in everything.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.400
And the karamat

15:09.800 --> 15:11.680
is the ...

15:11.920 --> 15:15.280
I don't know if you use charismatic-word, charismatic they call it

15:15.520 --> 15:19.240
or you say, the one how to do it

15:19.680 --> 15:23.320
how to raise the Kundalini, how to put it at the Sahasrara,

15:23.520 --> 15:27.720
how to break the Sahasrara, all these things you must know,

15:27.960 --> 15:32.600
how to spend your knowledge is viniyoga in Sanskrit.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.560
Guru principle is awakened in a person

15:37.800 --> 15:39.840
when he himself has achieved something.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.240
Imagine a half-baked guru going along talking as a Guru.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.960
He'll end up as a disciple ultimately.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.880
So you have to be master of your own,

15:52.120 --> 15:54.440
but when the Guru Principle comes in

15:54.640 --> 15:56.440
you have to give it to others,

15:56.640 --> 15:59.560
it's a question of giving it to others.

15:59.760 --> 16:04.280
So you have to be at a higher level to give it to others,

16:05.560 --> 16:07.960
have to be at a very high level.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.520
If you are attached to money, if you are attached to food,

16:10.720 --> 16:15.160
if you are attached to mundane things of life, you cannot give.

16:17.080 --> 16:22.520
Now the higher state than that can be achieved,

16:23.360 --> 16:27.160
which is naturally in Me, but can be achieved,

16:27.480 --> 16:33.320
is that you don't have to have any dependence like that,

16:33.680 --> 16:36.840
that any rules and regulations,

16:37.120 --> 16:41.520
like saying that I will have no worry about food,

16:41.800 --> 16:43.440
I should fast, this, that -

16:43.640 --> 16:49.360
it all ends up. When you eat but don't eat,

16:50.560 --> 16:53.600
that's the state one should have,

16:53.840 --> 16:57.320
that you are eating the food

16:57.760 --> 17:01.720
and if you ask, "Did you have your lunch?"

17:02.040 --> 17:04.720
"I don't know ..."

17:06.080 --> 17:08.080
"Will you have your lunch?"

17:08.280 --> 17:10.880
"I don't know ..."

17:11.120 --> 17:17.080
Absolutely indifferent to the problems of the body.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.120
"Where did you sleep?"

17:20.320 --> 17:23.240
"I don't know ..."

17:25.640 --> 17:27.600
"What did you eat, what will you have?"

17:27.840 --> 17:30.480
"I don't know ..."

17:30.800 --> 17:35.240
This kind of a state is called ateeta state where you go beyond

17:35.600 --> 17:40.440
and whatever you do, you are doing it

17:40.800 --> 17:44.360
because it is to be done. Without paying any attention to it,

17:44.680 --> 17:46.960
is automatic.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.760
Nothing is important, but this is -

17:52.080 --> 17:55.160
before becoming ateeta you have to steady yourself,

17:55.360 --> 17:57.360
"Nothing is important," you see, is a, avir bhava

17:57.560 --> 18:01.920
they call it, is a kind of a drama you have to put in.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.000
"Oh, nothing is important, this carpet is not important,

18:05.200 --> 18:07.840
I should try to sleep on the cement."

18:08.080 --> 18:10.520
First you have to do that.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.400
But after some time it happens

18:13.600 --> 18:16.240
that you don't remember whether you slept on the cement

18:16.480 --> 18:20.520
or on a cot, "Where did I sleep? I don't know."

18:20.840 --> 18:23.920
That is the ateeta state.

18:26.680 --> 18:32.240
And that state is to be achieved now by many Sahaja Yogis-

18:32.680 --> 18:35.680
in a state where you go beyond.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.440
Say there is somebody who is before you and you have to get angry.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.960
All right, you give them left, right, left, right nicely

18:44.200 --> 18:47.960
and then you are smiling next moment.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.840
Did you get angry with that person? "I don't know, did I?"

18:55.640 --> 18:59.600
Like Buddha once said something

19:00.200 --> 19:03.000
in one village

19:03.200 --> 19:05.000
and there was a horrible fellow who got up

19:05.200 --> 19:07.880
and said lots of things to him.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.640
And when He went to the next village the fellow felt

19:10.840 --> 19:14.680
that "Oh, I should not have done that," Left Vishuddi, perhaps.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.960
So he went down and said, "I am sorry Sir, I have said so

19:18.160 --> 19:19.720
and I should not have said it,

19:19.920 --> 19:21.480
I didn't know You are the enlightened one,

19:21.680 --> 19:23.200
so it happened, so forgive me."

19:23.400 --> 19:26.120
He said "When, where did you say?"

19:26.880 --> 19:28.080
He said, "In the last village."

19:28.280 --> 19:30.520
"Oh, everything in the last village I have left there alone

19:30.720 --> 19:33.560
I don't take with me."

19:34.560 --> 19:37.320
That is the ateeta state that you have to reach.

19:37.600 --> 19:42.080
So even not to feel, it's not important.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.760
These identifications when they drop out completely

19:47.160 --> 19:52.720
then you are doing things in akarma state,

19:53.200 --> 19:58.320
where, like sun is shining it doesn't know it is shining.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.600
When the vibrations are flowing you don't know it is flowing.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.160
Already it has started working in you.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.720
You are surprised, you raise the hands and the Kundalini is rising.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.920
You don't know you are raising the Kundalini actually.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.760
How do you raise it?

20:13.280 --> 20:16.160
You don't know, that's it.

20:18.720 --> 20:21.280
That state has already started ateeta in you,

20:21.480 --> 20:24.120
but get it established in every walk of life,

20:24.320 --> 20:29.000
everything, that you go beyond.

20:30.520 --> 20:34.040
And if you can manage that,

20:35.120 --> 20:38.240
that's the highest that you have to reach.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.880
Now with the incarnations it's very different,

20:48.160 --> 20:50.120
it's the other way round.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.760
Everything is the other way round.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.880
They don't have to do any tapasya.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.440
They don't have to starve, they don't have to cleanse themselves,

21:01.720 --> 21:06.400
whatever they do is the punya.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.040
They don't have to collect punyas either.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.880
If they kill somebody it is dharma.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.240
If they hit somebody it is the dharma.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.960
Nothing they do wrong.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.160
They are absolutely immaculate.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.680
If they deceive someone, they cheat someone,

21:25.880 --> 21:28.200
it's perfectly all right.

21:28.440 --> 21:34.000
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goals.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.080
It's justified in our day-to-day life you'll see,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.880
that when you are defending your country,

21:41.080 --> 21:44.200
there is an enemy on you, if you have to defend your country

21:44.440 --> 21:46.800
you can slay him.

21:47.160 --> 21:51.760
You can cheat him, diplomatically you can befool him.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.600
Is allowed, why?

21:53.800 --> 21:58.040
Because for a higher goal you have to give up the smaller goal.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.800
But for an incarnation it is always the higher goal.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.200
He is not bothered about smaller goals at all.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.960
He doesn't have to weigh, think, rationalize

22:07.160 --> 22:11.600
or to train himself or do some drama or anything, it's all done.

22:11.800 --> 22:16.440
Even the movement, every movement, every movement of an incarnation

22:16.720 --> 22:20.640
has a ripple in it, which is for the good.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.880
There is nothing, not even a moment is such

22:25.200 --> 22:29.560
which is not for the good of the world.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.160
So the incarnation is a very different thing,

22:33.480 --> 22:37.560
that is not to be achieved, that has to be.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.800
Now for example

22:42.320 --> 22:45.960
the incarnation is the bhokta, is the enjoyer,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.080
He is the enjoyer of everything.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.240
Many people, say, have created,

22:50.440 --> 22:53.120
now we have a carpet here from Turkey.

22:53.360 --> 22:56.000
These carpets were created by Turkish peoples

22:56.240 --> 23:00.240
some time back for an incarnation to sit.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.400
So the ritambhara pragya will bring it round in such a way

23:03.640 --> 23:07.160
that at least I see it,

23:07.800 --> 23:09.920
or I have it,

23:10.280 --> 23:12.720
so that their souls will be blessed,

23:13.000 --> 23:16.440
so that they feel nice.

23:17.280 --> 23:22.120
Like Michelangelo has made that not for popes, I can tell you.

23:23.920 --> 23:27.560
and not for all the rubbish people who go there.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.240
Neither Blake did all that work

23:30.440 --> 23:35.080
for the useless people who want to go and see nude artists.

23:35.280 --> 23:40.280
It was all done for the incarnation to see.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.440
That's the way they have blessed the most,

23:44.960 --> 23:48.640
because they are beyond, nothing touches them, nothing is important,

23:48.840 --> 23:51.560
but it's not rational or anything that they have trained themselves,

23:51.760 --> 23:55.560
but it is automatically they have.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.960
Like Shri Krishna had to marry sixteen thousand women.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.320
Can you imagine?

24:04.560 --> 24:09.800
In those days of monogamy he would be prosecuted hundred times.

24:10.160 --> 24:14.160
The reason was he has sixteen thousand powers

24:14.520 --> 24:15.920
and He was to be born

24:16.200 --> 24:20.480
with those sixteen thousand powers on this Earth

24:21.880 --> 24:27.120
and five elements became His queens.

24:30.320 --> 24:36.120
He had to do some justification to have them around.

24:38.760 --> 24:43.880
And as I have now Sahaja Yogis whom I have,

24:44.240 --> 24:46.960
I mean, given Realization.

24:47.320 --> 24:51.360
So automatically I am your Mother, is established.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.400
But for Him there was no way out

24:53.600 --> 24:57.320
but to marry His sixteen thousand powers.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.640
And so He married, but He was never married,

25:01.000 --> 25:04.720
He was a bachelor out and out all His life.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.840
Because He is Yogeshwara and He is a brahmacharya.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.520
Who can marry ... Him?

25:17.000 --> 25:22.800
So for Them all these worldly things are just a drama,

25:23.080 --> 25:26.040
has no meaning at all.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.640
It's just a drama.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.040
A person

25:33.440 --> 25:39.320
who is not an incarnation should not try to be.

25:40.560 --> 25:45.880
That's not the right of a human being.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.560
Like a policeman standing on the road,

25:48.760 --> 25:52.120
if he puts his hands right, left - we follow it.

25:52.400 --> 25:57.640
But you ask some mad man to go and stand there, he will be arrested.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.400
So for normal people, even you are a guru

26:05.680 --> 26:09.280
you shouldn't allow them to touch your feet.

26:10.240 --> 26:14.320
Only an incarnation's feet must be touched

26:15.520 --> 26:18.040
and nobody else's feet must be touched.

26:18.480 --> 26:20.040
Of course in samayachara

26:20.280 --> 26:23.320
like as we have in India the custom to touch the feet of the father,

26:23.600 --> 26:27.480
but because the father is a representative of the father

26:27.680 --> 26:30.960
in you, that's why - or the mother.

26:32.440 --> 26:34.160
But that's symbolic,

26:34.440 --> 26:37.840
but in reality you are not to surrender yourself to anybody else,

26:38.120 --> 26:40.200
but to an incarnation.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.160
Also if there's a teacher in your,

26:43.440 --> 26:47.400
any art or in anyway the master, you must touch his feet.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.760
Even to take his name you have to pull your ears.

26:51.160 --> 26:54.520
But nobody

26:54.800 --> 26:58.880
who is a human being should make touch your feet,

26:59.160 --> 27:02.640
especially the Sahaja Yogis should not.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.120
Nobody should ask anyone to touch your feet.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.280
As an elder you may,

27:10.920 --> 27:14.760
that's a different point, but not as a guru.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.240
Is a very dangerous thing,

27:17.440 --> 27:20.280
once you start it, you know what it happens, with so many,

27:20.520 --> 27:23.800
they have just gone out of Sahaja Yoga.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.560
So to develop the Guru Principle within you

27:27.800 --> 27:32.680
first of all you must develop yourself, fully.

27:32.880 --> 27:37.400
Now how to develop yourself a Guru Principle, one must see.

27:39.800 --> 27:44.880
We have got the ten principles within you, as I told you before

27:45.320 --> 27:48.680
and we should develop these all ten principles in such a way,

27:48.920 --> 27:52.560
that we stand out from others.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.840
Yesterday as I told you that when we do dhyana-dharana-samadhi

27:57.120 --> 28:00.560
and achieve the blessings of the ritambhara pragya,

28:00.840 --> 28:05.280
then put that whole thing

28:05.480 --> 28:08.880
onto different areas

28:09.720 --> 28:13.040
as called as desh or bhoomi.

28:13.400 --> 28:17.360
How you spend them is the point - is through mantras,

28:17.800 --> 28:20.240
cleanse it through mantras,

28:20.520 --> 28:23.800
cleanse it through your attention,

28:24.080 --> 28:29.040
every day you must know which chakra to be cleared out.

28:29.560 --> 28:31.880
You must know about yourself, where is the problem,

28:32.200 --> 28:33.760
how it is to be cleansed,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.880
how we have to clear it out.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.320
Do not take it for granted.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.880
Many people who have got, say, left-sided problem,

28:42.120 --> 28:44.080
you will just bring them lemon and chillis

28:44.280 --> 28:47.080
and think that Mother has done the job.

28:47.400 --> 28:52.000
I can only do the job temporarily,

28:52.560 --> 28:56.400
but if there is a vacuum again you will suck in.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.280
You see ...

28:58.640 --> 29:03.520
these vacuums within you feel hungry again to have some more.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.240
So to take out that vacuum is your job

29:06.440 --> 29:08.960
and for that you have to religiously get

29:09.160 --> 29:12.640
after all your defects.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.840
That's the most important thing for all of you.

29:16.120 --> 29:21.720
And try to put full attention to all these different deshas

29:22.080 --> 29:25.080
- is the nations, they are called like this.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.960
And once you have cleared it,

29:28.160 --> 29:32.160
it is enlightened, is full of light,

29:32.400 --> 29:34.640
then you call it pradesh,

29:34.920 --> 29:38.840
means the desha has been enlightened.

29:40.640 --> 29:41.680
Once that has achieved

29:41.880 --> 29:45.840
then you have reached the point you can become a guru,

29:46.120 --> 29:48.840
but still you are not a Satguru.

29:49.120 --> 29:55.080
To become the Satguru you must achieve the state of ateeta.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.960
The ateeta state is such

29:58.200 --> 30:04.120
that the person who is not a good man will tremble before you.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.640
A man who is a liar,

30:07.920 --> 30:12.080
who has cheated others will lose his tongue.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.600
A man who has adulterous eyes,

30:17.880 --> 30:24.960
who is a man without, no control,

30:25.280 --> 30:28.320
without any control over his mind

30:28.600 --> 30:32.360
as far as the women are concerned or men are concerned,

30:32.640 --> 30:36.000
such a person will have shaking in his eyes.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.040
Some of them will shake,

30:38.280 --> 30:42.560
those who have been possessed will be shaking with it.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.960
They'll be all exposed before the light of a Sat Guru.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.560
When you achieve that you don't have to fight them,

30:50.840 --> 30:53.320
they will themselves be exposed

30:53.600 --> 30:58.560
and you won't have to do anything.

30:59.400 --> 31:02.760
One day I was told

31:03.120 --> 31:05.360
that there is a servant, lady-servant

31:05.560 --> 31:09.240
who is a very possessed person, in the family.

31:09.480 --> 31:13.080
So I said "Get rid of her."

31:13.680 --> 31:18.200
I went to the airport. On My way I stopped at that house

31:18.440 --> 31:20.360
and the maid-servant just walked in, you see

31:20.640 --> 31:23.560
and there was a big gutter flowing,

31:23.800 --> 31:26.880
I mean not a gutter but a open sort of a thing

31:27.160 --> 31:31.360
and she saw Me and she fell in that.

31:32.360 --> 31:33.440
I said, "Oh God,"

31:33.720 --> 31:36.200
so I told the driver to take the car a little ahead.

31:36.440 --> 31:40.800
And she fell in. It happens.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.080
I was traveling by plane one day

31:43.320 --> 31:46.360
and the gentleman in front started just jumping.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.600
So a Sahaja Yogi asked, "Are you from TM?" He said, "How do you know?"

31:49.920 --> 31:53.400
He said, "We know." So I sat back.

31:53.880 --> 31:57.120
It may be they may all have ...

31:57.680 --> 32:00.840
A day may come when they might start jumping like that.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.960
Or a pilot might start jumping.

32:07.160 --> 32:11.120
It's a big problem for Me.

32:16.360 --> 32:22.120
Even the lights ...

32:24.680 --> 32:26.320
... you enter into a church

32:26.640 --> 32:29.680
and suddenly you find all the lights going off like this.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.760
Even in big banquets, I find, when I am sitting there

32:34.040 --> 32:35.480
and suddenly everybody comes and sit down

32:35.680 --> 32:37.840
and all their bhoots come around,

32:38.080 --> 32:41.600
they start jumping and then people start looking, "What's happening,

32:41.880 --> 32:44.680
is there a fire on?"

32:44.960 --> 32:45.680
So many things can happen,

32:45.960 --> 32:49.440
like there was a gentleman very much possessed in a war

32:49.680 --> 32:51.280
and we were going to a ship

32:51.520 --> 32:55.760
and there was a little  platform on which we had to first jump

32:56.040 --> 32:58.240
and the platform started doing like this, like that

32:58.440 --> 33:01.040
and the fellow didn't know what to do with it,

33:01.360 --> 33:04.960
he didn't understand why it was doing this.

33:05.920 --> 33:10.480
So when you reach that state you don't have to argue or do anything,

33:10.840 --> 33:13.640
even if you lift your eye

33:14.000 --> 33:18.520
it happens that the person gets into problems.

33:18.880 --> 33:23.960
Or there could be some ego-oriented people, they'll melt down.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.120
First you have to do the drama of a guru,

33:27.360 --> 33:31.000
dress up in a way which is simple,

33:31.280 --> 33:34.760
you have to behave in a way which is very gentle,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.280
because you have to attract them.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.240
"Come along, come along, come along."

33:38.440 --> 33:41.800
That's advertising, Advertising Department.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.360
And once it is done, that drama is done

33:48.720 --> 33:52.800
it can be exposed very soon, if they will find out that you are not good,

33:53.040 --> 33:55.040
you are just a dramatist.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.400
Once the drama has been done then

33:58.720 --> 34:03.720
very cleverly you can bring out your real self before them.

34:04.200 --> 34:09.400
So first you don't show them that you are a real, hard taskmaster.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.320
Never.

34:11.560 --> 34:15.240
First use all your sweet qualities.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.840
The more they are difficult the more I am gentle with them.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.440
Then they come inside.

34:21.720 --> 34:25.560
Then you put to the mill and you can cure them.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.480
First prepare them. First of all sometimes they are so frightened,

34:29.760 --> 34:34.280
they are so nervous, they are so upset, sometimes too much of ego.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.800
So be gentle.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.680
Gradually they'll strengthen themselves also in your company

34:41.040 --> 34:45.560
and then, even if you hit them they are all right.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.240
That's how it has to be done very cleverly.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.960
and if you see the way I manage My Gurudom

34:54.840 --> 34:58.640
you can also manage.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.680
But the key to Guru is patience,

35:02.920 --> 35:07.440
a complete patience and complete dependence on God Almighty.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.560
That's the key, complete patience.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.560
First you tell them that this should be such,

35:14.800 --> 35:16.680
but they will not accept. They will argue -

35:16.920 --> 35:21.240
how, why, this, that. All right, go ahead.

35:21.880 --> 35:25.720
Then they will come back with a black eye.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.880
Or they may come back with a punched nose.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.440
Then you say, "All right, I'll soothe it down." You soothe it down,

35:32.720 --> 35:35.160
and then tell them.

35:35.400 --> 35:41.160
So is the wisdom, the discretion of Yogeshwara you should have.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.960
How to deal with people is very important,

35:44.160 --> 35:45.360
why I say Yogeshwara.

35:45.560 --> 35:51.520
Because at the guru state you have to give it on a collective level.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.680
Individual level finishes and you jump into collective,

35:55.920 --> 36:00.640
once you start becoming a guru.

36:02.040 --> 36:07.360
So all these methods which I explained the other day to Modi,

36:09.080 --> 36:15.040
you can understand that the ten of

36:16.480 --> 36:21.200
your problems at the void

36:21.680 --> 36:22.960
- once solved -

36:23.360 --> 36:27.800
you solve the sixteen problems of the Vishuddhi.

36:28.920 --> 36:34.880
And once sixteen problems are crossed you come to Agnya.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.680
And at the Agnya Chakra

36:39.360 --> 36:44.080
there is such a tremendous sacrifice

36:45.640 --> 36:51.000
without feeling the sacrifice, is awaiting.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.920
And one has to see what you can sacrifice

36:58.280 --> 37:02.520
in that ateeta state, because you don't sacrifice anything.

37:02.760 --> 37:07.800
Everything is already sacrificed, what is there to sacrifice?

37:09.800 --> 37:13.560
And such a state should be achieved

37:14.080 --> 37:19.200
by realizing that you are realized souls.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.520
You are not ordinary people

37:21.720 --> 37:25.560
and you cannot have ordinary,

37:26.200 --> 37:28.280
mundane types

37:28.600 --> 37:32.960
of rules and regulations.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.440
Like yama and nyama,

37:35.680 --> 37:40.360
the nyamas are for yourself, yamas for others, nothing.

37:41.160 --> 37:45.040
There should be absolute truths with you.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.400
So much so that you should manifest them

37:50.720 --> 37:53.360
and all these truths have powers.

37:53.640 --> 37:59.320
By every truth that is within you established,

38:00.040 --> 38:04.080
you don't have to do anything, they work out themselves.

38:04.840 --> 38:09.560
So first of all you must get your chakras all right.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.760
On the chakras you must put your attention.

38:14.160 --> 38:19.120
After the samadhi state you will start opening them out properly.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.680
Clear them out. Know what are the chakras that are bad.

38:22.920 --> 38:26.600
I have seen people who have very bad few chakras

38:26.920 --> 38:27.880
and many good chakras,

38:28.120 --> 38:30.840
but they will be only enjoying the good chakras

38:31.080 --> 38:32.920
and will not worry about the bad ones.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.680
Pay attention to your bad chakras, cleanse them, cleanse them.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.840
Put all your attention to that.

38:40.120 --> 38:45.680
Put the attention of the God,

38:45.920 --> 38:50.280
of the Deity whom you worship

38:52.560 --> 38:55.120
and you'll get the ...

38:55.440 --> 39:00.320
... complete manifestation of their power within yourself.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.960
So clear all the chakras,

39:03.240 --> 39:06.480
all the pradeshas to be established

39:06.760 --> 39:09.600
and after the establishment of the pradeshas

39:09.880 --> 39:13.000
you'll have to establish the rapport with others

39:13.320 --> 39:16.160
on the collective level.

39:19.800 --> 39:25.680
Then a state when you become a complete spirit at the Agnya Chakra.

39:29.120 --> 39:33.800
It's a, easiest in Sahaja Yoga and I have told

39:34.000 --> 39:38.600
you the reason, because you are such fortunate people.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.160
The easiest of easiest is Sahaja Yoga.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.840
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is that it's the easiest thing to do.

39:50.880 --> 39:55.640
And that is why we should take full

39:56.200 --> 40:01.000
advantage of that easiest method,

40:01.280 --> 40:05.640
made easy, absolutely for you.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.360
This is the blessing of Guru Puja for you

40:11.600 --> 40:17.560
that you all should become gurus by next year.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.600
Just you have to dedicate and say today in your heart,

40:23.800 --> 40:28.800
to promise Me in your heart that Mother, not we'll try but we will be

40:29.080 --> 40:33.200
and thrice you should say, "We will be, we will be."

42:51.600 --> 42:55.560
Now last of all I want to tell you

42:55.760 --> 42:59.880
that now I have completed My sixtieth year

43:00.400 --> 43:04.440
and no more celebrations of My birthday, this is the last.

43:04.680 --> 43:05.840
Please remember this.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.600
I have accepted whatever you said,

43:07.800 --> 43:11.040
because of sixtieth birthday is very auspicious.

43:11.280 --> 43:17.080
After this no more celebration of My sixtieth birthday.

43:35.640 --> 43:41.160
You have already thought of giving Me some present

43:41.600 --> 43:43.920
from all Europeans.

43:44.240 --> 43:48.320
On the sixtieth birthday I have accepted,

43:48.600 --> 43:53.880
but no more of this kind of planning should be done anymore

43:54.360 --> 43:59.240
for the sixtieth birthday, which is over now.

43:59.960 --> 44:02.880
I am telling you very frankly, all right?

44:03.160 --> 44:06.480
So nobody is going to celebrate My sixtieth birthday anymore.

44:06.760 --> 44:09.960
I hope it's clear to you.

44:13.880 --> 44:19.880
So the protocol

44:21.920 --> 44:27.840
of the Guru and the Mother

44:28.760 --> 44:34.640
is to be understood in Sahaja Yoga mostly by experiencing it.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.720
But that doesn't mean

44:37.000 --> 44:42.040
that you go out of the way to experience the other side of it.

44:44.760 --> 44:47.320
By being protocolish more and more

44:47.600 --> 44:52.960
you will find you will receive much more help.

44:56.800 --> 45:00.080
Like Nick one day I told him, he will tell you that,

45:00.320 --> 45:02.600
there were two ladies who wanted to go to Belgium.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.520
I told them they are going tomorrow.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.600
And the ladies said, "No, we are going today."

45:07.840 --> 45:09.720
He said, "The Mother has said that you are going tomorrow,

45:09.960 --> 45:11.360
so you go tomorrow, whatever it is."

45:11.560 --> 45:12.680
They said, "No, we are going today.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.640
How is it Mother has said that we are going tomorrow?"

45:15.880 --> 45:18.800
He said, "But She said it" -  they wouldn't listen.

45:19.080 --> 45:21.880
So we sent them to the airport

45:22.200 --> 45:25.120
and they found they had to go next day.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.640
So that is how it is, that the protocol should be that,

45:36.840 --> 45:38.720
"Yes, Mother has said it, doesn't matter.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.600
It may go wrong, doesn't matter.

45:40.840 --> 45:43.200
Whatever She says, let's obey and see."

45:43.480 --> 45:45.120
By experiencing only you will know,

45:45.360 --> 45:46.680
but in the beginning only you will say,

45:46.880 --> 45:49.280
"No, we'll not do this and that," - it's not good.

45:49.520 --> 45:54.120
So the protocol is the simplest of simple to do,

45:54.400 --> 45:56.160
So that's the essence of Sahaja Yoga,

45:56.440 --> 45:59.000
the simplest of the simple is the protocol.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.480
If you understand the protocol

46:00.720 --> 46:04.400
you don't have to do anything, you will grow by it automatically.

46:05.520 --> 46:09.640
But you lack in protocol and that's how you do not grow.

46:11.480 --> 46:16.080
This is the point is, that to grow best in Sahaja Yoga

46:16.320 --> 46:20.960
is to know the protocol, which you can ask others.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.640
With experienced people you can ask,

46:23.840 --> 46:26.080
or if you want to have your own experience you can have.

46:26.360 --> 46:29.120
But some people try the other way round, like answering Me back,

46:29.400 --> 46:30.520
by saying all kinds of things

46:30.720 --> 46:33.160
they think "Let's experiment what happens."

46:33.560 --> 46:36.840
And then they break their necks and come to Me for curing.

46:37.160 --> 46:40.680
So that should not happen. Experience should be for betterment.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.800
And that's how if you can ask others, take their advice,

46:44.040 --> 46:48.160
those people who are rising higher then normal,

46:48.360 --> 46:50.120
what is the protocol?

46:50.400 --> 46:53.480
And put your attention to it, how can you improve your protocol,

46:53.720 --> 46:56.280
what should we do to observe protocol,

46:56.480 --> 46:59.160
what wrong are we doing, where are we going wrong?

46:59.360 --> 47:04.080
Because the essence of Sahaja Yoga today is the protocol,

47:04.560 --> 47:07.840
which should be the simplest.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.760
Should be the simplest thing to do

47:13.040 --> 47:17.080
and once you know the protocol that "If She has said it,

47:17.360 --> 47:19.160
if it is meant, then it's all right."

47:19.440 --> 47:21.520
But some people are so funny

47:21.720 --> 47:24.640
that they start using Me as a quotation.

47:24.920 --> 47:28.840
"Mother has said everybody must fast."

47:29.240 --> 47:32.000
I told somebody that "You'd better fast."

47:32.280 --> 47:36.160
So a thin man comes next day fainting, I said, "What happened?"

47:42.560 --> 47:46.120
When I say something to a particular person they just circulate it,

47:46.360 --> 47:50.400
because they think, "Why should I fast alone, everybody must fast."

47:58.280 --> 48:01.800
Is a big problem, that they always quote Me.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.720
Nobody is to quote Me to others,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.560
because one thing is important,

48:06.840 --> 48:10.640
whatever you have to say you put it on the notice board

48:11.000 --> 48:16.720
maybe with My signature, better - for general things.

48:17.080 --> 48:21.520
and for particular whatever I say, you should do it for particular.

48:21.760 --> 48:26.680
At least that much discretion we all should have.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.360
And try. You'll be very much helped,

48:29.560 --> 48:32.040
you will be surprised, you'll be very much helped,

48:32.240 --> 48:35.560
because it is for, everything is for your betterment

48:35.800 --> 48:38.080
and a special grace,

48:38.360 --> 48:42.440
if you understand the essence of protocol.

48:44.440 --> 48:47.760
So I am taking you to that point

48:48.080 --> 48:49.640
where you'll start understanding

48:49.840 --> 48:52.800
that nothing is to be surrendered to Mother as such,

48:53.040 --> 48:56.960
because She doesn't take anything, nothing goes to Her.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.160
Is only your surrendering yourself,

48:59.360 --> 49:03.680
by leaving all that is not wanted.

49:06.920 --> 49:11.360
It's a very beautifying process which one should take.

49:11.680 --> 49:15.680
You all have come up so much and you have to grow very much further,

49:15.960 --> 49:19.760
I am sure you will go ahead and will become great Gurus

49:20.000 --> 49:25.160
as you have promised today, by next year.

49:39.480 --> 49:43.400
So I don't know what is the procedure of the puja today is,

49:43.640 --> 49:47.760
whatever is the procedure, let's start.

51:28.480 --> 51:32.720
So now the first, the twenty-one names of Shri Vishnu,

51:32.960 --> 51:36.600
because it is for the sustainance.

51:36.880 --> 51:41.960
Then is the Ganesha Puja, Ganesha's Puja.

51:42.800 --> 51:46.440
Then the third thing ...

51:50.640 --> 51:55.800
Then sankalpa. Sankalpa is the

51:56.280 --> 51:58.880
dedicated vow -

51:59.160 --> 52:03.120
for what are you doing this Puja, that is to be said by all of you.

52:03.440 --> 52:04.960
Then the Ganesha Puja.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.600
After Ganesha's Puja then

52:07.840 --> 52:13.640
you do the Guru Puja

52:14.480 --> 52:16.920
and after the Guru Puja

52:17.600 --> 52:22.280
after the Guru Puja we will be doing Devi Puja.

52:22.920 --> 52:28.920
After the Devi Puja we will be going out for our Havana,

52:29.400 --> 52:32.320
then after that

52:33.400 --> 52:37.440
- if you are not worried, I'll tell you - is lunch.

52:43.840 --> 52:48.320
So just now put all your attention to the puja.

55:37.880 --> 55:40.720
A little suggestion is that

55:41.000 --> 55:46.960
these are the mantras for your central path of Sushumna Nadi.

55:47.560 --> 55:51.040
Every mantra has a very great meaning and deep significance.

55:51.240 --> 55:54.280
The resonance must help your chakras to open out.

55:54.520 --> 55:58.560
First and foremost thing, you must say it from your heart.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.640
Not from your tongue but from your heart.

56:01.920 --> 56:05.880
Say it from your heart, then the intensity will be great.

56:06.720 --> 56:09.840
We are not ordinary people who are just saying ordinary mantras.

56:10.120 --> 56:15.400
We are realized souls, we have to say it from our heart.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.840
This is the part called sankalpa

56:23.080 --> 56:28.120
where you have to have the dedicated

56:29.640 --> 56:33.960
declaration to Me why you are doing this Puja.

56:34.160 --> 56:35.760
It's to all the world, to everyone,

56:36.000 --> 56:39.600
to all the directions, all the Gods,

56:39.840 --> 56:44.000
every word is noted down in the historical documentation.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.480
So you have to say why you are doing this Puja

56:46.720 --> 56:50.320
on this day, at this time, where ...

56:57.600 --> 57:00.080
What’s the name of the river here? You tell him.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.999
Arun.

57:52.440 --> 57:57.960
All they say, some day in 24-th of July 1983,

57:58.680 --> 58:02.440
at Lodge Hill and west bank of the river Arun

58:03.000 --> 58:07.040
in the county of Sussex, in country of England

58:07.280 --> 58:10.800
in Europe, in the summer season,

58:11.640 --> 58:15.960
at 10:25 in the morning, when the sun is in the Leo

58:16.160 --> 58:19.080
and the moon is in Aquarius.

58:19.280 --> 58:23.440
we are doing this Guru Puja to our Mother Shri Adi Shakti.

58:23.960 --> 58:26.440
On the full moon day.

58:27.320 --> 58:31.200
On the full moon day,

58:31.480 --> 58:34.120
the Guru Purnima.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.840
We do this Puja on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis,

58:38.040 --> 58:41.000
from all the countries of the world.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.760
And according to all religious Scriptures, all of us

58:45.040 --> 58:49.400
with all of our families, pray now for wellbeing,

58:49.680 --> 58:52.080
the spiritual wellbeing,

58:52.360 --> 58:57.640
the victory over all obstacles, the fearlessness,

58:57.920 --> 59:02.920
for longevity, for the longevity of our Guru,

59:03.440 --> 59:06.480
for health, for wealth,

59:06.920 --> 59:10.840
for nullification of all the baddhas of the Sahaja Yogis,

59:11.120 --> 59:13.999
to be the master of eight siddhis,

59:14.320 --> 59:19.200
to give peace to all, whether on two legs or on four.

59:19.480 --> 59:25.520
We pray for the health, satisfaction and auspiciousness,

59:25.999 --> 59:28.480
for all those who are now handicaped,

59:28.680 --> 59:31.999
for the emancipation, for all the people.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.640
to give them the highest knowledge.

59:36.280 --> 59:41.320
And whatever is our powers, whatever our knowledge,

59:41.600 --> 59:43.800
whatever offerings we could bring,

59:44.040 --> 59:49.160
through meditation or by whatever means, are given sixteen times,

59:49.400 --> 59:52.440
these we surrender in the Puja.

59:53.760 --> 59:57.520
And to the seat of the Mother, to the water jar,

59:57.720 --> 01:00:02.920
the conch and the bell, we are doing Puja to all of them.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:08.640
We request all the rivers to cleanse our bodies.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.720
Above all we worship MahaGanapati

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:18.080
and request Him to continue this Puja without any hindrance.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.960
And we invite the Goddess,

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.080
oh, Mother who has all the thousand purushas in Her

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:34.400
You have a thousand eyes and you have surpassing powers,

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.360
we request You, invite You very humbly,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.720
be present for this occasion on Puja.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.640
You tell about this water.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.000
Just stand up and tell what you have got it for.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.720
SY: This is rose water.
SM: Loudly.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.720
Rose water, made from rose petals. They fell in Scotland

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:54.960
on Guru day, today, three days ago, on Thursday.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.800
And from Highland spring water.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.240
so that we bow with washing Mother's Feet with this rose water

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.520
offering the Guru tatwa of Scotland and all nations.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.480
with Mother's blessings.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.440
Put it in that water so that....

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.080
Let our ears hear that which is true,

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.400
let our eyes see that which is pure,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.400
let our beings praise that which is divine,

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.560
and let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:32.120
Let us worship with the same song, the same strength

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.880
and the same knowledge and let our meditation enlighten and enrich.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.520
Let there be amongst us compassion and peace.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.680
Now the prayer:

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.280
Salutation to Shrī Ganesh, sākshāt Shrī Jesus

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.480
Sākshāt Shrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.280
It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.600
It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:57.720
are being done, and will be done.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.840
It is You who supports all things that are supported.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.040
It is You who protects all things that are protected.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.960
It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit,

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.160
God’s divine energy.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.200
Think clearly brain, speak only the truth.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.680
Let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, speak;

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.160
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, listen;

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:22.920
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, bless;

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.720
let Your presence, awakened in us by Kundalini, protect;

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.760
let Your presence, awakened by Kundalini in us,

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.640
Your disciples, be the disciple.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.320
You are the essence of all the sacred literature and holy words

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.440
and You are the energy that understands the holy words.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.440
You are the divine combination of complete truth,

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.200
complete happiness and complete energy; and You are beyond.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.000
You are all knowledge, and You are the use to which knowledge is put

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.680
You exist until the end of all things,

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.160
and after the end of all things You are.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.240
You create the end of all things, and after the end of all things,

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.000
You remain indifferent.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:03.520
You are the earth, You are the water, You are the fire,

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.640
You are the air, and You are the space above the air.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.320
You are the gunas and You are beyond the gunas.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.680
You are the body and You are beyond the body.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.040
You are the essence of time and You are beyond time.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.000
You and only You exist at the Muladhara chakra.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.880
You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit;

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.920
and those who would join God meditate upon You

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.560
You are Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra; You are Indra, Agni, Vayu;

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.640
You are the sun at noon, You are the full moon;

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.160
through all of these and more,

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.840
You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.280
You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints;

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.400
You are the tiny core of all things,

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.000
without which the large have no purpose;

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.360
You are the key to the libraries of all the scriptures,

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.480
without which the truth is hidden;

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.320
You are the full stop which completes the sentence,

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.960
and without which the sentence loses its meaning.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.720
You are the crescent moon,

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.560
You are the stars and You are beyond the stars;

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.880
all the things, from tiny dot to universe, is You.

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.840
You are not to put your hand inside.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.800
Just pour water on My Feet when he says the mantras.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.720
You are where the sounds combine;

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.680
You are the silence between the sounds;

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.800
You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.360
This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh,

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.520
and You, Nirmal Ganesh, are the master of that knowledge,

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.440
and all knowledge. You are the God and You are the Goddess.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.160
Aum Gam Nirmal Ganapataye

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.080
To Your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender;

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.840
and the left side of memory and the right side of action

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.640
surrender to You. And let Your enlightenment prevail.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.160
Your first tooth You have, and four hands:

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.640
one holding a rope, the second a goad,

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.360
the third is raised in blessing and the fourth offers sustenance.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.960
Your banner is that of a humble mouse.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.640
You have long ears and are clothed in red.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.200
Red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.640
You have compassion for those who love You,

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:05.080
and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.000
You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.880
and the Spirit that protects.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.960
Those who seek union with God pray to You.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.880
Those who seek union with God worship You.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.120
Aum Gam Nirmal Jesusye.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.360
To Your powers, Aum Jesus, let's all surrender;

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:25.160
let the left side of memory and the right side of action

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.000
surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.240
You are the Word that was the beginning;

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.760
You are the Word that will be the ending.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.400
You are He who was born of a virgin, and died on the cross.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.440
You are He who absorbs all sins, and who died to live again.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.280
You are God in man, and You are worshipped with red flowers.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.240
You have compassion for those who love You,

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.880
and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.560
You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.680
and the Spirit that protects.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.040
Those who seek union with God pray through You.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.600
Those who seek union with God worship You.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.800
Shri Ganesha, salutations to You. Shri Jesus, salutations to You.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.840
He who is the beginning of all worship, salutations to You.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.840
He who destroys all the powers of evil, salutations to You.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.080
Sākshāt son of Lord Shiva,

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.400
who is unending blessings, salutations to You.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.240
Sākshāt son of Mary Mātājī,

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.560
who is unending love, salutations to You.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.600
Sākshāt Mātājī Nirmalā Devī,

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.680
who is unending joy, salutations to You.

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.000
Now the Sanskrit verses

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.920
which are being translated in English as you heard it

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.560
will be said, at the time when they'll be pouring water on My Feet,

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.800
called as abhisheka.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.480
Loud speak.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.840
Slowly.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.280
You have to put hand, to hold it up.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.520
See now viniyoga, the word has come -

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.160
the spending of it.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.040
What is the spending of the name of Shri Ganesha?

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.280
When you remember Him, then where do you spend it?

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.360
Viniyog, is a very good word.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.520
All right. The girls come.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.120
No, unmarried.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:07.999
Now they will read about Shri Mahavishnu in English,

01:15:08.999 --> 01:15:12.280
who was an incarnation,

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.920
came on this Earth as Lord Jesus Christ.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.120
How He was created

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.960
and the essence of it was that of ....

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.520
That when, was the One,

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.440
had the essence of Shri Ganesha

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:39.080
and He came on this earth ultimately as Shri Lord Shri Jesus Christ.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.880
But how He became Mahavishnu

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.999
and what were His blessings we should say,

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.680
who was the Son of Shri Krishna.
