00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:11.487
Now, when we are celebrating the
greatest of greatest this Navaratri,

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:15.020
there must be something special about it,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.634
that we have to cleanse this heart completely,

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.901
fully

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:31.687
and make it so pure that it purifies all the blood

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:36.501
that passes through the whole of the body.

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.554
So the cells of this heart,

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:44.554
which has made this great organ,

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:52.888
has to be the best, because the cells of the heart

00:00:52.968 --> 00:01:02.320
within a human body are the best cells,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.267
the highest quality, the most sensitive.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:15.801
And it's the heart that expresses the Anahata,

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:22.167
the sound that is without percussion.

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:28.854
While we find

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:34.387
that there are some people of caliber, there are,

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:40.187
but others talk more, show off more,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:44.000
and do not have the caliber.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:51.254
Now to achieve that caliber should be possible

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:57.687
because you are born on the special land of England.

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:02.254
That possibility must be built within you.

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:06.167
But then what is lacking?

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:12.487
Why is it, that with all the possibility,

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.020
with all the great background,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.220
with all the merits to be here,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.554
why is it we find

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:32.087
that Sahaja yogis for years together
do not come up to many others.

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:35.421
What is the reason?

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.387
Heart, if you see, has a pulse rate

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:45.020
and it moves with a certain sound,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.754
and you can even get it on to a graph

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.320
and it is so systematic,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.254
it is so regularized, it is so disciplined,

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:58.854
that even a slightest murmur,

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:03.854
or slightest change shows on the graph.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:08.020
Is a very sensitive thing.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.487
And that is what is lacking
here, is that discipline of the heart.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:18.654
It's an erratic, funny heart

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:22.267
which swells up in ego.

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.487
And whatever one may talk,

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:27.654
this is another reading people have,

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:31.854
that whatever you may tell them,
that time seriously they listen to you

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:36.100
and second moment it has no effect on them.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:42.020
So this is another thing we should see that if it is within us,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.654
let us understand that what we lack is disciplining.

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:55.734
And that disciplining has to come,
otherwise our caliber cannot improve.

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:05.521
But for all that, I think what we
should have is innate intelligence.

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:09.087
No education, innate intelligence.

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:16.167
Innate intelligence to understand
that our caliber has to improve.

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:25.000
Now here pulsates the Spirit,

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:32.654
the Spirit and not the Power.

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:36.254
The witness,

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:39.888
the one that watches,

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:43.020
that is the reflection of God,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:51.154
who is the Spectator of the work of the Devi.

00:04:51.234 --> 00:04:53.754
Actually what happens

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:59.554
that without rising up to that status

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:06.854
if we also say, "All right, we are also
watching because we are the Spirit,"

00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:11.354
then we do not achieve that caliber.

00:05:11.434 --> 00:05:18.953
We do not understand that we all have to discipline ourselves.

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.754
Only to take advantage

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:26.154
or to be in the Sahaja Yoga

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:29.754
to claim that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:37.834
is not a sign of being a cell of the heart.

00:05:41.767 --> 00:05:43.953
And warning has to be given now.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.953
Very important is at this juncture

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:50.987
when Sahaja Yoga is now taking off, remember this,

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.654
the speed has been gained and it is taking off.

00:05:54.734 --> 00:05:59.220
Those who will be left behind, will be left behind.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.521
So now to develop these powers

00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:07.354
we have to concentrate on these chakras.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:10.254
Everywhere I went, I was surprised,

00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:13.354
the questions they asked Me, the way they were.

00:06:13.434 --> 00:06:18.254
Nobody talked about their family,house, jobs or

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:22.287
any other nonsensical thing like

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:25.187
unemployment and all that.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:30.687
They just asked Me, "Mother, how
do we develop the power of this chakra,

00:06:30.767 --> 00:06:33.788
or that chakra or that chakra?"

00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:37.920
And I asked them, "How is it you
are asking about a particular chakra?"

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.801
They said, "Because we find this is missing in us,

00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.821
specially in me this one is not all right."

00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.587
Now for a realized soul

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:54.421
there is no need for Me to discipline
you or to tell you all these things,

00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:58.721
because I hate to talk in this tone to you today.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:03.920
But I have discovered, that if I do not warn you now,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.220
tomorrow you will blame Me that I did not warn you.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.100
Take it as a serious warning.

00:07:16.934 --> 00:07:20.187
Now after Realization

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:24.254
there is no need for Me to discipline you at all,

00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:27.187
because you have got the light,

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:33.154
you have known what is Realization,

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:38.554
you have known what it means to be realized,

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:42.687
and you have also known how much you have gained out of it,

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:47.133
how much your personality has improved.

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:55.334
But, there is something more that has to be done.

00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:59.687
Is to see for yourself,

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:04.521
if you have really disciplined yourself or not.

00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:07.320
There is no need for any leader to tell you,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.854
there is no need for any ashram fellow to tell you,

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:15.987
there is no need for anyone to tell you.

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:20.154
It is you, who is a realized soul,

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.320
you are your own master,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.354
you are your own guru. Imagine you are all gurus,

00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:35.354
great gurus and satgurus, respected saints

00:08:35.434 --> 00:08:40.721
where all the angels have to shower you with flowers.

00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.953
Think of it.

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:48.020
Every day you must meditate.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.154
Discipline yourself.

00:08:50.234 --> 00:08:55.487
Now you have come to a new perspection, perspective.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.487
You have come to a new vision.

00:08:57.567 --> 00:09:02.788
Now when you see that vision, when you know the vision,

00:09:02.868 --> 00:09:05.953
you cannot just stand there.

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:07.621
Get into it!

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:13.421
So let us now, promise within our heart

00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.454
that this has to go into our heart,

00:09:16.534 --> 00:09:22.287
a very deep feeling for ourselves,

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:25.953
that by God's grace we are born at such a juncture

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.120
when this thing has happened,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.654
that we are the people who are beneficiaries

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:36.788
of the blessings of God that we have got our Realization,

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:40.053
that we have risen so high.

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:45.854
But now let us spread our wings. But we are cutting them down

00:09:45.934 --> 00:09:50.020
You have to take full advantage.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.254
With full intensity you have to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:55.334 --> 00:09:58.621
That doesn't mean that you give up your jobs, or anything.

00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:02.521
If you are intense in Sahaja Yoga,
you will be intense in everything.

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.721
But there is no intensity.

00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:07.354
So, today is a great day.

00:10:07.434 --> 00:10:09.953
Of course a great privilege.

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:15.788
Always you are privileged people, like House of Lords.

00:10:15.868 --> 00:10:17.888
Is true, but may be,

00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:23.087
one day may come when this House
of Lords may be banished completely.

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:26.534
You have to behave like lords.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.854
That is why My humble request is

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:36.287
that you must learn

00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:39.888
to worship discipline.

00:10:39.968 --> 00:10:42.187
I don't say, "Do this, do that."

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:44.587
You know what is to be done.

00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:49.953
And then on top of that, you should not
tell Me, "I know, I should have, I know."

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:55.120
When you know, why don't you do it? You are empowered.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.888
Today let us, with full confidence in ourselves

00:10:59.968 --> 00:11:01.854
and in our ascent,

00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:05.621
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.754
and in our hearts decide

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.534
that, "I am going to discipline myself."

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.267
May God bless you.
