1
00:00:04,818 --> 00:00:07,568
TV Staff: Might be nice to chill out
TV Staff: I think so

2
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:09,793
TV Staff: Andrew
TV Staff: It's the time now

3
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:13,010
TV Staff Andrew: Exactly! What did you had
to do because a couple of weeks ago

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,330
on the Sunrise we had an incredible response
to the [UNCLEAR - SOATBOT?] it was [UNCLEAR]

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,462
we did on meditation. Now we will look
at ways to find some peace and quiet

6
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:26,481
in a short space of time.
TV Staff: So, being National Stress Down Day

7
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,471
we decided to get some more tips
on how to be stress-free.

8
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:38,935
TV Reporter: No matter where you work,
there are places to be, places to see but

9
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:43,622
every now and then it's nice to tune out
to find some inner peace. So, in a small

10
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:49,125
experiment I put together the entire Sunrise
team to see how meditation will help us to

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:54,907
get through the day.
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Something that you

12
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:59,626
don't have to pay for, no secret mantras, no
ten day retreats, no donations, nothing.

13
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,754
You just pick it up very easy and
TV Reporter: According to the Health of

14
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:07,291
Meditation expert, Dr. Ramesh Manocha, we
down tools in our bustling production office,

15
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,077
we learn how to achieve mental silence.
Dr. Manocha: We start with both hands

16
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:17,175
on our lap, palm up, breathing gently in
and out through the nose, taking our

17
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:24,597
attention away from many external distractions.
Keeping our eyes closed, we put our right hand

18
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:29,048
on the top of the tummy, on the left side,
just below the ribs. Here, we just say to

19
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:34,813
this energy of meditation within us, "I am
my own master." We just say slightly silently,

20
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:41,270
so inside we silently, inside otherwise
we feel silly.

21
00:01:42,646 --> 00:01:46,336
We take our hand to our heart,
so we can say here,

22
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:52,439
just a few times silently inside, "I am
the Spirit." Take our right hand towards

23
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,143
the left shoulder amidst the neck, turn the
head a little bit to the right and this is

24
00:01:56,143 --> 00:02:01,329
the center which accumulates a lot of pressure
or tension when we feel too much guilt, so

25
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:07,363
just to let go of that we say here, "I am
not guilty at all." Now we take the right

26
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:13,731
hand to the forehead grasping the temples,
to let it all go, "I forgive everyone and everything."

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,970
We turn the right hand to the lap and sitting
quietly, just enjoying the silence within.

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,830
Now we gently open our eyes and
that's the basic process

29
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,758
TV Reporter: In a space of just 10 short
minutes Dr. Ramesh managed to transport

30
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:33,580
most of us to different space.
TV Staff: There was one little thing

31
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,548
Another Staff: I had that as well.
TV Staff: and that's what I focused on
Another Staff: and I just went

32
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:40,512
and things would come out and not go - no.
Yeah, I was surprised.

33
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,554
Staff: I was surprised that we're sitting
above a busy newsroom with phones going off

34
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:49,585
and people having conversations
[UNCLEAR] to actually get out of that

35
00:02:49,585 --> 00:02:54,373
space and forget where I was.
Staff: Yes, I felt myself so concentrated
on the breathing motor

36
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:58,936
TV Reporter: For just 5-10 minutes, twice
a day, it's enough to not spend in us,

37
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:02,474
in just a couple of weeks.
Staff: So, who'd do it again?

38
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:09,960
TV Staff Andrew: It was amazing, wasn't it?
Staff: Oh, yeah! I was really surprised.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,730
because can't be cynical about that stuff
and I went to the happy place. I loved it.

40
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:21,669
TV Staff: And it's, and it's also, it was
in a busy office with lots of noise

41
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,759
and you do find yourself.
Reporter: Could you hear anything?

42
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,109
TV Staff : No
Reporter: I couldn't hear. I can't remember
hearing a phone even.

43
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,133
TV Staff Andrew: It was great!.
Reporter: How are you?

44
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:35,217
Staff: I wasn't quite where you went but I
felt myself slowing down my thoughts but I -

45
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,695
I was almost like a head sleeping hearing -
I could hear every little thing everywhere

46
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,840
but you know, that's okay. Maybe my
happy place is just noisy.

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,930
TV Staff Andrew: Full details of that is all
on our website. So, if you're interested

48
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,284
and you want to follow it, go the
Sunrise website - it's all there.

49
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:53,089
TV Staff: And Ramesh was great -
that's also there.
Host: Why did they say are the costs of....
