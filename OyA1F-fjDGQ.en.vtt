00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.060
…and how it resides within us and how we
are lost in the curtains of Maya.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:14.860
Today I am going to tell you how we get to
that Spirit.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:30.791
There are two types of methods people employ
in finding out that Spirit.

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:38.731
One is called as anuvopai, and another one
is called as shaktopai.

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.291
‘Anu’ means a molecule.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:59.151
When we are lost in the Maya, as I had told
you last time, actually the Spirit is eternal,

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.421
It is all-powerful.

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:09.760
It never loses Its power whether we are old,
young, whatever condition we may be, the Spirit

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.391
has Its own power, all the time.

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:23.311
But, the reflection of the Spirit in us, the
light of the Spirit in us, depends on the

00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.811
quality of our reflector, how we are.

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:37.510
And because of the quality being so poor sometimes,
darkness is created within us and in that

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:52.211
darkness, we do not know sometimes, even to
that extent, that there is something beyond.

00:01:52.211 --> 00:02:01.321
So the first style of seeking is anuvopai
as you call it, which is depending on separating

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:06.231
molecules after molecules.

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:12.721
Because under these circumstances, when you
are surrounded by darkness, you see Spirit

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:17.621
just as a molecule or you can say a spark
or a flicker.

00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:21.761
Sometimes you just get a flicker of it.

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:25.451
As you know the thoughts arise within us and
fade away.

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:29.851
We see the thoughts rising and fading away.

00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:32.821
And there are many thoughts all around us.

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:38.841
Our attention is on those thoughts, moving
all the time.

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:45.431
It is very hard to find that space in between
two thoughts, that’s why what we see is

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:54.091
just a flicker, you can call it, or a little
atom of that Spirit, sometimes sparkling.

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:57.071
And then the search starts among human beings.

00:02:57.071 --> 00:03:05.311
From that darkness, from Tamoguna they start
searching and the kriya (action) starts within

00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:06.311
us.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:18.321
So we can see in the left hand side as you
see the Ida Nadi, by which we live in Tamoguna,

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:30.451
in desiring for it, and then we move to the
right hand side, on the Pingala Nadi, in which

00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:36.801
we act.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:42.121
In that action we try to find the Spirit.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:54.481
Of course, first we think it is in getting
material advancement that you will find that

00:03:54.481 --> 00:04:02.581
Spirit, that flicker, and so we go in for
material advancement.

00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:12.251
Now, material advancement is very different
from the spiritual advancement.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:20.711
Or we can say the material happening, what
we see, like a plane landing or a plane taking

00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:33.320
off or a collision of two trains or any such
happenings are outside and spiritual happening

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:40.341
is within.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:47.871
Our attention is always attracted towards
outside happenings and it is an impossibility

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:56.271
to take this attention inside.

00:04:56.271 --> 00:05:05.771
That is why something has to happen within
us to attract that attention inside.

00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:18.051
We cannot force our attention inside, so people
try, normally, the anuvopai is that what you

00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:29.140
call Ashtanga Yoga and other Yogas, by which
they try separating themselves from myth,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:45.821
from darkness; for which you need very astute,
honest, sincere people, very young celibate,

00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:52.320
innocent people, those who have to live in
the forest with their Gurus.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.970
So they keep out their attention, which is
called as nirodha (restraint).

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.831
They stop their attention spreading itself.

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:10.211
They concentrate their attention with the
help of a Realised soul.

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:17.401
If you come to India you’ll meet some real
sages like that who live on top of hills and

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:20.591
mountains, who are not easily available to
people.

00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:27.281
They do not sell their religion or they do
not sell their Realisation to people.

00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.890
Hidden away from the madding crowd, they exist
there.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:38.530
One of them has told someone, some Sahaja
Yogis that he has practiced anuvopai for twenty-one

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.470
thousand years from when he was just a frog!

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:52.320
It’s fantastic that he carried on for twenty-one
thousand years, every year, life, he was born

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.662
and still he cannot raise the Kundalini of
others very easily!

00:06:57.662 --> 00:07:06.590
Still he does not have the power to raise
the Kundalini the way you Sahaja Yogis can

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.590
raise!

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.560
It’s most surprising!

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.480
He has given Realisation to only one person,
only one.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.161
In twenty five years he worked on him; the
same way, anuvopai.

00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:20.810
These are the people who are detached, veetragas.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:29.390
Not that you have to run way from anywhere,
but living in the society only you can achieve

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.420
it through our Sahaja Yoga or Mahayoga.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.880
This is shaktopai.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:44.910
But these people still are afraid to come
in the cities because they could not make

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:51.720
people understand.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:59.321
They do not trust human beings and they want
to keep away from them.

00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:00.321
They are not married.

00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:01.611
They lead a celibate life.

00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:05.920
They live up to two hundred years sometimes,
sometimes a thousand years also.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:15.091
But it is a very individualistic movement,
works on one or two people.

00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:17.311
Births after births they cleansed themselves.

00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:20.040
This is anuvopai.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:26.361
So the search for the Divine or for the Spirit
has been on for ages now, it’s not a new

00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:29.910
thing that we are doing here.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:38.541
And you also have been seeking that Divine
in your previous lives and many lives before.

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:44.041
But you must know that for seeking you have
to go inside.

00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:45.861
It’s not outside.

00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:51.431
And how do you go inside?

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.221
Is the problem.

00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.071
Some people say that if you go on suggesting,
“I’m going inside,” you go inside.

00:08:57.071 --> 00:09:10.140
It’s all imagination, because when the attention
is out, the knower and the knowledge, both

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.991
are different.

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.001
Like if I see this thing now, for example,
if I am not a Realised soul, I’ll see this

00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:20.791
one and I will just think, “How much they
must have paid for it?

00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:23.121
What is it made of?

00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:24.131
From where did they get it?”

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:27.270
All sorts of these superficial things as you
can call it.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.280
At the most somebody might say, “It’s
very aesthetically placed and it has very

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.261
great balance,” and all that.

00:09:33.261 --> 00:09:34.481
At the most!

00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:44.121
But it is all outside, because the knower
who knows about it is outside the knowledge.

00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:57.780
So there’s a tremendous difference between
the happening outside and happening inside.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:03.280
When you see a train colliding you will say,
“Oh, look at this!

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.881
What is this they have done?

00:10:04.881 --> 00:10:09.981
This driver is wrong!” and that, “These
people have suffered so much,” and all sorts

00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:10.981
of things.

00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.981
You’ll start collecting money.

00:10:11.981 --> 00:10:14.871
Whatever we do normally, you see.

00:10:14.871 --> 00:10:24.431
But the knowledge about it is outside the
knower that is your Self.

00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:35.111
But when the spiritual happening takes place
the knowledge and the knower become one.

00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:46.561
For example now this machine that is here,
to a normal person as I told you will be,

00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.820
“It is so much, it costs so much,” or
whatever it is, you see.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:53.890
But to a Realised soul it would be, “Is
it vibrating?

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.211
Is it emitting vibrations?

00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:59.501
What sort of vibrations is it emitting?

00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:02.161
It is good or bad?”

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:08.241
Because then you start understanding it according
to spiritual value and not according to material

00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:09.551
value.

00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:11.761
I hope you understand this point.

00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.571
Spiritual value is an absolute value.

00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:24.131
And what is the measure of that is the spiritual
joy.

00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:30.640
The vibrations give you spiritual joy – the
good vibrations, I mean.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.971
What are good vibrations?

00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:38.901
Are nothing but the coefficience (sic) of
this whole thing is emitting through it, the

00:11:38.901 --> 00:11:45.011
All Pervading Power, which is giving you joy.

00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:47.981
It is an absolute value.

00:11:47.981 --> 00:11:54.971
You take ten children who are Realised souls:
you tie their eyes and ask them to put their

00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:56.320
hands towards one person.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.001
All of them will show you the same finger,
which is burning; whichever is the chakra

00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:05.221
they are catching.

00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:10.566
There will be no confusion, no second opinion
about it, no quarrelling, because that’s

00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:21.460
what it is, because the knower and the knowledge
is the same.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.711
That is why when our attention is outside
and we are seeking something or knowing something,

00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:37.780
then we start seeing it according to our thinking
and who does the thinking is Mr. Ego or maybe

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.780
Superego.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:47.020
We are not there to think about it, so anything
you give them, say for example you marry two

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:51.861
persons in modern times.

00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:55.411
So they’ll sit down and work it out.

00:12:55.411 --> 00:12:59.601
How can you work out a marriage with your
brains?

00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:00.741
It’s a question of your heart.

00:13:00.741 --> 00:13:01.741
Just enjoy it.

00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:06.210
You give them food, they’ll sit down and
work it out, start analysing it.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.020
They cannot synthesise it.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.411
The food will get cold, it will lose all its
taste and the whole thing will be wasted.

00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:16.890
They make the same thing out of their lives.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.971
For nothing at all they create problems by
thinking.

00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:29.101
Analysis starts outside, synthesis starts
inside.

00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:36.351
Now this nirodha is the withdrawing of your
attention inside as I told you is only possible

00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:37.541
through a happening within.

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:42.030
Now how do you get the happening within yourself?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.520
For example, I am talking to you, you are
paying attention to Me: supposing something

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.991
falls down, immediately your attention goes
to that happening.

00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:53.481
So there has to be some happening within.

00:13:53.481 --> 00:14:01.561
Now, what is that happening, is Kundalini
Yoga, and this Kundalini Yoga is the shaktopai,

00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:07.641
is the, is known as shaktipath, is the giving
of the Shakti.

00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:13.510
Very few are entitled with this, I mean today
these are all selling ‘shaktis’ there.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:19.361
There have their ashramas, and this that,
they are talking of shakti, when that people

00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:23.491
start dancing, jumping, screaming like possessed
people.

00:14:23.491 --> 00:14:26.400
That is not Shakti at all.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:37.320
Only a person of a very high quality can raise
the Kundalini because he is to be authorised

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.330
by God.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:49.381
It’s a very rare thing to give Realisation
to people.

00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:58.551
Only such people who have been authorised
by God can just move the Kundalini straight

00:14:58.551 --> 00:14:59.971
forward.

00:14:59.971 --> 00:15:12.331
So the anuvopai is a very slow action, is
for few individuals who get out of this maya,

00:15:12.331 --> 00:15:19.440
this illusion and tell people that, “This
is all illusion, is a mirage, you are running

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.440
after a mirage.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.150
Don’t run after this mirage.”

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.111
But still, people can’t believe them.

00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:32.291
They crucify them, they poison them, they
beat them, they do all kinds of things to

00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:33.330
them.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:39.231
I mean, they did not do any harm to anyone
whatsoever that they should be treated so

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:45.580
badly by human beings.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:56.821
So, it is to be understood that your attention
has to be sucked in.

00:15:56.821 --> 00:16:03.181
The nirodha has to work out.

00:16:03.181 --> 00:16:06.080
Not by denying things, “Don’t look at
the women.”

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.241
“Don’t look at the gold.”

00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:11.311
“Don’t look at things, your attention
will be spoiled.”

00:16:11.311 --> 00:16:12.541
Not by those methods.

00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:18.570
Or by taking you to the jungles, leading you
a celibate life, making a very holy atmosphere

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:25.701
around and just forcing you that you do not
see that [which] is evil.

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:32.491
But when you see it again you go back to the
same!

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.840
There’s no immunity developed.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:44.991
So the attention when it’s sucked in by
Kundalini rising, the first thing you notice

00:16:44.991 --> 00:16:48.530
is that there is dilatation of the pupil.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.450
Now, dilatation of the pupil will cause a
kind of a blindness, normally.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.680
There was a lady doctor who had come for her
Realisation to me once and I tried to raise

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.771
her Kundalini, it wouldn’t go beyond Agya.

00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:08.090
While she was driving suddenly she felt that
her eyes were dilating and she couldn’t

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:14.631
see, so she took her car on one side and she
said , “For about a minute I just could

00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:16.611
not see anything, I was quite worried.

00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:20.471
I felt my dilatation of the pupil is taking
place and I was worried about it that how

00:17:20.471 --> 00:17:21.471
I’ve become blind.”

00:17:21.471 --> 00:17:27.681
And then again she got back but when she went
back, she was seeing much better and there

00:17:27.681 --> 00:17:32.011
was a sparkle in her eyes, eyes were sparkling.

00:17:32.011 --> 00:17:34.711
She telephoned to me, she said , “Does it
happen?”

00:17:34.711 --> 00:17:36.091
I said , “Yes.”

00:17:36.091 --> 00:17:44.261
To attract your attention from outside inward,
Kundalini does that to you, that She dilates

00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.081
your pupil.

00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:52.881
Now the doctors may come on my head and say
that it is a parasympathetic or a sympathetic

00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:53.881
action.

00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:54.881
They do not know, they have not yet decided.

00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:57.591
It’s the action of Kundalini.

00:17:57.591 --> 00:18:01.810
They don’t know about Kundalini.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.030
Even if you show them pulsating they will
not believe it.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.560
They don’t want to believe it.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.751
They want to remain outside, in ignorance.

00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:11.081
All of them are like that.

00:18:11.081 --> 00:18:16.791
Now, everybody is saying that now outside
battles are over, we have to have battle inside,

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.351
we have to fight ourselves.

00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:25.521
Anywhere you go they will say that, “We
must find our wholesomeness.”

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.910
Oh, big lectures you know!

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.670
Conferences after conferences people are talking
so big!

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.290
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:39.741
But when it comes to reality that you can
have it, it’s a very slow movement [but]

00:18:39.741 --> 00:18:41.071
still better than anuvopai!

00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:51.471
By anuvopai [those] who are living in the
city they will not reach anywhere, they cannot.

00:18:51.471 --> 00:18:55.751
If you try to do all those things, if you
do not have a Realised soul as your guru and

00:18:55.751 --> 00:19:02.101
also the atmosphere, either you’ll get into
ego or into superego; you’ll have a problem

00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:11.261
there, either onto to the left or onto the
right.

00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:14.491
Supposing you tell them , “Now, don’t
drink, don’t smoke!”

00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:17.971
Immediately you will get conditioned and Mr.
Freud will stand up and say, “See, you are

00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.290
conditioned, you should have all the freedom!”

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.290
Alright.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.231
So you go ahead [and] do whatever you please.

00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:29.660
So your Mr. Ego will become like a big balloon
on your head if you do whatever you please.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.041
And then you have a big forehead coming out,
eating everyone out like that.

00:19:34.041 --> 00:19:40.310
(laughing) And I have given a nice speech
on Mr. Ego, how it tries to strangle everyone

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.071
and how we are raising against everyone.

00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:49.540
This Mr. Ego gives us the feeling that we
are something and that is the one which keeps

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.511
us in bondage of ignorance.

00:19:52.511 --> 00:19:58.481
And it’s like, I sometimes feel, like the
fist of a boxer!

00:19:58.481 --> 00:20:02.991
Anybody tries to go near it, it gives you
a bang back!

00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.141
Anybody tries to say anything about it, it
will come out with a big bang on your head.

00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:13.331
So if you do not pay attention to your ego
and say, “No, no, no, no, I must not eat

00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:15.991
this, I must not do this, I must not do that,”
finished!

00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:19.761
You go onto the left hand side and then you
get the conditioning and then you may fall

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:23.821
into the traps of Mr. Rajneesh or someone
like that, who is conditioning you.

00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:26.371
And you cannot get out of it.

00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:34.211
You try your level best, you cannot get out
of it, because they entrap you with their

00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:38.800
hypnosis, you go into your superego, you are
hypnotised, you are possessed and whatever

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.771
you may try, all such people are very difficult
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:51.430
They think I don’t know what they are doing,
but it is not my knowing, it is your knowing

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.430
is the point.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.660
The loser is within you, and the winner is
also within you.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.231
It is you [who] have to gain, not me.

00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:02.991
Sahaja Yoga is not for me at all.

00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:05.341
I don’t have to do it.

00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:13.160
It is for you to do it to gain that knowledge
which is your Self.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:21.060
Only thing I can do is the Shakti path but
actually I don’t do it either, I can tell

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.060
you.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.060
I don’t do anything.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.060
I’m just sitting quiet.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.300
It just emits, what can I do?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.871
That’s my nature, it just flows.

00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.800
It works out that way.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.841
But, because of our ego, we want all challenges.

00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:46.650
Supposing I tell you tomorrow that, “You
can only get it by jumping hundred times,”

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.731
you will immediately start doing that!

00:21:47.731 --> 00:21:57.900
If I tell you, say, on another sort of a efficiency
trip, that, “Supposing you do a hundred

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:04.871
jumps in five minutes, you will get it faster,”
you will do that.

00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:13.141
Or else I give you another kind of a pralobhan
(प्रलोभन) as they call it, a

00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:14.141
temptation.

00:22:14.141 --> 00:22:20.310
Like you put five rupees today then I say,
“No, no, you better put ten rupees,” and

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.310
you put that.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.951
It’s like a running a horse, race.

00:22:24.951 --> 00:22:31.001
See how superficially we look at this.

00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:34.930
In this superficiality we are going to get
lost completely.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:41.641
If you are really seeking then you find it
and be there and get it!

00:22:41.641 --> 00:22:46.321
This is your own!

00:22:46.321 --> 00:22:50.711
We talk big; I find very – I mean I meet
the people who are the cream of every nation,

00:22:50.711 --> 00:22:58.111
I should say, and they are creaming each other,
that’s all!

00:22:58.111 --> 00:23:01.801
Nothing more than that.

00:23:01.801 --> 00:23:06.410
They do not want to go deeper into it and
talking about, “Oh, we understand.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.031
There has to be a Messiah.

00:23:08.031 --> 00:23:10.891
There has to be [that] something must happen
to us.”

00:23:10.891 --> 00:23:12.581
“We should all become wholesome.”

00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:16.861
Now they are finding fanaticism is troubling
them so they are saying, “No, these fanatics

00:23:16.861 --> 00:23:18.400
are there.”

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.461
And we are all fanatics when we are outside.

00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:29.790
I mean, if you ask me, they look like mad
people to me.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.560
Such extremists!

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.101
All [their] attention outside.

00:23:35.101 --> 00:23:39.150
And an arrangement has been made within you,
as I told you, of Kundalini being placed at

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:40.560
the triangular bone there.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.191
It’s so beautiful it is constructed, just
see the beauty of the Kundalini.

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:50.941
Even in seeking we have gone all out to torture
our Kundalini.

00:23:50.941 --> 00:23:59.310
We are not honest to ourselves and to our
Mother, the Kundalini, the One who is sitting

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:05.941
there for us to give us our Realisation, our
re-birth.

00:24:05.941 --> 00:24:10.851
She is there, you can see for yourself with
your naked eyes.

00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:14.601
For example, one of the Sahaja Yogis who is
a doctor went and talked to the doctors.

00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:15.920
I said, “Now, what are they doing?”

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.891
They said, “Yes, we know, we got the cool
breeze in the hand, alright.”

00:24:20.891 --> 00:24:21.891
“Then?”

00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:26.241
“And yes we see, we know there is something
pulsating in the triangular bone.”

00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:27.241
“Then?

00:24:27.241 --> 00:24:30.861
Does not intrigue you?”

00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:38.251
“But still, how can that be Self Realisation?”

00:24:38.251 --> 00:24:53.221
I mean, it is beyond any one to drink water
for others and digest it and enjoy it.

00:24:53.221 --> 00:25:01.241
You can take somebody to the water, make them
drink, push them down into it, but if they

00:25:01.241 --> 00:25:05.560
just refuse then what can you do about it?

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.881
And then they will come out of it and have
a big conference: “It’s a big conference.

00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:12.151
Having, a big, big conferences!”

00:25:12.151 --> 00:25:13.151
Halls they’ll fill up!

00:25:13.151 --> 00:25:14.461
And what are they discussing?

00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:21.941
How to know that you are a part of the one
living organism!

00:25:21.941 --> 00:25:28.391
Again you take out some books, read here,
have a big discussion, have a big party out

00:25:28.391 --> 00:25:30.661
of that and finished.

00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:39.050
This ‘Sunday School’ seeking, is not going
to help us.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:47.310
First thing we have to be genuine about it
that we want to seek it.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:58.650
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, those who have
advanced, those who have really worked genuinely,

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:14.651
without paying attention outside, have been
able to know the Divine, to enjoy It and to

00:26:14.651 --> 00:26:16.170
give It to others.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:25.631
But anywhere in life you see, without genuineness,
what are you going to achieve?

00:26:25.631 --> 00:26:29.971
It’s like some mad man who’s a Liaison
Officer, you see.

00:26:29.971 --> 00:26:31.471
Imagine what a job and a half!

00:26:31.471 --> 00:26:35.821
He’s a Liaison Officer, so he is running
with the flowers for one person, another for

00:26:35.821 --> 00:26:37.381
another person, he doesn’t know who is coming.

00:26:37.381 --> 00:26:41.761
He may give flowers to somebody else, all
sorts of madness.

00:26:41.761 --> 00:26:47.131
In the same way, we are like Liaison Officers,
without any feelings within our heart.

00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:53.280
But with this happening you start feeling
the other within you.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.381
You start feeling.

00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:58.060
It’s an actualisation, as I told you last
time.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:04.160
And when that actualisation takes place the
only thing you have to do, is to allow it

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:11.300
to grow, because it has happened spontaneously
without your effort being put into it and

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.481
it is going to work out spontaneously.

00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:21.140
Only don’t stop its progress by your own
ego and your own style of looking at things.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:29.040
You cannot make a career out of it or a business.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.181
It is to be enjoyed!

00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:35.761
Now I am surprised how human beings are not
selling their children.

00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:38.401
I mean they are selling everything.

00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:47.571
They are selling their hair, nose, eyes, everything
that is possible under the sun, blood.

00:27:47.571 --> 00:28:00.731
But the source of all the joy that is within
you is in the heart pulsating.

00:28:00.731 --> 00:28:06.701
That is called as the pranashakti, is the
pulsating power of the Spirit within you,

00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:13.991
which is just to be enlightened so [that]
the whole attention gets enlightened.

00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:20.930
And the difference between an ordinary awareness,
where the knower and the knowledge are two

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:28.060
different things and an enlightened awareness,
where both become one, it is tremendous!

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:34.941
But nobody wants to practice it and see for
yourself how dynamic it is!

00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:42.531
This is what the whole world is seeking today,
this is what we are talking about and that

00:28:42.531 --> 00:28:50.601
is how the supply department from India for
all the kinds of thugs are coming here!

00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:57.091
So it’s a big circus going on everywhere!

00:28:57.091 --> 00:29:03.300
Do you want to also run in the same circus?

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.671
I mean, it is not to please me, sir, but is
to please your Self.

00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:13.800
Because it is only the spiritual value of
everything whatsoever is going to give you

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.680
joy, nothing else.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.501
Let the awakening take place.

00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:26.321
Give some time to it.

00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:28.851
You have problems, the Kundalini rises, alright.

00:29:28.851 --> 00:29:32.520
It touches the Sahastrara, that’s also correct.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.351
But many people they say, “Mother, when
it has touched, why should it fall?”

00:29:36.351 --> 00:29:38.170
Now, it’s not my fault.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.170
Mine does not fall.

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:46.231
It falls because of your faults, whatever
you have done to yourself.

00:29:46.231 --> 00:29:49.280
The Kundalini has to supply, she has to look
after you.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.670
You have been so cruel to yourself or to others,
whatever you have done.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.481
You have done all wrong things so far, so
Kundalini falls.

00:29:57.481 --> 00:30:00.761
Let Her look after all these things.

00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.821
She knows you have a problem.

00:30:04.821 --> 00:30:09.810
But if you are not genuine, she knows also
that you are not genuine.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:16.601
She’ll just disappear into your Mooladhara
there in the triangular bone and will never

00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:17.601
rise.

00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:20.031
She’ll be very badly frozen.

00:30:20.031 --> 00:30:26.780
When you start thinking about the Kundalini,
you just close her completely there and she

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.780
just goes down.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.761
She sees, “This man doesn’t know anything.

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:36.511
He’ll have to take another ten births perhaps
to get his Kundalini again back in place.”

00:30:36.511 --> 00:30:43.221
But with some people it comes up and stays
there.

00:30:43.221 --> 00:30:46.051
You must respect it.

00:30:46.051 --> 00:30:47.831
You must value it.

00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:54.581
If you value that, you have valued yourself
and nobody else.

00:30:54.581 --> 00:31:02.701
By crucifying Christ, you cannot reduce his
value by any chance.

00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:08.420
You have crucified yourself by that, when
you crucified you.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:13.731
So the good time is coming, Christmas ahead.

00:31:13.731 --> 00:31:19.441
Let Christ be born within us on our Agya here
in the crossing point.

00:31:19.441 --> 00:31:31.020
Let us remember all these great incarnations
and prophets who came on this earth, who lived

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:38.921
like us, like ordinary human beings, in the
most ordinary way.

00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:41.040
They led a very ordinary simple life.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.530
Some of them married also, had children.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.530
Why?

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:56.941
They could have lived on the hills and mountains
very easily avoiding all the nonsense.

00:31:56.941 --> 00:32:09.821
No, they did come to give you a milestone
in your achievement of your evolution, and

00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:18.351
this is what is the evolution, the Maha Yoga,
where you become one with the Spirit.

00:32:18.351 --> 00:32:26.141
All the rest is useless, of no value.

00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:32.581
Spirit is your Self, is you.

00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:40.451
You are identified with your ego, so you want
to always satisfy your ego, “I like it.”

00:32:40.451 --> 00:32:48.651
“I like it,” means Mr. Ego likes it, really,
most of the time.

00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:52.691
And the Self doesn’t say , “I like it.”

00:32:52.691 --> 00:32:55.280
It feels it.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.121
It feels within Itself.

00:33:00.121 --> 00:33:02.540
It’s absolute.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.900
This is the shaktopai, which many people are
practicing.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.071
I haven’t come across even one genuine person
who does this, so far.

00:33:12.071 --> 00:33:17.121
I mean we had: Nanaka was there, Kabira was
there, we had in India – great people.

00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:25.081
And they have talked about these fake people.

00:33:25.081 --> 00:33:32.660
Even in the anuvopai, also Kundalini has to
rise in any case!

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.241
It has happened in the case of Buddha and
Mahavira.

00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:41.300
But I told you that they were the children
of Rama and thousands of years later, they

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:48.041
got their Realisation, and they are like incarnations
only, you can say, but they are different

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:49.041
styles.

00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:53.141
We have no time to waste now.

00:33:53.141 --> 00:34:01.051
This is the Last Judgment where we have to
give up all our nonsensical ideas.

00:34:01.051 --> 00:34:09.640
You see, it’s difficult to talk to people
who have made business out of God, or some

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:17.191
sort of a political issue out of a God.

00:34:17.191 --> 00:34:21.752
But sensible people should know that they
have to know themselves first of all, they

00:34:21.752 --> 00:34:29.061
have to become themselves and then they will
know that they are really a part and parcel

00:34:29.061 --> 00:34:37.231
of the whole, of the Viraat, the Akbar.

00:34:37.231 --> 00:34:42.831
You cannot know religion from outside like
these people are saying, “Allah ho Akbar,

00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:46.241
Allah ho Akbar,” and killing you!

00:34:46.241 --> 00:34:51.370
Or sitting in the Church and, “Let’s us
sing hymn number such and such.”

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:58.781
Or in our temples selling all kinds of drugs.

00:34:58.781 --> 00:35:09.871
That’s why this contrast one doesn’t understand
how religious people could be like that.

00:35:09.871 --> 00:35:18.771
And then you get some nice people, ‘gentlemen’,
you know, ‘very good people’.

00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:19.851
Useless!

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:24.603
“Oh, they are very good,” alright, what
will they do?

00:35:24.603 --> 00:35:33.631
They’ll make some bridges or may have some
tunnels or may do some creative work of writing

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:36.741
some novels or something.

00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:41.921
But still the knower and the knowledge is
separated in them.

00:35:41.921 --> 00:35:48.840
They are useless to themselves, I am saying,
not to others.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.491
And the confusion has to go by achieving your
absolute.

00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:58.021
But all the time our attention is outside
criticising others or finding faults with

00:35:58.021 --> 00:36:02.251
others or some sort of a trivial thing.

00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:11.881
All this sounds so trivial in this world,
the way we are wasting our energy.

00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:25.360
Here is the store within us of our own earnings,
of our own punyas by which you have to get

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:36.340
that [which] is promised to you and to enjoy
that and here is the key for you!

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:44.021
Keep your minds open and take in, have it,
it’s a gift.

00:36:44.021 --> 00:36:48.870
As you yourself know that – you have got
so many gifts from God.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:52.801
How is it you have become a human being?

00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:54.571
What have you done to become a human being?

00:36:54.571 --> 00:37:04.161
This is a gift of God, this beautiful human
body, mind, everything you have got it.

00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:15.610
And now that gift itself is going to transform
you into the greatest of greatest gift – is

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.541
to know your Father.

00:37:18.541 --> 00:37:26.691
The One who has created you is anxious to
bestow all His powers to you, like a father

00:37:26.691 --> 00:37:28.101
wants to bestow all his property.

00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:36.201
So take it with both the hands and have it,
and enjoy it.

00:37:36.201 --> 00:37:44.511
Before Realisation, I do not tell you that
you give up drinking, smoking or any kind

00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:45.511
of nirodh.

00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:50.580
No, I cannot ask you to do that.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:58.330
But after Realisation, jolly well you give
it up, you just do it, because you now taste

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.641
the ambrosia, the amruta.

00:38:01.641 --> 00:38:05.080
Then you don’t want to have anything else.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:13.151
But, till you have tasted it, give some time,
have some patience.

00:38:13.151 --> 00:38:17.061
You need not be very well educated for this.

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:22.461
You need not have a very good practice of
say, standing on your heads!

00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:27.421
You need not be going to churches or anything.

00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:30.501
If you are a normal human being, it is going
to work out.

00:38:30.501 --> 00:38:35.621
But mostly, when we do all these things, we
are abnormal.

00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:41.161
Even in saying that we are seeking God, we
are doing lots of abnormal things.

00:38:41.161 --> 00:38:43.411
We have to be absolutely normal.

00:38:43.411 --> 00:38:47.820
It is like this room being dark, you are sitting
down here, now sit down!

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.201
It’s going to work out.

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:52.241
But we start jumping here and there and we
get hurt.

00:38:52.241 --> 00:39:01.921
It’s like going in a boat: just keep quiet,
just be in the centre, with the centre of

00:39:01.921 --> 00:39:03.251
gravity of the boat.

00:39:03.251 --> 00:39:04.671
Just be there!

00:39:04.671 --> 00:39:07.321
That is dharma.

00:39:07.321 --> 00:39:13.971
In your sustenance, stay there.

00:39:13.971 --> 00:39:17.951
I mean to remain good, you don’t have to
do anything.

00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:25.921
I mean to become bad, you have to do something,
isn’t it?

00:39:25.921 --> 00:39:35.580
All these things will come to you automatically
when there is light.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.610
Just be quiet.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:42.781
All of you are going to get it.

00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:49.311
That is being ordained, that’s being arranged,
organised, very well within you, beautifully.

00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:58.321
As in a seed everything is arranged, to create
a tree, it’s arranged within you.

00:39:58.321 --> 00:40:12.921
But you have to be together, work it out,
understand each other and this group grows

00:40:12.921 --> 00:40:29.370
in that understanding, in collectivity, and
creates a nucleus for others to follow it.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:43.471
So, there should be no problem for you to
understand that it is a special grace.

00:40:43.471 --> 00:40:53.081
Because you are special, maybe I am also special,
and special people needed somebody special,

00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:55.100
so I had to come down here!

00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:02.501
Let’s have it in a mutual admiration way,
will be a good idea.

00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:08.411
There is no need to feel obliged because I
have to do it.

00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:18.491
I feel loaded with it and I feel lighter when
you get it.

00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:25.031
Like a mother I tell you.

00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:28.060
Sometimes I have to be stern.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.021
I know the job of a mother.

00:41:33.021 --> 00:41:38.001
You need not be afraid of me at all.

00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:43.151
I know everything about you, somehow.

00:41:43.151 --> 00:41:48.291
Like we had one Douglas (Fry) with us and
I suddenly asked him, “What about your birthday?”

00:41:48.291 --> 00:41:49.330
He was taken aback!

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:53.810
He didn’t know – he’s sitting here – how
I knew that his birthday was there.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.161
And he really had a rebirth from the life
he had.

00:41:57.161 --> 00:42:00.141
And when I said, he said , “How do You know,
Mother?”

00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:01.791
I said , “I know what about your birthday.”

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:04.851
And I went to his house and saw him.

00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:11.451
[I was] so overjoyed to see him settled down.

00:42:11.451 --> 00:42:20.651
It is amazing how your seed grows and how
fragrant you become.

00:42:20.651 --> 00:42:24.881
May God bless you all.

00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:34.381
If you have any questions, please ask me.

00:42:34.381 --> 00:42:49.080
We have little time.

00:42:49.080 --> 00:43:04.031
There are eighty-four tapes already with these
people and, if you want to have tapes for

00:43:04.031 --> 00:43:23.340
yourself, you can give them the tapes and
they can tape for you or perhaps…

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:52.961
Those who do not feel vibration should not
get upset.

00:43:52.961 --> 00:43:54.320
There’s something wrong somewhere.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.671
I may not tell you on your face, because I
don’t want to hurt you in any way.

00:43:58.671 --> 00:44:02.831
But doesn’t matter, I am going to work it
out, you see, doctor doesn’t come and tell

00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:09.221
you that, “You have got all these diseases
and you may die next moment.”

00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:12.091
If doctor can do that, I am after all your
Mother, so I am not going to tell you.

00:44:12.091 --> 00:44:20.161
You yourself will know, later on, what was
wrong with you.

00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:23.641
Because by knowing that, you are not going
to help yourself.

00:44:23.641 --> 00:44:30.671
On the contrary, you are going to feel dejected.

00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:40.641
Now please put your hands just like this,
just like this.

00:44:40.641 --> 00:44:43.001
And both the feet on the ground, straight.

00:44:43.001 --> 00:44:47.641
On the ground.

00:44:47.641 --> 00:44:53.731
I think perhaps next Monday is the last meeting,
is it?

00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:55.120
Two more?

00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:01.131
You are going to have me till the the end
is it?

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.131
Alright!

00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:05.991
So I was thinking of, next Monday, I’ll
be telling about elements and all those things

00:45:05.991 --> 00:45:06.991
how we are made.

00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:07.991
That would be better.

00:45:07.991 --> 00:45:08.991
Now close your eyes please.

00:45:08.991 --> 00:45:49.761
If you watch your thoughts you’ll find there
are no thoughts.

00:45:49.761 --> 00:46:07.711
Keep your eyes shut.

00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:16.681
Just see.

00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:48.100
There are no thoughts in your mind.

00:46:48.100 --> 00:47:41.951
Now, in your finger tips you’ll feel a cool
breeze coming in.

00:47:41.951 --> 00:48:05.702
That means the Realisation has taken place
because the cool breeze is the sign of the

00:48:05.702 --> 00:48:13.741
Holy Ghost, in Sanskrit it is, “salilam,
salilam,” described that the Spirit emits

00:48:13.741 --> 00:48:31.620
or radiates, you can say, Itself as cool breeze.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.261
The light of the Spirit is the cool breeze.

00:48:36.261 --> 00:48:38.761
Power of God.

00:48:38.761 --> 00:48:55.841
It’s a breeze like thing which starts floating
or going inside your…If any one of you are

00:48:55.841 --> 00:49:01.181
feeling sleepy, keep your eyes open please.

00:49:01.181 --> 00:49:03.511
Be alert.

00:49:03.511 --> 00:49:13.221
You have to be alert because this is the happening
for which you have been desiring.

00:49:13.221 --> 00:49:17.781
See for yourself.

00:49:17.781 --> 00:49:22.931
The more desirous you are the better it is.

00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:35.401
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

00:49:35.401 --> 00:49:36.401
Good.

00:49:36.401 --> 00:49:37.401
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

00:49:37.401 --> 00:49:38.401
All those who are getting cool breeze, please
raise your hands, all of you.

00:49:38.401 --> 00:49:39.401
All those who are getting cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:40.401
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

00:49:40.401 --> 00:49:41.401
Now those who have come today and not yet
Realised and are not getting cool breeze,

00:49:41.401 --> 00:49:42.401
please raise your hands.

00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:43.401
Can you come forward?

00:49:43.401 --> 00:49:44.401
Keep your eyes shut, please.

00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:45.401
That lady?

00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:46.401
You’re getting the cool breeze in the hands?

00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:47.401
Are you feeling any cool breeze?

00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:48.401
Lady: Not so much.

00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:49.401
Shri Mataji: Not so much?

00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:50.401
So you started thinking about it, that’s
all.

00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:51.401
Alright.

00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:52.401
So for that you ask for forgiveness, that,
“I should not think about it,” and it

00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:53.401
will start flowing.

00:49:53.401 --> 00:49:54.401
Alright?

00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:55.401
By thinking you did not get it.

00:49:55.401 --> 00:49:56.401
So, it’s alright now.

00:49:56.401 --> 00:49:57.401
Good!

00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:58.401
See how clever it is!

00:49:58.401 --> 00:49:59.401
Still wearing that?

00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:00.401
What is that?

00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:01.401
Now see him what’s the matter.

00:50:01.401 --> 00:50:02.401
On the heart he is catching.

00:50:02.401 --> 00:50:03.401
Now, better now ? It plays tricks.

00:50:03.401 --> 00:50:04.401
John, see here, this side.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.401
Don’t watch others at this time.

00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:06.401
You watch yourself, alright?

00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:07.401
Very important.

00:50:07.401 --> 00:50:08.401
You catch people.

00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:09.401
Just don’t watch.

00:50:09.401 --> 00:50:10.401
Watch yourself.

00:50:10.401 --> 00:50:11.401
This is the time to watch yourself, alright?

00:50:11.401 --> 00:50:12.401

00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:13.401

00:50:17.401 --> 00:50:18.401

Just somewhere here.

00:50:21.401 --> 00:50:22.401
Just sit.

00:50:22.401 --> 00:50:23.401
Is that Alan?

00:50:23.401 --> 00:50:24.401
How are you?

00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:25.401
Better now?

00:50:25.401 --> 00:50:26.401
Better?

00:50:26.401 --> 00:50:27.401
Can you come forward.

00:50:27.401 --> 00:50:28.401

Just let me see.

00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.401
I wanted to see your vibrations also.

00:50:30.401 --> 00:50:31.401
Yes, please.

00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:32.401
Come forward.

00:50:32.401 --> 00:50:33.401
Can you take two chairs?

00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:34.401
You must see your vibrations.

00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:35.401
We must get ourselves corrected.

00:50:35.401 --> 00:50:36.401
There may be some sort of a thing because
the vibrations if they are not sucking in

00:50:36.401 --> 00:50:37.401
alright, then there is some problem.

00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:38.401
Let’s get it alright.

00:50:38.401 --> 00:50:39.401
What is there to feel bad about anything whatsoever?

00:50:39.401 --> 00:50:40.401
Well, Alan, just come here, if possible.

00:50:40.401 --> 00:50:41.401
Alright.

00:50:41.401 --> 00:50:42.401
You can take a chair here next to John.

00:50:42.401 --> 00:50:42.407
