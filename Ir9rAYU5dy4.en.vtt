00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.760
So yesterday was a nice day for all of us, and I said something

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.480
of a different level.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.360
We've been talking all the time

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.080
about the mundane things

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.800
and these things sometimes are very ...

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.000
are of so much importance, we think.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.760
But when I talked to you yesterday,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.000
I hope you all realized

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.280
that we have to now jump into

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.280
another realm of a subtler understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.480
First we are worried about

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.880
our families, our children,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.200
our households;

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.680
then, our marriages.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360
One after another all these questions came up,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.200
and we were concerned about all these things;

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.000
little, little things.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.360
Then we also got concerned about the ashrams

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.920
which we were running:

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.000
the problems of the ashram,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.640
what we have been doing,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.400
how we have been facing the problems,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.880
how people are creating problems.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.200
That's how our humanity started

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.400
acquiring a subtler understanding.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.000
And then we also realized that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.040
we are blessed by God,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.160
that there's something great

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.640
that is always looking after us,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.800
some higher Force,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.160
some special Attention is there about us.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.880
This is what we realized.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.400
Today I was explaining how it happens,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.640
that how we realize

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.880
that God is helping us too.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.840
Any problem is an effect of some sort of a cause

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.320
- every problem.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.720
Like Mona wrote a letter that she was driving

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.040
in a motorway

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.480
and the car went out of control,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.320
and the brake would not act.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080
And there was a car coming from the right,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.720
car coming from the left,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.680
cars going through in front and behind.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.120
And she felt that they'll be finished

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.440
- two of them were traveling, two Sahaja yoginis.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.680
So the cause was the car or the brake or whatever it was,

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.240
the mechanism, and the effect was all the problem.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.320
So now, how to overcome that problem?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.800
Supposing you try to neutralize the effect, you cannot,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.680
because cause is still there.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.920
You try to improve the cause, it doesn't work out.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.960
Then what to do?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.120
So the easiest thing is to cross the cause,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.720
to ascend over, to go beyond the cause;

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.800
so the cause does not exist for you,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.960
so the effect does not exist for you.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.560
As long as the cause exists in your attention,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.680
the effect will be there.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.800
So what did she do?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.760
She just prayed to Me, just thought of Me that

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.680
"Mother, now it's my last chance" - that's all.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.000
So the cause disappeared, because you go beyond it.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.160
And the effect also disappeared, and she was surprised.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.760
So you must ascend away from the cause.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.760
Now a problem: "my wife is like this",

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.160
"my husband like this," "my family life is this,"

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.080
"Sahaja yogis are like this" - all kinds of things are there.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.160
It's an effect. Now what's the cause?

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.360
- is such and such person.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.960
All right, now what are we to get - relation of the cause.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.880
Surrender it.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.560
You are, you have the right to do that.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.480
You have a knack to do it, you can do it.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.880
You are capable of it, you are entitled to do it

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640
- but you don't do it, you forget.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.960
You just forget.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.840
If you surrender that cause,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.000
the effects will go away.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.680
But that is the thing at that time to remember,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.200
that you have to ascend.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.880
To go beyond the cause is the best way to get rid of it.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.360
So I've been playing with you.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.800
You had causes to say,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.000
"Oh Mother, this is the problem. I have no job."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400
Now I have a job, then the job is to be hard.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.280
Then the wife is not there, so must have a wife.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.680
The wife has a problem, so she is to be divorced

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.800
- and that and that, and this is that.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.280
Then, "I am like that.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.160
I am very bad because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.080
So the bhoot is the cause.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.800
"And I am behaving like this because there's a bhoot in me."

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.400
That's also a scapegoat, I think.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.200
So first you go beyond that, saying,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.280
"What is bhoot? Who is bhoot?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.040
I know my Mother.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.080
And Mother, You look after this bhoot of mine" - that's all.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.320
But for that an emergency has to come to you,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.400
otherwise you just don't do it, with that power.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.800
When you are in emergent condition,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.920
then it works out faster.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.640
When it is not emergency then it's half-hearted,

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.040
like Mona's condition.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.360
There was another case where a

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.160
journalist was traveling from ...

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.040
or something and his brakes broke down,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.960
and he was with another journalist,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.000
so both of them were coming - this another journalist told me.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.160
The another one was Sahaja yogi.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.480
So he found his brakes are not working

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.840
and he found his car is going,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.120
in front there is a big truck coming up

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.360
and another truck coming from behind.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.960
And there was no way for him to turn or to get out of it,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.760
and his brakes were horrid.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.120
That was a emergency, you see.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.440
Such an emergency that developed into his mind,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.040
that "Oh God, now the last moment has come.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.440
Now we're finished."

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.160
There is a truck coming from there and another truck,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.720
and within a split of a second he was to be finished.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.840
And he just told his friend, "Think of Mother" - that's all.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.960
And what he found, that he was nicely crawling on the road

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.720
and the trucks were left behind, and the brake was working.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.640
But that emergency has to come.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.920
Human beings are such that unless and until

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.040
they are put into tight corners, they never do that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.120
Once they are in a tight corner, then they do it.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.840
That is the reason why people try to take ascetic life,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.240
because if you are an ascetic then you are in a tight corner.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.360
They go to Gobi Desert to create that emergency within you,

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.960
so that you think of God.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.040
But that's too late to go to the Gobi Desert.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.480
They create problems for them to get into tight corners,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.080
so that they can get out of it.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.080
But for Sahaja yogis if they are wise, they need not have.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.000
But how do we achieve it otherwise, without any ... ?

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.400
Only way is meditation.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.080
Everybody must meditate, it's the point.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.200
If you do not meditate, you can continue for a while.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.400
You may be all right for a while

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.120
for two, three months, maybe two years,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.880
but then you drop out.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.600
Many people think, "Oh, what's the need to meditate?

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.000
You see, it's all right.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.200
If we don't meditate, doesn't matter." It's not so.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.920
Because in meditation only you grow.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.200
In emergency you suddenly grow, no doubt.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.800
I mean, you jump like a jack-in-the- box.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.080
You just come up with a spring.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.080
But if you have to have continuous growth

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.200
then you must meditate,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.720
allow the thoughts after thoughts coming,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.720
and then allow them to subside,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.680
because you rise into the state of thoughtless awareness.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And in that thoughtless awareness you grow.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.280
And you grow in your detachment

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.920
to the cause of all the effects.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.720
If there is no cause, there is no effect.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.000
But this is the problem with us,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.080
is that we do not meditate, normally.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.280
Only when it comes to absolute last point,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.240
now you'll have to fall in the well - then we think of it.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.120
Maybe at that moment you are helped,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.080
but you don't grow.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.560
Growth can only come if you meditate.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.560
That is one very important part,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:01.200
is complete help to people who meditate in the normal way.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.000
In the normal life, how do we grow?

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.800
If we have no oxygen, we cannot grow.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.320
We have to have sufficient oxygen,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.120
we have to have sufficient food,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.080
we have to have all these things.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.680
But in spirituality you grow through meditation.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.120
There's no way out.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560
Those who think they can grow are bumptious,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.400
actually bumptious people,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.440
because they can talk a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.000
I have seen people who talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.400
They can give big lectures, this, that,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.080
but have no vibrations at all.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.080
They can't do any work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.280
they are not collective,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.680
they have no sense to be collective,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.240
all kinds of problems.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.000
But the growth is to be achieved through meditation.
