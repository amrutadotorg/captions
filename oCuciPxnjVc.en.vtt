00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.859
Guru Puja.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.930
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:20.300
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:35.730
What does a guru do.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:50.680
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.600
Actually it is all there - everything.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:15.570
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:29.829
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time!

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:30.829
(more laughter).

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.170
It's all contained within you.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:57.210
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.490
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.590
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.560
There is nothing that you get from outside.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:29.780
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:40.739
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:55.200
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.459
That is the first step.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:12.710
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.000
world, this is all an illusion.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.209
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:33.040
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.240
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:49.579
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:59.329
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.700
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.140
to know yourself.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.940
But people get into rituals.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.700
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:33.470
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.220
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:47.700
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.320
Because it is all ignorance.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:05:01.680
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:13.400
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.710
They pamper your ego.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:28.650
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.350
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.940
connection with God, which you are not.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.880
To know God you should know your Self first.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.810
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.690
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:03.230
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.350
The experience is not sufficient.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.040
The knowledge has to come.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.150
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.160
Now you have to tally it.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.200
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.820
Is it true or not?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.440
Is it correct or not?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.600
Or is it just another illusion?

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:46.310
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.600
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:58.861
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

00:06:58.861 --> 00:07:02.870
is something special about you.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:15.760
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:24.750
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:38.140
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:46.780
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:08:01.610
Then what starts is introspection.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:10.640
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.050
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:29.250
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:38.829
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:45.160
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.639
great and they don't need any introspection.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:09:00.269
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:03.980
it Self realisation.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:11.350
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you, how

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:16.970
far you have come.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.529
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:27.709
You can do it later on.

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:31.370
You must hear with full concentration.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:39.560
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.560
gradually.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.560
How?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:54.639
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:59.779
very gentle and mild.

00:09:59.779 --> 00:10:13.360
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.100
At that stage you have no fears.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:29.310
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.339
You are not easily disturbed there.

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:42.949
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:48.069
is something wrong within yourself.

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:53.880
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:02.820
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:14.670
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:29.380
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:36.740
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:43.279
to verify how far it is correct.

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:57.759
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:13.800
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:22.809
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

00:12:22.809 --> 00:12:34.600
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:45.740
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:59.950
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.500
How you love.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.730
What is the quality of your compassion?

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:25.120
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:33.699
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

00:13:33.699 --> 00:13:37.490
You will do anything for that person.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:44.029
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

00:13:44.029 --> 00:13:47.730
This is just the love.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:56.600
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:12.529
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:25.089
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:35.079
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:48.879
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:54.839
that person you try to tolerate.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:15:02.119
Such a person just tolerates.

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:18.889
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:23.839
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:31.029
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:34.839
They don't have any anger about anyone.

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:41.519
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:53.179
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:59.649
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:07.190
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.019
People never liked them.

00:16:10.019 --> 00:16:23.800
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:29.579
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:42.199
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:43.199
them.

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:49.420
What they are doing they don't know'.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.769
Extremely compassionate.

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.920
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:06.370
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:11.020
They are not disturbed.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:20.560
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:28.230
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:36.170
They just enjoy their devotion.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:41.770
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:46.770
Devotion to God.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:57.630
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:06.380
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:18.590
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:33.020
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:38.570
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:48.560
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.280
but they are in the present.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:19:00.480
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:13.210
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them, they immediately go into thoughtless

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.580
awareness.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.560
That is what their capacity is.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:27.010
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.780
Now I'll tell you my own example.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:38.670
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:46.360
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:53.900
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.090
and one child fell down.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:03.070
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.520
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.950
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.680
I said, "I'll go in any case!

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:19.090
". So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.380
go to the airport".

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.190
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.950
Let's go!".

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:36.411
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

00:20:36.411 --> 00:20:41.540
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York, and I wanted to go to Washington

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.370
only!

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:56.380
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:05.050
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.190
That means it's a effortless.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:27.230
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:39.390
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:50.900
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:56.020
guarantee for your safety.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.790
For everything that you want to do.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:07.640
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640
You can become also very powerful!

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:20.850
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:31.210
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.860
you have to have.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:38.880
Everything is provided by the Divine.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:52.150
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

00:22:52.150 --> 00:23:05.341
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:11.330
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:19.320
You just close your eyes and things work out.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:28.160
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.460
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:42.600
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:56.450
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:01.590
for which the Divine is responsible.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:07.460
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:13.930
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:21.450
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:30.870
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come, he'll

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.230
never come.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:38.580
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:41.490
use your compassion.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:47.260
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:57.390
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.450
So now you have got your Self realisation.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.990
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:13.790
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:20.540
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:30.090
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:36.670
And some men also are like that.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:46.510
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:54.280
you should win over the partner of your life.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.800
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.850
But women indulge into so many other things.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:11.320
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:20.100
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.230
Without meditation you cannot rise.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.370
You have to meditate.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:31.340
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.340
No!

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.860
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.270
With the cleansing you understand.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:52.830
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.310
That is done by Divine.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:27:03.070
But you must religiously meditate.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:12.620
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:23.840
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:30.360
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:38.010
All sorts of problems can be solved.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:42.680
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:51.520
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.630
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:07.090
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.340
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:23.130
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:29.030
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:34.160
It just envelops you completely.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:40.840
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.440
It works so many miracles.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:52.390
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:59.120
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.020
to develop shraddha.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:11.690
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:23.610
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:31.160
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:38.140
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:44.130
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:52.360
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.280
do it for popularity.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.050
Many people are like that.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.720
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:10.010
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:17.810
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:26.980
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:37.970
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.940
solutions to things.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.910
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:55.480
It can find solutions to all your problems.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:05.940
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.220
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:17.030
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:24.810
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:34.100
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:46.530
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.220
within, which makes you understand.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:58.400
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.750
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:12.820
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.590
it to the leader.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:21.560
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.530
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:38.490
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.750
They never see their own faults.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.710
What's the use of finding faults of others?

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:51.620
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:58.670
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help, which you can work

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.620
it out.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:11.010
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:14.840
defects and get them corrected.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:24.130
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this, "I like this, I like

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.130
that".

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.620
But what about the Spirit?

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.820
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.610
Does it like?

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:40.620
Does it enjoy?

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.780
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:49.310
It's very common in the West.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.540
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:34:01.610
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:13.499
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine what I feel

00:34:13.499 --> 00:34:14.769
about them.

00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:21.220
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:32.089
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:42.259
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

00:34:42.259 --> 00:34:43.889
grace on your being.

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:46.240
The love of other people enthrals you.

00:34:46.240 --> 00:35:02.099
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:05.339
friendship in that kind of relationship.

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:12.300
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:21.329
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

00:35:21.329 --> 00:35:28.059
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:31.300
person -- instead of helping that person.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.470
Always people are in trouble.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.940
Then collectively you must help that person.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.160
Not talk ill of that person.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:49.390
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:56.519
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

00:35:56.519 --> 00:36:07.079
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:12.690
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.730
You had the experience.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:21.950
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:29.420
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge is really there or

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.559
not.

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:45.210
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.599
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:55.099
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration what's wrong

00:36:55.099 --> 00:36:56.099
with me".

00:36:56.099 --> 00:37:04.859
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:15.799
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

00:37:15.799 --> 00:37:19.319
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:23.789
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:31.589
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:45.400
And they have given us such a good attention,
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.020
hospitals.

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:57.509
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself, what

00:37:57.509 --> 00:37:59.490
are you?

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:11.490
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:32.430
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:41.640
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:51.769
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

00:38:51.769 --> 00:39:00.849
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved, a great

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:01.849
personality.

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:08.440
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.002
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

00:39:11.002 --> 00:39:22.440
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.990
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:41.660
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:50.609
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:53.279
Are you one of these type?

00:39:53.279 --> 00:39:59.920
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.239
It's a process, I must confess.

00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:09.460
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:18.180
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:22.190
had a very strong desire.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:23.720
What are we seeking?

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:31.270
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:37.739
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:39.239
So we seek.

00:40:39.239 --> 00:40:40.609
We seek.

00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:46.260
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:55.160
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:41:01.759
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:06.789
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

00:41:06.789 --> 00:41:14.470
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:21.220
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:27.799
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

00:41:27.799 --> 00:41:33.749
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

00:41:33.749 --> 00:41:36.970
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.029
She said, "I gave it up".

00:41:40.029 --> 00:41:48.470
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:52.460
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

00:41:52.460 --> 00:42:02.980
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.410
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.190
Guru's job is to guide people.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:14.780
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.920
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.749
That I have to tell you.

00:42:21.749 --> 00:42:28.700
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:38.019
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

00:42:38.019 --> 00:42:45.619
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:54.079
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved, what is your

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:55.549
understanding?

00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:57.990
What do you know?

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.960
Why these disasters are coming?

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.529
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

00:43:06.529 --> 00:43:09.170
It has to become very collective.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:13.460
It has to spread much more, all over.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.950
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:22.210
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.900
But go all out!

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.279
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

00:43:27.279 --> 00:43:32.069
Of course the people went into wrong things.

00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:39.759
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

00:43:39.759 --> 00:43:48.630
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:56.980
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:04.499
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

00:44:04.499 --> 00:44:07.259
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

00:44:07.259 --> 00:44:19.619
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:21.349
for the collective?

00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:23.109
Are we talking about it?

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:25.440
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.270
Are we making people know about it?'

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:40.220
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.280
vibrations.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:54.910
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:58.029
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:01.089
"My God" I said.

00:45:01.089 --> 00:45:06.579
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:09.770
So, what will happen?

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.770
Disasters!

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:18.819
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

00:45:18.819 --> 00:45:28.300
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.890
to them, and how they spread their message.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:39.770
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:45.240
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:51.890
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:56.150
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.270
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:11.869
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:16.630
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:19.519
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

00:46:19.519 --> 00:46:22.509
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:22.509 --> 00:46:28.660
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.440
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.039
nonsense, you get it.

00:46:39.039 --> 00:46:44.140
You are saved from so many things.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:49.480
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:56.869
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

00:46:56.869 --> 00:47:00.849
But why not save the whole world?

00:47:00.849 --> 00:47:07.670
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:14.119
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:18.550
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:23.019
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:31.869
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

00:47:31.869 --> 00:47:33.680
Go everywhere.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.309
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:44.989
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

00:47:44.989 --> 00:47:54.080
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.660
to save this Mother Earth.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.239
You have to save the people who are in it.

00:47:59.239 --> 00:48:06.170
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:11.560
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.359
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:18.970
Not that the people are stupid.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:28.299
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

00:48:28.299 --> 00:48:35.180
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:42.460
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:49.769
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

00:48:49.769 --> 00:48:53.619
we don't want!".

00:48:53.619 --> 00:49:02.109
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:06.589
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:08.569
God is wrathful, no doubt.

00:49:08.569 --> 00:49:13.779
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

00:49:13.779 --> 00:49:18.160
We have to save this Mother Earth.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:25.490
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.970
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:33.150
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.839
What's so much?

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:38.690
.... you can be also like me.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.660
You can talk about it to people.

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:49.050
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:55.599
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

00:49:55.599 --> 00:50:02.160
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same and talk about

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160
it.

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:12.069
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:21.309
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:26.450
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:32.470
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.329
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:39.619
Because you are always saved.

00:50:39.619 --> 00:50:44.249
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

00:50:44.249 --> 00:50:50.259
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

00:50:50.259 --> 00:51:03.390
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:16.099
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

00:51:16.099 --> 00:51:20.849
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:22.490
to fight it.

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:29.019
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.019
a difference.

00:51:30.019 --> 00:51:34.650
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:44.369
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:56.510
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:00.510
above jealousies, above talking loose.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:07.559
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

00:52:07.559 --> 00:52:10.309
gurus if you try to do that.

00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:13.569
This is what you have to achieve.

00:52:13.569 --> 00:52:20.020
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.609
May God Bless You All
