00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:27.020
EGO: Okay. Okay. Let's go over this once again.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.491
Pick up the bread, walk the dog, go to the dry cleaners,

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.562
pick up the bread, walk the dog, go thoughtless,

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.786
pick up the cake

00:01:39.714 --> 00:01:40.279
Cake?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Where did that come from?

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:48.690
Chocolate? Mmmh. No. No I can't.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.820
I mustn't. If eat chocolate I'll catch on liver.

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:55.750
If I catch on liver I'll get angry.

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:57.831
If I get angry I'll kick the dog.

00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:04.677
Why would I kick the dog?

00:02:05.977 --> 00:02:09.292
Do I have dog issues? Mmmh.

00:02:10.288 --> 00:02:13.898
Note to self. Introspect on dog issues. The dog!

00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:15.659
Mustn't forget dog food.

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.158
Wonder what dog food tastes like?

00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.518
Doesn't look that bad actually.

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:31.781
Well the dog seems to like it.

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:34.014
What was that? Oh yes. Note to self.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.651
Must remember to go thoughtless.

00:02:35.732 --> 00:02:37.732
Now where was I? Cake.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:38.936
Yes. No!

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.609
It'll make me fat.

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.766
Just one? Why not.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:49.884
No! I'll get addicted and I'll get fatter and fatter and fatter

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:51.269
then I'll die.

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:56.134
Who'll pay for the funeral?

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:58.508
The baker?

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:04.853
But...we hardly know each other.

00:03:05.353 --> 00:03:06.936
Oh God, I'm late.

00:03:07.436 --> 00:03:12.299
SUPER-EGO: I don't feel so good

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:17.231
It's so cold outside.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.261
Oh. I wish I could go back to bed.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.596
It looks so snug.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.372
So warm. So cosy.

00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:32.478
But...then I'll miss my train

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.521
and then I'll be late for work like always.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640
They don’t greet me. They don’t like me.

00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:38.721
I'll have to pretend I'm sick.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:40.802
Then I'll feel guilty.

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:44.088
Of course I'll feel guilty because I am guilty.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.576
I feel guilty even thinking about it.

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.158
I wish I cold just fall asleep right now.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:04:01.358
Sleep. Sleep.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.431
All day long.

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.281
EGO: Why am I meditating

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400
I should be buying dog food, walking the dog,

00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:10.481
going to the dry cleaners and....

00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:14.186
SUPER-EGO: It's so cold. Why is life so hard?

00:04:14.305 --> 00:04:17.353
EGO: Hang on a minute. This isn't going to work.

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:18.834
There's not enough time.

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:20.953
SUPER-EGO: If only I lived in Hawaii.

00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:22.762
In the sun. By the sea.

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:28.229
Okay, switch to Plan B. I walk to the bakery with the dog.

00:04:28.348 --> 00:04:30.348
SUPER-EGO: But...then I'd feel bad.

00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:32.546
I'd feel bad because I feel good.

00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:42.634
EGO: Does the baker sell dog food?

00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:45.468
Why on earth would he sell dog food?

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:47.587
He's a baker! He bakes bread!

00:04:47.893 --> 00:04:50.482
SUPER-EGO: Maybe I don't deserve to live in Hawaii.

00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:53.731
EGO: Which means...my dog will starve.

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:57.428
SUPER-EGO: Only Hawaiians deserve to live in Hawaii.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.585
EGO: Then he'll whine.

00:04:58.666 --> 00:04:59.658
SUPER-EGO: I'm an imposter.

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:00.573
EGO: Then he'll howl.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:02.042
SUPER-EGO: What am I doing here?

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.883
EGO: And then the baker will get angry and

00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:05.542
and won't sell me any chocolate cake.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.623
SUPER-EGO: Aren't we miserable

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:09.914
EGO: But that's good isn't it?

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:10.798
SUPER-EGO...and cold.

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.060
EGO: That's good!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.060
SUPER-EGO:and depressed.

00:05:14.074 --> 00:05:16.988
EGO: Must really start thinking about going thoughtless.

00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:30.904
EGO: What is it about her, huh?

00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:33.577
What’s her problem?

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:36.524
"I hope you made the right decision."

00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:39.501
Of course I made the right decision!

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.205
That guy was an idiot.

00:05:42.247 --> 00:05:43.674
Good riddance.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.511
YOGI: an idiot

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:50.412
EGO: You had to fire him. No choice.

00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:52.176
YOGI: Absolutely.

00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:55.398
EGO: So why the subtle jibes, ey?

"He'll be missed".

00:05:58.537 --> 00:06:00.537
He'll be missed!

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.481
He was an incompetent imbecile

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.495
who couldn't organize his way out of a paper bag.

00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:08.022
He won't be missed at all. A complete...

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.877
YOGI: Idiot.

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:13.806
EGO: She's always criticizing you.

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:18.155
You know that don't you?

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:20.683
YOGI: Really?

00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:24.685
EGO: Think about it.

00:06:31.505 --> 00:06:33.505
SUPER-EGO: Yes...but...

00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:36.004
maybe she was right?

00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:37.865
Maybe you shouldn't have fired him.

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:39.934
That poor man. Just imagine.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.418
He'll have to go home and tell his wife and kids.

00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:44.195
(WIFE) "Hello, darling. How was work ?

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.761
(HUSBAND) I was fired today.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:48.179
(WIFE) Fired! But...what about the house?

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:50.571
We'll be evicted. We'll have to live on the streets.

00:06:50.613 --> 00:06:52.613
(CHILDREN) Daddy? What does fired mean?

00:06:55.156 --> 00:06:57.509
(HUSBAND) It means Daddy doesn't have a job.

00:06:57.773 --> 00:06:59.773
No job, no money.

00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:02.268
(CHILDREN) But Daddy you promised me a bicycle!

00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:04.425
(HUSBAND) I'm sorry, honey.

00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:06.607
We'll be lucky if we can eat this month.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.154
SUPER-EGO: Oh, God.

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:16.160
I feel so terrible.

00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:19.878

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:21.365
YOGI: Given him another chance.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.618

00:07:25.722 --> 00:07:27.722
EGO: It's not your problem.

00:07:27.778 --> 00:07:29.778
