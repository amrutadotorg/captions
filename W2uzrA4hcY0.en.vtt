WEBVTT

01:20.293 --> 01:27.020
EGO: Okay. Okay. Let's go over this once again.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.491
Pick up the bread, walk the dog, go to the dry cleaners,

01:30.991 --> 01:33.562
pick up the bread, walk the dog, go thoughtless,

01:34.399 --> 01:35.786
pick up the cake

01:39.714 --> 01:40.279
Cake?

01:41.960 --> 01:43.960
Where did that come from?

01:44.841 --> 01:48.690
Chocolate? Mmmh. No. No I can't.

01:49.190 --> 01:53.820
I mustn't. If eat chocolate I'll catch on liver.

01:53.977 --> 01:55.750
If I catch on liver I'll get angry.

01:55.831 --> 01:57.831
If I get angry I'll kick the dog.

02:02.715 --> 02:04.677
Why would I kick the dog?

02:05.977 --> 02:09.292
Do I have dog issues? Mmmh.

02:10.288 --> 02:13.898
Note to self. Introspect on dog issues. The dog!

02:14.131 --> 02:15.659
Mustn't forget dog food.

02:19.285 --> 02:22.158
Wonder what dog food tastes like?

02:26.316 --> 02:28.518
Doesn't look that bad actually.

02:29.781 --> 02:31.781
Well the dog seems to like it.

02:32.014 --> 02:34.014
What was that? Oh yes. Note to self.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.651
Must remember to go thoughtless.

02:35.732 --> 02:37.732
Now where was I? Cake.

02:37.813 --> 02:38.936
Yes. No!

02:41.609 --> 02:43.609
It'll make me fat.

02:43.766 --> 02:45.766
Just one? Why not.

02:45.923 --> 02:49.884
No! I'll get addicted and I'll get fatter and fatter and fatter

02:49.927 --> 02:51.269
then I'll die.

02:53.904 --> 02:56.134
Who'll pay for the funeral?

02:57.244 --> 02:58.508
The baker?

03:00.952 --> 03:04.853
But...we hardly know each other.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.936
Oh God, I'm late.

03:07.436 --> 03:12.299
SUPER-EGO: I don't feel so good

03:13.598 --> 03:17.231
It's so cold outside.

03:17.350 --> 03:21.261
Oh. I wish I could go back to bed.

03:21.949 --> 03:24.596
It looks so snug.

03:26.049 --> 03:29.372
So warm. So cosy.

03:30.673 --> 03:32.478
But...then I'll miss my train

03:32.521 --> 03:34.521
and then I'll be late for work like always.

03:34.640 --> 03:36.640
They don’t greet me. They don’t like me.

03:36.721 --> 03:38.721
I'll have to pretend I'm sick.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.802
Then I'll feel guilty.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.088
Of course I'll feel guilty because I am guilty.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.576
I feel guilty even thinking about it.

03:49.639 --> 03:55.158
I wish I cold just fall asleep right now.

03:55.696 --> 04:01.358
Sleep. Sleep.

04:01.439 --> 04:04.431
All day long.

04:04.474 --> 04:06.281
EGO: Why am I meditating

04:06.400 --> 04:08.400
I should be buying dog food, walking the dog,

04:08.481 --> 04:10.481
going to the dry cleaners and....

04:10.524 --> 04:14.186
SUPER-EGO: It's so cold. Why is life so hard?

04:14.305 --> 04:17.353
EGO: Hang on a minute. This isn't going to work.

04:17.396 --> 04:18.834
There's not enough time.

04:18.953 --> 04:20.953
SUPER-EGO: If only I lived in Hawaii.

04:21.034 --> 04:22.762
In the sun. By the sea.

04:23.872 --> 04:28.229
Okay, switch to Plan B. I walk to the bakery with the dog.

04:28.348 --> 04:30.348
SUPER-EGO: But...then I'd feel bad.

04:30.429 --> 04:32.546
I'd feel bad because I feel good.

04:40.634 --> 04:42.634
EGO: Does the baker sell dog food?

04:42.753 --> 04:45.468
Why on earth would he sell dog food?

04:45.549 --> 04:47.587
He's a baker! He bakes bread!

04:47.893 --> 04:50.482
SUPER-EGO: Maybe I don't deserve to live in Hawaii.

04:50.563 --> 04:53.731
EGO: Which means...my dog will starve.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.428
SUPER-EGO: Only Hawaiians deserve to live in Hawaii.

04:57.509 --> 04:58.585
EGO: Then he'll whine.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.658
SUPER-EGO: I'm an imposter.

04:59.739 --> 05:00.573
EGO: Then he'll howl.

05:00.692 --> 05:02.042
SUPER-EGO: What am I doing here?

05:02.199 --> 05:03.883
EGO: And then the baker will get angry and

05:03.923 --> 05:05.542
and won't sell me any chocolate cake.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.623
SUPER-EGO: Aren't we miserable

05:08.704 --> 05:09.914
EGO: But that's good isn't it?

05:09.957 --> 05:10.798
SUPER-EGO...and cold.

05:10.879 --> 05:12.060
EGO: That's good!

05:12.060 --> 05:14.060
SUPER-EGO:and depressed.

05:14.074 --> 05:16.988
EGO: Must really start thinking about going thoughtless.

05:28.904 --> 05:30.904
EGO: What is it about her, huh?

05:31.653 --> 05:33.577
What’s her problem?

05:33.646 --> 05:36.524
"I hope you made the right decision."

05:37.901 --> 05:39.501
Of course I made the right decision!

05:40.640 --> 05:42.205
That guy was an idiot.

05:42.247 --> 05:43.674
Good riddance.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.511
YOGI: an idiot

05:46.567 --> 05:50.412
EGO: You had to fire him. No choice.

05:50.773 --> 05:52.176
YOGI: Absolutely.

05:52.704 --> 05:55.398
EGO: So why the subtle jibes, ey?

05:55.718 --> 05:58.037
"He'll be missed".

05:58.537 --> 06:00.537
He'll be missed!

06:01.009 --> 06:02.481
He was an incompetent imbecile

06:02.495 --> 06:04.495
who couldn't organize his way out of a paper bag.

06:05.551 --> 06:08.022
He won't be missed at all. A complete...

06:08.050 --> 06:08.877
YOGI: Idiot.

06:10.475 --> 06:13.806
EGO: She's always criticizing you.

06:15.167 --> 06:18.155
You know that don't you?

06:19.169 --> 06:20.683
YOGI: Really?

06:21.908 --> 06:24.685
EGO: Think about it.

06:31.505 --> 06:33.505
SUPER-EGO: Yes...but...

06:34.158 --> 06:36.004
maybe she was right?

06:36.297 --> 06:37.865
Maybe you shouldn't have fired him.

06:37.934 --> 06:39.934
That poor man. Just imagine.

06:39.990 --> 06:42.418
He'll have to go home and tell his wife and kids.

06:42.446 --> 06:44.195
(WIFE) "Hello, darling. How was work ?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.761
(HUSBAND) I was fired today.

06:45.982 --> 06:48.179
(WIFE) Fired! But...what about the house?

06:48.207 --> 06:50.571
We'll be evicted. We'll have to live on the streets.

06:50.613 --> 06:52.613
(CHILDREN) Daddy? What does fired mean?

06:55.156 --> 06:57.509
(HUSBAND) It means Daddy doesn't have a job.

06:57.773 --> 06:59.773
No job, no money.

06:59.801 --> 07:02.268
(CHILDREN) But Daddy you promised me a bicycle!

07:02.657 --> 07:04.425
(HUSBAND) I'm sorry, honey.

07:04.453 --> 07:06.607
We'll be lucky if we can eat this month.

07:08.690 --> 07:12.154
SUPER-EGO: Oh, God.

07:12.196 --> 07:16.160
I feel so terrible.

07:18.381 --> 07:19.878
I should have

07:19.934 --> 07:21.365
YOGI: Given him another chance.

07:21.490 --> 07:24.618
EGO: Nonsense. You gave him three warnings.

07:24.674 --> 07:25.708
SUPER-EGO: But what about the poor kids?

07:25.722 --> 07:27.722
EGO: It's not your problem.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.778
I wouldn't lose a minute of sleep over it.

07:29.806 --> 07:31.806
SUPER-EGO: My new bicycle, Daddy! You promised!

07:31.848 --> 07:34.126
EGO: The kid's already got a bicycle.

07:34.766 --> 07:36.518
He got the bicycle.

07:36.546 --> 07:37.847
SUPER-EGO: Daddy! You promised!

07:37.875 --> 07:40.113
YOGI: Neti! Neti!

07:41.001 --> 07:42.186
YOGI: Not this.

07:42.686 --> 07:44.686
Not this.

08:07.008 --> 08:07.784
EGO: Ehum.

08:13.812 --> 08:15.169
Ehum.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.586

YOGI: Three minutes.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.280
EGO: Three minutes?

10:21.308 --> 10:21.735
YOGI: Minimum.

10:21.763 --> 10:22.462
EGO: Maybe more?

10:22.476 --> 10:24.823
YOGI: Yeah. Five minutes. At least.

10:24.837 --> 10:26.057
EGO: Pretty good. Ah?

YOGI: Thank you.

YOGI: Do you think I'm a deep yogi?

11:02.458 --> 11:03.749
EGO: Very deep.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.653
YOGI: Deep enough to be a member of a sub committee?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.556
EGO: Sub committee?

11:16.543 --> 11:18.543
SUBCOMITTEE!

11:18.626 --> 11:20.626

YOGI: World Council!

11:29.626 --> 11:32.241
EGO: The leader of the world council!

11:33.963 --> 11:35.589
YOGI: You think so?

11:35.617 --> 11:38.215
EGO: Absolutely! You're indispensable.

11:38.271 --> 11:40.006
The collective would be lost without you.

11:40.034 --> 11:42.034
The world would be lost without you!

11:42.493 --> 11:45.805
YOGI: Yes, you're right. I am indispensable!

11:46.708 --> 11:48.708
EGO: You know the great thing about you.

humble.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.600
YOGI: Really?

12:01.170 --> 12:03.446
EGO: One of the humblest yogis I've ever met.

12:04.321 --> 12:07.131
YOGI: Well, if you say so. Wow.

12:07.824 --> 12:09.173
Humble.

EGO: Well thanks a lot!

12:27.137 --> 12:27.666
YOGI: What?

12:28.068 --> 12:31.172
EGO: I am not the doer?

12:31.228 --> 12:33.999
Bit of a short memory haven't you?

12:34.027 --> 12:36.027
YOGI: How do you mean?

12:36.345 --> 12:39.446
EGO: Who clinched that deal for you last week, hah?

12:40.571 --> 12:42.066

Exactly.

I.

Me.

12:57.987 --> 13:01.505
Me. Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, ME!!

13:03.505 --> 13:05.687
You were good. Very good.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.803
YOGI: Was I?

13:06.845 --> 13:10.242
EGO: You think anyone else would have been able to pull that deal off?

13:10.589 --> 13:13.784
Do you think she would have pulled it off?

13:13.826 --> 13:15.826
Mrs "He'll be missed"?

13:17.506 --> 13:18.344
Never.

13:18.396 --> 13:20.396
No way.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.438
You're the man.

13:22.729 --> 13:24.869
YOGI: I was good. Wasn't I?

13:24.980 --> 13:28.182

13:58.956 --> 14:02.170
Who is the doer?

14:02.212 --> 14:03.212
YOGI: You are!

14:03.226 --> 14:05.226
EGO: Bulls-eye! Follow me.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.060
One, two, three, four.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.828
Hi, there!

14:13.333 --> 14:17.147
♫ I'm on my way I'm making it.

14:21.042 --> 14:25.343
I've got to make it show, yeah.

14:30.307 --> 14:34.597
So much larger than life.

14:38.052 --> 14:42.071
I'm going to watch it growing.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.414
The place where I come from

15:06.858 --> 15:09.218
is a small town.

15:10.732 --> 15:15.185
They think so small. They use small words.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.310
But not me.

15:19.810 --> 15:21.810
I'm smarter than that.

15:22.782 --> 15:25.171
I've worked it out.

15:27.005 --> 15:33.205
I'll be stretching my mouth to let those big words come right out.

15:33.302 --> 15:35.302
I'm heading up.

15:35.344 --> 15:37.344
I'm getting out.

15:37.831 --> 15:39.831
To the city.

15:39.887 --> 15:41.887
The big, big city.

15:43.041 --> 15:47.325
I'll be a big noise, with all the big boys.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.742
So much stuff I will learn.

15:52.533 --> 15:55.930
And I will pray to a big God.

15:56.791 --> 15:59.762
As I kneel in the big church.

15:59.790 --> 16:03.797
Big time. I'm on my way I'm making it.

16:03.853 --> 16:06.627
Big time. O yes!

16:08.321 --> 16:10.321
Big time. ♫

16:24.085 --> 16:25.111
EGO: Hey?

16:26.821 --> 16:28.144
Where is your attention?

SUPER-EGO: What about me?

27:34.498 --> 27:36.498
What about my feelings?

Why don't you just go out with your other ego friends

28:20.683 --> 28:22.683
and tell each other how great you are.

28:22.745 --> 28:24.745
