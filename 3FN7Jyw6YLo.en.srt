3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,499
Diwali puja. Delphi (Greece), 7 November 1999.

4
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:09,007
It is very, very fortunate and auspicious

5
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:20,315
that we are celebrating the Diwali in Greece, specially in Delphi.

6
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,345
It has a very ancient history,

7
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:31,645
and as you know Athena resided here. She was the Primordial Mother.

8
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,038
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial.”

9
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:44,457
So this place has been described, has been described

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,353
even in the Puranas as “Manipur [navel] dvipa [island].”

11
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,583
Manipur is the Nabhi.

12
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:54,814
Also in Sanskrit Manipur means the Nabhi Chakra.

13
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:58,738
So it’s described as the Manipur dvipa,

14
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,336
is written “Manipur e dvipa.”

15
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:06,460
Just imagine these Puranas, these ancient-time books

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,821
– God knows how old they are,

17
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:13,143
must be at least eight thousand or maybe more –

18
00:01:13,263 --> 00:01:16,735
and they have described Greece as the Manipur dvipa,

19
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:21,527
is the place of Nabhi and where resides the Adi Shakti,

20
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,352
that’s the Athena.

21
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:26,030
So I mean, how it was known to them

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,798
– maybe through torsion area, I would say;

23
00:01:28,918 --> 00:01:32,632
but it is written very clearly, and same we find here

24
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:38,829
is the place of Athena which is in the Nabhi.

25
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:44,908
Also Athena is the Primordial Mother,

26
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:57,722
they say expressed Herself first in the sea on the Nabhi itself.

27
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,823
From there She did all Her work.

28
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:11,519
Now we can say that in Her movement,

29
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:22,204
when She came down as existence She created Shri Ganesha

30
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:32,432
and then She went to the right side and created Mahasaraswati,

31
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:39,328
the, we can say, the whole universe, all creations She created.

32
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:41,674
And then She came down,

33
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:49,415
came down and settled as Kundalini;

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,355
but coming down She created Mahalakshmi Principle,

35
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:59,492
which is for our ascent. This was Her movement,

36
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:05,007
but it is said that She incarnated in the Nabhi,

37
00:03:05,127 --> 00:03:12,237
because maybe after doing all this She incarnated in the Nabhi,

38
00:03:12,357 --> 00:03:16,948
and also we see that Ganesha’s Kundalini is in the Nabhi.

39
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,883
She incarnated in the Nabhi, they say, because the first pure knowledge,,

40
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:31,134
pure desire of a person or animal or anybody is hunger.

41
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,055
That is in the Nabhi.

42
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:43,228
And this hunger She wanted to satisfy or to direct or to handle,

43
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:49,068
and that might be the reason She might have first come to the Nabhi.

44
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,520
Now this Primordial Mother that we have as Athena

45
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,638
also has in Her hand a Kundalini, also She has one trident.

46
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:06,946
All this is sign that when She was born

47
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:10,108
She knew that She has to fight the evil forces

48
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:12,220
in the Nabhi Chakra.

49
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:17,990
All this history is really shown very clearly

50
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,278
in the Greek mythology,

51
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:25,110
but later on this mythology took a very, very wrong path

52
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,742
through human beings, as they know how to spoil everything.

53
00:04:28,862 --> 00:04:34,512
So what they did is to make all the gods and goddesses

54
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:39,892
look like human beings, and so we have here,

55
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:48,114
many gods which are in India,

56
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:53,003
they are represented even in the Greek mythology.

57
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:57,943
But the Indian gods are kept very pure and really godly and saintly,

58
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:01,916
but here it was brought down to the level of human beings.

59
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:04,317
And so many gods who were there

60
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:09,917
were shown to be little different from Indian gods,

61
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:13,126
because they made it human.

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,927
It’s very surprising how it was deviated

63
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:21,152
gradually from one to another.

64
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:25,797
Even in India it’s done but it doesn’t stay,

65
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:28,078
because we have Puranas.

66
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,574
So every time people try to ruin it and spoil it,

67
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:35,737
it goes back to the normal state because we have Puranas.

68
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:41,624
But Puranas are not worshipped like Bible or like Koran

69
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:44,524
or like any other such religious book,

70
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:49,872
but they are just relating the history of the ancient times;

71
00:05:49,992 --> 00:05:55,391
and one has to just see it that it is intelligible,

72
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:59,623
this can be explained, people can know about it.

73
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,212
But the way they have described about Manipur dvipa

74
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:10,743
was very much really great, and even at the time of Alexander,

75
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:16,422
Greece was a very prosperous, extremely beautiful state.

76
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:22,690
Because it is described by Chand Bardai,

77
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,227
one of the poet who came with him here,

78
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:29,320
and he has described into all details what things are.

79
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,053
And he has also described that there’s a temple

80
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:39,909
of the Primordial Mother, very clearly, of the Adi Shakti,

81
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,666
and there is the Ganesha is also sitting there.

82
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:45,420
He has described it in all details.

83
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,843
Also the steps going to the temple are three-and-a-half, he says.

84
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:56,736
Three are big ones and the last one is half way.

85
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:02,859
And if you make, extend them to the whole world

86
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:06,866
it can make a three-and-a-half coils.

87
00:07:06,986 --> 00:07:14,263
Also very clearly he said that there are swayambhu,

88
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:16,433
swayambhu of Shri Ganesha.

89
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:19,634
And also about Oracle of Delphi they say

90
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:23,987
that in the Nabhi Chakra the gods speak.

91
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:27,374
All this is described in India much before,

92
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:31,240
much, much before Alexander came to India,

93
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,481
and from that we can understand

94
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:38,718
that there might have been much more rapport, maybe; maybe

95
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:42,721
many people were going abroad or maybe coming here,

96
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,499
or may be from the torsion area

97
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:49,355
that all the Puranas were written down.

98
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:53,853
So it’s absolutely an ancient place we are in,

99
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:59,555
which is truthful in its description and everything, no doubt,

100
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:03,309
but later on the deterioration came, took place.

101
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,915
Also here there is question of Kundalini was there,

102
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:09,546
and the chakras were painted also.

103
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,563
But when Christianity came they said,

104
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,603
“It’s all bogus, forget it,”

105
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:16,447
and they didn’t want to see to the other side of it.

106
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:21,550
And that is how it became just a kind of a history also,

107
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,027
that was not so clean and clear.

108
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:33,582
The faith in Athena subsided,

109
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:37,814
faith in all the gods and goddesses also subsided

110
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,021
and it started becoming this, actually we can say

111
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:44,253
it was disappearing nicely.

112
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:49,523
This was the situation of this Greece. Now again we are back.

113
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:53,590
In the “Manipur e Dvipa” we are sitting down nicely,

114
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,380
and for Lakshmi Puja, which is in the Nabhi.

115
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,043
Lakshmi came out of water, no doubt,

116
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:06,110
but Athena is the Mother of Lakshmi.

117
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:14,992
She is the One who is all-pervading, and She created Lakshmi,

118
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:18,087
and this Lakshmi is the One that ruled here

119
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:22,852
and She was very much manifesting.

120
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:28,236
And She created beautiful things here,

121
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:33,975
because they were very rich people, Greeks were very rich;

122
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:37,291
and they were indulging into all kinds of things,

123
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:41,156
specially in business, then in shipping.

124
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:46,088
Shipping is their one of the most important business,

125
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:51,367
and I came with My husband here because he was a shipping man.

126
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,982
And I was surprised that at the airport

127
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:58,048
we had the minister’s wife, another minister’s wife,

128
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:01,535
Prime Minister’s wife. I was surprised, normally they never go

129
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:05,085
to receive any lady missus who comes.

130
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:07,835
“No, no,” they said. “You see what happened

131
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:12,506
that our husbands told us, ‘If you really want to see a lady

132
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:18,760
who is absolutely, immaculately feminine and very auspicious

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,819
and very serene, then it is Mrs. Srivastava.’”

134
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:26,410
So they came to see Me, imagine them!

135
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,067
The idea of serenity doesn’t exist now for women in the world,

136
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:33,276
but these ladies came to see Me that

137
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:36,538
“who is this serene lady who has come?”

138
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,559
And they looked after Me very well,

139
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,237
and then afterwards there was an election coming also.

140
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:46,440
But I don’t forget the way they told Me and very respectfully,

141
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,308
they said, “How did You develop this serenity?”

142
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,962
I said, “I didn’t develop. It was just existing.

143
00:10:52,082 --> 00:10:57,315
I didn’t do anything to look serene or in any way work it out.

144
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,676
There is no beauty parlor for that

145
00:10:59,796 --> 00:11:02,845
but it is something innate in Me,

146
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:05,666
what if you think it was serenity.” She said,

147
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:09,012
“No, no, all the men praised about You that

148
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:13,849
‘She is a person who is, even in these horrible days,

149
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:16,496
is extremely serene.’”

150
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:20,555
Now Diwali is very significant because

151
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:29,175
today is the darkest day, darkest night and longest night,

152
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:33,377
and to end it up they put lights.

153
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:38,560
Now in the atmosphere it’s all very dark, black,

154
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,524
the sun is gone. So they put on all these lights.

155
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:46,425
In the same way it is Kali Yuga.

156
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,696
Now, Kali Yuga you can consider as one day.

157
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:55,483
It’s very dark, horrible, it has lots of problems,

158
00:11:55,603 --> 00:11:57,887
it’s made our lives miserable

159
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:00,989
and we don’t know how to move with life.

160
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:07,693
At this moment what is necessary is to enlighten people.

161
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:10,252
Kali Yuga at its worst now.

162
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:13,732
The kind of things people are doing even in the name of God

163
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:16,964
is shocking. But that is Kali Yuga,

164
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:21,491
where we have lost all sense of direction.

165
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,584
We don’t know which way we are going.

166
00:12:23,704 --> 00:12:26,174
All kinds of wrong things we are doing

167
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:30,234
and we think it’s all right, after all what’s wrong in it?

168
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:33,561
Everything you tell them – “what’s wrong?”

169
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:37,600
You tell them, “Don’t do it.” They’ll say, “What’s wrong?”

170
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,411
And that’s how every human being has very,

171
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:44,835
become very individualistic. In a way he’s not,

172
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:48,943
because they follow a fashion, they follow a style

173
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:51,844
– I mean they are not, they are slavish –

174
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:54,005
but they believe they are very independent,

175
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,799
they are free people, they can do whatever they like.

176
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,692
As a result of this freedom in this Kali Yuga

177
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:04,283
or the idea of freedom, what has happened with them is that

178
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:08,281
they have become extremely ugly.

179
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:13,983
The kind of things they are doing in Kali Yuga is unbelievable.

180
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:17,079
Even when they are priests, they are in the churches,

181
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,722
this thing, that thing, they become so horribly immoral

182
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,313
that cannot believe how can that be

183
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,722
in the name of God, under this roof of God?

184
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:31,100
But it has started, that is Kali Yuga.

185
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,653
And this Kali Yuga has to be finished.

186
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:40,943
So what do we do to remove the darkness of the night

187
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:43,025
is to put lights.

188
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:46,798
In the same way people should be enlightened.

189
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,810
There should be light in the heart of people.

190
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,956
Once they’re enlightened, this darkness

191
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:57,113
from which we are suffering because of our ignorance

192
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:01,702
will be finished and we’ll have the absolute knowledge.

193
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:06,489
So this is a new age that they are talking about is here

194
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:12,006
right now, here, that it is going to work out in such a manner

195
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:17,771
that it will be all enlightened personalities together,

196
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:24,501
and they’ll know what is light is, what is real knowledge, gyana.

197
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:28,387
So ours is a path of knowledge:

198
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:33,910
knowledge that is love, knowledge that is compassion.

199
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,684
This is what we have to understand,

200
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:42,385
that we have come into another area, arena, where

201
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:50,647
all the skirmishes and the troubles of Kali Yuga cannot enter.

202
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:53,281
It’s raining outside, nothing inside

203
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:58,861
– it’s like that, that we are now not only free,

204
00:14:59,012 --> 00:15:03,404
but whatever we are doing is nothing but freedom;

205
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:08,170
where we are not attached to anything that can debase us,

206
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,440
make us lose grip over truth.

207
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,949
When such a personality is brought in then what happens,

208
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,132
that all these ideas of Kali Yuga will disappear.

209
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,726
But I must say, it’s the Last Judgment at the same time.

210
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:28,364
Those who accept the truth

211
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:32,544
and reside in truth and grow in truth will remain,

212
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:36,206
all other will be perished – is said already.

213
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:41,623
Like you see a garden in which there are some trees

214
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:47,755
who are nourished well, who get lot of water and love,

215
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:54,114
and who give also so much to people they exist.

216
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:57,667
The others are burnt down and finished.

217
00:15:57,787 --> 00:16:01,844
In the same way you have to first accept the love,

218
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:06,286
take the love, nourish yourself with that love

219
00:16:06,406 --> 00:16:09,321
and then you give to others.

220
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:18,098
This is a simple way you can overcome the Kali Yuga’s curses.

221
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:23,469
Kali Yuga is so much full of darkness

222
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,585
that we start hitting each other.

223
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,410
For example you are all sitting here. Suddenly it becomes dark.

224
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,706
You don’t know how to move, whether you are hitting others or not,

225
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,280
with whom are you sitting, nothing, in the same way.

226
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,288
With the darkness in the heart, darkness in the mind

227
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:44,334
that you don’t know where are you, what are you doing

228
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,900
and what you should be doing,

229
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,714
just like going amok you go on hitting each other.

230
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:56,483
This is what is Kali Yuga, and the one who recognizes it

231
00:16:56,603 --> 00:17:00,066
and gets out of it is the Sahaja Yogi.

232
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,380
Otherwise you are just like other people

233
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,517
if you are still indulging into the same periphery,

234
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:13,552
in the same circles of imbalance.

235
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,655
Now another thing with Kali Yuga is this,

236
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:23,372
that even if you are hit or even if you are destroyed

237
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,468
they just don’t blame themselves.

238
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,820
Is a another horrible temperament one develops

239
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,324
that you blame others, never yourself.

240
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:37,835
That it is your mistake that you hit yourself.

241
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:41,705
It was you did wrong and that’s what it is.

242
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:47,435
This is the, what we call is the illusion, is the bhrama,

243
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:49,943
and this illusion has to go away.

244
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:54,084
And for Kali Yuga it is said this is the era of illusions,

245
00:17:54,204 --> 00:18:00,261
and this illusion, if you fall into it you are finished.

246
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:04,739
But if you see the illusions then you try to seek the truth.

247
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:08,186
That’s why today the seeking is very strong,

248
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:11,640
because they can feel it’s an illusion.

249
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,159
It’s not the truth, they know.

250
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,887
And once they know it is not the truth, what do they do?

251
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,871
They want to know what is the truth,

252
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,789
where is the truth and they try to find it.

253
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:28,189
That’s how also in this Kali Yuga the seeking has started.

254
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,340
The story about Kali Yuga is told in also another Purana,

255
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,581
of Damayanti Purana where Damayanti, the wife of Nala,

256
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:44,166
was separated from him because of the same illusions created by Kali.

257
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:54,888
So one day it happened that Nala got hold of this horrible Kali

258
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:59,294
and he said, “Now I am going to strangle you and finish you off.”

259
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,250
So Kali said, “All right, you can do it,

260
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,013
but first listen to my importance, my mahatmya

261
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:08,270
– what importance I have, why I am there.”

262
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,837
So he waited.

263
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:14,534
He said, “Now agree, if you listen to me I’ll tell you.

264
00:19:15,002 --> 00:19:17,983
When I will come and I will rule the world

265
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:20,324
– means when there will be Kali Yuga –

266
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:25,146
people will get into bhranti, means illusions.

267
00:19:25,266 --> 00:19:28,225
They will not know whether this is truth or not

268
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:31,793
and they will then try to seek the truth.

269
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:36,556
But not only the people, those who go to the jungles

270
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,726
and those who renounce everything;

271
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:46,074
but there will be another type, the same people who are doing this,

272
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:53,487
who are doing this kind of seeking will, in the Kali Yuga

273
00:19:53,607 --> 00:19:58,730
will take birth and will be normal householders,

274
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,677
and they’ll get into these illusions of every kind.

275
00:20:03,797 --> 00:20:07,222
And at that time when they get into this illusion,

276
00:20:07,342 --> 00:20:10,522
then only they will start seeking,

277
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:15,611
realizing that it is untruth, and they will seek the truth

278
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,878
at that time.

279
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:21,491
At that time only they will get their Self Realization.”

280
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,601
He told very clearly, I mean thousands of years back.

281
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:27,930
So Kali Yuga is the time

282
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,900
where people can get their Self Realization,

283
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,640
they will know their Self, they will know the truth.

284
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,310
This is said long time back and you can see now it’s happening.

285
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,359
So this was the time meant for that,

286
00:20:42,479 --> 00:20:46,219
because if you are all right like in Satya Yuga and all that,

287
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:50,824
so you don’t seek; you just accept, you are obedient,

288
00:20:50,944 --> 00:20:52,668
you are good people – finished.

289
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:58,873
But in Kali Yuga you really start seeking the absolute truth,

290
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:04,116
and that is why these lights depict that character

291
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:08,217
or we can say that soul which are being enlightened.

292
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:14,196
So you are all enlightened souls. For Me that’s the Diwali.

293
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,847
If the people are enlightened that’s the Diwali:

294
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:21,755
that they remove all the darkness of Kali Yuga

295
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:27,562
and you all enjoy the beauty and joy of Kali Yuga.

296
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:31,551
It’s very, very symbolic I should say,

297
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:34,890
that Diwali has already started.

298
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,488
We have many lights, and we have to get more lights,

299
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:45,771
not because it is short of light; why are we taking more lights,

300
00:21:45,891 --> 00:21:49,886
why do you want? Because all must be saved.

301
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:54,409
Our effort is to save everyone of them.

302
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:56,634
Very difficult, it’s very difficult.

303
00:21:56,754 --> 00:22:01,845
But you can see now how like seeds realized souls go

304
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:05,421
and plant themselves in very far-fetched places

305
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,979
and there they prosper, become very beautiful trees,

306
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:15,646
fragrant, and which are giving shade to others.

307
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:19,818
That’s why you see people from all sorts of places

308
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:25,250
are being awakened and they become realized souls,

309
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,748
and they awaken others.

310
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:33,584
Is all the process it’s so well built in,

311
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:37,581
it looks like that and it’s working out well.

312
00:22:37,701 --> 00:22:40,831
The only thing which is doubtful is,

313
00:22:40,951 --> 00:22:43,341
how many will come to Sahaja Yoga,

314
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:46,876
and how many we can salvage and save?

315
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:51,377
Is the only problem and for that you should be prepared,

316
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:55,633
that every one of you should decide that

317
00:22:55,753 --> 00:23:00,223
“I am going to save at least one soul every day,

318
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,511
one person every day.”

319
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,914
Supposing we are some, we have some people who are getting drowned,

320
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:13,326
say, in a river or in the sea. What do you do?

321
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,659
You all rush together to save.

322
00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:19,475
You go all out to save his life.

323
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,058
In the same way we have to understand

324
00:23:22,178 --> 00:23:26,084
we have to save the lives of all the people,

325
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:29,583
and for that we have to work very hard.

326
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:36,747
Now in this rising from illusion to truth also

327
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:44,254
we have certain problems which must be faced in a proper way.

328
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:48,284
One of the problems that arises out of this, as they say,

329
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:52,430
is the hunger. Hunger could be for money,

330
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,952
could be for food, could be for anything.

331
00:23:56,625 --> 00:24:02,946
Now if there is a hunger for money

332
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:06,714
is going to settle [in] you permanently

333
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:12,802
because it is never satiable, you can never satisfy it.

334
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:19,948
But in the modern times people are just going mad, I tell you,

335
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:22,349
real mad for money.

336
00:24:23,183 --> 00:24:27,747
They do not care whether others have it or not,

337
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:31,217
others have this convenience or not,

338
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,823
but just like to show off, they want to show off

339
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:37,131
– they’re very rich, they’re very good –

340
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:40,482
and do all kinds of things with all their ego.

341
00:24:40,602 --> 00:24:44,091
They think, “Nothing wrong; what’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

342
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:47,300
This is one of the biggest hurdles you have,

343
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,162
is that your mind which is ego dictates,

344
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:59,620
and you try to do it without even verifying

345
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:02,563
what is this, what is that.

346
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:08,717
So the mind is under bhranti, in illusion,

347
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:12,521
and then you have many ways to understand.

348
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:16,035
So I have said that in Sahaja Yoga

349
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:19,106
if they want they should get their Realization,

350
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:26,198
and also they can go about with their shoes anywhere they feel like,

351
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,568
specially on the day they get Realization.

352
00:25:29,688 --> 00:25:31,500
It has worked wonders,

353
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,385
because that day you are in a stronger mood

354
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:36,894
and you avoid all wrong things.

355
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:40,547
Now so many of you have grown up in Sahaja Yoga

356
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,923
and are transformed completely.

357
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,386
So very happy to see that.

358
00:25:45,506 --> 00:25:49,532
I haven’t worked like… I have not done much, I don’t think;

359
00:25:49,652 --> 00:25:53,586
I have just enlightened in a way, that’s very far-fetched,

360
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:55,355
but I don’t do anything.

361
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:58,354
Without doing anything if you get enlightened and if you say,

362
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:01,905
“You have done it,” I can’t believe it. How can that be?

363
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:05,216
I didn’t do anything, just you got your Realization.

364
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:09,053
But now when I see, then I reflect

365
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:12,661
and find how beautifully you people sing,

366
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:17,379
how beautifully you have become sweet

367
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:22,546
and how beautifully you have become friendly to each other,

368
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:26,976
I am now convinced, and I feel this won’t take much time

369
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:30,282
for you to establish Sahaja Yoga.

370
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:36,105
It is very high time that we should understand that

371
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,347
we have to expose ourselves

372
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:42,558
to Sahaja Yoga much more often than otherwise.

373
00:26:43,931 --> 00:26:47,256
And you see the other problems are there also.

374
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:50,971
Like they have some problems, they are saying,

375
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:55,658
“Mother, there should be some written laws.” I said, “No.

376
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:59,823
It is through your experience also you can know.”

377
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:04,234
For example, the other day I said that there’s a Lakshmi Principle.

378
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:08,524
Now let us see how the Lakshmi Principle goes out.

379
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:15,175
Very simple, very easy if you want to know, it’s very simple.

380
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:22,908
Because this Lakshmi is very volatile, chancala [movable].

381
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:26,789
Once you give a hundred rupees to a servant,

382
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,407
immediately he’ll go to the pub and drink :

383
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:34,146
the Lakshmi is dead; as soon as you give the Lakshmi,

384
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:38,107
he tries to go and drink in a pub.

385
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:42,257
So you can imagine what is the situation is with this Lakshmi.

386
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:46,512
She is very good but also She tempts you.

387
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,761
She tempts you very much.

388
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:53,667
So, you see, you have to watch: whatever money you have

389
00:27:53,787 --> 00:27:56,405
you should put in the bank or do whatever you like,

390
00:27:56,525 --> 00:28:01,211
but just don’t spend the whole lot. Just don’t do it.

391
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:07,329
Secondly you must know also, if all the doors are closed

392
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:13,177
and you get Lakshmi from one door She will stay, no doubt

393
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:17,516
She will stay; if you are miserly She will stay,

394
00:28:17,636 --> 00:28:22,378
but She will rot because She has no outlet.

395
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:26,365
So if you open the other door, you will be amazed

396
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:30,653
that not only this Lakshmi can go out

397
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:37,239
but also can get much more air, much more freedom from outside,

398
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,690
because you’ve opened the other door.

399
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:45,955
With one door you just experiment, nothing comes in it.

400
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:49,488
You open one door, no air will come, nothing will come in.

401
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:54,197
But you open the second door, then you will find

402
00:28:54,317 --> 00:29:00,853
that there’s gushing of currents inside the room.

403
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:06,308
In the same way a person who wants to have money

404
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:10,882
should first learn to spend whatever money he has.

405
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:14,219
And in this Kali Yuga this is one of the blessings,

406
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:19,896
because the job of Kali Yuga is to create doubts,

407
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:22,628
to create illusions, bhramat

408
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:27,600
so it will go on creating. But if you stick on to the truth,

409
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,109
then it won’t work out, it won’t work out.

410
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:37,678
So it is important to understand that all the time

411
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:40,711
we are under a testing ground.

412
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,781
It is a thing just to be witnessed.

413
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:50,446
It’s very interesting to see how this Lakshmi

414
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:54,545
wants to run away from the house of a man

415
00:29:54,665 --> 00:30:00,833
who is only interested in cheating,

416
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:06,969
interested in grabbing, in telling lies.

417
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:12,045
So this Lakshmi doesn’t stay with him. She goes away.

418
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:20,188
All these things are happening around us.

419
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:26,516
I am not saying this offhand, it’s all there – horrible!

420
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:31,431
You see it’s to see, we have to clearly see

421
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:33,648
the movement of your mind.

422
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:38,008
Where is it going, where is it thinking?

423
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:42,077
Lakshmi is the One, She makes you think about some things

424
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:43,555
which you should not think.

425
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,387
As I told you people will start drinking,

426
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:51,980
they will to go to races, they will drink a lot

427
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,819
– I mean they’ll do everything.

428
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:59,254
Why? Because they have money, now they must spend somewhere.

429
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:03,957
But they will put it into things which has no investment

430
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,783
in the real good, in the real achievement.

431
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:17,763
And that’s how we have now people who are spending so much money,

432
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:21,864
so much on wasteful things.

433
00:31:21,984 --> 00:31:26,511
So wastefulness can never, never

434
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:34,305
achieve the goal that is yours;

435
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:41,023
and the goal that is yours is the fulfillment of your being,

436
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:48,886
to become the Spirit. It’s very, very subtle to understand.

437
00:31:49,006 --> 00:31:51,958
You think you are doing nothing wrong; what’s that?

438
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:55,377
– after all, while I am doing something wrong

439
00:31:55,497 --> 00:32:01,495
or something serious, the body should react. But no.

440
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:06,016
Nothing will react, neither your mind nor your body.

441
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:17,114
You see, all these years My experience has been very simple,

442
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:21,221
that there are some Sahaja Yogis still involved

443
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,976
in the Lakshmi Principle:

444
00:32:24,738 --> 00:32:27,986
like they want to cheat Me,

445
00:32:28,106 --> 00:32:31,732
they want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:35,895
Then there are some people who want to do business among themselves.

447
00:32:36,015 --> 00:32:39,689
All of them have failed very badly,

448
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:45,637
failed so badly that they are like bankrupts

449
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,899
or they are in jail, and all kinds of things.

450
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:54,886
So, never do business with a Sahaja Yogi.

451
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:58,385
For Sahaja Yogi it is very important

452
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:02,957
not to do any business with the Sahaja Yogis.

453
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:05,889
If you understand this simple principle

454
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:08,528
you will not do business with Sahaja Yoga.

455
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:11,171
Of course you can’t do business with Me also.

456
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:16,900
So this is a very, very simple thing in which people start doing.

457
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,039
For example they meet, two Sahaja Yogis:

458
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:27,671
one from say, from Japan, and another from say, America.

459
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,428
And they start saying, “Oh, you are a Sahaja Yogi,

460
00:33:30,548 --> 00:33:35,099
I am also a Sahaja Yogi. Can you give me some, a false paper,

461
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:37,948
or you can give me some report?”

462
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,843
They go on asking you questions.

463
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:43,073
“But why? We don’t want. We don’t want to do that.”

464
00:33:43,193 --> 00:33:45,779
They are not interested [in you?], they are interested

465
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,467
in what you have.

466
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:50,921
And this is something one has to learn

467
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:57,668
very cleverly and intelligently, when people start

468
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:02,525
communicating to you about the business part.

469
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:06,124
In Sahaja Yoga there is no business among themselves,

470
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:12,771
except they have business with Self Realization.

471
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:17,735
If you understand this point, small,

472
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:23,713
the money part of it which is quite illusive will disappear.

473
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,133
It all works out beautifully if you are surrendered,

474
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:34,403
but otherwise also it can be worked out,

475
00:34:34,523 --> 00:34:36,999
even if you are not surrendered;

476
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,926
because you see the result and you are hurt,

477
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:46,171
you are troubled, and so you give it up.

478
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:53,677
So whatever happens, it’s our watching system

479
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:56,926
– I should say, one of the chakras –

480
00:34:57,355 --> 00:35:02,336
here you can see clearly: by watching.

481
00:35:02,456 --> 00:35:06,750
Clearly you see how much you have gone into trouble,

482
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,797
so you give it up.

483
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:12,444
But before doing that we have a very good way

484
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:18,236
of seeing through our vibrations.

485
00:35:18,356 --> 00:35:21,242
You just feel the vibrations and see for yourself:

486
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:23,504
if the vibrations are good, well and good.

487
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,027
If they are not all right then should know

488
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,916
that there is something wrong.

489
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:30,391
You can judge any human being you like,

490
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:34,296
you can judge any pastor or if you want to see any one

491
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:38,674
of these millionaires and all those things,

492
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:41,800
but first you must find out:

493
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:50,662
that one, is he a perfect Sahaja Yogi or not?

494
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:55,325
This happens with the individuals.

495
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,130
It can happen in the collective also.

496
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,324
I have seen in the collective people are so much misled,

497
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:04,364
and one negative person immediately knows

498
00:36:04,484 --> 00:36:09,021
who is the other negative, and then he gets hold of that negative

499
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:11,818
and they start working together.

500
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:17,657
So you have to be extremely cautious

501
00:36:17,777 --> 00:36:23,210
that you have got your Realization, you’ve got everything,

502
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:28,056
you’ve got also lot of money in Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:31,037
With all that you should know

504
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:38,655
it’s a very, very good sign for thieves to walk in.

505
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:42,126
So you should be very careful

506
00:36:42,246 --> 00:36:48,553
and don’t get charmed by all these nonsensical things.

507
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,589
That’s what is the protection from your Mother,

508
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:56,269
that She wants to protect you in this way.

509
00:36:56,389 --> 00:37:06,173
Our whole attitude towards life has to be that of a witness:

510
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,676
you see everything clearly.

511
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:14,561
Gradually this seeing will become so very sharp,

512
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:20,216
so clear-cut, so understanding that you will be amazed.

513
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:26,770
Then you will be using some thing there, anything you are using.

514
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:30,804
Then you don’t have to think,

515
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:33,578
only you have to know the vibrations:

516
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:37,122
what are the vibrations are, what do the vibrations say,

517
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:40,448
because they are there to guide you.

518
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:51,151
Those who are not yet very good at vibrations

519
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,175
should try to establish themselves.

520
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,000
If you are not good at vibrations

521
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,182
that means you will not judge people rightly,

522
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:01,273
nor will they have knowledge properly.

523
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:05,457
So first you must get your, all your vibrations corrected

524
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:07,578
and also chakras corrected.

525
00:38:07,699 --> 00:38:15,474
After that you can see what are your associates, who are they?

526
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:23,094
See actually, your mind now is so enlightened

527
00:38:23,214 --> 00:38:28,813
that you can straightforward see everything before you.

528
00:38:29,979 --> 00:38:33,729
But if you don’t use that enlightened mind

529
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:39,096
you will be amazed, there are some forces of negativity,

530
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,391
and once these forces start

531
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:50,703
- You see, actually I should say we are at a juncture now

532
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:54,015
that these things won’t happen any more.

533
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:57,056
But when I started Sahaja Yoga it was very bad,

534
00:38:57,176 --> 00:39:02,300
very bad situation, and we had half-baked,

535
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:11,938
quarter-baked, one-sixteenth-baked people [Laughs].

536
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,198
And I just didn’t know how to tell them,

537
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:19,211
because if I tell them anything they would just run away.

538
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:21,229
They would not come to Sahaja Yoga.

539
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:24,848
While in the other places like gurus, what they do,

540
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:27,640
they take money and – “bas” (enough), that’s all.

541
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,634
Now people think: ”Now we have given money to the guru,

542
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:34,368
how can we leave?” Maybe they go on giving money and sticking on.

543
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:36,944
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s no money involved.

544
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:40,825
So they come, then they disappear.

545
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:43,135
Very common; it’s very, very common

546
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:46,129
that they come for a short time to Sahaja Yoga.

547
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:50,893
But if they are really special people they just stick,

548
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,136
and start seeing everything from the right angle

549
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:59,299
because they are enlightened,

550
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:02,946
they have grown up, they are mature.

551
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,529
So this is how we have to come back

552
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:12,255
to this horrible night of Kali Yuga through Diwali.

553
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,576
This is what we have to do,

554
00:40:14,696 --> 00:40:20,805
to be humble and to find whether you are all right or not,

555
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:24,709
whether you are going in the right direction or not.

556
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:27,870
It is you only who can decide.

557
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,294
With vibrations you can immediately know that you are catching,

558
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:34,449
or you will know you are right.

559
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:36,460
Whatever decision has to be taken,

560
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,858
you have to use your hands fully.

561
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:45,269
It’s not talking that is going to help,

562
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:49,979
it’s not giving lectures that is going to help – no.

563
00:40:54,232 --> 00:41:00,571
It is through experimenting, through understanding,

564
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:11,120
through the feelings or the deep, I should say the deep impact

565
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,807
of everything that will communicate to you

566
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:18,934
what sort of a people they are, what they are talking about,

567
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:20,672
what you should do.

568
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,183
This could be a little mental,

569
00:41:23,303 --> 00:41:28,712
but later on it becomes absolutely beyond the mental activity.

570
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:38,457
Now as it is, I said that Kali Yuga is over,

571
00:41:38,577 --> 00:41:41,152
is about to finish.

572
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:45,426
But still there may be people who will try to go back

573
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:49,504
to this kind of normalcy, so-called.

574
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:55,135
But there is a way out for all this, is simple meditation.

575
00:41:55,255 --> 00:42:02,547
With meditation you can achieve whatever is to be achieved,

576
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:08,008
and then you’ll be surprised that we have been given

577
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,320
very, very important thing to be done.

578
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,930
And the most important thing is to be watchful about yourself,

579
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:22,387
that I hope you are not falling into the trap of Lakshmi.

580
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:28,011
The same Lakshmi that decorates you can also disfigure you.

581
00:42:29,225 --> 00:42:34,297
So we have to do everything to keep this beautiful Lakshmi,

582
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:40,270
this decorated Lakshmi as our ideal, and it works out.

583
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:50,819
Our aim is this, our ideal is this and we have to do this,

584
00:42:50,939 --> 00:42:58,608
so we can establish the new government, very beautiful government.

585
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:10,926
Our whole attitude should be such that we have to be alert,

586
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,426
because you become meditative.

587
00:43:13,546 --> 00:43:16,930
As soon as you start thinking about something

588
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,360
you’ll become meditative. Your thinking will go away.

589
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:26,167
You won’t be able to think, and then you can be lost?

590
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:32,234
But no, when you are meditative then you cannot be lost. Why?

591
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:40,181
Because then you have given your life in the hands of truth.

592
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:45,751
You have given your hand into the hand of reality

593
00:43:45,871 --> 00:43:49,275
and that guides you, that protects you, that watches…

594
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:53,035
that watches you, that helps you – you can never go wrong.

595
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:55,333
Even if you are meditative

596
00:43:55,453 --> 00:43:57,855
don’t you worry, nothing will happen to you.

597
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:03,977
But if you are never meditative, then it’s impossible to save.

598
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:08,047
It’s impossible to save, it’s impossible to mature;

599
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:13,309
you have to be very meditative to mature. That’s very important.

600
00:44:13,429 --> 00:44:18,142
I would say that all the Sahaja Yogis here today

601
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:22,796
are doing this puja, and then there will be also

602
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:28,114
another puja of enlightenment I have been called, or whatever it is;

603
00:44:28,234 --> 00:44:32,394
but you have to be very, very careful

604
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:35,854
not to renounce your meditative mood.

605
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:39,322
What you can do is to watch

606
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:44,474
how far you have gone, how far you have solved your problems.

607
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:46,220
As soon as you see that,

608
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,677
immediately you become a complete realized soul.

609
00:44:53,495 --> 00:44:57,226
So the guideline is such that

610
00:44:57,844 --> 00:45:01,608
we should know that we are realized souls.

611
00:45:01,728 --> 00:45:04,247
And what is so important?

612
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:09,711
Why have we become realized souls? Not only for our desires,

613
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:12,987
for our pure desires but also for others.

614
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:15,884
And in that understanding

615
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,774
that we are not only for ourselves but for others,

616
00:45:19,894 --> 00:45:22,948
you become collectively conscious,

617
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:26,341
and you start helping others.

618
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:28,090
You’ll stand very well;

619
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,999
otherwise you are lost and the others are also lost.

620
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,004
This way is the way we have to really go ahead,

621
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:39,341
go ahead towards the truth

622
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:42,169
and bring that truth for the other people,

623
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:45,590
for other people, and save them.

624
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:51,742
This is how you can express your love to them, all your caring.

625
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:04,818
It is a subject which is very difficult to handle, I think,

626
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:13,423
because of – I should say that to talk about this subject

627
00:46:13,543 --> 00:46:18,634
is much easier than to assimilate this within ourselves.

628
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:20,783
So now when you are listening to Me,

629
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:24,656
please try that you have to meditate afterwards.

630
00:46:24,776 --> 00:46:28,019
In meditation you will assimilate,

631
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:33,101
and the same power that you think is within you

632
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:36,902
of discrimination, of giving vibrations,

633
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:39,507
of doing all kinds of things out of Sahaja Yoga

634
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:43,407
will be completely, continuously be acting.

635
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:50,127
But if you do not meditate, if you are somewhere else,

636
00:46:50,247 --> 00:46:53,324
it won’t work out. It won’t work out.

637
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:56,177
So today is the day to celebrate

638
00:46:56,297 --> 00:47:00,029
and to be happy that we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over,

639
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:02,021
there is hope for the whole world,

640
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:07,425
and we can save all people who are lost in the wilderness.

641
00:47:07,545 --> 00:47:09,380
That’s a fact, no doubt.

642
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,503
But after that celebration and everything

643
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:18,048
we should sit back on the, we can call, on the asanam or anywhere

644
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,119
and watch what is happening;

645
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,644
and you will be amazed that in meditation

646
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:28,972
you will be revealed with all the beauties you have achieved,

647
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:32,007
all kinds of things that you have achieved.

648
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:37,561
And all the worries and botherations of things disappear.

649
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:40,128
This should happen to you all,

650
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:44,130
and this is what I request you all to have

651
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:50,980
this special capacity to understand yourself.

652
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:58,939
My own hope is fulfilled.

653
00:48:01,156 --> 00:48:06,359
To see you sitting down here I feel overjoyed,

654
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,134
and same way you will also feel

655
00:48:10,254 --> 00:48:17,786
when you all will try to raise the Kundalini of others,

656
00:48:17,906 --> 00:48:20,289
establish them in Sahaja Yoga

657
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:22,824
– to be amazed what will happen to you.

658
00:48:22,944 --> 00:48:27,287
It’s so joyous to give Realizations to others.

659
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,417
For that you don’t have to do anything,

660
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:31,675
to pay anything, nothing of the kind;

661
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,880
this power you have which is awakened, that’s all.

662
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,679
I mean, what you have to do is to,

663
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:39,633
wherever you go you have to just awaken the Kundalini

664
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,396
of the person, give Realization.

665
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:47,484
Nothing needs to be done. And that’s so joy-giving,

666
00:48:47,604 --> 00:48:49,939
you feel so happy about it.

667
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:54,449
So today I bless you all with this special power

668
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:57,572
that you give Realization to people

669
00:48:57,692 --> 00:49:02,467
and look after the Nabhi of the people, and whatever it is.

670
00:49:03,872 --> 00:49:11,101
It is very, very important to understand how far you can go.

671
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:15,646
We have to change the world, we have to save the world.

672
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:18,276
It’s your responsibility.

673
00:49:18,396 --> 00:49:22,415
You have got Realization, not the others,

674
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:25,350
so don’t try to find faults with others.

675
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:29,045
Think about you, that you have Realization

676
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:35,978
and it is expected that you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

677
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,496
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

678
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:44,257
Today, I’m getting so meditative that I don’t know!

679
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,183
May God bless you all.
