00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:20.378
Today we have decided to have Shri Krishna
Puja in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.883
Though this is the land of Shri Krishna,

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:39.280
people ask Me why the people are not
spiritual.

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:47.922
How is it they get entangled into different
types of seekings

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:52.157
which are not leading to truth?

00:00:52.358 --> 00:01:01.023
Why is it the people in America are not
so alert as to recognize

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:06.707
what is the truth and what they have
to find?

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:14.809
Shri Krishna’s time was, as you know,

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:22.756
at least two thousand after Shri Rama.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:28.877
And Shri Rama created lots of disciplines

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:38.715
for human beings to follow in the path
of their ascent.

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:43.068
According to the time everything works out.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:52.029
So people were extremely rigid,
disciplined,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:06.421
and it so happened that people lost
the touch with the truth.

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:16.174
They would leave their wives, ill-treat
their wives,

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:23.398
do all kinds of things in the name
of Shri Rama;

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:30.647
because always human beings take
to something which is not right.

00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:37.462
The another side they never saw, how
Rama went after Sitaji to find Her,

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:49.106
and He fought the horrible rakshasa Ravana
to get back His wife.

00:02:49.307 --> 00:02:53.605
So the other side people never see.

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.652
Only this side they saw that He was very
strict with His wife,

00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:03.724
and if the wife stayed over in some
function, He got so angry,

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:09.946
and He shouted at Her and He threw Her out,
and all those things.

00:03:11.053 --> 00:03:20.562
That is how Shri Krishna came in.

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:28.140
Always incarnations come one after another
to correct themselves only.

00:03:28.341 --> 00:03:34.654
When Shri Krishna found that it is
on the other side, of ego –

00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:37.539
that men thought they were very powerful
people

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.922
and they could do whatever they liked,

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:43.910
and they had all the power to judge their
wives –

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:50.785
so Shri Krishna came with a new diversion,

00:03:50.986 --> 00:03:57.490
or I should say, from a new idea about
life.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:10.369
He talked of freedom, He talked
of abandonment,

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:16.703
and He talked that life is for enjoyment.

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:22.890
Radha was the source of joy.

00:04:23.091 --> 00:04:27.808
“Ra” is energy, “dha” means the one who
sustains energy.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.446
She was the source of joy,

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:41.202
and His idea was, to enjoy life is the best
way to live.

00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:47.026
And that’s why He said that you should play
Holi,

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:51.396
you should enjoy yourselves, you must have
Raas,

00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:59.429
by which you enjoy group dancing and
freedom.

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.331
So people thought that’s the way one has
to live -

00:05:05.532 --> 00:05:14.708
is to be absolutely free, live as you like,
specially in America.

00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:20.355
They thought that to enjoy life is
complete abandonment:

00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:25.338
no discipline, no bindings,

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.484
you can divorce your wife eight times and
husbands ten times.

00:05:30.685 --> 00:05:34.183
That sort of a life started long time back,

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:38.745
but it really prospered in America.

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:44.324
The prosperity of this kind of a culture
came to such a level

00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:50.150
that now we don’t know what’s going
to happen to the family system,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.512
to the joy part of it.

00:05:57.373 --> 00:06:02.043
Again here people forgot the other side
of it.

00:06:02.522 --> 00:06:09.790
Adi Shakti first created Shri Ganesh.

00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:15.313
Shri Ganesh is the source of wisdom,

00:06:15.793 --> 00:06:20.301
He’s the source of auspiciousness.

00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:32.607
Through Him we understand auspiciousness.

00:06:32.808 --> 00:06:39.060
And He is a child, He is an eternal child.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:49.980
And this behavior of abandonment is
very destructive,

00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:53.678
if there is no wisdom.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:02.694
First thing was to establish wisdom within
ourselves.

00:07:02.895 --> 00:07:10.869
But we start a theory or a kind of
a pattern of life

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.646
without thinking have we got the wisdom
or not?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.930
Are we capable of following that pattern
of life

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:31.136
without any development of our wisdom?

00:07:31.337 --> 00:07:39.827
But the worst was when the freedom became
the criteria of life,

00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:47.035
people became extremely dominating and
egoistical.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.127
The first answer always you will get it,
“What’s wrong?”

00:07:55.328 --> 00:08:00.097
You ask them, “Why are you doing this?”
“What’s wrong?”

00:08:00.526 --> 00:08:04.212
“I mean, it’s wrong because it is not
auspicious.”

00:08:04.413 --> 00:08:13.855
“What’s auspiciousness is there?” –
absolutely like you can call them,

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:21.600
people without any brains, brainless
people.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:25.477
“Brainless” means there is no wisdom.

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:31.748
What is the power of brain is wisdom.

00:08:33.075 --> 00:08:52.593
So life started drifting into a destructive
pond, we should say, of no return.

00:08:52.865 --> 00:09:01.843
And every kind of filth was accepted
as a blessing,

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:09.253
and nobody would think that this is wrong,

00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:13.804
this is not for human life.

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:18.099
Even the animals are all not like that.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:30.643
Added to that came the stupidity
of drinking alcohol.

00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:40.612
I don’t know how they discovered alcohol
long time back, long, long time back,

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:45.554
but they say it came out of the manthana

00:09:45.755 --> 00:09:49.908
and out of the churning of the ocean

00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:58.241
by the suras and asuras, by the rakshasas
and by the devas.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:03.811
Must be some trick to get these rakshasas
drunk,

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:21.650
and to somehow or other manage to get the
kumbha of, the pitcher of amruta, ambrosia;

00:10:21.928 --> 00:10:26.065
so that these rakshasas will be lost
drinking

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:33.612
and then the devas will get their due,

00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:38.869
which was amruta, which was ambrosia.

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:47.882
That might be one of the reasons that
it was created out of the ocean,

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:53.826
or among all the fourteen things that came
out of the ocean.

00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:08.892
So kind of a oppositions, opposite quality
of things were created.

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:14.261
Another thing they created were
prostitutes.

00:11:15.104 --> 00:11:21.348
One may ask why prostitutes came out
of that manthana –

00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:26.351
because now you have freedom.

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:31.309
You are given freedom to choose,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:39.634
and so you must have full vision

00:11:39.835 --> 00:11:49.570
whether to choose an auspicious life,
a holy life, a divine life,

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.291
or to choose destructive life.

00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:57.483
This opposition came forward

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:03.074
because your freedom had to be respected,

00:12:03.275 --> 00:12:05.405
that was very important.

00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:10.557
In the growth of human awareness it was
very important

00:12:10.758 --> 00:12:14.501
to respect the freedom of human beings.

00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:20.723
Because animals, if you see, they have
no freedom:

00:12:20.924 --> 00:12:27.087
a snake will be a snake, scorpion will be
a scorpion,

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.099
lion will be a lion.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:37.090
They live with their own qualities, gunas;

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:44.137
you cannot make them do something that
other animals are doing.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:50.461
We have passed through all these different
animal yonis

00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:56.166
and now we are human beings, and now we
have freedom.

00:12:56.367 --> 00:13:00.034
Now why freedom, one may ask – because
these days they ask

00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:05.818
such questions for everything you say –
why freedom needed?

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:11.523
Like I always told you before that
in the school they teach you

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:17.247
two plus two is four, and you have
to remember it.

00:13:19.503 --> 00:13:22.907
But when you grow and when you go
to college,

00:13:23.108 --> 00:13:29.187
you are supposed to have freedom
to understand everything yourself.

00:13:32.612 --> 00:13:40.348
In the same manner, your awareness was
to be brought to that level

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:47.095
that you could use your freedom wisely.

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:53.242
Now, you have to have temptations.

00:13:53.443 --> 00:14:00.439
How can you judge a person whether he is
blind or not blind?

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:08.100
Supposing you ask a blind person, “Is this
a flower?”

00:14:08.433 --> 00:14:12.740
He might feel it, say, “No, no, it’s
a bee.”

00:14:13.703 --> 00:14:18.014
So he has to have his eyes to see,

00:14:18.215 --> 00:14:24.515
and once you give him the eyes he goes
amok.

00:14:24.754 --> 00:14:30.312
He doesn’t know what to do, what is good
for him.

00:14:30.513 --> 00:14:38.672
So he chose all that was not at all good
for him,

00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:45.520
auspicious for him, and detrimental for his
growth.

00:14:46.572 --> 00:14:50.597
So the drinking started, and with drinking

00:14:50.798 --> 00:14:56.379
you don’t know how we get abandoned.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:03.974
I have heard people, that they lose their
sense of relationship with brothers,

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:09.441
sisters, mothers, everything, if you get
drunk.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.826
So many drunkards have told Me this.

00:15:13.027 --> 00:15:17.157
That is why in this country we have funny
type of relationships –

00:15:17.358 --> 00:15:22.630
one can’t understand, how can it be?
But it is so.

00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:25.904
By drinking, all these things have happened

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:28.474
that they don’t know who is your sister,

00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:32.547
who is your wife, who is your mother.

00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:40.251
In India also we have but different type
of thing,

00:15:40.452 --> 00:15:44.168
that they will ill-treat their mother,
they’ll ill-treat their sister,

00:15:44.369 --> 00:15:48.537
ill-treat their wives; the other way round
also.

00:15:48.738 --> 00:15:53.459
But here they do not ill-treat,

00:15:55.479 --> 00:16:00.355
they love, but in a very perverted manner.

00:16:01.381 --> 00:16:05.121
You see the reaction in two countries.

00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:09.107
So this grew up very much,

00:16:09.307 --> 00:16:18.787
and today we see a country that is America
in a complete chaos.

00:16:29.454 --> 00:16:35.861
So this freedom without any wisdom at all
growing,

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:44.362
starts creating a terrible ego.

00:16:45.102 --> 00:16:53.686
When auspiciousness is given up then
Shri Ganesha sleeps

00:16:53.887 --> 00:17:03.381
and as Christ, who is the incarnation
of Shri Ganesha, also doesn’t bother.

00:17:04.145 --> 00:17:08.465
So the rule of Christ is finished.

00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:17.418
So what rules is the ego, this ego which
thinks it is free.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:27.693
It doesn’t know it is bound by all kinds
of enemies of very horrible types.

00:17:28.553 --> 00:17:31.050
At the time of Shri Krishna He said

00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:36.535
that the worst enemy human beings have is
anger,

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:40.460
but I think in modern times the worst enemy

00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:47.023
human beings have is greed and jealousy.

00:17:47.395 --> 00:17:52.319
Greed has no meaning these days. I mean,
what do you say to a person

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:59.541
who has three thousand shoes – I mean,
pairs of shoes?

00:17:59.742 --> 00:18:02.682
Must be mad!

00:18:03.462 --> 00:18:07.686
There are all sorts of things, you know,
in greed you see these days.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:13.606
You don’t know how people are really
behaving.

00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:15.989
No one can explain.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:23.293
I know of someone who has five thousand
dogs.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:30.099
What is she doing with those dogs I don’t
know, but she has.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:43.138
Like all countries, even in America
I think it’s much worse, much worse.

00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:48.278
Now you may call it anything, consumerism
or anything like that,

00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:52.043
or your economics which is, I think, very
faulty,

00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:57.196
it doesn’t understand human beings –
whatever it may be,

00:18:57.397 --> 00:19:00.662
it can never bring benevolence,

00:19:00.863 --> 00:19:06.295
neither to the person who thinks he is
rich,

00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:14.013
or to the people whom he is exploiting.

00:19:16.087 --> 00:19:19.642
As far as spirituality is concerned,

00:19:19.843 --> 00:19:26.563
they are all away from the realm
of divinity.

00:19:26.764 --> 00:19:29.884
Now the mind starts working with ego.

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:33.832
Ego takes over like a computer,

00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:36.970
and it starts suggesting ways and methods

00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:42.468
by which how much money you can earn.

00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:46.068
So when you start earning money,

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:51.120
then again the same Ego Mister tells you

00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:55.920
how to destroy yourself with this money.

00:19:56.923 --> 00:20:00.408
They do all kinds of things when they have
money.

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:05.016
I mean, that money is not a Lakshmi prasad;

00:20:05.217 --> 00:20:08.912
it is some sort of a money that becomes
like a rakshasa

00:20:09.113 --> 00:20:13.016
or a devil and which devours you.

00:20:13.217 --> 00:20:18.291
It takes you to all kinds of wrong places.

00:20:18.492 --> 00:20:24.650
It takes you to such horrible theories

00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:29.963
that nobody would accept such theories.

00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:35.914
This ego makes you feel that – ah, yes,
you are perfect,

00:20:36.115 --> 00:20:41.507
you know everything, whatever you are doing
is the best.

00:20:41.708 --> 00:20:45.901
But with all that doing, what happens?

00:20:46.102 --> 00:20:51.090
You become restless, you cannot sleep.

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:59.353
Now with the problem here is that people
have this so-called tension, stress.

00:20:59.554 --> 00:21:03.551
In our young age we never heard of
this word, what is tension, stress is.

00:21:03.751 --> 00:21:07.911
Even now in India very few people know
about it.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.007
Because you yourself, you are destroying
yourself.

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:17.800
So with this money, say, you want to entice
some woman –

00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:20.446
take a very low-level thing.

00:21:20.647 --> 00:21:24.214
Then you’ll run after her, give her this,
give her that,

00:21:24.415 --> 00:21:29.210
and spend all your money till you become
bankrupt.

00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:34.269
And then you’ll start sitting and crying.

00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.313
And this is a common story.

00:21:37.514 --> 00:21:40.681
I don’t know why don’t they make films
like this,

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:45.671
to show actually what happens to a person
who runs after money,

00:21:45.872 --> 00:21:48.101
and he goes on then spending that money.

00:21:48.302 --> 00:21:53.702
He doesn’t know what to do, you see; money
also eats him, I think.

00:21:53.903 --> 00:22:00.124
On the other side we have people who are
extremely miserly.

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:09.799
So all their – with the money only, they
become so much greedy

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.462
that they keep their money in seven locks
and keys.

00:22:14.663 --> 00:22:20.635
Now, they see in the world there are people
who are suffering so much,

00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:23.934
who have so much problem.

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:29.432
Why not spend some money on them?

00:22:29.892 --> 00:22:37.315
So then there are agents come up, like
our Swiss bank.

00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:46.771
Swiss bank is the outcome of our greed,
completely our greed;

00:22:46.972 --> 00:22:49.721
because we have so much money we don’t
know what to do,

00:22:49.922 --> 00:22:52.676
so we put it in the Swiss bank.

00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:56.483
Swiss bank says, “All right, we’ll look
after it.”

00:22:56.684 --> 00:23:01.234
Because we are greedy as well as we are
miserly.

00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:06.818
I mean, miserly people are another
crackpots, I should say, the way they live.

00:23:07.019 --> 00:23:11.618
But also the people who have money are
really crackpots.

00:23:11.819 --> 00:23:19.587
They have no sense of self-respect, neither
self-esteem.

00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:27.443
Now imagine eighty, ninety-year-old women
going for a shake dance, as I told you.

00:23:27.644 --> 00:23:31.313
Because they have money they think they
should do this,

00:23:31.514 --> 00:23:34.404
competing with the young people, because
they have money.

00:23:34.605 --> 00:23:42.015
If they have money, if they get it without
any, I should say,

00:23:42.216 --> 00:23:47.483
cheating or without deceiving someone,
if it’s a real good money

00:23:47.684 --> 00:23:55.975
they should give it to some good cause
and try to propagate goodness.

00:23:56.176 --> 00:24:01.401
But money itself seems to be something
very bad, like poison,

00:24:01.602 --> 00:24:10.164
because either this money makes you mad
how to spend it,

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:14.218
or mad how to save it.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.278
As if you become a slave of this money
business,

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:25.636
and in that slavishness you go on drifting,
drifting, drifting.

00:24:26.635 --> 00:24:34.095
I’ve seen people when they talk,

00:24:34.296 --> 00:24:37.138
you don’t know why they talk like that,
you know.

00:24:37.339 --> 00:24:39.908
Then you discover that they have a bank
account,

00:24:40.109 --> 00:24:43.202
that’s why they are talking like that.

00:24:44.345 --> 00:24:49.319
If you don’t have bank account then you
won’t talk like that.

00:24:50.186 --> 00:24:52.495
I mean, more than that also.

00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:57.254
This country is overflowing with money,

00:24:57.455 --> 00:25:01.424
with all kinds of money transactions,

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.266
permutations and combinations and this
and that,

00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:11.570
and what you can do with money – because
Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:18.085
He is the Deity, or we can say He is
the God of wealth.

00:25:18.286 --> 00:25:25.659
But at the same time, He is a very
mischievous God.

00:25:26.095 --> 00:25:31.093
You can see clearly: this is supposed to be
Shri Krishna’s country

00:25:31.294 --> 00:25:34.913
which is overflowing with money.

00:25:35.114 --> 00:25:39.561
At the same time you find horrible things
happening,

00:25:39.762 --> 00:25:41.507
worst in the whole world.

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:44.724
I mean, no one can beat Americans, they
say,

00:25:44.925 --> 00:25:59.244
in stupidity, in vulgarity, indecency,
exploitation.

00:26:01.651 --> 00:26:08.804
So this is the curse of money on human
beings, which is to be understood,

00:26:09.005 --> 00:26:17.960
that freedom without wisdom is the most
dangerous thing to use.

00:26:18.603 --> 00:26:23.782
It is better not to be free if you have
no wisdom,

00:26:23.983 --> 00:26:27.309
because God knows what you will do

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:30.932
if you have freedom and no wisdom.

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:38.599
I’ve seen here, heard about women who are
killing their children.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.812
I mean, nowhere you will find such a thing
like that, killing small children.

00:26:45.013 --> 00:26:50.893
Now how this money makes you so dry

00:26:51.094 --> 00:27:03.651
that you have no, I would say, no love,
no feeling.

00:27:03.866 --> 00:27:08.967
Just for killing’s sake also, people kill
here.

00:27:15.736 --> 00:27:20.444
Now there are – there’s another thing that
this money does:

00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:25.071
it creates a disparity.

00:27:25.507 --> 00:27:32.119
There are some who are very rich,
there are some who are very poor.

00:27:32.436 --> 00:27:40.228
So those who are very poor are against
those who are very rich.

00:27:40.429 --> 00:27:46.081
They can’t understand why should these
people have so much money,

00:27:46.282 --> 00:27:48.857
so they think it’s a matter of right

00:27:49.058 --> 00:27:54.326
to snatch all that money from them and use
it for themselves.

00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:58.845
But the same money can destroy them also.

00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:06.176
So snatching that money with violence or
grabbing it

00:28:06.377 --> 00:28:10.889
is not going to give you any blessings.

00:28:14.298 --> 00:28:19.471
So what is the purpose of wealth?

00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:26.760
That is very important for people who
worship Shri Krishna to know.

00:28:26.961 --> 00:28:33.380
In Shri Krishna’s life, He saw that
the women

00:28:33.581 --> 00:28:39.864
who were creating buttermilk and butter

00:28:40.065 --> 00:28:45.719
were carrying all that all the way
to Mathura,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.922
where in Mathura this horrible King Kamsa
was reigning.

00:28:51.123 --> 00:28:56.478
And they used to give to all the soldiers
there.

00:28:56.711 --> 00:28:59.852
He didn’t want them to do that.

00:29:00.053 --> 00:29:02.372
Because they would fetch much more money,

00:29:02.573 --> 00:29:10.102
they would be paid much more, so these
women were greedy about it.

00:29:10.303 --> 00:29:14.987
Instead of giving them to their own
children, to their own families,

00:29:15.188 --> 00:29:21.198
they used to collect all that and take
to Mathura.

00:29:21.543 --> 00:29:29.581
From very childhood Shri Krishna used
to throw stones at those pitchers

00:29:29.782 --> 00:29:35.096
and break their pitchers, because he didn’t
want

00:29:35.297 --> 00:29:45.125
that to go all the way to Mathura to feed
those horrible soldiers.

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:50.469
This is what it is we have to learn,

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:57.437
that if we have, say, surplus money or
something,

00:29:57.638 --> 00:30:00.497
you have to think what you can do with it

00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:13.366
and what joy it can bring, by sharing with
right type of people.

00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:17.851
Not in the pubs, no, no, I don’t mean that,

00:30:18.052 --> 00:30:25.267
but sharing it for their needs and what
they want.

00:30:25.468 --> 00:30:33.112
Actually a disciple of Shri Krishna should
be a self-satisfied person.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:40.254
Look at His life, how self-satisfied He
was.

00:30:40.516 --> 00:30:52.656
Every episode about Him talks of His
complete oneness with Himself.

00:30:54.595 --> 00:30:58.818
For example, when Arjuna asked Him that

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:03.649
“Why don’t You join us Pandavas to fight
with us?”

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:10.901
In modern times in the competitive life,
you see, if you see those races,

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:16.394
they’re so anxious to win, to have
the higher position.

00:31:16.595 --> 00:31:23.710
Then all the big, big politicians are
trying

00:31:23.911 --> 00:31:30.607
to bring down other politicians, to have
their own power.

00:31:30.808 --> 00:31:37.129
But what did Shri Krishna say, that “I will
be your charioteer.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:46.069
I’ll drive your chariot, but I will not
lift My weapon against anyone.”

00:31:46.554 --> 00:31:50.908
We can’t think of anyone like that today.

00:31:51.352 --> 00:31:55.071
See, people will never say that,
“All right,

00:31:55.272 --> 00:32:01.266
I will stay down and you’ll be
on the throne.”

00:32:01.467 --> 00:32:04.849
Very difficult even to see one person

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:08.336
who could behave like Shri Krishna.

00:32:08.537 --> 00:32:17.878
Because whether He is a charioteer or He
is the one who was Arjuna,

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:26.950
or He was the captain of the whole thing,
He knew what He was.

00:32:27.151 --> 00:32:32.648
What was the need for Him to become this
or that, and that?

00:32:32.849 --> 00:32:38.256
But these days, you see, to become
something is such a struggle going on.

00:32:38.457 --> 00:32:42.572
Someone wants to be, say, the prime
minister –

00:32:42.773 --> 00:32:45.368
that’s the highest, I think, I don’t know.

00:32:45.569 --> 00:32:50.898
But then some want to dislodge the prime
minister.

00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:53.428
Then you start from the peon upward,

00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:58.096
everybody wants something higher, higher,
higher, higher.

00:32:58.297 --> 00:33:02.425
This is another very subtle type of greed

00:33:02.626 --> 00:33:09.124
which is working out in our minds.

00:33:09.325 --> 00:33:15.225
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen that
the leaders –

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:18.022
now are settled down of course, much
better –

00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:22.988
but used to be such a terrible fight
for leadership.

00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:27.866
It’s all a myth, actual myth, but they used
to fight.

00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:32.211
And they would write letters after letters.
There were groups:

00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:35.687
one group would write against another
group,

00:33:35.887 --> 00:33:38.039
another group would write against this
group,

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:47.267
and I used to just laugh, because there’s
no truth in it.

00:33:47.468 --> 00:33:50.897
Leadership is no truth, it’s just a joke.

00:33:51.098 --> 00:33:54.801
But even if I told them it’s a joke, they
would not understand

00:33:55.002 --> 00:34:00.697
it’s a joke and not to be that serious,
and to fight about it.

00:34:02.596 --> 00:34:07.428
Gradually it’s settled down normally –
better, much better, it’s not so much bad.

00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:11.758
But that is what is there, this greed.

00:34:11.959 --> 00:34:14.873
That was the mistake, I think, of Shri
Krishna,

00:34:15.074 --> 00:34:21.254
that instead of anger He should have put
greed as the worst thing.

00:34:22.811 --> 00:34:27.092
Actually, you see, these incarnations don’t
know much about human beings,

00:34:27.293 --> 00:34:29.620
and they would not know how far they will
be going –

00:34:29.821 --> 00:34:31.691
same happens to Me.

00:34:31.892 --> 00:34:37.826
But they are absolutely unaware that
what these human beings are,

00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:45.011
what you tell them, what they will make
out of it.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.408
Their brains are so sharp

00:34:49.608 --> 00:34:53.262
that they’ll pick up whatever is wrong
for them,

00:34:53.463 --> 00:34:58.421
and never see whatever is right for them.

00:34:59.311 --> 00:35:03.560
Shri Rama tried something – it was of no
use.

00:35:03.761 --> 00:35:07.595
Shri Krishna tried something – it was of no
use.

00:35:07.796 --> 00:35:12.546
So we come to Shri Jesus Christ.

00:35:12.747 --> 00:35:20.691
Nowadays the people who are something
else are ardent disciples of Christ.

00:35:26.978 --> 00:35:31.559
They have no wisdom of any kind.

00:35:33.873 --> 00:35:38.010
Like mad they are going about.

00:35:38.211 --> 00:35:40.317
You read there about their organizations,

00:35:40.518 --> 00:35:44.142
you read about things that they do,
you are amazed at it;

00:35:44.343 --> 00:35:49.119
you see, how can they be disciples
of Christ?

00:35:50.809 --> 00:35:56.520
In no way they have any right on Christ
to begin with,

00:35:56.721 --> 00:36:02.010
because they don’t know anything about
Christ.

00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:06.762
First to know and then to imbibe His
qualities

00:36:06.963 --> 00:36:16.289
are something very, very, I should say,
impossible thing it is these days.

00:36:16.765 --> 00:36:21.498
Some would say, “Why was He born in
a poor family?

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:26.893
He was born in a poor family – He should
have been born to Mr. Ford.”

00:36:27.094 --> 00:36:31.851
Some say – I mean, you see, finding faults
and criticizing

00:36:32.052 --> 00:36:36.038
is the only thing left to us now

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:40.336
because you can’t do anything else, that’s
why.

00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:45.182
Then they would say, “Why did He get
himself crucified?”

00:36:45.383 --> 00:36:48.061
He didn’t crucify you. He should have
crucified you,

00:36:48.262 --> 00:36:53.446
but actually He crucified himself, that was
His mistake.

00:36:54.529 --> 00:37:02.207
It is also very difficult for human beings
to understand incarnations,

00:37:02.408 --> 00:37:05.870
because they are in juxtaposition.

00:37:06.071 --> 00:37:12.760
They are very different things, so human
beings can’t understand.

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:16.445
Now they are there to lead them,

00:37:16.646 --> 00:37:20.403
they are there to tell them what is to be
done;

00:37:20.604 --> 00:37:28.325
but the way they understand, you see, it’s
just absurd.

00:37:28.841 --> 00:37:36.849
For example, you know in Chicago I met
the head of the Hare Rama fellow.

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:41.257
Another puzzle he was to Me, really,

00:37:41.458 --> 00:37:44.303
because he came in a very thin dhoti

00:37:44.504 --> 00:37:49.118
and it was so very cold, and he was
shivering before Me.

00:37:49.618 --> 00:37:53.461
So I said, “Sir, why are you wearing such
a thin dhoti?

00:37:53.662 --> 00:37:56.583
You are shivering, I am very sorry.”

00:37:56.784 --> 00:38:02.415
He said, “Why? My guru has told me
that I should have a thin dhoti.”

00:38:02.616 --> 00:38:06.896
“Why?” “To go to heaven, to achieve my
ascent.”

00:38:07.097 --> 00:38:09.177
I said, “Really? He told you like that?

00:38:09.378 --> 00:38:12.998
But Shri Krishna never wore a thin dhoti.”

00:38:13.199 --> 00:38:14.908
“But I am not Shri Krishna,” he said –

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:21.229
see how the human mind tries to avoid.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:31.971
So now, then he had shaved his head and
had a big pony-tail behind.

00:38:32.172 --> 00:38:35.022
I asked him, “Why have you shaved your
head?”

00:38:35.223 --> 00:38:38.802
So he said, “Because my guru told me that
you have to shave your head

00:38:39.003 --> 00:38:41.964
if you have to go to heaven.”

00:38:42.165 --> 00:38:46.009
So I said, “But Shri Krishna did not shave
His head.”

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.170
“No, no, but He was incarnation. I have
to shave my head

00:38:50.371 --> 00:38:53.714
so I have to go to heaven.”

00:38:53.915 --> 00:39:00.184
So I told him, “See, Kabira has said that,

00:39:00.636 --> 00:39:10.625
‘These sheep are shaven and shorn every
year twice.

00:39:12.043 --> 00:39:18.328
And if they all go to heaven where will be
a place left for you?’ ”

00:39:18.529 --> 00:39:21.149
So he never understood Me. He got very
angry with Me,

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.669
and he said to Me, “Mother, You are talking
ill about my guru.”

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.030
I said, “I am not talking ill. I am your
Mother, I am just asking Me

00:39:30.231 --> 00:39:33.948
that what’s the use of wearing this thin
dhoti, that’s all.

00:39:34.149 --> 00:39:39.240
A Mother has a right to ask.” He got very
angry, he went away.

00:39:39.441 --> 00:39:44.350
And he’s the head of these Hare Ramas!

00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:55.882
So to understand the incarnation also
you have to be a realized soul,

00:39:56.083 --> 00:40:03.290
otherwise you cannot, because they look
very absurd.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:11.187
Without asking any questions if you can
become a realized soul –

00:40:11.388 --> 00:40:15.874
if you ask questions it’s one degree less –

00:40:16.075 --> 00:40:23.540
without questioning if you get your
realization, without any questions,

00:40:23.741 --> 00:40:26.909
then you have the highest marks.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:31.693
But if you, after questioning and this
thing and that thing,

00:40:31.894 --> 00:40:37.714
then you have less marks, because your
mind is very active,

00:40:37.915 --> 00:40:42.060
and the person whose mind is active

00:40:42.261 --> 00:40:47.502
cannot achieve something beyond the mind.

00:40:47.703 --> 00:40:50.791
You have to achieve it beyond the mind.

00:40:50.992 --> 00:40:55.871
This is one thing at least if you all
understand,

00:40:56.072 --> 00:41:00.184
I think My work is done.

00:41:00.938 --> 00:41:04.130
All tricks tried by Shri Krishna,

00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:07.516
all disciplines put by Shri Rama,

00:41:07.717 --> 00:41:12.299
all the gurus who tried their level best
to tell you what to do,

00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:24.478
is only to make you a yogi by taking you
beyond the mind.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.033
And then what happens?

00:41:30.234 --> 00:41:35.584
Then you are in connection with this
all-pervading Power

00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:39.327
which is looking after you, which protects
you, which helps you;

00:41:39.528 --> 00:41:51.184
in every way you are absolutely in charge
of this Paramachaitanya.

00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:55.623
Now supposing I do not take the citizenship
of America –

00:41:55.824 --> 00:41:59.737
of course I may never take, but supposing.

00:41:59.938 --> 00:42:04.919
Then this government is not in charge
of Me.

00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:12.752
But if I take, of course they’ll tax Me, do
all kinds of things, doesn’t matter,

00:42:12.953 --> 00:42:17.077
but at least they’ll be in charge.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.780
But this Paramchaitanya when it takes
over,

00:42:20.981 --> 00:42:27.655
it is love, is absolute love:

00:42:27.856 --> 00:42:36.182
love which thinks, understands,
coordinates, cooperates, works,

00:42:36.383 --> 00:42:41.269
and extremely sensitive.

00:42:42.151 --> 00:42:50.485
It works – I’m sometimes so surprised
the way it works,

00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:57.946
without fail, without making any mistakes.

00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:04.103
You don’t have to even tell, because you
are there.

00:43:05.378 --> 00:43:11.300
But to believe that we are there also
is a difficult task.

00:43:13.009 --> 00:43:20.483
With all the experiences you should believe
that you are there,

00:43:20.684 --> 00:43:24.345
but that is also quite a difficult task.

00:43:24.546 --> 00:43:28.487
So when we say they’re established Sahaja
yogis

00:43:28.688 --> 00:43:35.986
then what we mean is this, that they are
completely one,

00:43:36.216 --> 00:43:44.098
under complete charge of Paramachaitanya.

00:43:44.713 --> 00:43:47.999
That’s what we have to be.

00:43:48.644 --> 00:43:53.812
If you want to save this country, you have
to be that.

00:43:54.013 --> 00:43:57.133
No argument, no explanation, nothing;

00:43:57.334 --> 00:44:02.098
no fighting, no strikes, nothing.

00:44:02.299 --> 00:44:05.944
No placards is needed.

00:44:06.145 --> 00:44:12.008
You are the ones who will advertise Sahaja
Yoga.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:17.349
Every one of you should understand

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:23.741
that your life is very important at this
juncture.

00:44:25.245 --> 00:44:30.851
And you have to become that special person

00:44:31.052 --> 00:44:38.270
who reflects reality through the divine
love.

00:44:38.471 --> 00:44:41.103
May God bless you.
