1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,610
First thing to note is that on the night of new-moon and full-moon,

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,480
always there are dangers on your left and right sides.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,760
Specially on these two days, that is, the nights of new
moon and full moon, you should sleep very early at night.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,960
After singing bhajans, bow down before the photograph, meditate,

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,069
and keep your attention on Sahasrara
and go to sleep after taking bandhan.

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:42,260
That means you go into the unconscious the
moment your attention is at your Sahasrara.

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:46,380
There, give yourself a bandhan and you are saved.

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,271
During these two nights it should be observed particularly.

9
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:57,251
The night of new moon, you should meditate especially on Shri Shiva.

10
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:04,352
You should sleep after meditating on Shri Shiva

11
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:12,151
– that is the Spirit – and completely surrender yourself to Him.

12
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:17,532
On the night of full moon, you should meditate on
Shri Rama and surrender yourself to Him for protection.

13
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:24,497
The meaning of the word Ramchandra is “creativity”.

14
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:29,798
You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.

15
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:33,649
Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.

16
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:43,764
However on the seventh and ninth days of Lunar fortnights
(according to the Indian Calendar “saptami” and “navami”)

17
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:45,235
you have my special blessings.

18
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:54,236
Remember that you are specially blessed by Me on these two days.

19
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:59,880
Make some special arrangements so that
you can have proper meditation on these days.
