00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:24.041
The question was asked Me,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.625
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:32.875
And I kept it a secret.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.917
Today we should worship

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:45.750
the Paramachaitanya,

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:49.834
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:04.208
We are aware

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:08.999
that Paramachaitanya

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:13.166
does everything.

00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:17.291
At least mentally we know

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.500
that everything is worked out

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:24.041
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.333
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:32.208
But still,

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:38.667
it is not so much in our heart,

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.625
so much in our attention.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.458
We can consider Paramachaitanya

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.375
like a ocean,

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:06.000
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:10.667
Everything, all the working,

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:17.041
everything, is within its own limits.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.041
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.667
Now, if you see the sun,

00:09:26.417 --> 00:09:29.750
then from the sun

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:34.250
the rays have to come out, to work it.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:40.625
If you see somebody,

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:46.291
say, a person

00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:50.250
who has an authority,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.500
he has to assert that power -

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:59.625
outside.

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.959
So within himself

00:10:03.208 --> 00:10:06.000
he doesn’t work it out.

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.041
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.250
and inside the seed only

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:27.250
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:30.875
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:34.583
everything is inside that seed.

00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:38.959
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:47.999
So we are all enveloped in it.

00:10:49.875 --> 00:10:53.834
And only the waves that we see,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.917
and we are on the waves,

00:10:57.083 --> 00:11:00.834
so we see it as

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.166
dislocated, separated.

00:11:05.709 --> 00:11:10.250
Like we feel “this is Germany”

00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:16.417
or “this is England, this is India.”

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:21.500
These are just folds of the sari

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:24.208
of Paramachaitanya

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:27.041
which look separated,

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:30.583
but they are not separated.

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:35.000
They are continuous.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.625
So the connection is absolutely complete.

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:45.375
If I pull a thread from here,

00:11:45.583 --> 00:11:49.709
the thread will throughout be pulled.

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:56.709
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.500
is working within itself.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.583
And there is nothing without.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.291
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:23.875
it pays special attention to you.

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:28.250
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:30.917
one with you.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.458
Whatever you desire,

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:36.834
whatever you want,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.542
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.625
if you are one with it.

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.750
Like in a, say,

00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:52.999
turbulent ocean

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:59.375
some drops of water may fly into the air

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:03.917
and start thinking that “we are above.”

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:09.375
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

00:13:09.583 --> 00:13:13.375
But again they have to fall into the sea.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:20.750
So this formless energy,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.875
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:29.166
all the organizations,

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:31.917
all the computers,

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.959
all the televisions,

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:40.667
all that you can think of communication

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:44.291
and of governing, of administration,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.250
and above all,

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:53.000
it is the Love,

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.959
it is the Love of God

00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:01.875
and Love of your Mother.

00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:13.709
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.208
you have to know

00:14:19.417 --> 00:14:23.417
that you have to become the reality.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:33.542
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:42.291
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:47.375
though it’s a photograph.

00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:56.999
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:06.208
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:13.208
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:16.834
It’s like any other painting if you see,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.917
supposing you see a painting

00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:23.458
where it is raining.

00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:27.083
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.583
It does not

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:39.667
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.583
It is static.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:46.583
So in ignorance,

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.041
in ignorance,

00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:54.458
we just have the

00:15:55.999 --> 00:16:00.917
picture which is static about reality.

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:05.375
And that is the reason why

00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:08.834
we think we can work it out

00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:12.125
ourselves, everything.

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:18.542
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:25.999
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:29.709
You cannot. Try anything,

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:32.333
put whatever color you like.

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:35.417
It may appear, it will appear

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.375
with effort.

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:42.792
But it will not have the capacity,

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:49.041
nor the nature of reality.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.083
So human beings always deal

00:16:56.125 --> 00:17:02.125
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:06.667
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:09.500
We can feel them.

00:17:12.583 --> 00:17:15.208
We can create plastic flowers.

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:19.917
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

00:17:20.083 --> 00:17:24.667
But we can’t produce one flower

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:28.333
on our own.

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:38.041
We’ll have to go to reality

00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:42.208
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:49.125
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:57.875
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:02.875
have to know

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:07.834
that in reality you do not do anything

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.625
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:16.750
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:22.000
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:28.208
And even if he knows, this is not

00:18:28.417 --> 00:18:31.125
the truth in his heart.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:34.250
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

00:18:34.458 --> 00:18:38.999
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

00:18:39.709 --> 00:18:42.709
reality is Paramachaitanya

00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:46.959
and it is reality that works out everything.

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:52.250
And then this reality is

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.542
the Divine Love.

00:18:57.166 --> 00:19:00.500
We always separate love from action.

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:04.750
To us love means

00:19:07.166 --> 00:19:12.500
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.999
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:24.250
It works without any understanding.

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:28.875
When we love somebody,

00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:32.999
we don’t know, what do we do?

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:36.750
We think we love you.

00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:40.166
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:43.709
So how can it be love?

00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:51.542
We love our own children, love our own family,

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.250
love our own friends,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.458
which is so unreal.

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:02.250
If it was real,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.208
it would never have failed.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.542
That you cannot definitely say

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.333
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

00:20:13.542 --> 00:20:16.250
and be very selfish about your son.

00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:18.709
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:21.583
or you’ll treat him.

00:20:25.542 --> 00:20:28.583
But Paramachaitanya knows.

00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:33.792
It knows how to express its love.

00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:37.458
Not only that,

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:42.166
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:48.458
which may change its hue, color,

00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:53.834
but

00:20:55.041 --> 00:20:59.417
the concern of that love will be the same.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:03.417
The essence of love is concern.

00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:08.041
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.875
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:14.583
Concern.

00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:18.208
Or if we say as “Hita”,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.917
is the benevolence.

00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:23.709
So the concern for the benevolence

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:26.041
will be all the time there,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.709
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

00:21:30.917 --> 00:21:33.417
might appear to be affectionate,

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.667
might appear to be over-indulgent.

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:39.542
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.959
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:47.583
it’s for your benevolence.

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:51.875
It works for your benevolence.

00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.875
Not only your benevolence,

00:21:55.041 --> 00:21:58.750
but the collective benevolence.

00:22:00.834 --> 00:22:04.458
And it knows very well what is to be done

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:07.542
how it is to be worked out.

00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:12.834
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.458
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:19.917
also is within itself.

00:22:22.834 --> 00:22:25.999
It’s such a storage

00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:32.542
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:37.709
So it does not deviate.

00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:42.458
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:47.792
for your benevolence

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.250
is all the time there.

00:22:51.542 --> 00:22:56.166
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:59.834
Some people might get a job.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.375
Some people will not get a job.

00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:05.500
With some people it will work out this way.

00:23:05.709 --> 00:23:08.625
With some people it will not work out that way.

00:23:08.834 --> 00:23:11.083
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

00:23:11.291 --> 00:23:13.083
is behaving like this?”

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:15.208
Is all for your correction.

00:23:15.417 --> 00:23:18.125
Is a big churning.

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:20.709
Whatever works out for your correction

00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:22.959
and is for your benevolence.

00:23:23.125 --> 00:23:25.208
If you understand this point,

00:23:25.417 --> 00:23:28.917
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:39.208
And it has no concern

00:23:39.417 --> 00:23:41.750
of its own benevolence,

00:23:41.959 --> 00:23:45.917
because it is complete benevolence itself.

00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:53.000
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

00:23:53.959 --> 00:23:59.458
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:03.709
A man, say, who has everything,

00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:05.709
worldly things,

00:24:05.917 --> 00:24:08.583
still may be concerned about getting more,

00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:11.083
the greed, there would be.

00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:15.000
But as it is the complete, Purna,

00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:18.500
it has no greed.

00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:23.625
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.458
And because it is so powerful,

00:24:28.083 --> 00:24:30.417
so knowledgeable,

00:24:30.625 --> 00:24:33.792
that it has no doubts,

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.959
no doubts of any kind.

00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:40.500
And because

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.792
there’s nobody which can harm it,

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:48.083
it has no fear.

00:24:52.375 --> 00:24:56.083
And you all have now felt

00:24:56.375 --> 00:25:00.458
that Paramachaitanya,

00:25:01.999 --> 00:25:06.875
should give you a complete fearless life,

00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:10.000
a peaceful life,

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.750
and a joyous life.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.166
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:22.417
no more, now he’s found his mother.

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:26.625
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:29.625
and the connection with it.

00:25:29.959 --> 00:25:34.000
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

00:25:34.792 --> 00:25:36.583
don’t have to think about anything,

00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:39.250
you don’t have to plan about anything,

00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.875
only thing is you have to jump into it,

00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:45.125
just jump into it

00:25:46.542 --> 00:25:51.750
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

00:25:54.875 --> 00:26:00.083
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:05.875
Now we are in Germany,

00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:09.166
and you know in Germany

00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:12.625
there have been people who have

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:17.999
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:21.583
But

00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:25.542
even that happening that took place,

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:30.208
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

00:26:30.417 --> 00:26:33.667
of course they are born again, no problem,

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:37.166
and such problems came up

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.083
that they were

00:26:43.542 --> 00:26:45.834
thinking that

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:48.959
the whole world will be finished.

00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:52.166
They were so much worried,

00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:55.542
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.959
But did not.

00:26:59.125 --> 00:27:03.333
But this war has taught us a lesson.

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:09.333
It has made us more collective.

00:27:09.917 --> 00:27:12.959
It has made us understand each other.

00:27:13.917 --> 00:27:17.208
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

00:27:17.417 --> 00:27:20.750
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:23.000
racialism,

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.917
then this so-called nationalism,

00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:28.166
so-called patriotism -

00:27:28.375 --> 00:27:32.834
all these separating forces,

00:27:34.375 --> 00:27:36.709
divisive things.

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:42.375
Saw clearly we are all human beings

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:47.458
and we should be treated as human beings.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.834
If you see the history, after every war

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.250
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

00:27:58.583 --> 00:28:01.999
knowledge of oneness of the world.

00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:05.542
It is something

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:10.959
like, you have in a spacecraft

00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:14.999
that a container is built in,

00:28:16.792 --> 00:28:20.166
one into another,

00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:25.750
and the whole thing

00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:32.291
comes into a speed, some velocity,

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:37.417
and then the lower container bursts,

00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:40.417
or explodes.

00:28:40.625 --> 00:28:44.625
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.959
to the rest of it.

00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:53.500
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

00:28:53.999 --> 00:28:57.999
And that’s how one can go into the space.

00:28:59.583 --> 00:29:02.417
In the same manner,

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:06.125
all these horrible things that have happened

00:29:06.834 --> 00:29:09.750
are explosions

00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:13.583
which brings you

00:29:15.667 --> 00:29:18.583
towards knowledge

00:29:18.834 --> 00:29:20.792
that there’s something wrong with us,

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:24.709
we are living with something unreal.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:31.041
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:40.208
like ecology problem,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.999
AIDS,

00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:47.917
drugs,

00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:54.792
all these modern problems and poverty,

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:59.166
if you see it like a witness, you will see

00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:02.083
these are quite shocking.

00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:05.625
These are very shocking things.

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:10.333
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.041
should really shock our mind.

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:18.000
Why we have these problems?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.709
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

00:30:24.917 --> 00:30:28.458
that we can solve by making more money.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.750
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

00:30:34.625 --> 00:30:38.792
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
because we will have more money.

00:30:41.208 --> 00:30:43.792
And then we can protect ourselves

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:46.333
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:49.083
moving about all over the place.

00:30:49.458 --> 00:30:53.875
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:57.875
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:00.583
So you move about

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.375
like a person who is entering

00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:07.542
into the area which is all full of fumes.

00:31:10.709 --> 00:31:13.583
All these stupid ideas come up because

00:31:13.792 --> 00:31:15.542
they do not see

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.000
that, what is human dignity is,

00:31:20.125 --> 00:31:24.166
that human beings are above

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:28.333
everything else - above machinery,

00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:32.500
above all material things of the world.

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:37.375
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:41.041
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.917
a greater slave of the machinery

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.999
because he must have money.

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:49.834
He must have more money, and with this more money,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.125
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

00:31:54.458 --> 00:31:56.917
It is absurd.

00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:01.959
But if you understand the human dignity,

00:32:02.291 --> 00:32:05.333
then you have to understand that

00:32:05.542 --> 00:32:08.542
as a human being,

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.625
we have to take a very positive,

00:32:15.834 --> 00:32:20.250
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

00:32:25.125 --> 00:32:27.500
Like, now most of the

00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:30.250
French

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:33.250
shores,

00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:37.500
the beaches, are polluted.

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:40.000
Naturally.

00:32:40.667 --> 00:32:42.166
Because they started a funny thing

00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:45.125
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

00:32:46.083 --> 00:32:47.875
So this is the result.

00:32:48.041 --> 00:32:49.999
Now, do what you please.

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:53.458
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:55.999
So instead of - now human brain is such,

00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:59.542
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.000
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

00:33:03.208 --> 00:33:05.625
of cleansing this.”

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:08.375
They will never condemn

00:33:08.583 --> 00:33:10.542
what has gone wrong with them

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.041
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:17.834
funny life that they have on the seashores.

00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:20.250
Now, AIDS.

00:33:20.458 --> 00:33:23.500
You’ll be amazed that in America

00:33:24.041 --> 00:33:27.250
why, even they said that

00:33:27.542 --> 00:33:31.083
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:34.709
seven hundred thousand people

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.792
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:42.834
because they are achieving such a great goal

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.208
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

00:33:48.542 --> 00:33:51.709
as if like a big revolution.

00:33:52.792 --> 00:33:56.583
And thinking that they are very, very

00:33:56.792 --> 00:34:00.166
great revolutionaries, great people,

00:34:00.458 --> 00:34:03.875
that they are supporting this AIDS

00:34:06.834 --> 00:34:11.208
disease and glorifying it.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.875
Can you believe

00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:19.375
that this kind of

00:34:19.583 --> 00:34:23.500
assertion will be accepted?

00:34:24.917 --> 00:34:27.750
People will laugh at you.

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:31.625
But everything is so money-oriented.

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.667
They like to advertise it.

00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:36.208
They want to talk about money help.

00:34:36.417 --> 00:34:39.458
They want to say that this is happening because

00:34:41.291 --> 00:34:43.000
if they had more money,

00:34:43.208 --> 00:34:46.583
they would have taken more drugs.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.999
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:53.667
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:57.792
or they can take to this kind of life.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:00.542
On the whole, if you see,

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.792
people have lived

00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:05.750
with something which is so unreal

00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:08.959
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:12.750
And when it comes to facing it,

00:35:12.959 --> 00:35:15.333
that we’ve done a mistake,

00:35:15.542 --> 00:35:18.500
we should not have done this mistake;

00:35:19.375 --> 00:35:21.417
then they retreat

00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:24.709
and take another glorious

00:35:24.917 --> 00:35:28.083
image, artificial and unreal,

00:35:28.291 --> 00:35:31.750
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:41.583
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:46.667
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:51.041
everything from which we should have protection will become

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:55.792
the goal of people to achieve.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.375
I hope you have understood

00:35:59.583 --> 00:36:03.959
that the All-Pervading Power around us

00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:06.834
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.375
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:09.583 --> 00:36:12.999
and is the one who has given you blessings,

00:36:13.166 --> 00:36:14.458
is Paramachaitanya.

00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:19.375
Through which it has worked out.

00:36:19.583 --> 00:36:24.125
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

00:36:24.333 --> 00:36:28.375
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:31.041
and that we can feel that,

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:35.333
we can use that power, we can work it out.

00:36:35.542 --> 00:36:38.291
If it is felt today that way,

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.917
I think lot of work has been done already

00:36:42.083 --> 00:36:43.917
and may God bless you for that.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.583
Now.

00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:05.959
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

00:38:06.125 --> 00:38:09.458
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:13.834
and so you have to just think

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.792
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:25.583
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

00:38:32.792 --> 00:38:35.083
May God bless you.
