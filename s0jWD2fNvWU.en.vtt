00:00.001 --> 00:00.285
Third Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey 1995-07-29

00:04.944 --> 00:06.186
Can you hear me?

00:26.122 --> 00:29.407
I bow to all seekers of truth!

00:34.033 --> 00:39.085
We have to know that the truth is what it is.

00:42.788 --> 00:45.704
You can not change it,

00:45.776 --> 00:48.595
you can not transform it,

00:48.635 --> 00:53.154
you can not describe it,
and you can not pay for it.

01:01.341 --> 01:08.201
In every religion it is said that
you have to find yourself,

01:13.686 --> 01:16.836
especially in Koran it’s written

01:16.941 --> 01:19.958
that if you do not know yourself,

01:20.026 --> 01:23.589
you are not a human being.

01:31.379 --> 01:38.600
All “Namaz” and all those prayers
are just to ascend, to know yourself.

01:49.628 --> 01:52.302
In every religion, it is said so.

01:55.286 --> 01:58.270
But as you know the religions have become

01:58.319 --> 02:01.741
now power-oriented and money-oriented.

02:08.226 --> 02:11.092
And in the name of god they all are fighting.

02:18.959 --> 02:26.210
So people saying that there is no truth in God.

02:37.908 --> 02:43.610
But the time has come to prove the existence of God

02:43.682 --> 02:46.890
and oneness, unity of all the religions.

02:56.395 --> 03:00.142
There is nothing to fight in the name of God.

03:05.992 --> 03:09.613
Actually, they are not fighting for the truth

03:09.631 --> 03:14.221
but fighting for money, for land
or for some power.

03:23.599 --> 03:26.400
Dr. Khan has already told you,

03:26.434 --> 03:29.301
what do we have within our self

03:36.207 --> 03:38.643
or also in Kuran,

03:38.773 --> 03:42.679
this Kundalini is described as Assas (The Foundation)

03:48.942 --> 03:52.753
and also this all-pervading power of divine love

03:52.772 --> 03:54.758
is described as “Ruh”.

04:00.534 --> 04:02.645
Names may be different

04:02.695 --> 04:06.015
but they all talk of the same thing.

04:12.126 --> 04:16.469
You can not call any religion, as exclusive.

04:21.659 --> 04:25.438
Mohammad sahib is the one who talked about

04:25.481 --> 04:30.491
Abraham, about Moses, about Christ and His mother.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.269
especially about Christ’s Mother,

04:44.325 --> 04:49.019
he said you should never challenge her chastity.

04:54.783 --> 04:58.886
Even in the bible,she is not so much
respected as he respected.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.042
That shows that we must respect our women.

05:20.436 --> 05:26.138
Every religion has gone into some sort of a perversion

05:26.157 --> 05:28.531
and has become  fundamentalist,

05:36.906 --> 05:41.232
where there are based or everything

05:41.315 --> 05:44.509
a kind of a  fear

05:50.761 --> 05:52.855
and hatred for each other.

05:55.620 --> 05:59.384
If God is ‘Rahim’ (very merciful) and
‘Rahmet’ (feel pity for every living thing)

05:59.409 --> 06:02.362
how can we have hatred.

06:07.758 --> 06:14.779
You must understand that the divine power
is there to construct us,

06:14.804 --> 06:18.432
to guide us, and to lead us to patience.

06:29.966 --> 06:34.134
They are living in this modern world which is so Chaotic.

06:41.405 --> 06:46.478
And all over the world, you will find people are just trusted.

06:51.043 --> 06:57.760
All the truthful people are trying to find out the solution.

07:09.324 --> 07:12.514
In these special modern times

07:12.578 --> 07:17.305
also there is one blessing which is spreading that,

07:17.329 --> 07:20.696
people will know themselves.

07:29.822 --> 07:33.123
Which was the idea of Mohammad Sahib also.

07:40.039 --> 07:45.390
Especially, your country has been
blessed by a very great soul

07:45.438 --> 07:49.186
like Atatürk Kemal Paşa.

07:57.543 --> 08:01.312
And in this country, you have had so many Sufis

08:01.347 --> 08:03.188
of very great evidence.

08:09.548 --> 08:11.349
Like Yunus Emre.

08:13.311 --> 08:16.718
If you read his poetry you will be amazed to know

08:16.766 --> 08:22.698
that your country has such beautiful poets
and such truthful people.

08:36.971 --> 08:41.686
He was such a great spiritual soul,

08:41.729 --> 08:46.104
and the way he has described about human beings

08:46.160 --> 08:51.378
is really so loving, so compassionate.

09:06.388 --> 09:09.158
He has talked of nothing but love.

09:12.496 --> 09:16.870
He says I have one enemy that is the hatred

09:17.257 --> 09:20.605
and I have one friend that is love.

09:26.059 --> 09:28.122
It is really remarkable,

09:28.561 --> 09:32.142
how such a great soul is in this country, Turkey

09:32.167 --> 09:36.121
and it’s blessings will always be with you.

09:45.699 --> 09:49.374
I was really very much attracted to your country

09:49.383 --> 09:52.980
because so many Sufis have been created here

09:53.005 --> 09:56.603
and their praises are star even in India.

10:10.951 --> 10:14.014
There is nothing to learn from others.

10:14.043 --> 10:19.515
You have such great people
who have done so much service

10:19.555 --> 10:23.151
to your country as far as spirituality is concerned.

10:34.572 --> 10:38.564
When we say this is my hand,
this is my body,

10:38.589 --> 10:44.924
this is my intelligence who is the owner of this.

10:53.497 --> 10:57.904
All this you see, these are the channels which look after

10:57.921 --> 11:00.367
your autonomous nervous system.

11:08.846 --> 11:13.879
As intelligent people, you should
ask a question who is this “auto”.

11:22.502 --> 11:27.632
Science is very limited and also immoral.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.778
There is no morality about science.

11:36.222 --> 11:40.407
For example, they can make atom bombs,

11:40.441 --> 11:43.547
they can make all kinds of destructive weapons,

11:43.572 --> 11:47.004
there is no restrictive power in Science.

11:56.768 --> 12:00.469
And so you find that they have created machinery

12:00.485 --> 12:04.985
and the machineries which are creating lots of pollution.

12:14.479 --> 12:18.513
And the whole world today is afraid of this pollution

12:18.545 --> 12:21.880
which will come and can destroy our world.

12:30.456 --> 12:34.990
So is there a solution for this?

12:36.105 --> 12:39.351
For the protection of human beings.

12:46.035 --> 12:54.200
There is, a way of becoming
the self, the spirit

12:54.267 --> 13:00.317
that you develop by divinity to these
circumstances that are around you.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.896
It is the becoming that is important,

13:20.920 --> 13:23.906
now in our evolutionary process.

13:32.678 --> 13:38.929
We have now reached the stage
which we called as the human stage

13:46.496 --> 13:49.980
but this stage is not perfect.

13:55.910 --> 13:58.682
We do not have absolute knowledge,

14:03.229 --> 14:06.779
for example one think that capitalism is good,

14:06.804 --> 14:11.869
one think that communism is good,
everybody has there own idea.

14:20.605 --> 14:23.096
Also, we have fixed ideas,

14:26.053 --> 14:28.356
like Hitler had the fixed idea

14:28.382 --> 14:33.907
that he was the one who has to kill the Jews.

14:42.906 --> 14:47.548
Also, he felt that the Germans were the highest race.

14:56.220 --> 15:01.539
As a result, he thought he is alright
in thinking to arrest the rest of them.

15:08.684 --> 15:11.899
Even today there are people, many people,

15:11.908 --> 15:16.315
who are at the helm of affairs and have fixed ideas.

15:24.422 --> 15:28.788
But if you know what is the absolute truth

15:28.857 --> 15:33.642
and if you know that there is a divine power

15:33.782 --> 15:37.115
which guides our life, nourishes us,

15:37.181 --> 15:39.531
then the whole thing changes.

15:56.472 --> 16:06.575
Now, Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

16:12.186 --> 16:20.455
And we get people from these 65 nations,
in India in thousands.

16:28.932 --> 16:32.945
Here also, people have also come from other countries

16:33.013 --> 16:37.239
to help other Sahaj yogis here.

16:43.860 --> 16:47.719
But there is no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

16:56.802 --> 16:59.573
They are enjoying their life.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.266
And they have a purpose in life now.

17:07.837 --> 17:12.339
All the bad habits, destructive habits
like drugs, alcohol,

17:12.397 --> 17:14.397
all these things just drop out.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.756
One does not have to tell them,
don’t do this, don’t do that.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.994
Automatically they drop.

17:39.082 --> 17:44.659
In the `light of your spirit, you see
what is destructive for you

17:50.687 --> 17:55.718
and you just give up,
you just give it out understanding

17:55.744 --> 17:59.683
that it is something very dangerous for you.

18:06.854 --> 18:09.330
Also, you get your powers,

18:13.067 --> 18:16.884
by which you give up everything that is wrong.

18:22.250 --> 18:27.442
You get powers to give self-realisations to others also.

18:35.485 --> 18:39.796
So one person can give realisation to 1000 people.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.172
Your health improves

18:47.196 --> 18:51.389
and all kinds of incurable diseases
have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.

18:59.735 --> 19:03.639
There are 3 doctors in India who have got their M. D

19:03.688 --> 19:09.409
in Sahaja yoga for curing incurable diseases.

19:20.185 --> 19:23.932
For that, you don’t have to study medicine.

19:30.345 --> 19:39.082
On your fingertips, you can feel the centres
who are in jeopardy.

19:45.847 --> 19:48.912
And you.  If you know how to cure yourself

19:48.937 --> 19:51.017
you can also cure others.

19:56.263 --> 20:00.240
Because you develop the new dimension in your awareness.

20:06.217 --> 20:10.879
That we call as collective consciousness.

20:15.139 --> 20:22.446
Sitting down here you can feel the
centres of other people all over the world.

20:28.711 --> 20:33.538
Also, those who are dead you can find out
what sort of people they were.

20:40.143 --> 20:46.599
Most important thing is that,
we have to become the spirit

20:46.665 --> 20:51.610
because that is something indistinguishable.

21:04.501 --> 21:09.266
All the problems of a human being can be solved.

21:12.995 --> 21:16.840
It’s very important that today

21:16.865 --> 21:21.517
we should take to our self-hood,
to our self-knowledge,

21:28.368 --> 21:30.670
for which we don’t have to pay.

21:30.695 --> 21:32.456
You can not pay for it.

21:37.632 --> 21:40.044
You can not organize.

21:42.399 --> 21:44.295
You have no organisation as such.

21:48.221 --> 21:50.691
Individually you have to grow.

21:54.571 --> 22:01.671
So you rise above, the time,
above all your defects

22:01.704 --> 22:04.705
and you become a supreme personality.

22:14.337 --> 22:19.666
Every day I am giving lectures,
so my throat is out of order.

22:22.695 --> 22:25.076
This time alright!

22:36.884 --> 22:42.826
Our life today, seems to be in real jeopardy.

22:49.262 --> 22:51.313
Today for the first time

22:51.338 --> 22:54.142
I wanted to listen to the news in the morning.

22:54.167 --> 22:56.653
I never listen to the news in the morning.

22:56.678 --> 22:57.891
It’s horrible.

23:04.973 --> 23:07.298
And it was so shocking.

23:07.323 --> 23:09.959
Everywhere in the world, something is going on

23:09.984 --> 23:12.817
which is really unbearable.

23:19.908 --> 23:23.407
And when you see all that you feel that

23:23.442 --> 23:26.903
there is something must be done about it

23:32.738 --> 23:36.287
and that is to be done by the people

23:36.290 --> 23:39.115
who achieve their self-realisation

23:49.407 --> 23:51.665
because you don’t know who you are?

23:55.381 --> 24:01.305
You are the epitome of the evolution.

24:02.422 --> 24:05.072
Interpreter: I don’t understand, sorry,

24:05.440 --> 24:09.266
The epitome of the human evolution means the highest.

24:14.877 --> 24:22.502
Now the last breakthrough is very simple.

24:27.389 --> 24:31.819
It’s your own power. It’s your own mother.

24:31.844 --> 24:33.724
She does it all.

24:40.600 --> 24:47.207
And when it happens you feel
from  top of your head

24:47.263 --> 24:51.630
the cool breeze like “Ruh” coming out

24:59.570 --> 25:01.512
and you become “Ruhani” (spirituel person).

25:04.092 --> 25:07.222
Nobody has to certify you know yourself

25:12.970 --> 25:18.106
and you are amazed that
yourself because so fantastic.

25:22.185 --> 25:23.629
But you are that!

25:25.915 --> 25:31.334
You are born to be that and it has to happen.

25:35.022 --> 25:37.740
There is no end to my lecture because I have been

25:37.756 --> 25:40.843
talking about it in every country I have been .

25:48.646 --> 25:52.695
but it works and there is no end to your energy.

25:56.475 --> 25:59.728
You must be knowing  I am 73 years of age.

25:59.753 --> 26:02.739
[UNCLEAR]

26:05.698 --> 26:09.405
and travel praticly every third day

26:14.101 --> 26:16.261
but I feel very energetic.

26:18.933 --> 26:23.629
and it works so well I have seen that people

26:23.638 --> 26:26.367
who are seekers some or other nature

26:32.600 --> 26:36.496
I think it’s all organised by this Ruhani power.

26:43.443 --> 26:48.145
Thus,  you become religious,
you become righteous.

26:48.170 --> 26:50.719
There is no hypocrisy about it.

27:00.049 --> 27:03.447
My husband told me that
Turkish people are very  capable people

27:03.472 --> 27:06.347
very to able been.

27:11.004 --> 27:14.911
and I find that, they are such great artist

27:14.936 --> 27:18.272
they are so creative, everything is there

27:23.453 --> 27:26.461
but the only thing this has to happen

27:26.503 --> 27:29.458
so that you become great Sufi’s.

27:36.515 --> 27:38.689
This is very simple

27:38.706 --> 27:41.517
and you can work it out just now.

27:48.504 --> 27:51.927
Of course, I cannot force on you.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.814
You have to ask for it.

28:00.034 --> 28:03.660
If you do not desire,
I can not force on you,

28:07.739 --> 28:12.724
because this is the power of pure desire.

28:18.153 --> 28:22.273
If you have the desire to become the self,

28:22.286 --> 28:26.940
it is very simple because
only this power has to rise

28:26.965 --> 28:30.481
and pierce through your fontanel bone area

28:30.506 --> 28:33.787
become one with this all-pervading power.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.257
Sahaja means born with you.

28:51.948 --> 28:57.201
It’s the right that you become one
with this all-pervading power.

28:57.226 --> 28:59.642
This is a union.  This is yoga

29:06.241 --> 29:09.789
for which you don’t have to stand on your head do anything.

29:09.814 --> 29:10.924
It’s just there.

29:15.735 --> 29:19.520
So, the only thing it has to work out.

29:23.321 --> 29:27.783
Now, you see there are so many beautiful lights here,

29:27.865 --> 29:30.067
but only one switch to can put on the whole

29:30.083 --> 29:31.876
because they are just switches.

29:39.784 --> 29:43.831
In the same way, you can get your enlightenment

29:43.856 --> 29:47.415
because that’s the built-in system within you like this.

29:54.743 --> 29:58.331
In every country, they have talked about this.

30:01.014 --> 30:03.537
In every religion, they have talked about this.

30:06.439 --> 30:12.163
So one has to just get to it.

30:18.397 --> 30:21.785
It will not take more than 10 minutes

30:21.845 --> 30:25.622
but those who want to go, should leave the hall

30:32.180 --> 30:33.910
because it can not be forced

30:37.061 --> 30:39.537
and those who do not want should please leave

30:39.562 --> 30:42.341
because others should not be disturbed in receiving.

30:59.180 --> 31:07.719
Of course,  of course,
There are very simple 3 conditions:

31:14.651 --> 31:20.670
First one is that you have to forgive yourself.

31:25.430 --> 31:29.526
You should not feel guilty about it at this moment.

31:34.327 --> 31:38.201
Because whatever wrong you have done is a past,

31:44.075 --> 31:47.104
so why you carry this myth on your head all the time.

31:52.045 --> 31:57.205
Actually, by feeling guilty
this centre is caught up here very much.

32:03.391 --> 32:06.891
You all have it very much so
that’s why I am coughing.

32:12.732 --> 32:17.267
But if this centre is very much caught up, then

32:19.072 --> 32:26.175
what happens is that you develop spondylitis.

32:36.171 --> 32:39.299
You can also have a disease called angina

32:41.414 --> 32:43.429
by which you get a heart attack

32:47.228 --> 32:53.375
or else you can also have a very lethargic organs.

32:56.994 --> 32:59.557
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all.

33:03.835 --> 33:10.870
So the second condition is to forgive others.

33:15.092 --> 33:17.038
You have to forgive others,

33:19.755 --> 33:24.145
because -whether you forgive or don’t forgive
you don’t do anything.

33:28.495 --> 33:31.606
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

33:36.194 --> 33:40.813
So the best is to forgive, not to carry this myth.

33:46.909 --> 33:51.468
So you forgive everyone,
even without thinking about them

33:57.359 --> 34:00.454
that will really make you feel much lighter.

34:04.523 --> 34:09.107
Then the third condition is – that
you have to take out your shoes

34:09.133 --> 34:11.317
which is not so difficult I think.

34:15.347 --> 34:19.315
In London, the first time when I told them
that take out your shoe

34:19.316 --> 34:21.405
half of them walked out.

34:31.713 --> 34:34.427
Please take out your shoes.

34:54.313 --> 35:04.979
Some people feel that they are basically bad.

35:18.704 --> 35:23.349
Interpreter : She shouldn’t  take
photograf during the session.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.889
Shri Mataji: Now, at  this time,
why don’t you take your realisation?

35:27.676 --> 35:29.097
That is the best.

35:44.402 --> 35:46.910
Then you enjoy yourself.

36:01.469 --> 36:03.683
Now, we will show you,

36:03.971 --> 36:11.054
how we have to nourish your
centres with your own hand.

36:36.475 --> 36:39.660
Left side that you have seen here,

36:39.946 --> 36:47.316
is what our mundane desires in day to day life.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.247
So please put your left hand on your lap

36:56.271 --> 37:02.355
or comfortably towards me
indicting that you desire it.

37:08.572 --> 37:17.553
Now believe me that you are all going
to become the self, the spirit.

37:19.816 --> 37:23.897
Have faith yourself,
you must have faith like this, like this.

37:23.930 --> 37:25.080
On the lap.

37:25.096 --> 37:26.886
That show it, like this, comfortable.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.086
No No like this.

37:36.386 --> 37:37.481
Alright!

37:43.759 --> 37:48.203
And the right hand is for the action.

37:53.046 --> 37:56.562
So you put your right hand on your heart.

38:00.586 --> 38:04.300
Left hand towards Me
and right hand on the heart.

38:07.642 --> 38:11.387
In the heart, resides your spirit.

38:15.737 --> 38:22.281
If you become the spirit,
you are your own guide.

38:22.322 --> 38:25.258
You are your own master.

38:35.854 --> 38:39.385
So you put your right hand in the

38:39.426 --> 38:42.984
upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

38:43.000 --> 38:46.107
which is the centre of your mastery.

38:58.846 --> 39:03.935
Then you take your hand now below  in the
lower portion of the abdomen

39:03.954 --> 39:07.311
lower portion of the abdomen
on the left-hand side.

39:13.734 --> 39:16.313
Please keep your left hand straight like this.

39:19.685 --> 39:29.962
Now, this is the centre of pure knowledge that is divine.

39:38.230 --> 39:43.562
Even you people do it, because
you see there is nothing to [UNCLEAR].

39:52.372 --> 39:54.705
Because this is not to be repeated
what I am saying.

39:56.187 --> 39:57.655
Alright!

39:58.814 --> 40:01.631
Can you do it or not?

40:06.648 --> 40:08.338
Let us seek your peace.

40:11.448 --> 40:12.979
It’s much better.

40:15.570 --> 40:16.570
Alright!

40:16.748 --> 40:23.440
So Now this is the centre of pure
divine knowledge.

40:27.757 --> 40:30.785
Now you have to raise your right hand

40:30.872 --> 40:40.571
on top of the upper part of the abdomen
on the left-hand side.

40:46.953 --> 40:49.389
You are nourishing your own centres.

40:52.793 --> 40:58.462
Now put your right hand on the
top of your heart.

41:04.105 --> 41:08.234
Now raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder

41:08.267 --> 41:10.150
and turn your head to your right.

41:15.586 --> 41:18.355
Now I have already told you about this centre

41:18.380 --> 41:20.683
will go out of order

41:22.550 --> 41:24.216
if you feel guilty.

41:26.564 --> 41:31.861
Now raise your right hand on the
top of your forehead across

41:36.335 --> 41:38.979
and please put down your head.

41:42.231 --> 41:48.234
This is the centre where you
have to forgive others in general.

41:54.737 --> 41:57.754
Now, take back your hand

41:57.779 --> 42:03.013
on the backside of your head and
push back your head as far as possible.

42:07.892 --> 42:12.434
This is the centre where without feeling guilty,

42:12.459 --> 42:14.626
without counting your mistakes,

42:14.652 --> 42:19.040
you have to ask forgiveness from
this all-pervading power.

42:28.142 --> 42:32.056
Now, stretch your palm fully

42:32.304 --> 42:36.205
and this the is the last centre where

42:36.229 --> 42:40.445
you have to put your hand is
the fontanel bone area

42:40.470 --> 42:43.465
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

42:51.766 --> 42:55.513
Now please push back your finger.
This is very important.

42:58.861 --> 43:00.721
and put down your head.

43:02.801 --> 43:05.519
Now here, you have to move your scalp.

43:05.532 --> 43:12.770
Not your hand, your scalp,
carefully clockwise 7 times.

43:26.192 --> 43:27.898
Just bend your heads.

43:30.910 --> 43:33.070
That’s all we have to do.

43:39.126 --> 43:43.874
Now you have to close your eyes.

43:43.917 --> 43:46.862
Before that ,those who are sitting on the chair

43:46.887 --> 43:48.986
should put both the feet apart from each other.

43:49.010 --> 43:51.978
Those who are on the ground are alright.

43:57.441 --> 44:00.028
All of you take out your glasses.

44:09.017 --> 44:11.088
No, no, you are alright, you are alright,

44:12.122 --> 44:14.066
you don’t have to,  you are alright,

44:14.091 --> 44:17.243
those who are sitting on the chairs
because there are two powers.

44:23.682 --> 44:25.913
Now please close your eyes

44:25.922 --> 44:28.509
and don’t open them till I tell you.

44:36.482 --> 44:42.422
Now left hand towards Me and right
hand on the heart on the lap.

44:47.835 --> 44:53.107
Now in your heart, you have to ask a question

44:53.117 --> 44:56.896
about yourself.  a very fundamental one.

45:03.924 --> 45:09.942
You can call me Mother or
you can call me Shri Mataji,

45:15.904 --> 45:21.374
here you say, in your heart 3 times.

45:21.457 --> 45:26.770
Ask the question -Mother Am I the spirit?

45:36.641 --> 45:37.760
3 times

45:39.477 --> 45:43.827
I have told you already that
when you become the spirit.

45:43.837 --> 45:46.760
You become your master.

45:54.063 --> 46:01.966
So now put your right hand on top of your abdomen

46:01.991 --> 46:05.555
on the left-hand side in the
upper part and press it.

46:13.997 --> 46:16.879
Here you have to ask

46:18.437 --> 46:21.687
another question which is fundamental.

46:26.788 --> 46:31.615
Mother, Am I my own master?

46:35.910 --> 46:41.721
Now I can not force

46:42.892 --> 46:45.848
the pure divine knowledge on you.

46:45.864 --> 46:48.300
You have to ask for it.

46:55.621 --> 46:58.988
So now please put your right hand in the

46:59.037 --> 47:03.667
lower portion of your abdomen on the
left-hand side and press it

47:07.943 --> 47:10.349
and please ask 6 times

47:10.365 --> 47:14.454
Mother please give me pure divine knowledge.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.960
Some of you are putting the left hand
on the other way.

47:26.985 --> 47:32.861
Please put it like this.
I see some of you are putting wrong.

47:42.709 --> 47:47.073
Now Please ask six times

47:47.099 --> 47:51.602
Mother please give me your divine knowledge.

48:01.083 --> 48:06.426
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

48:16.415 --> 48:20.758
As soon as you ask for the divine knowledge

48:20.799 --> 48:23.994
this power starts rising within you,

48:24.019 --> 48:33.688
so you have to open higher centres
with self-confidence.

48:41.293 --> 48:44.491
So, here you ask

48:45.007 --> 48:50.918
or you can say with full self-confidence
10 times

48:50.990 --> 48:55.239
“Mother I am my own master”.

49:05.715 --> 49:08.357
I must tell you, that

49:08.392 --> 49:11.392
you are not this body this mind,

49:11.426 --> 49:16.795
these emotions, these egos,
these conditionings,

49:17.201 --> 49:20.925
but you are your own spirit.

49:31.044 --> 49:35.148
So now raise your right hand on your heart

49:35.181 --> 49:41.653
and here, you have to say
with full self-confidence, 12 times

49:41.881 --> 49:46.317
“ Mother I am the pure spirit”.

50:00.869 --> 50:03.726
I have already told you

50:03.742 --> 50:07.585
that you should not feel guilty for your past.

50:14.765 --> 50:23.334
Because this all-pervading power of love
is the ocean of forgiveness.

50:28.199 --> 50:31.684
And whatever mistakes you might have committed

50:31.717 --> 50:36.243
will be completely dissolved
by this power of forgiveness.

50:42.842 --> 50:46.397
So please forgive yourself.

50:48.377 --> 50:53.843
And you rise your right hand in
the corner of your neck  and shoulder

50:53.868 --> 50:56.670
and turn your head to your right.

51:05.856 --> 51:12.306
Here now you have to say with
full self-confidence 16 times

51:12.331 --> 51:16.565
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

51:29.176 --> 51:31.696
I have already told you that

51:31.721 --> 51:36.045
whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything

51:42.275 --> 51:45.679
but if you don’t forgive then

51:45.719 --> 51:49.556
you play in the wrong hands
and you torture yourself.

51:53.961 --> 51:57.330
Especially at this moment, it’s very important .

51:57.355 --> 52:02.672
because the centre that is crossing of

52:02.811 --> 52:06.812
your optic chiasma is very constricted

52:14.028 --> 52:19.335
and if you don’t forgive, this power don’t rise through

52:19.381 --> 52:24.226
because this centre has to open.

52:29.985 --> 52:34.693
So, please take your right hand
on the top of your forehead across

52:34.718 --> 52:37.246
and put down your head.

52:45.350 --> 52:49.376
Here you have to be humble and say from your heart

52:49.379 --> 52:51.014
not how many times

52:51.086 --> 52:55.613
“Mother I forgive everyone in general”.

53:10.212 --> 53:14.531
Now without feeling guilty,
without counting your mistakes

53:14.555 --> 53:18.438
just for your satisfaction,

53:18.456 --> 53:21.402
from this all-pervading power.

53:30.814 --> 53:34.393
So please take your right hand
in the backside of your head

53:34.418 --> 53:37.252
and push back your head as far as possible.

53:45.152 --> 53:49.367
Here, you have to say

53:49.382 --> 53:52.764
-not how many times- but from your heart

53:53.204 --> 53:57.753
“Oh Divine power! Oh, Ruhani power!
Please forgive me

53:57.769 --> 54:02.853
if I have done anything wrong
knowingly and unknowingly.”

54:16.646 --> 54:25.075
Now the last most important centre
is on top of your head.

54:32.945 --> 54:37.464
Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm

54:37.497 --> 54:40.401
on the top of the fontanel bone area

54:40.420 --> 54:43.858
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

54:53.729 --> 54:59.095
Now please push back your fingers,
it’s very important because

54:59.120 --> 55:02.528
you have to have good pressure on your scalp.

55:14.497 --> 55:17.593
Now Please bend your head.

55:19.688 --> 55:24.607
Here again I can not force self-realisation on you.

55:29.250 --> 55:31.155
So you have to ask for it.

55:34.081 --> 55:39.558
So move your scalp 7 times clockwise, saying

55:39.807 --> 55:44.024
“Mother please give me my self-hood

55:44.049 --> 55:48.115
or my self-realisation or my spirit.”

56:22.895 --> 56:28.246
Now, takedown your hand
and slowly open your eyes.

56:34.621 --> 56:38.517
Now, please put both your hands towards me like this.

56:43.615 --> 56:46.647
Now, put your right hand like this,

56:46.672 --> 56:50.237
bent your head and with the left hand, you see

56:50.261 --> 56:54.725
on top of your head if there any cool breeze

56:54.750 --> 56:58.745
or a hot breeze coming out of your own head.

57:14.854 --> 57:18.020
Now please put your left hand.

57:18.039 --> 57:22.573
And see with your right hand,
if there is a cool or a hot breeze

57:22.598 --> 57:25.623
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

57:36.097 --> 57:39.813
Higher, higher not on the top of the head.

57:39.837 --> 57:43.442
It can be very much higher also.
Just move and see.

57:46.066 --> 57:50.029
If you are have not forgiven yourself
or not forgiven others.

57:50.054 --> 57:52.636
It will be hot here coming in.

58:01.776 --> 58:03.791
Now,

58:10.790 --> 58:14.748
Now, Put the right hand towards me

58:14.773 --> 58:16.551
and again [UNCLEAR]

58:16.576 --> 58:23.628
with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

58:33.539 --> 58:37.286
Now raise both the hands towards the sky
and push back your head.

58:41.976 --> 58:48.565
Here now you have to ask one question 3 times:

58:50.118 --> 58:56.336
Is this the all-pervading power
of divine love that is called as “Ruh”.

58:56.499 --> 59:01.556
3 times ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading power

59:01.581 --> 59:05.648
of divine love which is called as Ruh”.

59:08.573 --> 59:10.977
Push back your head.

59:19.192 --> 59:21.584
Now please take down your hand.

59:24.725 --> 59:26.996
Now put both the hands towards me like this.

59:31.540 --> 59:33.660
And watch me without thinking

59:33.685 --> 59:39.130
because this is what happens
that you become thoughtlessly aware.

59:45.816 --> 59:49.490
You come to your present.
You stand in your present.

59:55.102 --> 59:57.009
Please put both the hands.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:06.018
All those who have felt the cool
or hot breeze on the fingers,

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:10.380
on the palm or on the top of the fontanel bone area

01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:12.557
Please raise your both hands

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560
Oh, my God.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.473
Look at that!

01:00:31.664 --> 01:00:34.099
The whole of the Turkey has got it!
May God bless you !

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.314
May God bless you !

01:00:35.636 --> 01:00:40.397
I bow to you all, Now your saintly life has started.
