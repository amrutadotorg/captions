00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.285
Third Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey 1995-07-29

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:06.186
Can you hear me?

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:29.407
I bow to all seekers of truth!

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:39.085
We have to know that the truth is what it is.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.704
You can not change it,

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:48.595
you can not transform it,

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:53.154
you can not describe it,
and you can not pay for it.

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:08.201
In every religion it is said that
you have to find yourself,

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:16.836
especially in Koran it’s written

00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:19.958
that if you do not know yourself,

00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:23.589
you are not a human being.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:38.600
All “Namaz” and all those prayers
are just to ascend, to know yourself.

00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:52.302
In every religion, it is said so.

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:58.270
But as you know the religions have become

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.741
now power-oriented and money-oriented.

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:11.092
And in the name of god they all are fighting.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:26.210
So people saying that there is no truth in God.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:43.610
But the time has come to prove the existence of God

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:46.890
and oneness, unity of all the religions.

00:02:56.395 --> 00:03:00.142
There is nothing to fight in the name of God.

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:09.613
Actually, they are not fighting for the truth

00:03:09.631 --> 00:03:14.221
but fighting for money, for land
or for some power.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.400
Dr. Khan has already told you,

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:29.301
what do we have within our self

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:38.643
or also in Kuran,

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:42.679
this Kundalini is described as Assas (The Foundation)

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:52.753
and also this all-pervading power of divine love

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:54.758
is described as “Ruh”.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:02.645
Names may be different

00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:06.015
but they all talk of the same thing.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:16.469
You can not call any religion, as exclusive.

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.438
Mohammad sahib is the one who talked about

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:30.491
Abraham, about Moses, about Christ and His mother.

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.269
especially about Christ’s Mother,

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:49.019
he said you should never challenge her chastity.

00:04:54.783 --> 00:04:58.886
Even in the bible,she is not so much
respected as he respected.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.042
That shows that we must respect our women.

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:26.138
Every religion has gone into some sort of a perversion

00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:28.531
and has become  fundamentalist,

00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:41.232
where there are based or everything

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:44.509
a kind of a  fear

00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:52.855
and hatred for each other.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.384
If God is ‘Rahim’ (very merciful) and
‘Rahmet’ (feel pity for every living thing)

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.362
how can we have hatred.

00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:14.779
You must understand that the divine power
is there to construct us,

00:06:14.804 --> 00:06:18.432
to guide us, and to lead us to patience.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:34.134
They are living in this modern world which is so Chaotic.

00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:46.478
And all over the world, you will find people are just trusted.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:57.760
All the truthful people are trying to find out the solution.

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:12.514
In these special modern times

00:07:12.578 --> 00:07:17.305
also there is one blessing which is spreading that,

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:20.696
people will know themselves.

00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:33.123
Which was the idea of Mohammad Sahib also.

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:45.390
Especially, your country has been
blessed by a very great soul

00:07:45.438 --> 00:07:49.186
like Atatürk Kemal Paşa.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.312
And in this country, you have had so many Sufis

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.188
of very great evidence.

00:08:09.548 --> 00:08:11.349
Like Yunus Emre.

00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.718
If you read his poetry you will be amazed to know

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:22.698
that your country has such beautiful poets
and such truthful people.

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:41.686
He was such a great spiritual soul,

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:46.104
and the way he has described about human beings

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.378
is really so loving, so compassionate.

00:09:06.388 --> 00:09:09.158
He has talked of nothing but love.

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:16.870
He says I have one enemy that is the hatred

00:09:17.257 --> 00:09:20.605
and I have one friend that is love.

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:28.122
It is really remarkable,

00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:32.142
how such a great soul is in this country, Turkey

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:36.121
and it’s blessings will always be with you.

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:49.374
I was really very much attracted to your country

00:09:49.383 --> 00:09:52.980
because so many Sufis have been created here

00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:56.603
and their praises are star even in India.

00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:14.014
There is nothing to learn from others.

00:10:14.043 --> 00:10:19.515
You have such great people
who have done so much service

00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:23.151
to your country as far as spirituality is concerned.

00:10:34.572 --> 00:10:38.564
When we say this is my hand,
this is my body,

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:44.924
this is my intelligence who is the owner of this.

00:10:53.497 --> 00:10:57.904
All this you see, these are the channels which look after

00:10:57.921 --> 00:11:00.367
your autonomous nervous system.

00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:13.879
As intelligent people, you should
ask a question who is this “auto”.

00:11:22.502 --> 00:11:27.632
Science is very limited and also immoral.

00:11:27.657 --> 00:11:29.778
There is no morality about science.

00:11:36.222 --> 00:11:40.407
For example, they can make atom bombs,

00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:43.547
they can make all kinds of destructive weapons,

00:11:43.572 --> 00:11:47.004
there is no restrictive power in Science.

00:11:56.768 --> 00:12:00.469
And so you find that they have created machinery

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:04.985
and the machineries which are creating lots of pollution.

00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:18.513
And the whole world today is afraid of this pollution

00:12:18.545 --> 00:12:21.880
which will come and can destroy our world.

00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:34.990
So is there a solution for this?

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:39.351
For the protection of human beings.

00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:54.200
There is, a way of becoming
the self, the spirit

00:12:54.267 --> 00:13:00.317
that you develop by divinity to these
circumstances that are around you.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.896
It is the becoming that is important,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.906
now in our evolutionary process.

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:38.929
We have now reached the stage
which we called as the human stage

00:13:46.496 --> 00:13:49.980
but this stage is not perfect.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.682
We do not have absolute knowledge,

00:14:03.229 --> 00:14:06.779
for example one think that capitalism is good,

00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:11.869
one think that communism is good,
everybody has there own idea.

00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:23.096
Also, we have fixed ideas,

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:28.356
like Hitler had the fixed idea

00:14:28.382 --> 00:14:33.907
that he was the one who has to kill the Jews.

00:14:42.906 --> 00:14:47.548
Also, he felt that the Germans were the highest race.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.539
As a result, he thought he is alright
in thinking to arrest the rest of them.

00:15:08.684 --> 00:15:11.899
Even today there are people, many people,

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:16.315
who are at the helm of affairs and have fixed ideas.

00:15:24.422 --> 00:15:28.788
But if you know what is the absolute truth

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:33.642
and if you know that there is a divine power

00:15:33.782 --> 00:15:37.115
which guides our life, nourishes us,

00:15:37.181 --> 00:15:39.531
then the whole thing changes.

00:15:56.472 --> 00:16:06.575
Now, Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:20.455
And we get people from these 65 nations,
in India in thousands.

00:16:28.932 --> 00:16:32.945
Here also, people have also come from other countries

00:16:33.013 --> 00:16:37.239
to help other Sahaj yogis here.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.719
But there is no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

00:16:56.802 --> 00:16:59.573
They are enjoying their life.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.266
And they have a purpose in life now.

00:17:07.837 --> 00:17:12.339
All the bad habits, destructive habits
like drugs, alcohol,

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.397
all these things just drop out.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.756
One does not have to tell them,
don’t do this, don’t do that.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.994
Automatically they drop.

00:17:39.082 --> 00:17:44.659
In the `light of your spirit, you see
what is destructive for you

00:17:50.687 --> 00:17:55.718
and you just give up,
you just give it out understanding

00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:59.683
that it is something very dangerous for you.

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:09.330
Also, you get your powers,

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:16.884
by which you give up everything that is wrong.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:27.442
You get powers to give self-realisations to others also.

00:18:35.485 --> 00:18:39.796
So one person can give realisation to 1000 people.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.172
Your health improves

00:18:47.196 --> 00:18:51.389
and all kinds of incurable diseases
have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:59.735 --> 00:19:03.639
There are 3 doctors in India who have got their M. D

00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:09.409
in Sahaja yoga for curing incurable diseases.

00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:23.932
For that, you don’t have to study medicine.

00:19:30.345 --> 00:19:39.082
On your fingertips, you can feel the centres
who are in jeopardy.

00:19:45.847 --> 00:19:48.912
And you.  If you know how to cure yourself

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:51.017
you can also cure others.

00:19:56.263 --> 00:20:00.240
Because you develop the new dimension in your awareness.

00:20:06.217 --> 00:20:10.879
That we call as collective consciousness.

00:20:15.139 --> 00:20:22.446
Sitting down here you can feel the
centres of other people all over the world.

00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:33.538
Also, those who are dead you can find out
what sort of people they were.

00:20:40.143 --> 00:20:46.599
Most important thing is that,
we have to become the spirit

00:20:46.665 --> 00:20:51.610
because that is something indistinguishable.

00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:09.266
All the problems of a human being can be solved.

00:21:12.995 --> 00:21:16.840
It’s very important that today

00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:21.517
we should take to our self-hood,
to our self-knowledge,

00:21:28.368 --> 00:21:30.670
for which we don’t have to pay.

00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:32.456
You can not pay for it.

00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:40.044
You can not organize.

00:21:42.399 --> 00:21:44.295
You have no organisation as such.

00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:50.691
Individually you have to grow.

00:21:54.571 --> 00:22:01.671
So you rise above, the time,
above all your defects

00:22:01.704 --> 00:22:04.705
and you become a supreme personality.

00:22:14.337 --> 00:22:19.666
Every day I am giving lectures,
so my throat is out of order.

00:22:22.695 --> 00:22:25.076
This time alright!

00:22:36.884 --> 00:22:42.826
Our life today, seems to be in real jeopardy.

00:22:49.262 --> 00:22:51.313
Today for the first time

00:22:51.338 --> 00:22:54.142
I wanted to listen to the news in the morning.

00:22:54.167 --> 00:22:56.653
I never listen to the news in the morning.

00:22:56.678 --> 00:22:57.891
It’s horrible.

00:23:04.973 --> 00:23:07.298
And it was so shocking.

00:23:07.323 --> 00:23:09.959
Everywhere in the world, something is going on

00:23:09.984 --> 00:23:12.817
which is really unbearable.

00:23:19.908 --> 00:23:23.407
And when you see all that you feel that

00:23:23.442 --> 00:23:26.903
there is something must be done about it

00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:36.287
and that is to be done by the people

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:39.115
who achieve their self-realisation

00:23:49.407 --> 00:23:51.665
because you don’t know who you are?

00:23:55.381 --> 00:24:01.305
You are the epitome of the evolution.

00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:05.072
Interpreter: I don’t understand, sorry,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.266
The epitome of the human evolution means the highest.

00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:22.502
Now the last breakthrough is very simple.

00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:31.819
It’s your own power. It’s your own mother.

00:24:31.844 --> 00:24:33.724
She does it all.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:47.207
And when it happens you feel
from  top of your head

00:24:47.263 --> 00:24:51.630
the cool breeze like “Ruh” coming out

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.512
and you become “Ruhani” (spirituel person).

00:25:04.092 --> 00:25:07.222
Nobody has to certify you know yourself

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:18.106
and you are amazed that
yourself because so fantastic.

00:25:22.185 --> 00:25:23.629
But you are that!

00:25:25.915 --> 00:25:31.334
You are born to be that and it has to happen.

00:25:35.022 --> 00:25:37.740
There is no end to my lecture because I have been

00:25:37.756 --> 00:25:40.843
talking about it in every country I have been .

00:25:48.646 --> 00:25:52.695
but it works and there is no end to your energy.

00:25:56.475 --> 00:25:59.728
You must be knowing  I am 73 years of age.

00:25:59.753 --> 00:26:02.739
[UNCLEAR]

00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:09.405
and travel praticly every third day

00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:16.261
but I feel very energetic.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:23.629
and it works so well I have seen that people

00:26:23.638 --> 00:26:26.367
who are seekers some or other nature

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.496
I think it’s all organised by this Ruhani power.

00:26:43.443 --> 00:26:48.145
Thus,  you become religious,
you become righteous.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.719
There is no hypocrisy about it.

00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:03.447
My husband told me that
Turkish people are very  capable people

00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:06.347
very to able been.

00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:14.911
and I find that, they are such great artist

00:27:14.936 --> 00:27:18.272
they are so creative, everything is there

00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:26.461
but the only thing this has to happen

00:27:26.503 --> 00:27:29.458
so that you become great Sufi’s.

00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:38.689
This is very simple

00:27:38.706 --> 00:27:41.517
and you can work it out just now.

00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:51.927
Of course, I cannot force on you.

00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:57.814
You have to ask for it.

00:28:00.034 --> 00:28:03.660
If you do not desire,
I can not force on you,

00:28:07.739 --> 00:28:12.724
because this is the power of pure desire.

00:28:18.153 --> 00:28:22.273
If you have the desire to become the self,

00:28:22.286 --> 00:28:26.940
it is very simple because
only this power has to rise

00:28:26.965 --> 00:28:30.481
and pierce through your fontanel bone area

00:28:30.506 --> 00:28:33.787
become one with this all-pervading power.

00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:49.257
Sahaja means born with you.

00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:57.201
It’s the right that you become one
with this all-pervading power.

00:28:57.226 --> 00:28:59.642
This is a union.  This is yoga

00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:09.789
for which you don’t have to stand on your head do anything.

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:10.924
It’s just there.

00:29:15.735 --> 00:29:19.520
So, the only thing it has to work out.

00:29:23.321 --> 00:29:27.783
Now, you see there are so many beautiful lights here,

00:29:27.865 --> 00:29:30.067
but only one switch to can put on the whole

00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:31.876
because they are just switches.

00:29:39.784 --> 00:29:43.831
In the same way, you can get your enlightenment

00:29:43.856 --> 00:29:47.415
because that’s the built-in system within you like this.

00:29:54.743 --> 00:29:58.331
In every country, they have talked about this.

00:30:01.014 --> 00:30:03.537
In every religion, they have talked about this.

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:12.163
So one has to just get to it.

00:30:18.397 --> 00:30:21.785
It will not take more than 10 minutes

00:30:21.845 --> 00:30:25.622
but those who want to go, should leave the hall

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:33.910
because it can not be forced

00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:39.537
and those who do not want should please leave

00:30:39.562 --> 00:30:42.341
because others should not be disturbed in receiving.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:07.719
Of course,  of course,
There are very simple 3 conditions:

00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:20.670
First one is that you have to forgive yourself.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.526
You should not feel guilty about it at this moment.

00:31:34.327 --> 00:31:38.201
Because whatever wrong you have done is a past,

00:31:44.075 --> 00:31:47.104
so why you carry this myth on your head all the time.

00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:57.205
Actually, by feeling guilty
this centre is caught up here very much.

00:32:03.391 --> 00:32:06.891
You all have it very much so
that’s why I am coughing.

00:32:12.732 --> 00:32:17.267
But if this centre is very much caught up, then

00:32:19.072 --> 00:32:26.175
what happens is that you develop spondylitis.

00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:39.299
You can also have a disease called angina

00:32:41.414 --> 00:32:43.429
by which you get a heart attack

00:32:47.228 --> 00:32:53.375
or else you can also have a very lethargic organs.

00:32:56.994 --> 00:32:59.557
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all.

00:33:03.835 --> 00:33:10.870
So the second condition is to forgive others.

00:33:15.092 --> 00:33:17.038
You have to forgive others,

00:33:19.755 --> 00:33:24.145
because -whether you forgive or don’t forgive
you don’t do anything.

00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:31.606
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:33:36.194 --> 00:33:40.813
So the best is to forgive, not to carry this myth.

00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:51.468
So you forgive everyone,
even without thinking about them

00:33:57.359 --> 00:34:00.454
that will really make you feel much lighter.

00:34:04.523 --> 00:34:09.107
Then the third condition is – that
you have to take out your shoes

00:34:09.133 --> 00:34:11.317
which is not so difficult I think.

00:34:15.347 --> 00:34:19.315
In London, the first time when I told them
that take out your shoe

00:34:19.316 --> 00:34:21.405
half of them walked out.

00:34:31.713 --> 00:34:34.427
Please take out your shoes.

00:34:54.313 --> 00:35:04.979
Some people feel that they are basically bad.

00:35:18.704 --> 00:35:23.349
Interpreter : She shouldn’t  take
photograf during the session.

00:35:23.389 --> 00:35:26.889
Shri Mataji: Now, at  this time,
why don’t you take your realisation?

00:35:27.676 --> 00:35:29.097
That is the best.

00:35:44.402 --> 00:35:46.910
Then you enjoy yourself.

00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:03.683
Now, we will show you,

00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:11.054
how we have to nourish your
centres with your own hand.

00:36:36.475 --> 00:36:39.660
Left side that you have seen here,

00:36:39.946 --> 00:36:47.316
is what our mundane desires in day to day life.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:56.247
So please put your left hand on your lap

00:36:56.271 --> 00:37:02.355
or comfortably towards me
indicting that you desire it.

00:37:08.572 --> 00:37:17.553
Now believe me that you are all going
to become the self, the spirit.

00:37:19.816 --> 00:37:23.897
Have faith yourself,
you must have faith like this, like this.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.080
On the lap.

00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:26.886
That show it, like this, comfortable.

00:37:29.666 --> 00:37:31.086
No No like this.

00:37:36.386 --> 00:37:37.481
Alright!

00:37:43.759 --> 00:37:48.203
And the right hand is for the action.

00:37:53.046 --> 00:37:56.562
So you put your right hand on your heart.

00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:04.300
Left hand towards Me
and right hand on the heart.

00:38:07.642 --> 00:38:11.387
In the heart, resides your spirit.

00:38:15.737 --> 00:38:22.281
If you become the spirit,
you are your own guide.

00:38:22.322 --> 00:38:25.258
You are your own master.

00:38:35.854 --> 00:38:39.385
So you put your right hand in the

00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:42.984
upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.107
which is the centre of your mastery.

00:38:58.846 --> 00:39:03.935
Then you take your hand now below  in the
lower portion of the abdomen

00:39:03.954 --> 00:39:07.311
lower portion of the abdomen
on the left-hand side.

00:39:13.734 --> 00:39:16.313
Please keep your left hand straight like this.

00:39:19.685 --> 00:39:29.962
Now, this is the centre of pure knowledge that is divine.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.562
Even you people do it, because
you see there is nothing to [UNCLEAR].

00:39:52.372 --> 00:39:54.705
Because this is not to be repeated
what I am saying.

00:39:56.187 --> 00:39:57.655
Alright!

00:39:58.814 --> 00:40:01.631
Can you do it or not?

00:40:06.648 --> 00:40:08.338
Let us seek your peace.

00:40:11.448 --> 00:40:12.979
It’s much better.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:16.570
Alright!

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:23.440
So Now this is the centre of pure
divine knowledge.

00:40:27.757 --> 00:40:30.785
Now you have to raise your right hand

00:40:30.872 --> 00:40:40.571
on top of the upper part of the abdomen
on the left-hand side.

00:40:46.953 --> 00:40:49.389
You are nourishing your own centres.

00:40:52.793 --> 00:40:58.462
Now put your right hand on the
top of your heart.

00:41:04.105 --> 00:41:08.234
Now raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder

00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:10.150
and turn your head to your right.

00:41:15.586 --> 00:41:18.355
Now I have already told you about this centre

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.683
will go out of order

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.216
if you feel guilty.

00:41:26.564 --> 00:41:31.861
Now raise your right hand on the
top of your forehead across

00:41:36.335 --> 00:41:38.979
and please put down your head.

00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:48.234
This is the centre where you
have to forgive others in general.

00:41:54.737 --> 00:41:57.754
Now, take back your hand

00:41:57.779 --> 00:42:03.013
on the backside of your head and
push back your head as far as possible.

00:42:07.892 --> 00:42:12.434
This is the centre where without feeling guilty,

00:42:12.459 --> 00:42:14.626
without counting your mistakes,

00:42:14.652 --> 00:42:19.040
you have to ask forgiveness from
this all-pervading power.

00:42:28.142 --> 00:42:32.056
Now, stretch your palm fully

00:42:32.304 --> 00:42:36.205
and this the is the last centre where

00:42:36.229 --> 00:42:40.445
you have to put your hand is
the fontanel bone area

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.465
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:42:51.766 --> 00:42:55.513
Now please push back your finger.
This is very important.

00:42:58.861 --> 00:43:00.721
and put down your head.

00:43:02.801 --> 00:43:05.519
Now here, you have to move your scalp.

00:43:05.532 --> 00:43:12.770
Not your hand, your scalp,
carefully clockwise 7 times.

00:43:26.192 --> 00:43:27.898
Just bend your heads.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.070
That’s all we have to do.

00:43:39.126 --> 00:43:43.874
Now you have to close your eyes.

00:43:43.917 --> 00:43:46.862
Before that ,those who are sitting on the chair

00:43:46.887 --> 00:43:48.986
should put both the feet apart from each other.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:51.978
Those who are on the ground are alright.

00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:00.028
All of you take out your glasses.

00:44:09.017 --> 00:44:11.088
No, no, you are alright, you are alright,

00:44:12.122 --> 00:44:14.066
you don’t have to,  you are alright,

00:44:14.091 --> 00:44:17.243
those who are sitting on the chairs
because there are two powers.

00:44:23.682 --> 00:44:25.913
Now please close your eyes

00:44:25.922 --> 00:44:28.509
and don’t open them till I tell you.

00:44:36.482 --> 00:44:42.422
Now left hand towards Me and right
hand on the heart on the lap.

00:44:47.835 --> 00:44:53.107
Now in your heart, you have to ask a question

00:44:53.117 --> 00:44:56.896
about yourself.  a very fundamental one.

00:45:03.924 --> 00:45:09.942
You can call me Mother or
you can call me Shri Mataji,

00:45:15.904 --> 00:45:21.374
here you say, in your heart 3 times.

00:45:21.457 --> 00:45:26.770
Ask the question -Mother Am I the spirit?

00:45:36.641 --> 00:45:37.760
3 times

00:45:39.477 --> 00:45:43.827
I have told you already that
when you become the spirit.

00:45:43.837 --> 00:45:46.760
You become your master.

00:45:54.063 --> 00:46:01.966
So now put your right hand on top of your abdomen

00:46:01.991 --> 00:46:05.555
on the left-hand side in the
upper part and press it.

00:46:13.997 --> 00:46:16.879
Here you have to ask

00:46:18.437 --> 00:46:21.687
another question which is fundamental.

00:46:26.788 --> 00:46:31.615
Mother, Am I my own master?

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:41.721
Now I can not force

00:46:42.892 --> 00:46:45.848
the pure divine knowledge on you.

00:46:45.864 --> 00:46:48.300
You have to ask for it.

00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:58.988
So now please put your right hand in the

00:46:59.037 --> 00:47:03.667
lower portion of your abdomen on the
left-hand side and press it

00:47:07.943 --> 00:47:10.349
and please ask 6 times

00:47:10.365 --> 00:47:14.454
Mother please give me pure divine knowledge.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.960
Some of you are putting the left hand
on the other way.

00:47:26.985 --> 00:47:32.861
Please put it like this.
I see some of you are putting wrong.

00:47:42.709 --> 00:47:47.073
Now Please ask six times

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:51.602
Mother please give me your divine knowledge.

00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:06.426
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:48:16.415 --> 00:48:20.758
As soon as you ask for the divine knowledge

00:48:20.799 --> 00:48:23.994
this power starts rising within you,

00:48:24.019 --> 00:48:33.688
so you have to open higher centres
with self-confidence.

00:48:41.293 --> 00:48:44.491
So, here you ask

00:48:45.007 --> 00:48:50.918
or you can say with full self-confidence
10 times

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:55.239
“Mother I am my own master”.

00:49:05.715 --> 00:49:08.357
I must tell you, that

00:49:08.392 --> 00:49:11.392
you are not this body this mind,

00:49:11.426 --> 00:49:16.795
these emotions, these egos,
these conditionings,

00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:20.925
but you are your own spirit.

00:49:31.044 --> 00:49:35.148
So now raise your right hand on your heart

00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:41.653
and here, you have to say
with full self-confidence, 12 times

00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:46.317
“ Mother I am the pure spirit”.

00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:03.726
I have already told you

00:50:03.742 --> 00:50:07.585
that you should not feel guilty for your past.

00:50:14.765 --> 00:50:23.334
Because this all-pervading power of love
is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:31.684
And whatever mistakes you might have committed

00:50:31.717 --> 00:50:36.243
will be completely dissolved
by this power of forgiveness.

00:50:42.842 --> 00:50:46.397
So please forgive yourself.

00:50:48.377 --> 00:50:53.843
And you rise your right hand in
the corner of your neck  and shoulder

00:50:53.868 --> 00:50:56.670
and turn your head to your right.

00:51:05.856 --> 00:51:12.306
Here now you have to say with
full self-confidence 16 times

00:51:12.331 --> 00:51:16.565
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

00:51:29.176 --> 00:51:31.696
I have already told you that

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:36.045
whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything

00:51:42.275 --> 00:51:45.679
but if you don’t forgive then

00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:49.556
you play in the wrong hands
and you torture yourself.

00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:57.330
Especially at this moment, it’s very important .

00:51:57.355 --> 00:52:02.672
because the centre that is crossing of

00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:06.812
your optic chiasma is very constricted

00:52:14.028 --> 00:52:19.335
and if you don’t forgive, this power don’t rise through

00:52:19.381 --> 00:52:24.226
because this centre has to open.

00:52:29.985 --> 00:52:34.693
So, please take your right hand
on the top of your forehead across

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:37.246
and put down your head.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:49.376
Here you have to be humble and say from your heart

00:52:49.379 --> 00:52:51.014
not how many times

00:52:51.086 --> 00:52:55.613
“Mother I forgive everyone in general”.

00:53:10.212 --> 00:53:14.531
Now without feeling guilty,
without counting your mistakes

00:53:14.555 --> 00:53:18.438
just for your satisfaction,

00:53:18.456 --> 00:53:21.402
from this all-pervading power.

00:53:30.814 --> 00:53:34.393
So please take your right hand
in the backside of your head

00:53:34.418 --> 00:53:37.252
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:53:45.152 --> 00:53:49.367
Here, you have to say

00:53:49.382 --> 00:53:52.764
-not how many times- but from your heart

00:53:53.204 --> 00:53:57.753
“Oh Divine power! Oh, Ruhani power!
Please forgive me

00:53:57.769 --> 00:54:02.853
if I have done anything wrong
knowingly and unknowingly.”

00:54:16.646 --> 00:54:25.075
Now the last most important centre
is on top of your head.

00:54:32.945 --> 00:54:37.464
Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm

00:54:37.497 --> 00:54:40.401
on the top of the fontanel bone area

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:43.858
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:54:53.729 --> 00:54:59.095
Now please push back your fingers,
it’s very important because

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:02.528
you have to have good pressure on your scalp.

00:55:14.497 --> 00:55:17.593
Now Please bend your head.

00:55:19.688 --> 00:55:24.607
Here again I can not force self-realisation on you.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.155
So you have to ask for it.

00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:39.558
So move your scalp 7 times clockwise, saying

00:55:39.807 --> 00:55:44.024
“Mother please give me my self-hood

00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:48.115
or my self-realisation or my spirit.”

00:56:22.895 --> 00:56:28.246
Now, takedown your hand
and slowly open your eyes.

00:56:34.621 --> 00:56:38.517
Now, please put both your hands towards me like this.

00:56:43.615 --> 00:56:46.647
Now, put your right hand like this,

00:56:46.672 --> 00:56:50.237
bent your head and with the left hand, you see

00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:54.725
on top of your head if there any cool breeze

00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.745
or a hot breeze coming out of your own head.

00:57:14.854 --> 00:57:18.020
Now please put your left hand.

00:57:18.039 --> 00:57:22.573
And see with your right hand,
if there is a cool or a hot breeze

00:57:22.598 --> 00:57:25.623
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:57:36.097 --> 00:57:39.813
Higher, higher not on the top of the head.

00:57:39.837 --> 00:57:43.442
It can be very much higher also.
Just move and see.

00:57:46.066 --> 00:57:50.029
If you are have not forgiven yourself
or not forgiven others.

00:57:50.054 --> 00:57:52.636
It will be hot here coming in.

00:58:01.776 --> 00:58:03.791
Now,

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:14.748
Now, Put the right hand towards me

00:58:14.773 --> 00:58:16.551
and again [UNCLEAR]

00:58:16.576 --> 00:58:23.628
with your left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:58:33.539 --> 00:58:37.286
Now raise both the hands towards the sky
and push back your head.

00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:48.565
Here now you have to ask one question 3 times:

00:58:50.118 --> 00:58:56.336
Is this the all-pervading power
of divine love that is called as “Ruh”.

00:58:56.499 --> 00:59:01.556
3 times ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading power

00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:05.648
of divine love which is called as Ruh”.

00:59:08.573 --> 00:59:10.977
Push back your head.

00:59:19.192 --> 00:59:21.584
Now please take down your hand.

00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:26.996
Now put both the hands towards me like this.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.660
And watch me without thinking

00:59:33.685 --> 00:59:39.130
because this is what happens
that you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:59:45.816 --> 00:59:49.490
You come to your present.
You stand in your present.

00:59:55.102 --> 00:59:57.009
Please put both the hands.

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:06.018
All those who have felt the cool
or hot breeze on the fingers,

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:10.380
on the palm or on the top of the fontanel bone area

01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:12.557
Please raise your both hands

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:29.560
Oh, my God.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.473
Look at that!

01:00:31.664 --> 01:00:34.099
The whole of the Turkey has got it!
May God bless you !

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.314
May God bless you !

01:00:35.636 --> 01:00:40.397
I bow to you all, Now your saintly life has started.
