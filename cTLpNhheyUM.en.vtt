00:01:24.908 --> 00:01:39.449
We all are expecting something great to happen
and the happening that has to take place has

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:44.779
been already described in all the scriptures.

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:56.758
But somehow we are misled by other people
who have a better way of manifesting their

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:14.410
own style and we get so confused because this
is the time of great confusion.

00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:20.179
Without the confusion evolution cannot take
place.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:27.869
Unless and until people are confused they
will never try to aspire for something higher.

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:39.559
If you see in the animal stage also, there
was a confusion for the fishes to come out,

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:48.000
and that confusion made one or two to lead
the rest of them and that’s how they could

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:54.568
crawl onto this Mother Earth with confidence.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.699
So the areas started changing gradually, that,
from Mother Earth then they started looking

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:06.809
towards the sky.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:13.250
And the evolution went on like this till the
human beings were created.

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:22.128
Now, all these areas are within ourselves.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:33.880
These are all the elements into which we had
to probe into: we had to find about them.

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:43.508
And through this evolution we have been able
to look into these, to fathom them, to find

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.259
out their nature through our intelligence.

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:57.168
So we reached this point where we could understand
the elements, we could understand their use

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.750
for our purpose.

00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:01.250
So far so good.

00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:05.139
But that’s not the end.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.130
That’s not the end of our evolution.

00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:18.988
If it was then there would have been no more
search, there would have been no more seeking,

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.008
people would have been happy, would have been
satisfied, but that’s not so.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.258
So there has to be something more that we
have to achieve.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:53.250
At this time of great confusion we have certain
lamp posts, we can say, or beacons, to guide

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:59.299
us and these beacons are all the scriptures.

00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:07.589
Now these scriptures are also so much being
misused and misrepresented and explained in

00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:15.630
such a funny way and everything made into
a money-making proposition, that it adds to

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.320
the confusion more.

00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:25.910
So you get much more confused and confused
and confused.

00:05:25.911 --> 00:05:33.589
Imagine the light that has to show your path
becomes an illusion: how are you to find your

00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:35.089
path then.

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:41.929
But this is the pastime of human beings, you
can’t help it.

00:05:41.931 --> 00:05:46.769
You give them everything and they can convert
it into a confusion.

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:54.290
You can see the results of these in our politicians,
in our economists, our psychologists: all

00:05:54.291 --> 00:06:02.079
of them seem to be quite confused, and they
don’t know what the other person is saying,

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:03.239
what they are saying.

00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:10.869
And they cannot relate it to something absolute.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:19.529
So we have to find out that absolute point
where this confusion drops out.

00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:27.660
At this level only you can find it out, at
this level only it can be given, at this level

00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:31.769
only that will manifest.

00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:38.440
Before this, at any other stage it is impossible.

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:42.220
It was impossible and it is impossible.

00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:48.000
So at human stage only it is going to manifest.

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:59.320
But human beings also must know that they
have some drawbacks compared to other stages.

00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:06.299
At the animal stage or even earlier stages
you can say: at the element stage.

00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:08.660
Elements don’t have to think.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:11.299
They don’t have any choice.

00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:14.160
They don’t have to bother about anything.

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:15.190
They just exist.

00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:23.329
They are not aware of anything; they are just
existing with whatever are their qualities:

00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.940
say hydrogen is hydrogen, oxygen is oxygen.

00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:31.418
They are bound by different valencies and
different qualities and their chemical compounds

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:44.529
and their physical powers by which they act,
react and exist.

00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:56.380
Then when the life started itself, at that
time also, life was guided, very much by nature.

00:07:56.381 --> 00:08:02.228
The evolution was very much controlled by
nature.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.640
I’ll give you an example of that.

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:13.279
A gentleman who has written a very nice book
– I would not give you the name because

00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:19.720
you will immediately buy that book and start
reading the whole thing – but he was experimenting

00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:27.728
with some oysters and he had them first in
Los Angeles where the sea was.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:36.270
And he found out that when the tide was low
these shells used to open themselves up, the

00:08:36.271 --> 00:08:41.958
oysters, and when it was high tide they would
close down because the water should not run

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.349
into them.

00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:50.630
And you know that the tide time is bound everywhere:
anybody can calculate it sitting down here

00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:55.440
what is the tide in Falkland.

00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:01.239
So he removed those shells from there, brought
them to Ohio which is very far away and there

00:09:01.241 --> 00:09:08.070
is no sea and he put them down there and they
were opening at the same time.

00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:14.020
Now see: the time changes according to the
moon, so the water was acting according to

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:20.599
the moon and these oysters were also acting
according to the moon.

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:28.239
But when the time changed, they came to Ohio,
still they had that habit and they were opening.

00:09:28.241 --> 00:09:38.179
But suddenly they changed and they took to
the timing which would happen if the sea was

00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:41.508
there in Ohio!

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.119
So they were so much bound still by nature.

00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:56.539
Nature controls them, and up to a great point,
nature even controlled human beings.

00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:08.299
But in the animal stage one has to know that,
to find out the difference between an animal

00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:18.518
and a vegetable, what happened was, first
the cellular wall was doubled.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:28.159
So element was first put into a cell to make
a vegetable and the vegetable was given a

00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:32.818
double wall to make it an animal.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:45.268
Now [an] animal that has become a human being
has a triple bond, that’s why is the confusion.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:53.018
That we call as ‘human freedom’: that
we are free to do what we like: “What’s

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.018
wrong?”

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.018
Correct!

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.008
I mean if somebody wants to commit suicide,
what’s wrong?

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.948
Somebody wants to kill his father, what’s
wrong?

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.219
I mean laws according to many people is all
artificial, man-made — is correct.

00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:06.698
So, what’s wrong?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.479
So we were bound thrice.

00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:20.528
The third binding came when, as human beings,
we started acting, creating our ego as a by-product

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.148
of that action, physical and mental.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.828
We developed ourselves into an egg.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:32.349
We became just like eggs and this egg had
three shells.

00:11:32.351 --> 00:11:40.698
First one of the human shell, second of the
animal, and third that of the vegetables and

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.750
inside that were all the elements.

00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:50.159
That’s how we are made.

00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:51.698
But for what?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.909
Why?

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:55.979
Why this freedom was given to us?

00:11:55.981 --> 00:12:00.528
To get us confused?

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:10.398
Because we had to go to a higher evolutionary
state, and that higher evolutionary state

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:19.609
has to give us complete freedom from all these
three bondages: the vegetable bondage which

00:12:19.611 --> 00:12:30.799
makes you stick to one place, the animal bondage
where you cannot think, and human bondage

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.328
where you think.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.929
Man can’t live without thinking: it’s
a bondage.

00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.388
We can’t get out of it.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.289
Like horns it grows into your head.

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:45.878
You can’t stop it you know.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.849
Even if you cut your throat you cannot stop
it, some people say – it’s surprising.

00:12:50.851 --> 00:12:53.328
It’s so bad, it’s such a bondage in us.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.628
All the time we think, think, think.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:01.248
This is the third bondage: of human being.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:05.859
But what happens with this when this bondage
is broken?

00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:12.328
Light comes in, through the light.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:22.518
And this light gives you enlightenment in
all the three prisons into which you are imprisoned;

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:31.688
and you get a complete integration into all
these different bondages within you and you

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:42.508
start seeing the absolute truth: that all
this is bound by one thread.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:52.388
All these elements, all these vegetables,
animals, human beings are bound by one thread.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:58.719
And when you start seeing that thread as a
witness, you start seeing the play of all

00:13:58.721 --> 00:14:05.928
these elements, of all these bondages — beautifully.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:12.578
But there’s a very great difference between
the other evolution and the evolution of man

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.578
at this stage.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:25.448
It’s a very great difference I think, which
very few people realise: that before the evolution

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:33.989
up to human stage, you are not aware of it
and you can’t do anything about it at all.

00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:44.169
Supposing a seed evolves into a better fruit
— it doesn’t have to do anything about

00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:48.229
it, somebody else has to do.

00:14:48.231 --> 00:14:53.299
If you sprout a seed then you have to look
after it throughout.

00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:58.558
Sprout the seed then take the seedlings, put
them right somewhere then let them grow into

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:00.938
a tree, then you have to prune the tree.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:07.828
Whatever you have to do, you have to do all
the time, you have to look after the tree.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:17.008
But after this evolution, this jumping, this
happening, when you become the Self, you have

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:22.648
to do something about it: you have to.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:29.338
Because you become the master of your being.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.858
It is you who has to work it out.

00:15:31.859 --> 00:15:40.669
In Sahaja Yoga there are many people who get
Realisation: it’s very easy.

00:15:40.671 --> 00:15:45.719
The confusion is so great that people want
to come out of it, [so] they get it.

00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:54.568
But again they are drawn back into it because
that time which is so important, the intermediary

00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:05.349
time, where you have to stick on to that area,
to that new dimension of collective consciousness,

00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:15.028
your willpower doesn’t act, and that is
the time you require this will power.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.729
Already you are exhausted.

00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:25.039
So many are exhausted because of seeking,
because of worrying, because of thinking,

00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:28.448
wrong seeking, gurus, this that.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:33.719
All kinds of exhaustions are there: family
life, married life.

00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:38.518
Every sort of problem that you have faced,
you have already exhausted your willpower.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:47.278
And when even you get Realised, you have the
cup, but you have no strength to lift, within

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:57.068
yourself, to raise it to your mouth and to
enjoy the nectar of your Realisation.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.438
More so in places that are supposed to be
developed.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:09.458
In developing that part of your systems you
have exhausted yourself much more.

00:17:09.459 --> 00:17:18.900
I mean it was all right up to a point, but
when human beings know something, they’ll

00:17:18.901 --> 00:17:21.410
go to the extreme end of everything.

00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:29.739
Now, if you know electricity, then everything
must work on electricity, your lift will work

00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:33.859
on electricity, this will work on electricity,
now computers have come, all right.

00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:36.510
Now they will make human beings into electrical
electrodes!

00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:39.839
I don’t know what they’re going to make
out of that.

00:17:39.841 --> 00:17:43.130
I mean, going to that extent.

00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:45.540
But then electricity fails — finished!

00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:49.609
Now petrol has started — use petrol as much
as you like, all right.

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:53.770
Now petrol is getting exhausted.

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:56.829
So there’s a shock, future shock condition.

00:17:56.831 --> 00:17:59.020
In a trauma we sit.

00:17:59.021 --> 00:18:02.910
In that confused state you are in a shocked
state, “Oh God what’s going to happen

00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:03.910
to us?”

00:18:03.911 --> 00:18:09.640
But why play into the hands of these things
to that extent.

00:18:09.641 --> 00:18:15.099
The countries which are not so developed,
we can say countries which are a little underdeveloped

00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:19.130
and developed: where a motor car runs and
a bullock cart also runs.

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:28.280
If the motor car fails they can use the oxes
to run the motor cars, we call it ‘Ox Ford’.

00:18:28.281 --> 00:18:29.280
(laughter)

00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:35.829
So one can rely on something else, there is
an alternative already available.

00:18:35.831 --> 00:18:40.579
But when you cut out all the alternatives,
then how can you find out an alternative.

00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:44.180
For example, now we’ve got calculators.

00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:48.798
I was amazed in the shop: they can’t count
one, two, three, four, five.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.390
If they make mistakes in somewhere, if you
tell them that, that’s a mistake, because

00:18:52.391 --> 00:18:55.079
you know how to calculate, they say, “How
can it be?

00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:56.109
The machine is not wrong."

00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:58.839
But your fingers were wrong somewhere.

00:18:58.841 --> 00:19:01.560
They have no alternatives left now.

00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:03.311
I mean they have to depend on the electricity.

00:19:03.313 --> 00:19:11.359
They have to depend on petrol.

00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:14.349
You have to depend on all these elements.

00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:23.729
So if you find with a little detachment: we
are already slaves of all these elements.

00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:28.650
Instead of becoming free birds, we have become
now slaves of this.

00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:30.910
So we start finding out alternatives.

00:19:30.911 --> 00:19:34.310
Now what can alternatives we can have?

00:19:34.311 --> 00:19:38.260
We have lost all deftness to do any hand work.

00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:43.140
After some time I think people won’t be
able to clean their dishes, they will need

00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.250
a machine.

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:49.510
As it is they can’t clean their clothes
I think, they can’t comb their hair.

00:19:49.511 --> 00:19:51.170
What’s going to happen?

00:19:51.171 --> 00:19:53.119
You will need even a machine to feed you!

00:19:53.121 --> 00:20:01.310
Going to that extent: when we go up to such
a limit that we become absolute slaves.

00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:04.079
The confusion is worse.

00:20:04.081 --> 00:20:09.530
But after Realisation the whole thing changes.

00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:12.300
All the priorities change, you become a different
person.

00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.630
It’s a tremendous change that comes within
you.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:21.790
But to appreciate it, to understand it and
use it, you have to stabilise yourself because

00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:25.380
you are still shaking.

00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:30.709
And it’s very easy to go back to the life
which you have lead so far.

00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:35.040
We have had people coming from all works of
life.

00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:37.380
We had bureaucrats.

00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:38.650
We had people who were hippies.

00:20:38.651 --> 00:20:44.219
They must belong to some club: “Are you
a communist or a socialist?”

00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:48.270
Like when I came here, they asked me, “What
is your politics?”

00:20:48.271 --> 00:20:49.640
I looked at them.

00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:51.000
I said, “Which one?”

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:53.569
They said, “I mean what politics we have.

00:20:53.571 --> 00:20:55.349
What is yours?”

00:20:55.351 --> 00:20:59.939
I said, “I don’t know."

00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:04.099
Quite confused you see.

00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:09.939
I was quite confused, because I had no politics
at all.

00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:17.900
There’s only one politics for me, that is
the politics of the Divine, of God: where

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:23.000
He plays His tricks on all human beings; I
see that every day.

00:21:23.001 --> 00:21:27.930
They don’t know, but He’s playing tricks
on everyone: on nations, on human beings,

00:21:27.931 --> 00:21:29.189
on all organisations.

00:21:29.191 --> 00:21:32.959
He’s playing tricks all the time to make
you learn so many things, but you don’t

00:21:32.961 --> 00:21:33.959
want to learn.

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:36.449
That’s the only politics.

00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:39.430
These politics are nothing but children’s
play, they are of no use.

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:43.859
This is just you want to play with cards and
you sit down and play; that’s all, to me.

00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:47.369
Otherwise there’s no politics for me.

00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:50.339
What is economics of God?

00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:54.010
That’s the only economics that reins.

00:21:54.011 --> 00:21:58.250
No other economics reins for me.

00:21:58.251 --> 00:22:04.310
His economics is that matter doesn’t give
you joy.

00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:13.410
He gives you something that gives you joy,
that gives you compassion, love, security,

00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:16.160
health, innocence.

00:22:16.161 --> 00:22:25.829
Above all it gives you the power to love others:
tremendous power it is.

00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:29.540
We have never used the power of love, never.

00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:34.170
Always we have used the power of hatred.

00:22:34.171 --> 00:22:37.900
All our politics and economics is based on
hatred.

00:22:37.901 --> 00:22:46.670
We create goods to sell by seeing what weaknesses
people have: like England or America and all

00:22:46.671 --> 00:22:49.989
these Western countries.

00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:56.000
In India the crooks found out that there are
many seekers in these countries — all right,

00:22:56.001 --> 00:22:57.000
export all the crooks!

00:22:57.001 --> 00:23:00.079
They all came out of the jail and are here
back.

00:23:00.081 --> 00:23:04.810
They have got Rolls Royces, they have got
big, big huge houses, they have got huge big

00:23:04.811 --> 00:23:12.130
aeroplanes and you can’t see that.

00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:14.839
This is the economics of human beings.

00:23:14.841 --> 00:23:24.319
But God’s economics is such that if you
have any want, it looks after you.

00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:29.349
But it gives you a desire for the right type
of wants.

00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:36.699
Because the whole system changes, the whole
value system changes.

00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:45.109
A person who is a realised-soul would like
to have vibrations flowing all the time.

00:23:45.111 --> 00:23:49.140
Today I had taken my grandchildren to a shop
to buy them a sweater.

00:23:49.141 --> 00:23:54.810
It’s very difficult because they are realised-souls,
all of them.

00:23:54.811 --> 00:23:57.550
So I gave them a very beautiful one.

00:23:57.551 --> 00:23:58.959
I said, “How do you like it?”

00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:00.229
They said, “No, it’s very uncomfortable."

00:24:00.231 --> 00:24:01.229
It was acrylic.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.089
They just can’t have it.

00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:07.369
I said, “But it’s quite nice and cheap."

00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:09.020
So she refused to have it.

00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:12.900
Then it was semi-acrylic: refused to have it.

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:15.319
Then I gave her wool.

00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:22.089
I said, “But this wool will be only one
when you can have ten like these if you buy

00:24:22.091 --> 00:24:23.089
acrylic."

00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:29.459
She said, “Better to have one which you
can wear, than to have ten which you cannot

00:24:29.461 --> 00:24:30.459
wear."

00:24:30.461 --> 00:24:35.359
The whole value system changes, to have too
many things becomes useless!

00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:41.010
Have one which is comfortable to your being.

00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:48.540
Somehow they have reached even rationally,
through your science and to such points, that

00:24:48.541 --> 00:24:50.239
Sahaja Yoga just fits into it.

00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:57.560
I sometimes feel all these things have created
the beautiful ring for the diamond of Sahaja

00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:00.390
Yoga to just fit into it.

00:25:00.391 --> 00:25:07.410
For example people are now realising that
there is no sense in creating plastic.

00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:16.390
But say about thirty years back, people would
have been proud to have a sofa set made out

00:25:16.391 --> 00:25:20.000
of plastic.

00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:26.729
We had a ship from Norway, I remember, about
thirty years back, and they were going round

00:25:26.731 --> 00:25:36.719
to show us how they had made plastic railings
for the staircases: beautiful plastic railings.

00:25:36.721 --> 00:25:40.380
And we were all very much enamoured in India,
how they had made it.

00:25:40.381 --> 00:25:44.180
While we can make very beautiful carvings,
but we thought this was wonderful: looks so

00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:49.770
nice, washable, you can wash it, no polishing
needed, no painting needed, wonderful thing

00:25:49.771 --> 00:25:52.140
you know, just go ahead with it.

00:25:52.141 --> 00:26:00.079
But now the same Norwegians are asking Indians
to create some things for them out of wood.

00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:10.890
So the whole value system changes, as soon
as you start feeling your Self, your being.

00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:19.150
Because your being is absolute: it is truth,
and its complete beauty manifests when you

00:26:19.151 --> 00:26:27.410
start, with your willpower, accepting the
new challenge that is given to you.

00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:33.770
And that is the time where this built-in ego
of ages stands out: “Why?

00:26:33.771 --> 00:26:36.239
Why to do like this?”

00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:43.439
So many things in the society that we have,
whether in India or here or anywhere in the

00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:49.479
whole world, are so shocking that only after
Realisation you realise that you have been

00:26:49.481 --> 00:26:53.390
going on with it all these lives and your
parents have been and their parents have been.

00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:58.459
It’s absolutely a shocking thing.

00:26:58.461 --> 00:27:01.839
But for that you have to first get your Realisation.

00:27:01.841 --> 00:27:06.670
That part is not so difficult, as I told you,
because the time has come for many to get

00:27:06.671 --> 00:27:07.670
Realisation.

00:27:07.671 --> 00:27:15.420
But how many will enjoy it you cannot say,
because Mr Ego is the worst enemy of human

00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:16.420
beings.

00:27:16.421 --> 00:27:23.109
First of all they cannot take it from anyone
else but themselves.

00:27:23.111 --> 00:27:24.869
This is the big problem.

00:27:24.871 --> 00:27:29.051
“All right,” I say, “even take that
way!”

00:27:29.053 --> 00:27:32.250
But it cannot be done.

00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:36.140
Now supposing somebody has to do it: it’s
not a very easy thing you know, it’s a very

00:27:36.141 --> 00:27:40.800
difficult thing to do such a thing, and it’s
horribly embarrassing.

00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:44.810
You have to do something which people think
they can do themselves!You can imagine how

00:27:44.811 --> 00:27:46.510
embarrassing it is.

00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:52.119
Only a Mother can take such a situation that
she knows her children are like that, doesn’t

00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:53.119
matter.

00:27:53.121 --> 00:27:57.630
But any other person would say, “Go to hell
what do I care!

00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.859
Why should I take the responsibility of anybody
and why should I say all these things to them?

00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:05.680
If they are so egoistical, let them go to
hell!”

00:28:05.681 --> 00:28:08.369
This is what is really the situation.

00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:13.239
But supposing somebody is nothing but compassion
and love: supposing.

00:28:13.241 --> 00:28:18.160
I mean, it’s a supposition for many people:
they can’t believe it.

00:28:18.161 --> 00:28:23.020
Supposing someone is, then someone has to
do it.

00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:26.670
And if someone has to do it why be so angry
about it?

00:28:26.671 --> 00:28:30.560
This I have failed to understand.

00:28:30.561 --> 00:28:39.250
Like in Spain one gentleman got Realisation
and he couldn’t believe that it has happened.

00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:42.349
And he came to me and argued with me in a
very funny manner.

00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:44.869
He said, “But why is it you had to do it?”

00:28:44.871 --> 00:28:45.920
I said, “You do it!”

00:28:45.921 --> 00:28:48.180
(laughter) That he can’t do!

00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:51.869
I said, “All right, now if you are angry
for that…”

00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:56.150
Because it has happened in my presence, he
was angry with me.

00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.760
He was thinking why shouldn’t he do it.

00:28:58.761 --> 00:29:03.609
I said, “All right now you can do it but
before this you could not!”

00:29:03.611 --> 00:29:05.829
So he was very angry for that also.

00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:09.699
He said, “Why should God make one person
do it?”

00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:11.390
I said, “It’s really horrible I tell you!

00:29:11.391 --> 00:29:14.719
If He had given one hundred people to do it,
it would be much better.

00:29:14.721 --> 00:29:17.160
I would have taken some rest myself.

00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:23.880
Because I am already sixty years of age and
when am I going to retire?

00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:24.880
But it’s not so.

00:29:24.881 --> 00:29:26.689
What can I do?”

00:29:26.691 --> 00:29:28.640
Then he was still angry with me.

00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:31.410
He said, “But must be something why you
are doing it."

00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:33.660
I said, “Yes there is!”

00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:34.839
“What is it?”

00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:36.459
I said, “Love."

00:29:36.461 --> 00:29:40.130
He couldn’t understand that, he couldn’t
understand that.

00:29:40.131 --> 00:29:43.979
So he went on with very great anger still.

00:29:43.981 --> 00:29:45.510
He said, “But must be something!”

00:29:45.511 --> 00:29:51.959
Then foolishly one of the Sahaja Yogis, brought
my shoes down to put in my feet, which I never

00:29:51.961 --> 00:29:56.250
asked them, I never asked them, I have never
ask them, I would not like it.

00:29:56.251 --> 00:30:00.839
But they like it because there are vibrations
in my shoes!

00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:03.180
Out of their self-interest that they’re
doing it.

00:30:03.181 --> 00:30:08.010
And he said, “This is the reason why you
are doing all this!”

00:30:08.011 --> 00:30:09.770
I said, “Really?

00:30:09.771 --> 00:30:11.520
It’s very wise."

00:30:11.521 --> 00:30:15.050
And at that point he left Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:19.239
So there are such wise people in this world.

00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:24.670
I am talking of something very great and the
wisdom of people is so limited.

00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:27.579
The quality of wisdom is poor.

00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:36.319
They are intelligent, well-educated but quality
of wisdom is very poor.

00:30:36.321 --> 00:30:43.689
But in a village [if] you go, you always find
villagers more wise than the city people,

00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:44.689
I tell you.

00:30:44.691 --> 00:30:49.469
The reason is they live with the Mother Earth,
they take all their innocence.

00:30:49.471 --> 00:30:51.229
Without innocence you cannot have wisdom.

00:30:51.231 --> 00:30:54.849
Innocence is the basis of wisdom.

00:30:54.851 --> 00:31:01.308
Normally people who are living in the city
have to deal with such crooks that part of

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:05.359
the wisdom is lost.

00:31:05.361 --> 00:31:10.449
And that’s why the quality of wisdom I find
is lacking.

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:18.640
If that is there, Sahaja Yoga works out, it
gives you what is your own and you enjoy what

00:31:18.641 --> 00:31:19.750
is your own.

00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:23.930
Now take a simple question, a simple thing.

00:31:23.931 --> 00:31:35.670
You have got say for example your property,
say your ornaments, kept with someone; and

00:31:35.671 --> 00:31:38.849
somebody knows the keys and the ornaments.

00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:45.410
Say your forefathers have given the key to
a person and the person comes and says that,

00:31:45.411 --> 00:31:51.349
“I have got the keys with me, you take it
and use your own money."

00:31:51.351 --> 00:31:54.109
Will you get angry with that person for that?

00:31:54.111 --> 00:32:00.219
For nothing at all, for giving nothing, will
you get angry?

00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:05.400
But immediately they become like a bull: “No
we’ll not have it!”

00:32:05.401 --> 00:32:06.569
“But why?

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:07.739
Please have!”

00:32:07.741 --> 00:32:08.900
I persuade.

00:32:08.901 --> 00:32:10.650
“Please have it!

00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:11.650
Enjoy it.

00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:12.650
It is your own.

00:32:12.651 --> 00:32:16.750
You have been desiring it, you have been wanting
it, please have it."

00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:19.381
They say, “Why should we have it?

00:32:19.383 --> 00:32:21.890
Who are you to give us the key?”

00:32:21.891 --> 00:32:23.390
I mean, “But I have it!

00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:25.069
What am I to do?”

00:32:25.071 --> 00:32:30.050
I am imploring, “Please just have it."

00:32:30.051 --> 00:32:33.040
But they are adamant just like bulls you know.

00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:35.560
Bulls are easy, easier people.

00:32:35.561 --> 00:32:37.229
I tell you, bulls are much easier.

00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:42.400
If there is a bull like that in India what
we do, we take some red chillies and put to

00:32:42.401 --> 00:32:45.209
the nose and it will get up.

00:32:45.211 --> 00:32:47.329
But what should we do with human beings?

00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:53.150
They are stuck-up people and this really amazes me.

00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:57.449
Aren’t you seeking, aren’t you seeking?

00:32:57.451 --> 00:32:59.469
What more do you want me to say?

00:32:59.471 --> 00:33:01.359
It is impossible.

00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:04.558
I mean I discussed with them I said, “What
should we do with these people?”

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.819
They come, get Realisation, disappear just
like that!

00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:11.729
After ten months they’ll appear, “Mother
I developed this trouble, that trouble."

00:33:11.731 --> 00:33:13.150
But why not?

00:33:13.151 --> 00:33:16.349
It’s all free to you.

00:33:16.351 --> 00:33:23.270
We had in India a great advantage I should
say because we know what to expect, first

00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:24.660
of all.

00:33:24.661 --> 00:33:29.609
Everyone knows: whether you go to a villager
or to an educated man, everyone knows what

00:33:29.611 --> 00:33:32.619
to expect, everyone.

00:33:32.621 --> 00:33:35.699
Secondly they know how to make out a real
person.

00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:36.959
I mean not the westernised [ones].

00:33:36.961 --> 00:33:39.760
The westernised I don’t know but otherwise.

00:33:39.761 --> 00:33:45.199
Then also we have a great advantage of certain
prophesies made in our country so people know

00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.689
when it is going to happen, how to pin down
the thing.

00:33:48.691 --> 00:33:54.239
Now you too had prophesies made, like a person
like William Blake.

00:33:54.241 --> 00:33:57.439
But who understands William Blake here?

00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:58.579
No one!

00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:03.239
Because he is on a different plane and when
he speaks no one understands him.

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:08.449
So it has all been prophesised that you are
going to get it, this is going to happen.

00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:14.308
There’s a book written thousands of years
back that this is going to happen in 1970,

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:19.489
that people are going to get transformation,
that they are going to get into a system,

00:34:19.491 --> 00:34:25.848
a new system will be developed by which they
will get their Realisation.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:30.428
There will not be any need to go to hospitals
any more after that.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.969
Even the word is there that they will not
go to any rugunalay (रुग्णालय)

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.580
means a hospital.

00:34:35.581 --> 00:34:38.729
So clearly it is given thousands of years
back!

00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:41.928
And people are looking forward for that.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.939
But the tragedy is: most of the seekers are
born in the West.

00:34:45.941 --> 00:34:52.739
It’s like one has the teeth so he cannot
get food and the one who has got food, has

00:34:52.741 --> 00:34:56.818
no teeth!

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:03.459
And that is why Sahaja Yoga takes time to
develop.

00:35:03.461 --> 00:35:09.239
It will always because it’s such a process,
living process.

00:35:09.241 --> 00:35:15.280
And this is the living process of the living
God which you must ask for.

00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:22.318
You must not any more look at things which
are done artificially: like a baptism, like

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:29.078
in Indian communities we’ll have a ceremony
actually called as a your ‘gopavita’,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.979
where they say that, “Now you are a twice
born!”

00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:33.510
At the age of eight years it is done actually.

00:35:33.511 --> 00:35:35.949
Even Muslims do that.

00:35:35.951 --> 00:35:41.800
And everybody gets a kind of a thread in India
to celebrate that: “Now you have become

00:35:41.801 --> 00:35:45.518
a Brahmin, you know the Brahma, you are a
realised-soul."

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:46.689
I mean certified!

00:35:46.691 --> 00:35:47.848
They move about like that!

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.459
They think that they are realised-souls.

00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:53.879
And in America there are many who certify
themselves as twice born.

00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:56.159
[They] certify: self-certificate.

00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:58.449
I am surprised.

00:35:58.451 --> 00:36:02.919
In this country, I am told that people give
self-certificate that they are totally mad!

00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:04.348
(laughter) I didn’t know.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.268
But really I met some people who came to my
programme and I said, “Why are you shaking

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.268
so much?”

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.268
He said, “We are certified mad people."

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.268
I said, “What?”

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.989
“Yes, we are coming from lunatic asylum."

00:36:14.991 --> 00:36:18.979
But this type of self-certificate that people
have, they go about.

00:36:18.981 --> 00:36:20.669
And how to tell them?

00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:22.838
It’s impossible, you know.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.879
I can understand a drunkard but I can’t
understand a person in all sanity becoming

00:36:27.881 --> 00:36:29.518
so drunk with stupidity.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.558
It’s impossible to understand.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:37.538
And this is one of the drawbacks, I feel,
in me, that I don’t know how to convince

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.409
people that, “Please have it now, this is
yours, go ahead with it.

00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:44.758
You are hungry.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.028
This is food for you.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.389
Better have it!”

00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:56.838
And then after Realisation as I said that,
you are the one who can do it.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:03.488
All the progress later on is completely done
by you.

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:09.328
The complete vidya, the complete technique,
the Divine technique, how to operate the Divine

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:15.108
technique is all told to you and you have
to just see and work it out.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.750
If you want, you can work it out, anyone.

00:37:17.751 --> 00:37:23.778
I have seen people who came to me absolutely
possessed, absolutely possessed: today they

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.919
are great Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:38.459
People came mentally absolutely we can call
them half mad or some of them full mad, certified

00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:45.088
mad and they are today great Sahaja Yogis
giving Realisation to people.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.389
Yes, yes!

00:37:47.391 --> 00:37:54.649
People who were drunkards, alcoholics, drug
addicts: all sorts of people came.

00:37:54.651 --> 00:38:01.358
They all have got Realisation and they are
settled down as very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:08.469
But how can you treat a person who is stupid?

00:38:08.471 --> 00:38:13.998
(laughter) Ego makes you stupid, I tell you.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.429
Ego, the result of ego, is stupidity!

00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:22.368
People do so many stupid things these days
that even little children laugh like this,

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:23.838
when they see people doing it.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.129
But to them it is nothing.

00:38:26.131 --> 00:38:29.949
They think, “Oh we are very great!”

00:38:29.951 --> 00:38:35.179
This ego business is really very blinding.

00:38:35.181 --> 00:38:41.248
But one doesn’t have to worry about it because
Christ Himself has made arrangements that

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.550
He sucks in your ego.

00:38:44.551 --> 00:38:45.998
He does that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.071
Surprisingly the One who came just to do that.

00:38:53.073 --> 00:38:56.459
I don’t know what a mess they have created
out of Him, that those who follow have much

00:38:56.461 --> 00:38:59.229
more of it.

00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:07.118
I mean, you see anybody in charge of the church
he won’t talk to you; he’s a snooty fellow!

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:10.719
You don’t know which way to approach.

00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:12.189
He walks with five revolvers around him.

00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:18.038
If you say anything, he may hit you or do
whatever, and you don’t know.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.030
It’s easier to face a madman than to face
a priest sometimes – it’s difficult.

00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:27.108
God knows how he will attack you.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:31.538
Today I had a little encounter and I was rather
worried.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:39.899
But this is what it is: that Christ, a person
so Divine.

00:39:39.901 --> 00:39:42.858
I mean there’s nothing left in Him as a
person (in Christianity).

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.858
It’s nothing [of] Divinity.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.298
He came on this earth and nicely people have
cooked him, I really tell you.

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:52.808
I mean I don’t know how they could make
anything out of Him this kind of nonsense.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:59.590
That this ‘Saint’ Paul of all the persons
was included in the Bible I was amazed!

00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:04.098
When I saw the Bible I said, “From where
does he come?”

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:10.318
And now they have started this charismatic
movement; and go and have a look at them:

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.318
they are epileptic.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.568
And horrible things they are doing in the
name of Christ.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.848
Can you imagine?

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:23.598
He drove out the spirits from people and here
the people are calling spirits!

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.368
It’s such a mess I tell you!

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:32.449
You all have to help me because you are all
wise people and sensible ones.

00:40:32.451 --> 00:40:38.770
And we have to see now how many remain in
Sahaja Yoga; that’s the sign of wisdom according

00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:40.510
to me.

00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:43.278
Maybe your style may be different, I don’t
know.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:51.248
But my style, I understand that, if you have
pure intelligence, pure intelligence which

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:55.358
many have, you suddenly know what it is.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.018
As I have seen in Spain one fellow, he was
a lawyer.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:07.248
He listened to one of my lectures and sparkled
him: just sparkled with it.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.949
I don’t know what made him think that way.

00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:10.608
I don’t know at which point he got up.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.719
But he said, “That’s the truth.

00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:13.800
I can see clearly this is the truth."

00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:15.699
There are many like that.

00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:20.189
They may not even get Realisation but rationally
they just reach the point, “Yes this is

00:41:20.191 --> 00:41:21.189
the truth.

00:41:21.191 --> 00:41:22.189
Cannot be anything else but the truth."

00:41:22.191 --> 00:41:32.000
You need not be very well educated for that
or need not go to any one of these universities.

00:41:32.001 --> 00:41:35.228
You could be a very simple housewife to understand.

00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:41.618
But a person who has common sense which is
based on wisdom, should know that you have

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.838
to become your Spirit.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:48.088
All other nonsensical ideas like painting
your hair, you are not going to go to God,

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.088
take it from me.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:55.760
By painting your hair, if you can go to God
then it is the easiest!

00:41:55.761 --> 00:42:02.189
Or by putting nails into your noses or by
standing on your head, or by jumping morning

00:42:02.191 --> 00:42:07.919
till evening, or calling God, morning till
evening: how can you go to God?

00:42:07.921 --> 00:42:09.608
Something has to happen within.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.239
It’s evolutionary.

00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:12.560
It has to be something living.

00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:16.919
It’s a living God we are talking about.

00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:23.229
Whatever we do before Realisation is all dead,
and dead way is not going to take you to God.

00:42:23.231 --> 00:42:28.199
Only after Realisation because you become
the master of life, life starts flowing through

00:42:28.201 --> 00:42:30.719
you, you can give Realisation to others.

00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:33.939
For the first time you start doing really
something that is living.

00:42:33.941 --> 00:42:39.578
You can give vibrations to the flowers, you
can give vibrations to the trees, you can

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:44.250
give vibrations to the nature, whatever you
touch you vibrate.

00:42:44.251 --> 00:42:50.379
But first you must become a realised-soul.

00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:52.929
And then you respect that Realisation.

00:42:52.931 --> 00:42:58.699
It’s a tremendous thing but it happens very
quickly, very easily and that’s how you

00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:00.738
get lost.

00:43:00.739 --> 00:43:09.679
If somebody is made to work for something
with a very great difficulty, then perhaps

00:43:09.681 --> 00:43:15.699
people realise that, “Oh we must have it!”

00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:21.318
But if the forefathers have earned quite a
lot, they want to distribute to their children

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.758
freely, everything.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.939
Why to worry?

00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:31.469
But we must have wisdom to use that with respect.

00:43:31.471 --> 00:43:36.050
It has been earned with very great difficulties.

00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:41.939
For example the crucifixion of Christ: without
His crucifixion we could not have had Sahaja

00:43:41.941 --> 00:43:46.719
Yoga today, could not have.

00:43:46.721 --> 00:43:51.088
Unless and until He’s awakened within us,
we cannot give Realisation to people whether

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.798
you like it or not.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:44:00.108
So these people have dedicated themselves
completely, they have built everything within

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:08.318
you and that’s how you get it so easily
but you must have respect, you must have understanding,

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:15.233
otherwise all their efforts are lost and also
your seeking is lost.

00:44:15.233 --> 00:44:16.633
Seeker: Inaudible,

00:44:16.633 --> 00:44:17.916
Shri Mataji: You can’t do it.

00:44:17.916 --> 00:44:18.916
I am sorry.

00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:21.916
Really, you can’t do it in the beginning,
just can’t do it.

00:44:21.916 --> 00:44:22.916
It’s made like that.

00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:24.588
The whole situation is made.

00:44:24.588 --> 00:44:26.818
Now I must give you a frank thing.

00:44:26.836 --> 00:44:27.836
All right?

00:44:27.916 --> 00:44:31.878
I have not told this to anyone but today I
must confess to you something.

00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:36.850
As I have told you that your forefathers have
worked it out, all right?

00:44:36.983 --> 00:44:44.225
Now in this all working you never recognised
them, never before.

00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:45.598
You always refused them.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.639
Leave alone photograph, even bodily you never
recognised.

00:44:49.641 --> 00:44:54.739
You crucified them, you gave them poisons,
you beat them, did everything.

00:44:54.741 --> 00:44:59.989
But in this working you have to recognise me.

00:44:59.991 --> 00:45:03.149
I am sorry.

00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:06.368
This is the first time I am saying this.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:11.879
Because it was not wise to say but now it’s
[the] ninth year I am running in this England.

00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:13.929
I kept my mouth shut!

00:45:13.931 --> 00:45:21.598
Of course you can’t crucify me, I think,
but that’s a fact.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.409
You have to recognise me, otherwise things
are not going to work out.

00:45:26.411 --> 00:45:32.868
People want to get their cancers cured free,
they want to get their Realisation free, everything

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.919
done free by me.

00:45:35.921 --> 00:45:40.288
But my photograph or anything to do with me
they don’t want to do it.

00:45:40.290 --> 00:45:41.469
So it’s not possible.

00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:42.498
You have to recognise.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:47.459
And Christ has said already about you, very
clearly.

00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:50.728
Because I am something special, I must say.

00:45:50.729 --> 00:45:53.209
I am really a special person.

00:45:53.211 --> 00:45:57.338
But I don’t want to say that because it’s
rather embarrassing.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.139
But it is so.

00:45:59.141 --> 00:46:02.728
Without that do you think I can give mass
Realisation to people?

00:46:02.729 --> 00:46:07.568
There must be something about me or not, if
I am doing it?That’s it.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:12.868
So it is better that you recognise me; it’s
better for you.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.139
I am not going to take away anything from
you, nothing whatsoever.

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.459
What are you going to give me?

00:46:18.461 --> 00:46:19.699
Just think of it.

00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:25.459
I am here to give you something but you must
recognise that I am a giver, just recognise.

00:46:25.461 --> 00:46:29.939
I am sorry to say but it is so.

00:46:29.941 --> 00:46:31.649
You will gradually recognise when you’ll
have vibrations.

00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:34.258
When I say that the vibrations, see how much
it flows.

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.449
When I boast the vibrations flow more!

00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:39.429
What can I too do?

00:46:39.431 --> 00:46:41.848
But I am very cautious.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.949
Christ said, “I am the light.

00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:44.949
I am the path."

00:46:44.951 --> 00:46:45.959
They killed Him.

00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:47.649
What did He say?

00:46:47.651 --> 00:46:50.118
What did He say so much?

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.959
What did He say that people killed Him and
crucified Him?

00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.778
And even till today these Jews are not willing
to accept Christ!

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.258
They want to have sufferings, so have it.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:07.879
You will have, not Christ but you will have
Hitler.

00:47:07.881 --> 00:47:09.939
You have to recognise.

00:47:09.941 --> 00:47:13.520
This is a compulsion on you.

00:47:13.521 --> 00:47:17.429
I am sorry, that’s what it is.

00:47:17.431 --> 00:47:19.498
You have to recognise the Divine.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.328
You have to recognise.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.798
It’s not easy to give Realisation to anyone.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:34.788
If you had seen in Spain I cured a lady whose
brain was damaged, and they had removed a

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:39.058
part of the brain, and in ten minutes that
lady was cured and she started understanding

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.288
everything and she started moving her hand
and everything.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:51.278
But for people you know they don’t understand,
how it happened.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:48:00.268
It’s easy for people to understand who know
what to expect.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:03.419
All the kinds of people have photographs,
all these gurus have.

00:48:03.421 --> 00:48:04.639
What have they done for you?

00:48:04.641 --> 00:48:05.639
What have they done?

00:48:05.641 --> 00:48:07.728
They have just taken your money.

00:48:07.729 --> 00:48:13.409
This photograph has vibrations.

00:48:13.411 --> 00:48:18.139
The first time a photograph has been taken
actually authentically, thanks to your science.

00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:23.288
You don’t have any authentic photograph
of Christ.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:29.250
I haven’t seen any good picture except for
I would say a few like Michelangelo or someone

00:48:29.251 --> 00:48:32.828
like that, very few: Rubens, Michelangelo.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.379
Otherwise the way they make Him He was never
like that!

00:48:35.381 --> 00:48:37.078
Never, never like that.

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.018
No vibrations from them.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.348
So I have to tell you there is something about me.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.669
I am sorry but it is so.

00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:53.929
It’s rather dangerous to say in this great
country of yours, where people don’t take

00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:57.949
things easily, but you better take it now.

00:48:57.951 --> 00:48:58.959
It’s late.

00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:04.449
Already eight years I have worked in this
great country of yours because this is an

00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:05.449
important country.

00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:10.018
You do not know the value of this country;
you do not know what role it is going to play

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.498
for the whole humanity of the world.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.038
That’s why I have come here.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.998
I have not come as an immigrant at all.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.409
My husband got a posting here.

00:49:19.411 --> 00:49:28.298
He was elected by a hundred and thirty-five
nations and that’s why I am here.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:31.409
It’s all organised!

00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:39.548
And that’s how I am at your service here
but you have to recognise my services.

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.618
I have no union for that but you have to understand
this.

00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.629
If you do not recognise my services nothing
is going to work out.

00:49:48.631 --> 00:49:51.699
I am sorry but that’s how I am made.

00:49:51.701 --> 00:50:06.209
Jewish Seeker: (says Something about recognising
Mother and Christ)

00:50:06.211 --> 00:50:12.209
Shri Mataji: Because you are all conditioned,
you are a Jew, you are conditioned.

00:50:12.211 --> 00:50:15.588
So you have to get out of this condition.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.879
You see you’ll be surprised: you can make
out a Jew just like that.

00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:23.459
When the Kundalini rises She stops at the
point of Christ.

00:50:23.461 --> 00:50:24.649
This is the biggest problem of the Jews.

00:50:24.651 --> 00:50:25.959
Where are they going to go?

00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:28.088
You have to save them.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.738
Jewish Seeker: Inaudible

00:50:30.739 --> 00:50:34.929
Shri Mataji: This is all your conditioning
my child.

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.231
How can we understand Him?

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.629
You tell me.

00:50:37.631 --> 00:50:38.998
How can you understand Him?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.949
You cannot understand Him.

00:50:40.951 --> 00:50:41.949
Jews didn’t want to.

00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:46.608
You see this is a common practice of human
beings: they don’t want to recognise, that’s

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.288
the main thing.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:56.298
Afterwards of course, even the Christians
so-called who have built big, big churches,

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.449
never recognised Him.

00:50:57.451 --> 00:50:59.260
At that time, how many were there?

00:50:59.261 --> 00:51:00.659
His disciples: useless people!

00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:03.778
You ask me, I’ll tell you about them!

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.778
Absolutely useless!

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:10.758
They wouldn’t believe in Him till He got
His resurrection then they started saying,

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.518
“Oh God, Oh God!”

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:22.598
Otherwise this Mathews, he was a terrible
man and he wouldn’t recognise that there

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.088
could be this conception.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.780
They can’t understand Divine things.

00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:28.780
What have Jews achieved?

00:51:28.781 --> 00:51:29.780
You tell me.

00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:33.818
You just see the way they pray: everything
nonsensical just like Christians, just like

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.689
Hindus, Muslims, everybody’s just the same.

00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:38.929
What are Islams doing?

00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:44.608
What a ‘sensible’ thing they are doing!

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:51.578
It’s a different world I tell you.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.518
You will understand yourself when you will
come to that level and see for yourself.

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.468
We have many Jews now here sitting down, many
Jews now; who know [that] while raising the

00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:06.459
Kundalini you have to take the name of Christ
and if it is in the stomach you have to take

00:52:06.461 --> 00:52:07.548
the name of Moses.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:12.528
You don’t know where Moses is settled down
and where is that David’s star is, do you

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.528
know that?

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:14.568
In your being?

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.199
So what’s the use of all this talking isn’t
it, when you don’t know where Christ is,

00:52:19.201 --> 00:52:21.568
where Moses is, where the star is?

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.639
You don’t know anything, anything at all
and what are you fighting about?

00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:29.118
But we can show you in the Kundalini.

00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.169
But be wise and humble.

00:52:32.171 --> 00:52:37.270
Without humility you cannot go in Sahaja Yoga
because it’s Divine.

00:52:37.271 --> 00:52:38.949
All right?

00:52:38.951 --> 00:52:42.338
It’s nothing like clubbing or conditioning.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.929
It is something that you really feel, “Your
hands will speak!”

00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:47.040
Christ has said.

00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:48.040
You can see.

00:52:48.041 --> 00:52:51.219
Even a child can see, yourself.

00:52:51.221 --> 00:52:52.288
All right?

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.288
So do not live with any conditioning because
you are born a Jew.

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:59.929
Supposing you are born a Muslim, take it from
me, you would have hated yourself! (laughing)

00:52:59.931 --> 00:53:00.959
Isn’t it?

00:53:00.961 --> 00:53:01.998
It’s surprising.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.368
I mean you could have been born in a Muslim
before.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.728
I have seen many like that.

00:53:08.729 --> 00:53:14.108
With great hatred people are born in the other
religion and they must have hated one thing

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.409
in one life and in another life, they are
hating another.

00:53:17.411 --> 00:53:18.608
It’s all hatred.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:24.250
This is not Judaism, this is not Moses, this
is not that.

00:53:24.251 --> 00:53:27.419
It’s very different.

00:53:27.421 --> 00:53:30.598
It’s very different.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:41.568
Sahaja Yoga will teach you that they are all
Brothers and Sisters and Father and Mother

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:55.328
and Son and we are just fighting against that
family which is Divine.

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:59.429
You see, what these religions have done is
that they have put you up [into] conditionings

00:53:59.431 --> 00:54:04.429
and into ego trips, and these ego trips are
funny you see.

00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:07.949
Every religion has done this, that’s why
this problem is there.

00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:09.868
And these are not a solutions.

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.338
If you are a true Christian, then save all
of them.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.298
If you are a true Jew, save all of them.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.889
If you are a true Muslim, save all of them.

00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:19.858
That’s what it is.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.469
And it will happen to you.

00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:27.578
We have an Algerian who is a Muslim, he came
down here.

00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:33.919
They were all supporting fundamentalists and
the young people got frightened you know.

00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:35.209
They thought they should become communists.

00:54:35.211 --> 00:54:37.548
And this boy came down in London.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:45.679
When he came here, I don’t know how we found
him somewhere; he came down to see me and

00:54:45.681 --> 00:54:49.838
he got his Realisation and went back and said,
“No: neither this nor that.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.778
God is in the centre!”

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.858
And he gave Realisation to so many Muslims
and they come down here and they worship Christ

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:02.278
they worship Mohammed, they worship all the
other people, and they know what it is.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:07.088
And even when I went to Paris, so many came
down to see me from Algeria.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:14.699
We are entering into Algeria, into Lebanon,
into Muslim countries.

00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:20.348
What about you people?

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:24.719
How long are we going to be Christians, Jews
and Hindus, this, that?

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:28.068
We are human beings and we are prophets now.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:37.538
We have to become prophets and these prophets
will have powers to make others prophets as

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:41.959
prophesised by a great poet in your country,
William Blake.

00:55:41.961 --> 00:55:43.308
That time has come.

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:44.459
You better become prophets!

00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:45.459
All right?

00:55:45.461 --> 00:55:46.459
Forget it!

00:55:46.461 --> 00:55:47.459
Forget it!

00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:48.459
You’ll be all right.

00:55:48.461 --> 00:55:50.578
Jewish Seeker: Can I come back to you on something?

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:56.368
My religion teaches me that we should believe
in one God.

00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:01.348
And I do, I really do.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:04.298
Shri Mataji: But your belief is artificial.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.179
It has no meaning.

00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:09.919
Even if you believe in ten Gods, what difference
does it make?

00:56:09.921 --> 00:56:11.268
You see, what I am saying: “I believe!”

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:12.268
Supposing, “I believe!”

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:13.788
Here it’s very common, “I believe!”

00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.469
But Baba, you believe — so what?

00:56:15.471 --> 00:56:17.679
Whom are you obliging?

00:56:17.681 --> 00:56:20.068
If you believe, what is the truth behind it?

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:21.169
Show us where is God?

00:56:21.171 --> 00:56:23.429
You believe in one God I say the…

00:56:23.431 --> 00:56:28.828
Jewish Seeker: I believe in God and you are
telling me not to.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:30.728
Shri Mataji: No, No.

00:56:30.729 --> 00:56:33.348
But I am telling you: believe in the truth.

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:34.358
All right?

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.679
So keep your mind open.

00:56:35.681 --> 00:56:38.518
If you say, “I believe!” then you are
closing your mind.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.929
I am saying you believe in the truth.

00:56:40.931 --> 00:56:42.528
So keep yourself open.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.328
You believe into something because you are
conditioned into that’s what I am saying.

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:50.699
If you believe into anything, you are conditioning
yourself.

00:56:50.701 --> 00:56:54.288
Whatever you have believed into is not the
truth, if so show us!

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:55.288
Simple thing.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:57:00.818
Now see, you are a believer of truth, all
right?

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:07.979
Believe in truth; now you find out the truth
and see if it is truth or not.

00:57:07.981 --> 00:57:09.719
It’s as simple as that.

00:57:09.721 --> 00:57:11.468
It’s nothing more or less.

00:57:11.469 --> 00:57:13.389
You should be the believer of truth.

00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:18.728
Not because you are born as Jew, you should
become a Jew and deny Christ.

00:57:18.729 --> 00:57:27.278
Only because you are born in a Jew family,
you are denying Christ.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.528
While those born in the Christian families
will deny Mohammed.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:33.669
But we do not because that’s not the truth.

00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:36.629
So you see for yourself, find out for yourself.

00:57:36.631 --> 00:57:39.848
As a scientist you must keep your mind open.

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:44.458
I want you to expose to the science of God.

00:57:44.459 --> 00:57:45.929
All right?

00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:48.699
So if you believe into something, then you
will be sticking on to that.

00:57:48.701 --> 00:57:53.048
This belief is artificial, it has no proof
behind it.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:58.689
But we can prove it that all of them are related
to each other.

00:57:58.691 --> 00:58:02.468
You see they have made segments, that’s
how they have made different religions.

00:58:02.469 --> 00:58:09.000
If they could put them together, then they
don’t believe in one religion, do they?

00:58:09.001 --> 00:58:12.318
That’s the point.
