00:01:16.178 --> 00:01:18.495
Please, be seated.

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.455
What a great place.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.655
Really?

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:25.548
It’s very gratifying to see so many Sahaja Yogis

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:34.511
have come to celebrate the Sahasrara Day.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:46.947
Without breaking the Sahasrara,

00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:58.016
we could not have achieved the ascent en-masse.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.159
But the Sahasrara, which is the brain,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:21.320
has gone into too much complications in the West

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:30.261
and the nerves are very much twisted, one upon another.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:47.174
To keep Sahasrara open should be very easy

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:57.323
if the Western brains could understand

00:05:57.524 --> 00:06:05.018
and be aware

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.965
about your Mother.

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:28.660
When your Mother is the Deity of Sahasrara,

00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:38.279
the only way to be able to keep the Sahasrara open

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.124
has to be complete surrendering.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:57.011
For that many ask Me, "How do we do?"

00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:02.512
It's a very funny question.

00:07:02.713 --> 00:07:06.693
It is irrelevant.

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:21.592
If your Sahasrara has been opened out by someone,

00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:27.736
and luckily that is the Deity before you,

00:07:27.937 --> 00:07:34.856
it should be the easiest thing to surrender,

00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:44.625
but it is not.

00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:50.878
It is difficult

00:07:51.079 --> 00:08:00.211
because the attention that has come up,

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:04.396
through the cells of the brain,

00:08:04.597 --> 00:08:12.451
expressing itself through the cells of the brain,

00:08:12.652 --> 00:08:17.768
is polluted,

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:23.062
it is impure, it is destructive.

00:08:26.823 --> 00:08:33.735
It spoils the nerves

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:41.816
and when the nerves are spoilt, the light of the Spirit

00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:47.872
does not shine on the nerves.

00:08:52.592 --> 00:09:05.258
And you feel the inability to surrender.

00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:12.173
Normally it should be the easiest thing to do.

00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:21.581
So we have to mentally approach ourselves.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.813
We have to talk to ourselves

00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:36.293
and say to ourselves

00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:40.464
“What are you doing?”

00:09:43.843 --> 00:09:47.833
What is surrendering?

00:09:48.464 --> 00:09:52.708
It is enjoyment.

00:09:56.956 --> 00:10:00.789
It is just enjoyment.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:06.055
“Then why I cannot surrender?

00:10:06.464 --> 00:10:11.147
What is lacking in me?

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:16.194
Am I a very low level person?

00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:24.261
Am I the one who was just saying I'm a seeker

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:26.813
but I'm not?

00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:33.573
Am I a dishonest person that I cannot surrender?

00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:39.748
If so, what am I proud of myself?

00:10:41.887 --> 00:10:51.085
If that is the situation, then why am I

00:10:51.286 --> 00:11:00.393
so much enamoured by my ego?”

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:14.930
What do you have to surrender?

00:11:20.457 --> 00:11:28.128
A drop has to dissolve into the ocean to become the ocean.

00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:38.647
And a drop cannot be greater than the ocean - can it be?

00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:42.477
So what is the surrendering?

00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:47.564
Surrendering of our conditionings, of our ego

00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:54.206
and the artificial barriers we have built around us.

00:11:54.407 --> 00:12:03.475
One can approach mentally. One can approach emotionally

00:12:03.676 --> 00:12:09.482
and also physically we can approach ourselves.

00:12:10.035 --> 00:12:17.552
We can approach ourselves through mantras,

00:12:17.753 --> 00:12:21.595
through seeing ourselves,

00:12:21.796 --> 00:12:26.235
through knowing ourselves.

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:35.578
But one should know this is

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:42.686
the greatest of greatest opportunity - for you -

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:46.554
not for the Divine.

00:12:47.965 --> 00:12:49.425
If you are not available

00:12:49.626 --> 00:12:51.981
Divine can find Its own ways

00:12:52.182 --> 00:12:58.730
of fulfilling Its last culmination of expression.

00:13:05.213 --> 00:13:14.912
Even to understand how immense the task is

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:20.294
you need a surrendering heart.

00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:29.320
Only through mental approach, when you arrive,

00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:32.271
you develop a petty ego

00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:36.541
that you are doing a great work.

00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:45.166
Like I telephoned

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:49.362
to America, saying that I'll be coming,

00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:54.362
and there's a very big scientist in Los Angeles who is an Indian,

00:13:54.563 --> 00:13:59.574
Maharashtrian fellow. He missed his Nobel Prize -

00:13:59.775 --> 00:14:03.841
such a great scientist.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:02.525
He telephoned to Me immediately,

00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:10.915
saying : "Mother I'm coming to New York to receive You.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:14.043
I'm taking leave for fifteen days.

00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:16.865
When You are here, I want to be with You.

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:20.685
What else is to be done?

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:22.896
As it is

00:14:23.097 --> 00:14:25.459
I'm doing Sahaja Yoga by-the-way

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.493
at my own convenience, wherever I get time,

00:14:29.694 --> 00:14:31.878
that's what I'm doing isn't it?

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.769
But I would like to travel with you to Europe

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.053
to all the different places with you to spend some time.

00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:45.449
Otherwise what am I doing here?"

00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:54.094
But what I have heard that

00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:58.427
people are arriving at different times for Sahasrara Day.

00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:02.481
I was amazed. It's typical western mind.

00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:04.963
By the way, Sahaja Yoga is done, mostly -

00:15:05.164 --> 00:15:06.023
by-the-way.

00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:10.299
It should be convenient. It should be a weekend,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.902
when, just, by-the-way, for a holiday, we can go to Vienna.

00:15:18.736 --> 00:15:22.377
There of course, by-the-way, we'll have a puja

00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:25.469
and, by-the-way, Mother will raise the Kundalini.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.774
She will awaken our deities

00:15:29.975 --> 00:15:35.469
and then by-the-way we'll be enjoying the blessings.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:42.774
No sacrifice can be done for God.

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:48.537
No time, they have no time. Everything is by-the-way.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.190
It's rather amazing.

00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:57.754
For war, people gave up their lives.

00:15:57.955 --> 00:16:03.468
For destruction they work so hard, day and night.

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:07.493
But for the construction of humanity,

00:16:07.694 --> 00:16:12.357
for the ultimate goal of Divinity, in the West,

00:16:12.558 --> 00:16:17.056
how many there are who really surrender?

00:16:19.872 --> 00:16:24.614
If it suits, then we'll be there.

00:16:26.783 --> 00:16:28.469
Sahaja.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.594
“This is Sahaja style. We should do it Sahaja.”

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:37.897
I heard about this many a times, and there are still many

00:16:38.098 --> 00:16:42.644
who take that kind of an attitude towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:50.507
It is sometimes surprising for Me.

00:16:51.118 --> 00:16:54.615
If I go to a village

00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:58.665
people take leave for fifteen days, one month.

00:16:58.866 --> 00:17:01.866
In Rahuri people take leave for one month

00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:05.304
to prepare for My coming.

00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:11.047
One day leave for them is a very big thing.

00:17:14.626 --> 00:17:19.339
They are the people who deserve.

00:17:20.101 --> 00:17:26.247
It's not what you dress and what you eat and what you have.

00:17:26.448 --> 00:17:32.099
It's what you can give

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.408
and give up.

00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:43.349
The tags of mundane life are to be cut off,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.189
we must understand.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:56.122
It's a progress of people like slaves tied up to chains;

00:17:57.704 --> 00:18:01.441
chains of desires,

00:18:01.642 --> 00:18:05.849
chains of “complacentness”,

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.954
chains of lethargy,

00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:16.668
chains of ego which is like a log.

00:18:26.377 --> 00:18:32.478
So we have to understand ourselves.

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:36.438
Everybody has to understand oneself,

00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:41.874
that through you the salvation of the world has to come.

00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:47.856
You are chosen for the emancipation of the whole humanity.

00:18:48.057 --> 00:18:54.057
The Divine wants you to work as a channel

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:58.677
for the beautification of this universe,

00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:05.393
for the ultimate expression of God's love.

00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:10.126
When I say this

00:19:10.327 --> 00:19:15.822
I find suddenly the ego coming up automatically.

00:19:17.486 --> 00:19:20.800
On the contrary, a surrender,

00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:29.927
to fill up your vessels with the bliss,

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:34.047
the bliss of Divinity,

00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:36.659
so that when you go to others

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:43.427
you pour on them the beauty and love of God.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:20:00.084
It is for you to understand yourself

00:20:00.285 --> 00:20:04.408
very well and not others.

00:20:04.609 --> 00:20:08.511
Don't blame anyone.

00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:14.669
It's so precious

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:21.528
that no words can describe

00:20:21.729 --> 00:20:27.271
the greatness of these moments which we are spending together.

00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:38.204
You have to feel it within yourself

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:44.756
the assignment that is given to you.

00:20:44.957 --> 00:20:47.781
Through your own Spirit,

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:51.440
through your own state

00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:56.959
you can fulfill the assignment.

00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:06.324
But lack of faith in yourself

00:21:06.525 --> 00:21:11.091
cannot give you surrendering powers.

00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:31.557
Surrender is the opening of Sahasrara,

00:21:31.758 --> 00:21:40.444
keeping it completely open

00:21:40.645 --> 00:21:46.949
so that the Nirvikalpa state is established within us.

00:21:50.178 --> 00:21:56.381
There should be a regular progress of improvement,

00:21:56.582 --> 00:21:59.381
regular progress of the opening.

00:21:59.582 --> 00:22:06.819
Have you ever seen any lotus or any flower that blooms,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:12.370
blooms, and in between again does not bloom,

00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:17.274
then bloom then collapses then blooms.

00:22:18.302 --> 00:22:24.302
Have you ever seen such a nonsensical phenomena in the nature?

00:22:26.437 --> 00:22:31.972
You come up, again you go down, again you come up, you go down.

00:22:36.177 --> 00:22:38.770
Have you ever seen a tree that comes up,

00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:44.787
again it comes up, again goes back into the mud,

00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:49.011
blaming other people?

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:54.475
Have you seen any animal which starts growing,

00:22:54.676 --> 00:22:59.886
then it becomes a dwarf, again it grows, again it becomes a dwarf?

00:23:04.802 --> 00:23:08.429
Even these huge palaces

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:14.073
which have been built so beautifully for us,

00:23:14.274 --> 00:23:19.122
do you see that they become small,

00:23:19.323 --> 00:23:24.768
suddenly, and then collapse and then again they blow up.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:32.148
Only the balloon of ego and superego does that.

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:37.842
And when you are identified with them

00:23:38.043 --> 00:23:45.668
you too become very peculiar personalities.

00:23:49.857 --> 00:23:58.768
The lotus of your Sahasrara is open now.

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:06.597
It must open more and more and more

00:24:06.798 --> 00:24:09.508
and should not suddenly collapse,

00:24:09.538 --> 00:24:13.548
again open, again collapse.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:23.170
It's a very complicated phenomena you can see in the West

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.602
and you can be very much surprised sometimes.

00:24:26.803 --> 00:24:30.038
To Me it's sometimes very shocking to see.

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:33.951
Suddenly someone will come, "Oh, I'm very nervous about this thing.

00:24:34.152 --> 00:24:36.105
I'm very nervous about that."

00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:37.742
Another person will come and tell Me,

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:43.130
"I want to leave Sahaja Yoga now." Another one comes and tells me,

00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:49.088
"Oh, it's too much, I cannot go any further with it."

00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:00.674
So we must realize that there is something very peculiar

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:03.222
within us,

00:25:03.423 --> 00:25:07.633
something absurd within us. That's why it happens.

00:25:07.842 --> 00:25:10.913
We go forward, backwards, forward, backwards all the time.

00:25:11.114 --> 00:25:14.184
What is this pendulum?

00:25:15.429 --> 00:25:20.342
That cannot be Sahasrara. Sahasrara is not a pendulum,

00:25:20.543 --> 00:25:23.202
it is a lotus.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.796
So the pendulum is the chitta, is the attention;

00:25:31.997 --> 00:25:34.879
the attention that moves from left to right,

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.416
right to left, goes on
like that all the time.

00:25:46.105 --> 00:25:52.636
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

00:25:55.793 --> 00:26:01.703
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

00:26:01.904 --> 00:26:06.029
then the heavens open within yourself.

00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:18.861
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

00:26:19.062 --> 00:26:22.674
creates that subtle opening, by which

00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:26.796
the Divine starts pouring all its
subtleties inside

00:26:26.997 --> 00:26:29.734
your brain.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.680
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

00:26:35.881 --> 00:26:39.249
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.772
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

00:26:43.973 --> 00:26:47.856
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

00:26:48.057 --> 00:26:51.924
the Divine doesn't bother.

00:26:57.072 --> 00:27:01.345
So it is you who has to achieve that state

00:27:01.546 --> 00:27:07.014
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

00:27:08.973 --> 00:27:14.275
In that there is just progression.

00:27:14.476 --> 00:27:18.214
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

00:27:18.415 --> 00:27:20.829
If somebody is still

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.759
going up and down, up and down,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.155
he should know he is still not up to the point

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:32.946
and he should face up to himself

00:27:33.147 --> 00:27:37.327
and tell himself or herself that

00:27:37.528 --> 00:27:44.023
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

00:27:44.224 --> 00:27:47.942
where I do not come down."

00:27:49.435 --> 00:27:53.462
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

00:27:53.663 --> 00:27:59.842
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:11.331
They are not going to be saved.

00:28:12.253 --> 00:28:15.753
They will be punished.

00:28:16.163 --> 00:28:21.519
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.368
but they will not occupy

00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:31.061
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:37.565
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:44.212
Do not blame any circumstance.

00:28:44.525 --> 00:28:50.392
Do not blame your father, mother, brother, atmosphere, this, that.

00:28:50.607 --> 00:28:54.607
There's no need to blame anyone.

00:28:57.491 --> 00:29:00.542
“Because somebody came, we were influenced.”

00:29:00.743 --> 00:29:02.875
What is the matter with you?

00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:06.284
I am here, you are not influenced by Me.

00:29:06.485 --> 00:29:10.703
How are you influenced by somebody who is so stupid, obviously,

00:29:10.904 --> 00:29:13.989
so dominating?

00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:22.138
That means - what is your level?

00:29:24.536 --> 00:29:28.259
So tomorrow I've decided to tell you

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.022
how to be at the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:41.579
As I said, we can approach mentally;

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.236
but mentally if I say you take this medicine

00:29:44.437 --> 00:29:47.874
and you do not take the medicine, then it’s just a mental thing.

00:29:48.075 --> 00:29:51.448
The medicine is kept on the cupboard, you are just the same.

00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:55.961
And then you'll say, "Mother, yes we listened to your lecture."

00:29:58.258 --> 00:30:02.645
So the key note

00:30:02.846 --> 00:30:09.079
of tomorrow's puja, as I've decided,

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.670
that you have to be at the Nirvikalpa state.

00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:33.918
You can say this Sahasrara Day is a very big day

00:30:34.119 --> 00:30:38.518
because I never threw such an ultimatum before.

00:30:38.852 --> 00:30:43.687
Because now we are established

00:30:43.888 --> 00:30:48.107
as Vishwa Dharma,

00:30:48.308 --> 00:30:52.222
as the Universal Religion.

00:30:53.182 --> 00:30:57.941
We are not like other religions

00:30:58.142 --> 00:31:04.303
where, after the death of the incarnations,
people started the religion

00:31:04.504 --> 00:31:09.246
and did whatever they wanted to do with that.

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:17.832
In our living time

00:31:18.033 --> 00:31:24.714
we are going to make ourselves that instrument

00:31:24.915 --> 00:31:30.915
which will represent the Vishwa Dharma.

00:31:35.466 --> 00:31:41.424
We have to have strong deities within ourselves.

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:48.153
We have weakened them by all mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:31:48.757 --> 00:31:51.139
They are weak because traditionally

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.966
we haven't got the strength,

00:31:54.167 --> 00:31:56.854
doesn't matter.

00:31:58.644 --> 00:32:02.253
But now this Religion has been established

00:32:02.454 --> 00:32:11.266
we cannot have black spots

00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:13.488
any more.

00:32:14.763 --> 00:32:23.046
We've done all the choosing, the training, everything

00:32:23.247 --> 00:32:27.754
and you all have to jump into the boat now.

00:32:28.963 --> 00:32:36.001
There's no more time left for us

00:32:36.202 --> 00:32:43.647
to dilly-dally. Those who'll be left behind will be left behind.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:53.785
It's a very intense period now, you must understand.

00:32:53.986 --> 00:32:58.696
The intensity of the period is not by-the-way.

00:32:59.923 --> 00:33:04.952
It's not any more Sahaja Yoga. It is Maha Yoga now.

00:33:05.153 --> 00:33:07.690
And you have to become maha, you have to become great,

00:33:07.891 --> 00:33:11.934
otherwise you cannot be there.

00:33:15.537 --> 00:33:20.455
You have to jump out of all these things.

00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:25.963
Tomorrow I'll try whatever is possible on My side.

00:33:26.164 --> 00:33:30.116
I'll work it out. But it's a serious matter, I must tell you,

00:33:30.317 --> 00:33:32.423
that once I've established the Religion,

00:33:32.624 --> 00:33:36.952
I don't want to have any holes in it.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:44.725
I avoided it because I was not sure.

00:33:50.431 --> 00:33:56.453
Now I know for sure that there are many who could be called

00:33:56.654 --> 00:33:59.107
as Nirmalites.

00:34:03.036 --> 00:34:10.006
Because no more black spots

00:34:10.207 --> 00:34:14.292
on the beautiful sari of your Mother.

00:34:19.394 --> 00:34:27.511
It has to be absolutely

00:34:27.712 --> 00:34:32.438
highest quality.

00:34:36.118 --> 00:34:38.547
Gradually we used to drop out people,

00:34:38.748 --> 00:34:40.458
gradually worked out this

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.492
but there's no time left now.

00:34:43.693 --> 00:34:48.544
As I have told you, I am going back to India.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.994
Tomorrow I'll be able to tell you

00:34:59.195 --> 00:35:06.054
how gradually you have got up to your Sahasrara.

00:35:06.977 --> 00:35:13.573
And to get to Nirvikalpa,

00:35:13.774 --> 00:35:21.125
you have to really dedicate yourself fully.

00:35:22.803 --> 00:35:27.403
It's not a matter of convenience to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:27.604 --> 00:35:31.486
It's a Sahasrara Day,

00:35:31.687 --> 00:35:36.687
you have to cross the Himalayas.

00:35:36.888 --> 00:35:41.540
If you read the lives of the people who tried to

00:35:41.741 --> 00:35:43.489
travel up to Kailasha,

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.084
you will know what hardships they have gone through.

00:35:47.285 --> 00:35:51.645
I have taken you very sweetly, delicately, up to that point

00:35:51.846 --> 00:35:55.251
but don't get spoilt by that.

00:35:55.452 --> 00:35:58.821
You will all fizzle out into thin air

00:35:59.022 --> 00:36:03.779
unless and until you are in the Nirvikalpa state.

00:36:07.044 --> 00:36:13.186
I'm sorry I have to say that here in Austria.

00:36:13.387 --> 00:36:20.865
This is the place which

00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:28.332
should demarcate the end of our journey to left and right.

00:36:32.437 --> 00:36:35.999
“Because my husband is like that, my wife is like that.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.082
Because my child is like this.”

00:36:45.772 --> 00:36:48.355
You are not going to be excused.

00:36:48.556 --> 00:36:51.580
Whom are you telling? Your own Spirit?

00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:55.101
Tell your Spirit, does it understand?

00:36:55.302 --> 00:36:58.958
It takes away your vibrations,

00:36:59.159 --> 00:37:06.721
it takes away your joy, it takes away your position.

00:37:13.145 --> 00:37:17.138
Nirvichara is very easy to establish

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:20.173
but that, also, some people have not.

00:37:20.374 --> 00:37:24.249
Then what about Nirvikalpa?

00:37:26.319 --> 00:37:30.983
You have to take it up very seriously.

00:37:32.764 --> 00:37:34.818
This may be the last Sahasrara Day

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:41.107
we are celebrating in Europe,
may be, I don't know.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:54.009
It's not that Mother is only happy

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.971
if there are people of higher qualification

00:38:00.172 --> 00:38:05.093
or higher caliber, it's not that.

00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:14.662
I have very great concern for those who are lost,

00:38:14.863 --> 00:38:20.154
who are left out. But sometimes,

00:38:20.355 --> 00:38:22.839
through My experience,

00:38:23.025 --> 00:38:27.722
I think such people get spoilt.

00:38:34.708 --> 00:38:39.202
My love is not for spoiling you,

00:38:39.403 --> 00:38:43.511
is not for ruining you,

00:38:43.712 --> 00:38:49.863
it is for your emancipation, it's for you to enjoy

00:38:50.064 --> 00:38:58.120
the beauty of God's blessings on you.

00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:04.651
Even now if there are people who are not righteous,

00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:07.395
who are not truthful,

00:39:07.596 --> 00:39:12.176
who are not virtuous at the dharma stage,

00:39:12.377 --> 00:39:16.306
then what can I talk to them?

00:39:16.828 --> 00:39:23.738
And then if they are not even the Spirit,

00:39:23.939 --> 00:39:29.540
then what am I to do with them?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.289
The ideologies, the talking,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:44.835
the discussions and arguments do not lead you there.

00:39:45.036 --> 00:39:47.285
No, they do not.

00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:50.923
It's meditation.

00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:55.901
What is meditation is actually facing yourself

00:39:56.102 --> 00:40:01.496
and correcting yourself with the full understanding as to what you are.

00:40:01.697 --> 00:40:06.447
We have to create ideal human beings.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.679
That is what is the Vishwa Dharma.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.942
Otherwise we have many dharmas going on.

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:14.650
So many religious activities

00:40:14.851 --> 00:40:17.681
in the name of all the great incarnations

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:20.038
which are nowhere near the incarnations,

00:40:20.239 --> 00:40:21.239
just the opposite of it.

00:40:26.476 --> 00:40:29.882
This Nirvikalpa state has to be established,

00:40:30.083 --> 00:40:32.647
once for all.

00:40:33.206 --> 00:40:37.704
So I don't have to then struggle with you.

00:40:37.905 --> 00:40:42.067
The group of people who will attend tomorrow, Sahasrara,

00:40:42.268 --> 00:40:46.266
should be able to establish that state

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:50.508
otherwise they are just like the people who are newcomers.

00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:54.046
They are coming for the first time, or ten times, or eleven times,

00:40:54.247 --> 00:40:58.801
or hundred times, what difference does it make?

00:41:06.561 --> 00:41:12.701
To Me it is clear cut.

00:41:13.866 --> 00:41:18.519
I have short time,

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:25.016
because the instrument has to be all right.

00:41:27.775 --> 00:41:33.233
If you have to expedite the growth

00:41:33.434 --> 00:41:35.837
of the instrument in a proper way,

00:41:36.038 --> 00:41:43.733
so that God's Love flows

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:51.106
and the God of that Love feels happy about it,

00:41:51.315 --> 00:42:00.997
we have to create such beautiful flowers that He appreciates,

00:42:01.198 --> 00:42:05.315
that He does not destroy.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:12.596
The Spectator of this play has to be satisfied

00:42:12.797 --> 00:42:16.640
so that He postpones His destruction.

00:42:22.679 --> 00:42:28.476
That's why I said the time is short,

00:42:28.677 --> 00:42:31.238
time is very short.

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:36.576
If we want our children to grow into the realm of God,

00:42:36.777 --> 00:42:39.463
they are great saints who are born,

00:42:39.664 --> 00:42:43.975
if we want to give them a full chance of the enjoyment,

00:42:44.176 --> 00:42:53.693
then let us first of all become proper parents

00:42:53.894 --> 00:43:00.729
and not people who just live with illusions.

00:43:05.511 --> 00:43:09.915
Everything in Sahaja Yoga cannot be explained.

00:43:10.116 --> 00:43:14.719
I cannot explain, I cannot, because

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:21.833
you don't have those powers to understand.

00:43:22.034 --> 00:43:27.020
Like Gregoire said, "Mother I want to have the sun"

00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:30.194
because people told him the weekend would be terrible,

00:43:30.395 --> 00:43:36.717
there won't be any sun. Within fifteen minutes the sun was shining,

00:43:36.918 --> 00:43:40.941
within fifteen minutes. The wind started blowing,

00:43:41.142 --> 00:43:45.208
all the clouds settled round Vienna beautifully,

00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:47.640
like a Sahasrara,

00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:50.088
and the sky opened,

00:43:50.311 --> 00:43:55.635
as I want your Sahasrara to be open.

00:43:55.836 --> 00:44:02.020
All the nature is so anxious to work it out

00:44:02.221 --> 00:44:07.278
but you must learn

00:44:07.479 --> 00:44:12.010
to cooperate with your Spirit.

00:44:12.663 --> 00:44:16.278
It's not a cooperation that is just by-the-way.

00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:24.051
It is to be the Spirit, the becoming of the Spirit fully.

00:44:24.252 --> 00:44:27.751
is very important.

00:44:27.952 --> 00:44:31.264
Nothing should stop that.

00:44:32.184 --> 00:44:37.629
I hope today's announcement will help all of us

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:44.550
to have that understanding of our responsibilities

00:44:44.751 --> 00:44:49.688
towards ourselves and towards our Creator.

00:44:50.052 --> 00:44:55.069
It's nice to praise Me for My love,

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:59.232
it's nice to praise Me for whatever has happened

00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:04.370
but to be very frank, I do not know if you are praising Me.

00:45:04.716 --> 00:45:08.683
I do not feel the praise

00:45:08.884 --> 00:45:15.477
because I am My Self, I am not Myself.

00:45:16.738 --> 00:45:23.291
I see My Self as separate

00:45:23.492 --> 00:45:28.231
and then I tell Myself that, “ See,

00:45:28.432 --> 00:45:31.299
You are Adi Shakti, all right,

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.445
but You have spoilt Your children.

00:45:37.414 --> 00:45:42.984
You have not done full justice to them.

00:45:43.863 --> 00:45:50.456
They take everything so easy and mundane.”

00:45:54.201 --> 00:46:01.823
So you have to, tomorrow, take a vow within your heart.

00:46:02.024 --> 00:46:05.686
It's not the words that are important.

00:46:05.887 --> 00:46:13.413
It has to be living action of your being, that should prove,

00:46:13.614 --> 00:46:18.512
that should convince you that we are fully surrendered.

00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:22.475
And the effects of that you'll feel in your own personality,

00:46:22.676 --> 00:46:25.506
in your own being, in your own manifestation.

00:46:25.707 --> 00:46:27.707
With so many saints,

00:46:27.908 --> 00:46:32.329
why should I have any worry of spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:39.477
Because there are some who drag you down,

00:46:39.678 --> 00:46:44.054
there are some adamant people, and there are some, still,

00:46:44.255 --> 00:46:46.846
who are possessed,

00:46:47.047 --> 00:46:52.242
there are some who are murmuring souls.

00:46:53.239 --> 00:46:58.910
Just don't pay any attention to them, they'll be all lost,

00:46:59.111 --> 00:47:02.532
doesn't matter.

00:47:03.343 --> 00:47:10.179
We have to create the great day for us to be proud

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.022
that we belong to this great religion of Truth.

00:47:13.223 --> 00:47:18.274
There has been no religion so far which is the religion of Truth,

00:47:18.475 --> 00:47:23.539
it practices something and preaches something

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:28.794
and it has nothing to do with the incarnation.

00:47:29.373 --> 00:47:35.417
You have to do something that people should say,

00:47:35.618 --> 00:47:40.453
"We see our Mother in this person."

00:47:46.169 --> 00:47:51.296
Today is a day when I want to bless some children.

00:47:51.497 --> 00:47:53.995
I've blessed many children.

00:47:54.196 --> 00:47:56.805
I would like to bless all the parents also

00:47:57.006 --> 00:48:00.739
to understandthat they have to contribute a lot

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.108
for the upbringing of the children.

00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:07.033
There have been some very good tapes they have made in England,

00:48:07.234 --> 00:48:11.865
how to help the children to grow properly

00:48:12.066 --> 00:48:18.636
in this crazy Western life.

00:48:22.468 --> 00:48:28.085
And the one who has been the greatest enemy of yours

00:48:28.286 --> 00:48:30.967
worked in this place.

00:48:31.168 --> 00:48:37.323
He's the one who has ruined you

00:48:37.524 --> 00:48:42.484
and you had to commit sin against the Holy Ghost,

00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:46.200
sin against your Mother.

00:48:46.401 --> 00:48:50.449
Now at this time,

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.489
in this place,

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:58.067
we have to turn our face

00:48:58.268 --> 00:49:01.263
to all that was the past,

00:49:01.464 --> 00:49:11.147
and ascend into the new realm of bliss and joy.

00:49:11.854 --> 00:49:18.429
I assure you that with your dedication,

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.371
it will work out.

00:49:20.572 --> 00:49:27.197
But just think in your mind what have we sacrificed so far?

00:49:33.682 --> 00:49:37.777
No sacrifice is sufficient

00:49:37.978 --> 00:49:42.087
but have we sacrificed anything?

00:49:45.395 --> 00:49:49.312
That will make you understand that

00:49:49.513 --> 00:49:52.540
your Mother has given you your second birth

00:49:52.741 --> 00:49:55.207
without any difficulties.

00:49:55.408 --> 00:49:59.861
She's taken up all the labor pains upon Herself.

00:50:00.336 --> 00:50:04.978
Now you are grown up

00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:09.778
and you have to understand that,

00:50:09.979 --> 00:50:12.408
now you are grown up people

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:16.494
and you can't behave like children.

00:50:17.702 --> 00:50:20.111
That is over now.

00:50:20.312 --> 00:50:22.207
Now you are grown up people

00:50:22.408 --> 00:50:27.713
you have to become responsible for this Maha Yoga

00:50:27.914 --> 00:50:32.624
and for this great dharma that we have established.

00:50:32.825 --> 00:50:35.573
The dharma that integrates all the dharmas.

00:50:35.774 --> 00:50:39.357
The dharma that purifies anybody who comes near them.

00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:41.332
Is the ocean of all the rivers.

00:50:41.533 --> 00:50:48.361
All the rivers flow to this great ocean of Vishwa Dharma.

00:50:50.082 --> 00:51:00.371
So we have to mould ourselves to befit into the new pattern,

00:51:00.572 --> 00:51:03.666
the new rhythms,

00:51:03.867 --> 00:51:11.023
the new music of Divine flute.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.055
Unless and until that happens

00:51:15.256 --> 00:51:26.180
I do not think that Western people have much chances.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:39.326
If you have come for Sahasrara be prepared.

00:51:39.527 --> 00:51:47.608
Tomorrow I would like to work out as much as possible.

00:51:50.274 --> 00:51:54.867
I'm working twenty-four hours.

00:51:55.601 --> 00:52:00.038
Not a single minute I waste.

00:52:00.757 --> 00:52:09.071
And in the same way I hope you will dedicate your twenty-four hours

00:52:09.272 --> 00:52:17.375
for your emancipation and the emancipation of the whole Universe.

00:52:18.662 --> 00:52:22.365
May God bless you all.

00:52:56.123 --> 00:52:58.636
Water.

00:53:14.401 --> 00:53:17.414
So may God bless you.

00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:50.448
[Should I make a very quick translation...]

00:53:59.358 --> 00:54:03.217
Okay. You can make a quick translation...

01:00:24.756 --> 01:00:28.421
Thank you.

01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:43.964
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for this promise.

01:00:49.155 --> 01:00:52.751
Today I thank the sun and I thank the wind

01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:57.483
and now I thank you for this promise.

01:00:58.303 --> 01:01:00.904
I’m a very simple, innocent Mother,

01:01:01.105 --> 01:01:02.964
can be pleased very easily,

01:01:03.165 --> 01:01:06.875
but do not play games with Me.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.813
Do not play games with Me.

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:13.071
Innocence can be very powerful also.

01:01:13.272 --> 01:01:16.514
Don’t play games with Me.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:41.001
So now, the children are there how to be named?

01:02:13.778 --> 01:02:16.352
That's it.

01:02:17.645 --> 01:02:19.501
May God Bless you.

01:02:20.065 --> 01:02:25.403
It is a son? You have been blessed. Alright?

01:07:00.778 --> 01:07:04.369
I think let us meditate for about ten minutes.

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:07.210
Would be a good idea.

01:07:45.046 --> 01:07:48.275
Keep your eyes open.

01:07:52.838 --> 01:07:57.277
Now all the children should put their hands link this.

01:07:57.478 --> 01:07:59.183
All right?

01:07:59.384 --> 01:08:01.845
And watch Me.

01:08:38.486 --> 01:08:44.373
Lift your tongues and put them back

01:08:44.574 --> 01:08:48.019
as much as possible.

01:08:48.859 --> 01:08:51.765
Turn it backward.

01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:59.542
Let it feel the bliss of the Divine on its tip.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:16.388
Now put your chin down, touching your…

01:09:16.605 --> 01:09:19.635
don’t close your eyes.

01:09:22.623 --> 01:09:26.122
In complete surrender,

01:09:27.857 --> 01:09:30.075
put the chin.

01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:38.639
But don’t close your eyes.

01:09:43.317 --> 01:09:47.097
Pay attention to your Sahasrara.

01:09:53.610 --> 01:09:57.014
Loosen your hands fully on the sides,

01:09:57.215 --> 01:10:01.785
make them loose. Sit straight.

01:10:13.123 --> 01:10:16.412
Do not touch the palate.

01:10:38.406 --> 01:10:41.179
Now breathe in.

01:10:42.935 --> 01:10:45.794
Do not push back the tongue. Keep the tongue where it is.

01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:47.770
Breathe in.

01:10:55.020 --> 01:11:00.678
Now raise your stomach, without taking out the breath, upward,

01:11:00.879 --> 01:11:05.521
pushing the air upward towards the lungs.

01:11:06.515 --> 01:11:09.718
Push your stomach in.

01:11:15.566 --> 01:11:19.659
Attention on the Sahasrara.

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:35.725
You start seeing light through Sahasrara.

01:11:37.015 --> 01:11:40.718
Sort of the Sahasrara becomes like eyes.

01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:50.034
Now leave it.

01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:56.203
Leave it now.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:11:59.914
Raise your head.

01:12:06.264 --> 01:12:09.553
Now put back your heads.

01:12:10.354 --> 01:12:12.196
Put the fingers [in the ears].

01:12:12.397 --> 01:12:14.379
Put the attention to your Sahasrara, that’s all.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:17.467
Don’t say anything, no mantras.

01:12:21.065 --> 01:12:24.266
Take out your tongue,

01:12:24.467 --> 01:12:27.404
push it back.

01:12:29.303 --> 01:12:32.146
Take in your breath.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.638
Push the stomach.

01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:50.496
That’s good.

01:13:04.365 --> 01:13:13.146
Now watch Me continuously without blinking.

01:13:16.853 --> 01:13:20.253
Without any pressure on the eyes.

01:13:30.863 --> 01:13:33.895
Attention on the Sahasrara.

01:14:25.543 --> 01:14:29.815
You can do it without blinking.

01:14:41.293 --> 01:14:44.173
May God bless you.

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:51.389
This is it, physically, we have worked out our attention,

01:14:54.902 --> 01:14:58.832
on our Vishuddhi and on our Agnya.

01:15:07.392 --> 01:15:10.790
The left Vishuddhi is still there.

01:15:12.324 --> 01:15:18.228
Now put your head more on the right side,

01:15:18.429 --> 01:15:21.460
loose, like this.

01:15:22.788 --> 01:15:26.889
With the attention on the Sahasrara, looking at Me.

01:15:28.224 --> 01:15:30.528
Put it loose.

01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:36.455
Hand to be loose.

01:15:39.455 --> 01:15:41.751
Loosen it.

01:15:51.221 --> 01:15:53.455
Now better.

01:16:02.969 --> 01:16:06.569
You feel the Kundalini rising?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:14.600
Let us put ourselves into bandhan after raising our Kundalini.

01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:17.074
Raise.

01:16:18.298 --> 01:16:21.290
Attention on your Sahasrara. Don’t close your eyes,

01:16:21.491 --> 01:16:23.524
push back your head.

01:16:23.725 --> 01:16:25.529
One.

01:16:26.185 --> 01:16:28.388
Again.

01:16:29.213 --> 01:16:30.958
Sit straight.

01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:34.401
Take it up on your head.

01:16:34.602 --> 01:16:36.277
Two…

01:16:49.268 --> 01:16:51.029
three.

01:16:51.586 --> 01:16:53.810
Now a bandhan.

01:16:54.385 --> 01:16:56.650
One,

01:16:58.260 --> 01:16:59.775
two.

01:17:00.158 --> 01:17:02.327
Do it properly, systematically.

01:17:02.528 --> 01:17:05.838
Three. All of us should do properly. Three…

01:17:06.039 --> 01:17:08.229
four…

01:17:09.884 --> 01:17:11.408
five…

01:17:11.823 --> 01:17:13.897
Try to wait as I am doing it…

01:17:14.098 --> 01:17:16.129
six…

01:17:18.818 --> 01:17:20.613
seven.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.149
Still we have not done it properly.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:31.546
We all should do in one rhythm. Let’s do it again.

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:34.536
One. slowly…

01:17:38.004 --> 01:17:41.363
two, with attention on the Sahasrara…

01:17:42.798 --> 01:17:45.493
three…How do I do it? …

01:17:46.594 --> 01:17:48.204
four…

01:17:50.484 --> 01:17:52.539
five…good…

01:17:54.008 --> 01:17:55.461
six.

01:17:56.227 --> 01:17:59.391
Attention on Sahasrara…seven.

01:18:04.907 --> 01:18:06.961
Rising?

01:18:08.005 --> 01:18:10.563
Let’s have the last binding…

01:18:18.138 --> 01:18:19.656
Now see.

01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:29.201
Clear?

01:18:35.402 --> 01:18:37.348
Tremendous.

01:18:39.299 --> 01:18:41.348
May God bless you.

01:18:45.498 --> 01:18:49.586
[Shri Mataji, if you permit I’d like to say that]

01:18:49.787 --> 01:18:52.436
[if there are some people who cannot decide that]

01:18:52.637 --> 01:18:55.055
[Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing in their life,]

01:18:55.256 --> 01:18:57.662
[they should not come to the puja tomorrow.]

01:18:57.863 --> 01:19:01.830
Of course. For tomorrow’s puja

01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:08.205
we should not have people who are not at least in Nirvichara.

01:19:08.406 --> 01:19:12.951
Means if they still think that “Sahaja Yoga will not suit me,”

01:19:13.152 --> 01:19:16.486
and all that, we don’t want such mediocres. Please don’t come.

01:19:16.687 --> 01:19:19.411
Nothing will work out with them, they are useless people for Me,

01:19:19.612 --> 01:19:21.160
absolutely.

01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:24.781
If they have to come to the puja they must know that,

01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:29.396
you have to be of a caliber, otherwise please don’t come.

01:19:32.576 --> 01:19:35.135
There are many who think like that,

01:19:35.336 --> 01:19:38.738
that Sahaja Yoga is the solution

01:19:38.939 --> 01:19:45.274
and that I am the chosen one for that solution.

01:19:45.657 --> 01:19:47.758
Such people should only come tomorrow.

01:19:47.959 --> 01:19:51.427
Otherwise all such people who think, this kind,

01:19:51.628 --> 01:19:55.630
even now. Please, forgive Me.

01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:58.057
I want you to forgive Me.

01:19:58.258 --> 01:19:59.882
I cannot have you for Sahasrara puja,

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:01.872
it’s too much for Me to work,

01:20:02.073 --> 01:20:05.278
with such adamant nonsensical people here.

01:20:05.479 --> 01:20:09.638
I don’t want such adamant nonsensical people to come.

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:12.313
If they think they are doing some obligation,

01:20:12.514 --> 01:20:15.110
they should know that there’s no obligation on Me,

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.743
but it’s obligation on you.

01:20:16.944 --> 01:20:20.643
Please none of you, of that kind, should come. I could feel it.

01:20:20.844 --> 01:20:23.087
There are some sitting within you.

01:20:23.288 --> 01:20:26.398
So all such people should not try to come and disturb us.

01:20:26.599 --> 01:20:29.984
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga, work it out and then come back.

01:20:30.185 --> 01:20:32.738
I don’t know how much chances they have, but whatever it is.

01:20:32.939 --> 01:20:35.700
You must know that to come to Sahaja Yoga

01:20:35.901 --> 01:20:40.965
is a special privilege

01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:45.717
and anybody who thinks like that should not be here.

01:20:45.918 --> 01:20:48.883
I’ll be very thankful.

01:20:49.084 --> 01:20:52.240
Thank you very much.

01:21:06.941 --> 01:21:09.092
So now I think we will have dinner,

01:21:09.293 --> 01:21:12.626
after that we will have some music and sing songs.

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:17.321
And then tomorrow, we will have Sahasrara Puja.
