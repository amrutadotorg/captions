00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.346
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:25.964
that the last work of the Divine,

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:31.040
of opening the last centre

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:41.186
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

00:02:58.084 --> 00:03:08.880
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:29.959
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

00:03:37.513 --> 00:03:48.656
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:54.112
how things are worked in the heavens.

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:11.999
It is your fortune and God’s love

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.614
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

00:04:27.436 --> 00:04:32.106
Without this happening, there could not
have been

00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:42.413
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:55.111
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

00:04:55.312 --> 00:05:02.909
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:22.963
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

00:05:29.925 --> 00:05:38.821
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:51.199
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:12.459
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:23.067
and, with the permutations and combinations

00:06:25.004 --> 00:06:33.893
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:43.307
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

00:06:44.873 --> 00:06:54.205
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:10.315
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:18.815
and the whole thing came on this Earth

00:07:19.016 --> 00:07:26.707
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.681
with such a tremendous force,

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:52.239
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

00:07:57.971 --> 00:08:04.449
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:15.380
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:42.585
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

00:08:50.284 --> 00:09:00.908
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:12.144
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:19.241
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.523
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

00:09:24.724 --> 00:09:40.473
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:55.233
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:59.960
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:17.168
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.930
on their golden seats,

00:10:30.385 --> 00:10:38.682
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:46.508
like a big dome,

00:10:50.104 --> 00:10:53.156
and opened it,

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:57.788
and then this torrential rain

00:11:00.472 --> 00:11:04.320
completely drenched me

00:11:08.957 --> 00:11:15.761
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:31.434
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

00:11:31.635 --> 00:11:36.637
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

00:11:51.129 --> 00:12:00.189
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

00:12:05.294 --> 00:12:13.336
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

00:12:18.368 --> 00:12:22.695
and I became absolutely silent.

00:12:31.276 --> 00:12:38.181
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:53.291
But I saw all stones.

00:12:58.317 --> 00:13:07.340
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:18.938
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:24.871
appearing like inflated flames.

00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:38.585
It is a thing which is seen by many people

00:13:43.086 --> 00:13:50.455
but to see it pour that torrential rain

00:13:54.759 --> 00:14:00.470
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

00:14:03.607 --> 00:14:10.074
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

00:14:12.592 --> 00:14:20.405
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:31.751
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

00:14:35.412 --> 00:14:41.212
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

00:14:46.484 --> 00:14:52.223
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:59.042
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.759
you cannot see its beauty;

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.294
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:18.647
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:34.098
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:41.723
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

00:15:52.518 --> 00:15:55.734
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

00:15:55.935 --> 00:16:03.080
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:28.900
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:48.143
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

00:16:55.382 --> 00:17:03.574
and you are drawn out to people

00:17:03.775 --> 00:17:12.501
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:28.468
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

00:17:37.437 --> 00:17:43.260
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

00:17:49.135 --> 00:18:00.766
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:15.079
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.107
has to be through human beings.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:33.998
The power could be with you,

00:18:34.199 --> 00:18:39.764
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:53.702
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

00:18:58.157 --> 00:19:01.279
How to get them?

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.849
How to work it out?

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.967
So I started looking out for people,

00:19:18.683 --> 00:19:23.541
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:31.667
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:40.217
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

00:19:42.782 --> 00:19:47.034
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

00:19:50.234 --> 00:19:58.940
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

00:20:04.307 --> 00:20:08.939
And her brain would be covered with clouds

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.405
and darkness.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:20.879
Again and again I had to enlighten it

00:20:22.818 --> 00:20:26.951
but she did not get her Realisation.

00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:35.841
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

00:20:39.723 --> 00:20:44.113
This capacity I had from childhood.

00:20:45.582 --> 00:20:50.770
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

00:20:54.612 --> 00:20:59.396
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

00:21:04.128 --> 00:21:09.247
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:13.865
because I was not living in the forest,

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:23.472
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:39.181
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:46.833
and I had to do this work among them.

00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:56.232
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

00:21:56.433 --> 00:22:00.681
and the false [one] in which they live?

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:17.355
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:24.269
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

00:22:29.189 --> 00:22:33.000
and it worked in her.

00:22:37.946 --> 00:22:41.351
That was not the happiest day,

00:22:43.957 --> 00:22:49.903
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

00:22:54.738 --> 00:22:59.848
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:10.996
We had a programme in Bordi

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:16.405
in ’70,

00:23:16.892 --> 00:23:23.857
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

00:23:29.197 --> 00:23:36.323
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:44.819
and they started talking of favouritism.

00:23:48.002 --> 00:23:53.977
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

00:23:58.392 --> 00:24:05.841
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

00:24:10.437 --> 00:24:14.339
I was in a great fury.

00:24:16.563 --> 00:24:21.094
I had never gone into such a fury before

00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:26.641
and I lashed out at them.

00:24:30.492 --> 00:24:36.269
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

00:24:40.937 --> 00:24:45.184
That was the greatest moment.

00:24:46.503 --> 00:24:51.444
Then many got, one by one.

00:24:56.206 --> 00:24:59.783
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

00:24:59.984 --> 00:25:04.540
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

00:25:11.216 --> 00:25:16.257
So the mass evolution started.

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:25.312
Sahasrara is your awareness.

00:25:26.314 --> 00:25:29.890
When it is enlightened

00:25:31.336 --> 00:25:38.621
you get into the technique of the Divine.

00:25:39.814 --> 00:25:43.248
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

00:25:43.449 --> 00:25:47.579
and the technique that you follow.

00:25:54.016 --> 00:26:03.364
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

00:26:13.822 --> 00:26:20.099
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:31.699
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:39.587
When your Sahasrara opens out

00:26:40.486 --> 00:26:48.947
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

00:26:54.488 --> 00:27:00.791
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

00:27:06.746 --> 00:27:15.474
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:28.482
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

00:27:32.991 --> 00:27:39.105
and your nadis get enlightened;

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.399
not all of them,

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.171
quite a lot of them;

00:27:49.372 --> 00:27:53.843
not all the length,

00:27:54.662 --> 00:27:58.912
but quite the peripheries.

00:28:01.572 --> 00:28:06.244
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

00:28:10.144 --> 00:28:13.330
So many things happen

00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:20.354
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

00:28:25.499 --> 00:28:30.182
With the light you see their relative
positions.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:40.974
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:52.429
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

00:29:01.588 --> 00:29:09.824
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

00:29:15.865 --> 00:29:19.518
It becomes one with your attention.

00:29:20.553 --> 00:29:24.635
Wherever your attention goes

00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:29.774
you act in a collective way.

00:29:31.251 --> 00:29:37.338
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:45.315
The attention itself is effective.

00:29:46.793 --> 00:29:51.731
Your attention is very important,

00:29:54.074 --> 00:29:58.587
your desires are even more important.

00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:10.052
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.651
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

00:30:18.852 --> 00:30:26.611
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

00:30:34.167 --> 00:30:38.115
The priorities change very fast.

00:30:40.617 --> 00:30:46.077
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

00:30:47.825 --> 00:30:52.052
may not find that happening

00:30:55.507 --> 00:30:59.915
but those who are over mentally developed,

00:31:01.624 --> 00:31:07.843
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

00:31:10.448 --> 00:31:14.073
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

00:31:14.274 --> 00:31:18.932
They want to see that it is logical.

00:31:26.211 --> 00:31:31.078
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

00:31:35.716 --> 00:31:39.929
We have some people like that among us.

00:31:41.986 --> 00:31:46.053
They just became and they never questioned.

00:31:49.555 --> 00:31:52.521
They just settled down.

00:31:54.086 --> 00:31:59.108
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

00:31:59.329 --> 00:32:03.549
above all they are spiritual.

00:32:05.892 --> 00:32:08.396
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

00:32:08.597 --> 00:32:12.637
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

00:32:17.941 --> 00:32:21.236
First of all you have to put down your ego

00:32:21.437 --> 00:32:26.195
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

00:32:30.187 --> 00:32:33.752
Also the super-ego must be reduced

00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:40.815
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

00:32:48.396 --> 00:32:52.509
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

00:32:52.710 --> 00:33:00.586
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:14.395
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

00:33:19.222 --> 00:33:28.044
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:36.935
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.813
it closes back.

00:33:42.014 --> 00:33:45.522
That’s like a poison.

00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:51.821
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

00:33:55.934 --> 00:34:00.055
If you go about with the poison

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.506
then it again closes.

00:34:09.976 --> 00:34:17.019
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:22.628
and all other problems of the ego,

00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:28.393
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

00:34:30.665 --> 00:34:35.118
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

00:34:35.684 --> 00:34:41.237
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

00:34:43.884 --> 00:34:46.845
and wrong books,

00:34:47.046 --> 00:34:50.175
from wrong parents maybe,

00:34:50.376 --> 00:34:53.639
from a wrong country,

00:34:56.402 --> 00:35:00.184
from a wrong livelihood

00:35:01.297 --> 00:35:08.421
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

00:35:13.596 --> 00:35:19.353
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.119
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:33.664
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

00:35:40.657 --> 00:35:45.303
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

00:35:46.988 --> 00:35:51.259
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:58.548
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

00:35:58.749 --> 00:36:02.775
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

00:36:09.189 --> 00:36:15.409
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

00:36:21.482 --> 00:36:25.801
We have to have more and more channels

00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:32.918
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

00:36:37.356 --> 00:36:44.871
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

00:36:50.524 --> 00:36:58.341
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:08.058
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:16.782
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.214
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:39.544
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

00:37:39.753 --> 00:37:47.379
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:03.406
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

00:38:03.607 --> 00:38:07.743
that he should not have bad company,

00:38:12.085 --> 00:38:16.982
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:23.682
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

00:38:23.883 --> 00:38:30.455
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:45.050
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:54.395
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

00:39:06.808 --> 00:39:15.973
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.428
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:35.649
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:44.055
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

00:39:45.398 --> 00:39:51.952
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

00:39:57.184 --> 00:40:02.131
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

00:40:05.029 --> 00:40:09.416
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

00:40:12.053 --> 00:40:18.422
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

00:40:25.709 --> 00:40:30.254
so all other things must drop out.

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:39.455
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:47.023
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

00:40:47.224 --> 00:40:53.711
that you can really correct yourself

00:41:00.402 --> 00:41:09.250
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:21.234
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:30.377
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

00:41:30.578 --> 00:41:38.013
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

00:41:42.047 --> 00:41:44.943
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

00:41:45.144 --> 00:41:50.875
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

00:41:59.003 --> 00:42:03.041
For that tolerance is needed,

00:42:05.321 --> 00:42:08.419
wisdom is needed,

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:13.622
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

00:42:18.545 --> 00:42:21.392
which you are,

00:42:24.299 --> 00:42:28.242
and you should talk like a prophet.

00:42:32.918 --> 00:42:37.727
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

00:42:41.974 --> 00:42:48.469
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

00:42:49.653 --> 00:42:55.660
This is not insincere or acting

00:42:58.321 --> 00:43:01.482
because now you are awakened.

00:43:03.182 --> 00:43:10.817
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:39.079
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

00:43:46.342 --> 00:43:56.757
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

00:44:02.124 --> 00:44:10.281
one has to watch one’s own growth.

00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:19.826
Never justify your wrongdoings.

00:44:24.646 --> 00:44:31.305
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

00:44:34.498 --> 00:44:39.075
We have no time to think about oneself.

00:44:42.656 --> 00:44:47.180
You have to think of others

00:44:47.381 --> 00:44:51.027
because others are also in your brain;

00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:57.391
and when you start thinking of others,

00:44:57.774 --> 00:45:03.548
talking to them about their resurrection,

00:45:06.391 --> 00:45:16.267
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

00:45:23.213 --> 00:45:26.818
The sensitivity will also increase,

00:45:27.765 --> 00:45:30.704
the depth will also come in.

00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:37.917
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

00:45:45.844 --> 00:45:49.779
So you have to come out of your shells

00:45:53.495 --> 00:45:56.947
and spread your wings.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:03.041
All small things of mind

00:46:06.535 --> 00:46:09.302
must be given up.

00:46:13.002 --> 00:46:20.328
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

00:46:27.264 --> 00:46:30.846
which has to give support,

00:46:31.776 --> 00:46:35.564
guidance, help

00:46:35.765 --> 00:46:40.617
and awakening to thousands.

00:46:41.694 --> 00:46:48.619
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

00:46:51.772 --> 00:46:58.100
establishes a new dynamism

00:46:59.808 --> 00:47:02.787
in this country,

00:47:03.908 --> 00:47:06.425
I am sure

00:47:07.276 --> 00:47:13.261
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

00:47:20.318 --> 00:47:25.162
It will resound into their brains,

00:47:28.744 --> 00:47:33.641
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

00:47:38.516 --> 00:47:44.081
and they will start thinking afresh.

00:47:48.439 --> 00:47:53.875
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

00:47:57.869 --> 00:48:06.480
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

00:48:11.895 --> 00:48:15.316
They’ll come to right conclusions.

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:22.537
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

00:48:29.284 --> 00:48:33.931
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:40.581
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

00:48:43.306 --> 00:48:46.437
The way you treat your Spirit

00:48:46.638 --> 00:48:52.252
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

00:48:59.746 --> 00:49:07.634
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

00:49:11.866 --> 00:49:17.272
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:28.941
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

00:49:34.912 --> 00:49:39.507
And then you can become a subtle being.

00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:45.475
Through your conscious effort,

00:49:45.676 --> 00:49:51.833
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

00:49:57.642 --> 00:50:01.868
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:09.222
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

00:50:15.113 --> 00:50:17.639
When you start developing higher and
higher,

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:23.985
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

00:50:31.088 --> 00:50:34.458
You may not have any interest in many
things

00:50:34.659 --> 00:50:42.178
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

00:50:47.394 --> 00:50:53.923
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

00:51:00.282 --> 00:51:09.453
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

00:51:15.923 --> 00:51:22.333
So you become the master of your brain

00:51:23.462 --> 00:51:28.631
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

00:51:30.603 --> 00:51:36.572
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

00:51:36.773 --> 00:51:42.489
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

00:51:47.641 --> 00:51:51.943
And the light of that expands

00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:58.131
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

00:52:01.348 --> 00:52:05.483
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

00:52:05.684 --> 00:52:09.852
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

00:52:10.053 --> 00:52:17.722
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

00:52:28.795 --> 00:52:37.238
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

00:52:42.097 --> 00:52:46.616
their obstinacy

00:52:46.817 --> 00:52:52.667
and childish pranks.

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:59.934
Let the man rise

00:53:01.414 --> 00:53:07.610
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:19.126
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

00:53:29.758 --> 00:53:40.677
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

00:53:40.886 --> 00:53:47.458
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

00:53:57.115 --> 00:54:01.093
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

00:54:01.294 --> 00:54:06.191
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:20.661
That is what is your job,

00:54:22.678 --> 00:54:28.302
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

00:54:32.581 --> 00:54:40.895
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:49.811
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

00:55:03.486 --> 00:55:07.728
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

00:55:07.929 --> 00:55:13.641
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

00:55:13.842 --> 00:55:21.146
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

00:55:33.584 --> 00:55:37.376
neglected by all the deities,

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:44.406
because human beings really went very
wrong.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:57.914
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

00:56:00.717 --> 00:56:05.057
because this is the attention,

00:56:08.059 --> 00:56:16.558
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

00:56:29.066 --> 00:56:35.636
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

00:56:39.558 --> 00:56:46.011
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:51.508
and  towards the eternal life.

00:56:52.564 --> 00:56:56.935
Is [a] very important country,

00:56:58.128 --> 00:57:03.442
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

00:57:06.975 --> 00:57:13.754
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

00:57:18.605 --> 00:57:22.860
They have to change their methods

00:57:23.211 --> 00:57:25.719
and styles.

00:57:26.317 --> 00:57:30.422
They should be very mild, gentle

00:57:31.527 --> 00:57:34.967
and healthy people

00:57:37.223 --> 00:57:42.578
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:48.680
so that when others see them

00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:53.589
[they] find that superiority in them.

00:57:57.463 --> 00:58:01.877
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:05.070
I am very happy about you.

00:58:10.754 --> 00:58:14.143
May God bless you all.

00:58:15.066 --> 00:58:19.361
Now I bless all the other centres,

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:24.711
who have prayed and are praying;

00:58:24.912 --> 00:58:30.422
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

00:58:31.551 --> 00:58:34.553
an enlightened one,

00:58:34.739 --> 00:58:39.751
that will separate them from their small
shells.

00:58:41.633 --> 00:58:45.979
Let them expand so much,

00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:52.946
that they become one with the whole.

00:58:53.147 --> 00:58:56.281
May God bless you all.

00:59:03.092 --> 00:59:06.266
May God bless you.

00:59:06.787 --> 00:59:09.692
Good (…)
