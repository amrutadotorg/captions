02:10.490 --> 02:18.346
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

02:18.547 --> 02:25.964
that the last work of the Divine,

02:26.165 --> 02:31.040
of opening the last centre

02:33.219 --> 02:41.186
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

02:58.084 --> 03:08.880
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

03:20.363 --> 03:29.959
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

03:37.513 --> 03:48.656
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

03:48.857 --> 03:54.112
how things are worked in the heavens.

04:02.393 --> 04:11.999
It is your fortune and God’s love

04:12.200 --> 04:17.614
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

04:27.436 --> 04:32.106
Without this happening, there could not
have been

04:33.878 --> 04:42.413
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

04:50.379 --> 04:55.111
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

04:55.312 --> 05:02.909
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

05:12.252 --> 05:22.963
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

05:29.925 --> 05:38.821
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

05:43.346 --> 05:51.199
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

06:00.451 --> 06:12.459
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

06:17.381 --> 06:23.067
and, with the permutations and combinations

06:25.004 --> 06:33.893
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

06:38.812 --> 06:43.307
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

06:44.873 --> 06:54.205
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

07:04.651 --> 07:10.315
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

07:14.499 --> 07:18.815
and the whole thing came on this Earth

07:19.016 --> 07:26.707
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

07:35.860 --> 07:40.681
with such a tremendous force,

07:45.186 --> 07:52.239
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

07:57.971 --> 08:04.449
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

08:04.650 --> 08:15.380
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

08:31.014 --> 08:42.585
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

08:50.284 --> 09:00.908
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

09:06.076 --> 09:12.144
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

09:12.345 --> 09:19.241
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

09:19.450 --> 09:24.523
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

09:24.724 --> 09:40.473
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

09:50.589 --> 09:55.233
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

09:55.434 --> 09:59.960
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

10:09.770 --> 10:17.168
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

10:24.724 --> 10:27.930
on their golden seats,

10:30.385 --> 10:38.682
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

10:43.279 --> 10:46.508
like a big dome,

10:50.104 --> 10:53.156
and opened it,

10:53.786 --> 10:57.788
and then this torrential rain

11:00.472 --> 11:04.320
completely drenched me

11:08.957 --> 11:15.761
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

11:23.722 --> 11:31.434
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

11:31.635 --> 11:36.637
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

11:51.129 --> 12:00.189
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

12:05.294 --> 12:13.336
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

12:18.368 --> 12:22.695
and I became absolutely silent.

12:31.276 --> 12:38.181
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

12:49.418 --> 12:53.291
But I saw all stones.

12:58.317 --> 13:07.340
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

13:12.905 --> 13:18.938
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

13:19.139 --> 13:24.871
appearing like inflated flames.

13:30.562 --> 13:38.585
It is a thing which is seen by many people

13:43.086 --> 13:50.455
but to see it pour that torrential rain

13:54.759 --> 14:00.470
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

14:03.607 --> 14:10.074
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

14:12.592 --> 14:20.405
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

14:26.906 --> 14:31.751
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

14:35.412 --> 14:41.212
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

14:46.484 --> 14:52.223
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

14:54.280 --> 14:59.042
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

14:59.250 --> 15:02.759
you cannot see its beauty;

15:08.070 --> 15:12.294
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

15:12.495 --> 15:18.647
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

15:24.465 --> 15:34.098
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

15:34.299 --> 15:41.723
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

15:52.518 --> 15:55.734
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

15:55.935 --> 16:03.080
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

16:19.692 --> 16:28.900
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

16:36.693 --> 16:48.143
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

16:55.382 --> 17:03.574
and you are drawn out to people

17:03.775 --> 17:12.501
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

17:18.931 --> 17:28.468
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

17:37.437 --> 17:43.260
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

17:49.135 --> 18:00.766
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

18:06.840 --> 18:15.079
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

18:15.280 --> 18:20.107
has to be through human beings.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.998
The power could be with you,

18:34.199 --> 18:39.764
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

18:45.280 --> 18:53.702
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

18:58.157 --> 19:01.279
How to get them?

19:03.590 --> 19:06.849
How to work it out?

19:09.890 --> 19:13.967
So I started looking out for people,

19:18.683 --> 19:23.541
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

19:25.909 --> 19:31.667
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

19:34.876 --> 19:40.217
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

19:42.782 --> 19:47.034
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

19:50.234 --> 19:58.940
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

20:04.307 --> 20:08.939
And her brain would be covered with clouds

20:11.060 --> 20:14.405
and darkness.

20:15.297 --> 20:20.879
Again and again I had to enlighten it

20:22.818 --> 20:26.951
but she did not get her Realisation.

20:29.088 --> 20:35.841
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

20:39.723 --> 20:44.113
This capacity I had from childhood.

20:45.582 --> 20:50.770
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

20:54.612 --> 20:59.396
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

21:04.128 --> 21:09.247
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

21:11.003 --> 21:13.865
because I was not living in the forest,

21:14.066 --> 21:23.472
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

21:33.525 --> 21:39.181
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

21:41.739 --> 21:46.833
and I had to do this work among them.

21:53.231 --> 21:56.232
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

21:56.433 --> 22:00.681
and the false [one] in which they live?

22:11.170 --> 22:17.355
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

22:17.556 --> 22:24.269
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

22:29.189 --> 22:33.000
and it worked in her.

22:37.946 --> 22:41.351
That was not the happiest day,

22:43.957 --> 22:49.903
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

22:54.738 --> 22:59.848
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

23:06.770 --> 23:10.996
We had a programme in Bordi

23:11.910 --> 23:16.405
in ’70,

23:16.892 --> 23:23.857
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

23:29.197 --> 23:36.323
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

23:39.587 --> 23:44.819
and they started talking of favouritism.

23:48.002 --> 23:53.977
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

23:58.392 --> 24:05.841
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

24:10.437 --> 24:14.339
I was in a great fury.

24:16.563 --> 24:21.094
I had never gone into such a fury before

24:22.565 --> 24:26.641
and I lashed out at them.

24:30.492 --> 24:36.269
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

24:40.937 --> 24:45.184
That was the greatest moment.

24:46.503 --> 24:51.444
Then many got, one by one.

24:56.206 --> 24:59.783
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

24:59.984 --> 25:04.540
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

25:11.216 --> 25:16.257
So the mass evolution started.

25:20.789 --> 25:25.312
Sahasrara is your awareness.

25:26.314 --> 25:29.890
When it is enlightened

25:31.336 --> 25:38.621
you get into the technique of the Divine.

25:39.814 --> 25:43.248
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

25:43.449 --> 25:47.579
and the technique that you follow.

25:54.016 --> 26:03.364
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

26:13.822 --> 26:20.099
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

26:25.656 --> 26:31.699
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

26:35.294 --> 26:39.587
When your Sahasrara opens out

26:40.486 --> 26:48.947
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

26:54.488 --> 27:00.791
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

27:06.746 --> 27:15.474
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

27:20.284 --> 27:28.482
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

27:32.991 --> 27:39.105
and your nadis get enlightened;

27:43.710 --> 27:46.399
not all of them,

27:46.600 --> 27:49.171
quite a lot of them;

27:49.372 --> 27:53.843
not all the length,

27:54.662 --> 27:58.912
but quite the peripheries.

28:01.572 --> 28:06.244
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

28:10.144 --> 28:13.330
So many things happen

28:13.531 --> 28:20.354
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

28:25.499 --> 28:30.182
With the light you see their relative
positions.

28:33.510 --> 28:40.974
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

28:46.809 --> 28:52.429
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

29:01.588 --> 29:09.824
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

29:15.865 --> 29:19.518
It becomes one with your attention.

29:20.553 --> 29:24.635
Wherever your attention goes

29:25.471 --> 29:29.774
you act in a collective way.

29:31.251 --> 29:37.338
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

29:39.419 --> 29:45.315
The attention itself is effective.

29:46.793 --> 29:51.731
Your attention is very important,

29:54.074 --> 29:58.587
your desires are even more important.

30:01.906 --> 30:10.052
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

30:15.310 --> 30:18.651
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

30:18.852 --> 30:26.611
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

30:34.167 --> 30:38.115
The priorities change very fast.

30:40.617 --> 30:46.077
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

30:47.825 --> 30:52.052
may not find that happening

30:55.507 --> 30:59.915
but those who are over mentally developed,

31:01.624 --> 31:07.843
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

31:10.448 --> 31:14.073
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

31:14.274 --> 31:18.932
They want to see that it is logical.

31:26.211 --> 31:31.078
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

31:35.716 --> 31:39.929
We have some people like that among us.

31:41.986 --> 31:46.053
They just became and they never questioned.

31:49.555 --> 31:52.521
They just settled down.

31:54.086 --> 31:59.108
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

31:59.329 --> 32:03.549
above all they are spiritual.

32:05.892 --> 32:08.396
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

32:08.597 --> 32:12.637
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

32:17.941 --> 32:21.236
First of all you have to put down your ego

32:21.437 --> 32:26.195
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

32:30.187 --> 32:33.752
Also the super-ego must be reduced

32:33.953 --> 32:40.815
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

32:48.396 --> 32:52.509
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

32:52.710 --> 33:00.586
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

33:07.645 --> 33:14.395
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

33:19.222 --> 33:28.044
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

33:32.609 --> 33:36.935
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

33:38.683 --> 33:41.813
it closes back.

33:42.014 --> 33:45.522
That’s like a poison.

33:46.651 --> 33:51.821
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

33:55.934 --> 34:00.055
If you go about with the poison

34:02.740 --> 34:06.506
then it again closes.

34:09.976 --> 34:17.019
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

34:18.111 --> 34:22.628
and all other problems of the ego,

34:22.829 --> 34:28.393
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

34:30.665 --> 34:35.118
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

34:35.684 --> 34:41.237
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

34:43.884 --> 34:46.845
and wrong books,

34:47.046 --> 34:50.175
from wrong parents maybe,

34:50.376 --> 34:53.639
from a wrong country,

34:56.402 --> 35:00.184
from a wrong livelihood

35:01.297 --> 35:08.421
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

35:13.596 --> 35:19.353
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.119
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

35:26.320 --> 35:33.664
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

35:40.657 --> 35:45.303
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

35:46.988 --> 35:51.259
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

35:52.610 --> 35:58.548
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

35:58.749 --> 36:02.775
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

36:09.189 --> 36:15.409
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

36:21.482 --> 36:25.801
We have to have more and more channels

36:27.286 --> 36:32.918
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

36:37.356 --> 36:44.871
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

36:50.524 --> 36:58.341
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

37:03.644 --> 37:08.058
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

37:11.751 --> 37:16.782
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

37:22.800 --> 37:28.214
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

37:34.294 --> 37:39.544
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

37:39.753 --> 37:47.379
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

38:00.086 --> 38:03.406
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

38:03.607 --> 38:07.743
that he should not have bad company,

38:12.085 --> 38:16.982
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

38:19.690 --> 38:23.682
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

38:23.883 --> 38:30.455
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

38:38.981 --> 38:45.050
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

38:45.251 --> 38:54.395
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

39:06.808 --> 39:15.973
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

39:23.950 --> 39:28.428
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

39:30.542 --> 39:35.649
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

39:38.714 --> 39:44.055
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

39:45.398 --> 39:51.952
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

39:57.184 --> 40:02.131
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

40:05.029 --> 40:09.416
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

40:12.053 --> 40:18.422
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

40:25.709 --> 40:30.254
so all other things must drop out.

40:34.431 --> 40:39.455
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

40:43.774 --> 40:47.023
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

40:47.224 --> 40:53.711
that you can really correct yourself

41:00.402 --> 41:09.250
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

41:15.539 --> 41:21.234
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

41:24.586 --> 41:30.377
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

41:30.578 --> 41:38.013
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

41:42.047 --> 41:44.943
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

41:45.144 --> 41:50.875
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

41:59.003 --> 42:03.041
For that tolerance is needed,

42:05.321 --> 42:08.419
wisdom is needed,

42:08.620 --> 42:13.622
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

42:18.545 --> 42:21.392
which you are,

42:24.299 --> 42:28.242
and you should talk like a prophet.

42:32.918 --> 42:37.727
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

42:41.974 --> 42:48.469
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

42:49.653 --> 42:55.660
This is not insincere or acting

42:58.321 --> 43:01.482
because now you are awakened.

43:03.182 --> 43:10.817
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

43:25.705 --> 43:39.079
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

43:46.342 --> 43:56.757
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

44:02.124 --> 44:10.281
one has to watch one’s own growth.

44:14.767 --> 44:19.826
Never justify your wrongdoings.

44:24.646 --> 44:31.305
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

44:34.498 --> 44:39.075
We have no time to think about oneself.

44:42.656 --> 44:47.180
You have to think of others

44:47.381 --> 44:51.027
because others are also in your brain;

44:53.441 --> 44:57.391
and when you start thinking of others,

44:57.774 --> 45:03.548
talking to them about their resurrection,

45:06.391 --> 45:16.267
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

45:23.213 --> 45:26.818
The sensitivity will also increase,

45:27.765 --> 45:30.704
the depth will also come in.

45:31.881 --> 45:37.917
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

45:45.844 --> 45:49.779
So you have to come out of your shells

45:53.495 --> 45:56.947
and spread your wings.

45:57.710 --> 46:03.041
All small things of mind

46:06.535 --> 46:09.302
must be given up.

46:13.002 --> 46:20.328
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

46:27.264 --> 46:30.846
which has to give support,

46:31.776 --> 46:35.564
guidance, help

46:35.765 --> 46:40.617
and awakening to thousands.

46:41.694 --> 46:48.619
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

46:51.772 --> 46:58.100
establishes a new dynamism

46:59.808 --> 47:02.787
in this country,

47:03.908 --> 47:06.425
I am sure

47:07.276 --> 47:13.261
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

47:20.318 --> 47:25.162
It will resound into their brains,

47:28.744 --> 47:33.641
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

47:38.516 --> 47:44.081
and they will start thinking afresh.

47:48.439 --> 47:53.875
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

47:57.869 --> 48:06.480
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

48:11.895 --> 48:15.316
They’ll come to right conclusions.

48:18.079 --> 48:22.537
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

48:29.284 --> 48:33.931
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

48:35.830 --> 48:40.581
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

48:43.306 --> 48:46.437
The way you treat your Spirit

48:46.638 --> 48:52.252
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

48:59.746 --> 49:07.634
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

49:11.866 --> 49:17.272
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

49:22.409 --> 49:28.941
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

49:34.912 --> 49:39.507
And then you can become a subtle being.

49:41.064 --> 49:45.475
Through your conscious effort,

49:45.676 --> 49:51.833
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

49:57.642 --> 50:01.868
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

50:02.069 --> 50:09.222
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

50:15.113 --> 50:17.639
When you start developing higher and
higher,

50:17.840 --> 50:23.985
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

50:31.088 --> 50:34.458
You may not have any interest in many
things

50:34.659 --> 50:42.178
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

50:47.394 --> 50:53.923
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

51:00.282 --> 51:09.453
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

51:15.923 --> 51:22.333
So you become the master of your brain

51:23.462 --> 51:28.631
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

51:30.603 --> 51:36.572
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

51:36.773 --> 51:42.489
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

51:47.641 --> 51:51.943
And the light of that expands

51:53.001 --> 51:58.131
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

52:01.348 --> 52:05.483
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

52:05.684 --> 52:09.852
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

52:10.053 --> 52:17.722
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

52:28.795 --> 52:37.238
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

52:42.097 --> 52:46.616
their obstinacy

52:46.817 --> 52:52.667
and childish pranks.

52:56.690 --> 52:59.934
Let the man rise

53:01.414 --> 53:07.610
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

53:10.881 --> 53:19.126
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

53:29.758 --> 53:40.677
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

53:40.886 --> 53:47.458
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

53:57.115 --> 54:01.093
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

54:01.294 --> 54:06.191
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

54:16.651 --> 54:20.661
That is what is your job,

54:22.678 --> 54:28.302
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

54:32.581 --> 54:40.895
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

54:41.096 --> 54:49.811
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

55:03.486 --> 55:07.728
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

55:07.929 --> 55:13.641
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

55:13.842 --> 55:21.146
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

55:33.584 --> 55:37.376
neglected by all the deities,

55:38.735 --> 55:44.406
because human beings really went very
wrong.

55:49.780 --> 55:57.914
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

56:00.717 --> 56:05.057
because this is the attention,

56:08.059 --> 56:16.558
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

56:29.066 --> 56:35.636
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

56:39.558 --> 56:46.011
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

56:47.830 --> 56:51.508
and  towards the eternal life.

56:52.564 --> 56:56.935
Is [a] very important country,

56:58.128 --> 57:03.442
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

57:06.975 --> 57:13.754
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

57:18.605 --> 57:22.860
They have to change their methods

57:23.211 --> 57:25.719
and styles.

57:26.317 --> 57:30.422
They should be very mild, gentle

57:31.527 --> 57:34.967
and healthy people

57:37.223 --> 57:42.578
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

57:44.960 --> 57:48.680
so that when others see them

57:50.039 --> 57:53.589
[they] find that superiority in them.

57:57.463 --> 58:01.877
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

58:02.078 --> 58:05.070
I am very happy about you.

58:10.754 --> 58:14.143
May God bless you all.

58:15.066 --> 58:19.361
Now I bless all the other centres,

58:20.800 --> 58:24.711
who have prayed and are praying;

58:24.912 --> 58:30.422
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

58:31.551 --> 58:34.553
an enlightened one,

58:34.739 --> 58:39.751
that will separate them from their small
shells.

58:41.633 --> 58:45.979
Let them expand so much,

58:46.180 --> 58:52.946
that they become one with the whole.

58:53.147 --> 58:56.281
May God bless you all.

59:03.092 --> 59:06.266
May God bless you.

59:06.787 --> 59:09.692
Good (…)
