1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,386
We have to seek the eternal. 

2
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:12,581
We have to seek\hthe eternal and the transitory is to be used in moderation

3
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:18,221
in its own limitation and in its\h
full understanding.

4
00:00:18,348 --> 00:00:26,499
Today's problems of ecology, this, that, all these things come from\hhuman error

5
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:34,357
and the human error is because they have not found out the eternal.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,400
When you find\hout the eternal, then you become a balanced personality.\h\h

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,527
Absolutely a balanced personality.

8
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:50,267
And\hthe balance comes from Divine wisdom.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,832
All the problems today are because human beings\h
are not at that level of self-knowledge. 

10
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:09,419
Because\hhuman beings are still relatively living.

11
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:14,222
One person thinks, "This is good".\h
Another thinks, "This is good".

12
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,362
And that's how we\h\hexploit each other, we exploit the nature,

13
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:22,996
we create\hproblems and everything repels on us, 

14
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:33,128
because transitory things as you know are transitory\h
because they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

15
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,903
They get destroyed and gradually\h
we learn from them how to destroy.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,599
But human beings are the epitome of\h
evolution.

17
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:56,304
God has created human beings as the highest creation.

18
00:01:56,988 --> 00:02:03,855
Maybe we have\hbeen given
 freedom, a complete freedom\hto choose.

19
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:10,080
If we want to go to heaven, we\hcan go. 
If we want to go to hell, we can go.\h\h

20
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,956
So, this Freedom we have been acting on,

21
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:18,988
we can say,\has trial and error
 error and trial,  

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:29,491
and ultimately, a stage has to reach where we start thinking, \h
"What mistake did we commit?"

23
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,430
"Where did we go wrong?"\h

24
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:41,579
And there we have to realize that 
the eternal, we have not sought. 

25
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:47,194
We see this miracle, 
say, of flowers.

26
00:02:47,355 --> 00:02:51,741
We see the flowers how beautiful they are,

27
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:58,193
created by\hnature.
We can't create even one of them\h\h

28
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,563
Spontaneously, they appear according to\h
the different categories they belong\hto.\h

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,293
The choice, such a big choice!

30
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:19,526
All this and many other such living things are done by this Divine power.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,971
But we take it for granted. We just take\h
it for granted.

32
00:03:25,132 --> 00:03:34,363
And the greatest thing that has happened is that today human beings are brought\h
to this level

33
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:40,469
that now they have become divine computers.

34
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:44,310
They can become divine computers.

35
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:47,586
It’s a very beautiful thing that is ahead of us.

36
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:54,629
Only thing, we should know that we have to grow into that new awareness.

37
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:59,788
This is called as the one that we call knowledge.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,584
Knowledge is not mental knowledge, by reading you do not become. 

39
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,015
Kabira once said that by reading too much the great learned people have become stupid.

40
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,540
First, I used to think, "How can that be?"

41
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,254
"Pari, pari\hpandita moorakha bhaiye".

42
00:04:17,254 --> 00:04:21,086
I used to think, "By reading, how can people become stupid?"

43
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:27,975
The thing is, when you read all others are in your head, but you are not there. 

44
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,866
And this is, I find today, that we think by reading we’ll become the knowledge. 

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,951
Knowledge will be, but that’s not an absolute knowledge, that’s not. 

46
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:46,848
That is a relative knowledge to get to the\h\habsolute knowledge you have to become something.

47
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,911
You have to become the Spirit. 

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,456
And once you become the Spirit, this knowledge is just manifested. 

49
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:58,886
It can be manifested even in a little child.

50
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:05,191
And a child can know. It’s a subjective knowledge, you can say, but absolute. 

51
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,782
It is not arbitrary, it’s collective. 

52
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,686
You put ten children who are Realized and ask them, "What’s wrong with this person?" 

53
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,978
Immediately they’ll raise the same finger.

54
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:21,134
This is the thing. Now ask that person, 

55
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:26,302
"Something wrong with your throat? Are you suffering from some trouble?" 

56
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,668
He’ll say, “Yes, how do you know?” These children are telling me.\h

57
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:37,542
So, only the decoding is needed afterwards that, "What’s wrong with you? What finger is burning? 

58
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:41,773
What is the problem and what does it relate to? 

59
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:45,394
You have to just know how to correct it. 

60
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:50,902
And once you know the art of correcting it, you can correct and you can perfect it. 

61
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,903
It’s very easy to master this art.

62
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:57,670
Of course, you must know you can’t pay for anything like this.

63
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:03,250
How much did we pay\hto the Mother Earth when she sprouted the seeds?

64
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,315
If it’s a living process you don’t pay for anything.

65
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,688
Living processes do not understand money. 

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:20,098
How can you pay for these flowers when you have to pay to the Mother Earth?

67
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:23,401
Of course, you can pay to the florist – that’s a different point.

68
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:25,744
But to the Mother Earth, you cannot pay. 

69
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,562
She does all the job without any payment.

70
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:34,828
In the same way, this is a living process and you must know that you cannot pay for it.

71
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,939
Anybody who says that “I’m doing God’s work,

72
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:44,718
I’m doing this work for the emancipation of your soul,” and all that, and takes money,

73
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,732
tell him that he should redeem his own soul first. 

74
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:54,194
You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in the effort also, 

75
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:58,081
because it is a spontaneous thing. 

76
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,988
'Sahaja' means: 'saha' with, 'ja' born with you

77
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:07,889
– is the right of this union with the Divine, is the Yoga.

78
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,148
For this you cannot pay, nor can you command, nor can you demand. 

79
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:20,816
You cannot ask – it just works. So, it’s so simple. 

80
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,460
Now some people say, “Mother, how can it be so simple?” 

81
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,670
Anything that is vital, isn’t it simple?

82
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,947
As soon as we are born, we know how to breathe. 

83
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:35,274
Who teaches us how to breathe? Automatically we start breathing.

84
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,450
Anything that is important has to be simple, cannot be complicated.
