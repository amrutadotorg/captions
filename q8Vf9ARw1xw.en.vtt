WEBVTT

04:07.658 --> 04:14.188
Yesterday was such a nice time we had together,
and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think.

04:14.188 --> 04:25.947
I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely
going in a tempest.

04:25.947 --> 04:35.308
We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja,
I think, only yesterday: it’s to feel the

04:35.308 --> 04:37.828
joy of God’s love.

04:37.828 --> 04:56.738
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali”
means the “rows of lights”.

04:56.738 --> 05:11.078
It was celebrated firstly because thousands
of years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this

05:11.078 --> 05:12.407
day.

05:12.407 --> 05:23.438
That means the benevolence of human beings
was crowned, was accepted.

05:23.438 --> 05:37.578
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal
personality being shown to be a king, to be

05:37.578 --> 05:47.378
the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

05:47.378 --> 05:55.828
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent
king was crowned.

05:55.828 --> 06:03.107
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

06:03.107 --> 06:22.147
That’s only possible if
the people who choose the king have no other

06:22.147 --> 06:33.818
consideration but that of benevolence of all
the people.

06:33.818 --> 06:44.378
So one has to come to the conclusion that
they have to be Sahaja Yogis, because other

06:44.378 --> 06:50.688
think that: “How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

06:50.688 --> 06:55.128
Some think: “How much power-oriented we
could be?”

06:55.128 --> 07:07.147
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”
or any other domination.

07:07.147 --> 07:12.677
So we’ve got two types of theories: as we
see, is one is communism and another is democracy,

07:12.677 --> 07:20.018
where one is power-oriented, the another is
money-oriented, and in both the cases we say

07:20.018 --> 07:22.227
that it’s all failed.

07:22.227 --> 07:30.228
And it’s a good news for all of you to know
that Russia, which was a country known to

07:30.228 --> 07:40.228
be run in complete fear, has turned out to
be the best for Sahaja Yoga.

07:40.228 --> 07:44.438
It is one of the super powers.

07:44.438 --> 07:58.778
When the government is like that, I think
the people are better.

07:58.778 --> 08:06.258
They do not have these false notions of individual
freedom.

08:06.258 --> 08:09.898
They do not think that: “Ah, what’s wrong?”

08:09.898 --> 08:14.498
I told them: “You must put oil on in your
head because you’ll become bald."

08:14.498 --> 08:19.128
Next day all of them were done with the oil,
nothing doing.

08:19.128 --> 08:32.338
So the kind of obedience they had, from very
beginning of their country, that sense of

08:32.338 --> 08:38.068
obedience is so great, you tell them anything,
immediately they do it.

08:38.068 --> 08:42.478
Not one, thousands.

08:42.478 --> 08:47.438
One thousand were sitting in the hall; two
thousand were outside waiting for Me, on a

08:47.438 --> 08:50.728
follow-on.

08:50.728 --> 08:53.348
Imagine how wise and deep they are?

08:53.348 --> 08:59.228
While in the West we are lost in our so-called
freedom idea of so-called freedom: “What’s

08:59.228 --> 09:00.228
wrong?”

09:00.228 --> 09:04.278
But actually we are slaves, if you see.

09:04.278 --> 09:09.458
Any fashion that starts, everybody starts
doing it.

09:09.458 --> 09:11.058
But why?

09:11.058 --> 09:12.917
Why do we follow those fashions?

09:12.917 --> 09:15.227
We must see how we are slaves.

09:15.227 --> 09:18.387
Because others will laugh at us if we don’t
do like that.

09:18.387 --> 09:20.238
They’ll make fun of us.

09:20.238 --> 09:22.957
Because they will criticize us.

09:22.957 --> 09:29.908
So because they have got a freedom to criticize,
we are frightened of such people who can criticize.

09:29.908 --> 09:35.288
And now the criticizing people are criticizing
them.

09:35.288 --> 09:40.038
Critics have critics, their critics are there,
there are other critics, and there are critics

09:40.038 --> 09:41.077
after critics.

09:41.077 --> 09:42.758
So only the critics are produced.

09:42.758 --> 09:43.827
Where is the benevolence?

09:43.827 --> 09:46.737
There’s no question of benevolence at all.

09:46.737 --> 09:59.207
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed
to be free, the idea of benevolence is finished.

09:59.207 --> 10:05.148
Because whatever good for you, whatever is
benevolent for you, can be only understood

10:05.148 --> 10:08.237
if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

10:08.237 --> 10:13.878
But if you have this kind of freedom is to
go amuck, do what you like: “Because everybody’s

10:13.878 --> 10:16.808
doing it, I must do it.

10:16.808 --> 10:21.737
Everybody is singing like this; so I must
do it."

10:21.737 --> 10:27.167
But from where does this idea come in?

10:27.167 --> 10:33.749
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs
who want to befool you, make slaves out of

10:33.749 --> 10:39.427
you, and this slavery is so-called freedom
for you.

10:39.427 --> 10:44.598
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery
because you do what they tell you, behave

10:44.598 --> 10:49.177
in the same manner as whatever they say.

10:49.177 --> 10:54.038
There are no fashions in that country, very
few, very few women indulge into fashions.

10:54.038 --> 10:55.038
Nothing.

10:55.038 --> 10:56.348
And men are also very simple.

10:56.348 --> 10:59.908
They have no fashionable things.

10:59.908 --> 11:06.808
They have only things which are convenient,
good for their climate.

11:06.808 --> 11:13.288
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh
or don’t laugh.

11:13.288 --> 11:16.237
It’s everybody laughs here.

11:16.237 --> 11:22.887
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This
is stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him,

11:22.887 --> 11:23.957
that’s all."

11:23.957 --> 11:32.978
So one has to understand that it was the king,
Rama, who was made the, actually accepted

11:32.978 --> 11:40.927
by the public, like a crown was put on his
head to say that benevolence is the highest

11:40.927 --> 11:41.927
thing.

11:41.927 --> 11:50.628
And whatever is benevolent for us should be
accepted in our freedom, if we are really

11:50.628 --> 11:53.418
a free country.

11:53.418 --> 11:59.348
But if we are not free inside, we are bound
by what people will say; they’ll criticize

11:59.348 --> 12:00.348
us.

12:00.348 --> 12:05.358
Do you know as a result of that, there is
no art in this country [Italy]?

12:05.358 --> 12:09.008
But I saw lot of art growing in Russia.

12:09.008 --> 12:16.768
Because any art you produce is criticized,
so people have to be careful: “This should

12:16.768 --> 12:20.148
not be so much, little this, little that."

12:20.148 --> 12:22.608
Nobody can produce any art there.

12:22.608 --> 12:27.588
Any musician is there is criticized in these
countries.

12:27.588 --> 12:31.738
There if you go, the musicians are tremendous
musicians.

12:31.738 --> 12:41.048
They have of a very high quality musicians
there, very high quality of dramatist, not

12:41.048 --> 12:43.018
at all boring as they are here.

12:43.018 --> 12:51.258
If you go any play in England, it’s so boring
that you feel like running away from there,

12:51.258 --> 12:53.978
extremely boring.

12:53.978 --> 12:58.708
There was a play, we went to see, it was called
as “Star Express” or “Express Star”

12:58.708 --> 12:59.708
or something.

12:59.708 --> 13:04.198
There was nothing, except on the wheels they
were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar.

13:04.198 --> 13:09.828
Nothing there ! So anybody would go mad with
it, I tell you.

13:09.828 --> 13:11.668
We were there hardly for fifteen minutes,
came out with a headache.

13:11.668 --> 13:15.408
We didn’t know where to go.

13:15.408 --> 13:19.328
So with this kind of criticism that we have,
it’s only freedom we have is to criticize

13:19.328 --> 13:23.158
other, make fun of others, react to others.

13:23.158 --> 13:31.418
How can you enjoy?

13:31.418 --> 13:37.418
To enjoy others first of all you must accept
the goodness of other people, not mentally,

13:37.418 --> 13:39.427
from your heart.

13:39.427 --> 13:48.648
And that will bring the benevolence on this
country of ours which we call the Kingdom

13:48.648 --> 13:52.937
of God.

13:52.937 --> 14:02.747
Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura
was killed.

14:02.747 --> 14:14.708
Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil
from the Hell, they say: very cunning, very

14:14.708 --> 14:20.288
clever, and he was killed by the Goddess.

14:20.288 --> 14:31.247
Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation,
Kartikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power

14:31.247 --> 14:32.858
to kill.

14:32.858 --> 14:40.278
So when he was killed it was celebrated because
the evil was killed, but we don’t find that,

14:40.278 --> 14:47.038
these days the evil people are getting peace
awards.

14:47.038 --> 14:52.418
So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted
brain?

14:52.418 --> 14:56.278
How is it they are using perversion?

14:56.278 --> 15:00.048
Just the opposite of it.

15:00.048 --> 15:09.468
What has worked out these things, so again
we find the same so-called freedom to become

15:09.468 --> 15:14.317
also evil.

15:14.317 --> 15:16.778
So we have freedom to become evil.

15:16.778 --> 15:25.737
First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent,
and secondly to become evil we have freedom.

15:25.737 --> 15:32.138
So the Narakasura within us must be killed,
the one which teaches us evil, to do evil

15:32.138 --> 15:33.398
to others.

15:33.398 --> 15:39.877
If you are busy doing evil to others, you
can never enjoy.

15:39.877 --> 15:46.747
Because you enjoy doing evil to others.

15:46.747 --> 15:50.958
So that has to be faced within ourselves,
not in other people.

15:50.958 --> 15:58.528
It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi
is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that,

15:58.528 --> 16:00.858
but very difficult to say: “Mother, I am
caught up.

16:00.858 --> 16:06.057
I have got this problem within myself."

16:06.057 --> 16:10.237
So when you start seeing yourself your heart
opens out.

16:10.237 --> 16:16.478
Unless and until you learn how to open out
your heart how can you enjoy?

16:16.478 --> 16:19.338
Open your heart.

16:19.338 --> 16:21.867
Many people live on very superficial level.

16:21.867 --> 16:25.498
All right, some of them might say that: “I
am possessed, Mother.

16:25.498 --> 16:27.268
I’ve got this possession."

16:27.268 --> 16:28.268
Why?

16:28.268 --> 16:31.768
“I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning."

16:31.768 --> 16:32.968
But why?

16:32.968 --> 16:38.528
You don’t want to enjoy.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.838
So watch yourself, see for yourself.

16:40.838 --> 16:43.148
This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll
put you right."

16:43.148 --> 16:44.148
See in the mirror.

16:44.148 --> 16:48.617
Tell yourself: “This kind of a useless conditioning
I’ve got it from where?

16:48.617 --> 16:51.398
Because I’m Indian, because I’m French,
because of English."

16:51.398 --> 16:57.388
Open the heart.

16:57.388 --> 17:03.288
And opening the heart is only possible if
Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed,

17:03.288 --> 17:06.088
finished, once for all.

17:06.088 --> 17:12.377
In small, small things there is joy.

17:12.377 --> 17:17.728
In very little things also there’s a ripple
of joy.

17:17.728 --> 17:20.558
If you are sensitive you can catch it.

17:20.558 --> 17:22.948
And why not enjoy?

17:22.948 --> 17:31.898
Why to have these stupid conditioning on our
heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy?

17:31.898 --> 17:38.567
Enjoyment is only possible if you take out
this one sitting on your heart.

17:38.567 --> 17:47.937
So, that is the second part of the Diwali
that you have to open your heart.

17:47.937 --> 17:53.478
Forget your nationality, forget your race,
forget everything.

17:53.478 --> 17:57.128
It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis
have.

17:57.128 --> 18:03.997
They must be respected, they must be treated
like this, or maybe that we are something

18:03.997 --> 18:06.408
great and they are no good.

18:06.408 --> 18:12.997
If you cannot mix up with the collective,
something’s wrong with you.

18:12.997 --> 18:13.997
Nothing wrong with others.

18:13.997 --> 18:19.067
Easy to find faults with others.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.228
But what’s the use?

18:20.228 --> 18:24.638
If you start finding faults with others you
do not become clean.

18:24.638 --> 18:28.638
Supposing I find that your clothes are not
clean.

18:28.638 --> 18:33.148
My clothes are not going to get clean by that,
are they?

18:33.148 --> 18:39.008
It’s so practical and simple it is that
we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with

18:39.008 --> 18:47.408
us, and improve ourselves, so that we can
really, really, from our heart, enjoy.

18:47.408 --> 18:53.758
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the
Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi.

18:53.758 --> 18:58.817
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of
Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

18:58.817 --> 19:05.328
And it was so that She came out of the water.

19:05.328 --> 19:14.567
Through the water, She came out so clean.

19:14.567 --> 19:25.198
And She has no pride.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.148
She doesn’t assert Herself.

19:27.148 --> 19:31.348
She doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

19:31.348 --> 19:36.797
But human beings are just opposite if they
have money, they ride on a horse all the time,

19:36.797 --> 19:38.208
they cannot come down.

19:38.208 --> 19:42.908
It’s impossible to talk to them.

19:42.908 --> 19:51.408
So a person who has money is not the one who
is worshipping Lakshmi, who is not a “Lakshmi

19:51.408 --> 19:54.328
pati” as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.047
Because She stands only on a lotus.

19:56.047 --> 19:59.418
Can you imagine how light She must be to stand
on a lotus?

19:59.418 --> 20:04.187
She has a big body, everything is there, but
She stands on a lotus.

20:04.187 --> 20:10.518
That She takes all Her weight within Herself,
She just sucks in Her weight as Shri Krishna

20:10.518 --> 20:11.698
has described.

20:11.698 --> 20:18.448
That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside
his body, in the same way, we have to suck

20:18.448 --> 20:29.988
in all the weight of money, weight of your
positions, weight of your so-called education,

20:29.988 --> 20:36.377
weight of some aristocratic family you are
born of.

20:36.377 --> 20:48.148
This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy
person, to go down very fast.

20:48.148 --> 20:53.928
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the
lotus.

20:53.928 --> 21:01.928
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,
that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the

21:01.928 --> 21:04.348
lotus, nothing.

21:04.348 --> 21:08.878
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

21:08.878 --> 21:13.088
Unless and until you have balance you cannot
stand on a lotus.

21:13.088 --> 21:15.097
So She is so balanced.

21:15.097 --> 21:21.138
Her center of gravity is so balanced that
She cannot topple down.

21:21.138 --> 21:27.168
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them:
“How are you?”

21:27.168 --> 21:33.258
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means just
ok] Ten years have passed, sometimes like

21:33.258 --> 21:34.258
this also.

21:34.258 --> 21:39.138
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means you are
up side down]

21:39.138 --> 21:40.138
[Laughter]
Why?

21:40.138 --> 21:47.528
Because you must be grounded in the Mother
Earth, into the practical side of it.

21:47.528 --> 21:55.638
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging
in the air, but we are grounded in the Mother

21:55.638 --> 21:57.888
Earth.

21:57.888 --> 22:06.008
And the slightest thing happens to us, again
we come back to our balance.

22:06.008 --> 22:10.457
So this is Her position when She stands up
in a lotus.

22:10.457 --> 22:16.018
Now She has a hand, one hand like this [which
gives], one hand like this [which protects],

22:16.018 --> 22:19.587
and there are two hands which have got again
the lotuses, the pink ones.

22:19.587 --> 22:25.548
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is Her fragrance
I think is spread on the sky.

22:25.548 --> 22:40.008
And She is pink, pink because that shows that
Her house, Her nature is pink, pink is inviting,

22:40.008 --> 22:42.178
is loving.

22:42.178 --> 22:53.618
She is a very fond hostess, that She wants
everybody to come in, in Her house.

22:53.618 --> 23:00.548
But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten
dogs outside and nobody can come inside the

23:00.548 --> 23:02.088
house.

23:02.088 --> 23:05.518
Only the dogs and he lives.

23:05.518 --> 23:08.378
He can’t live with human beings.

23:08.378 --> 23:15.768
So the house is closed, the doors are closed,
everything’s closed, money is closed permanently.

23:15.768 --> 23:23.577
So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi
pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati.

23:23.577 --> 23:31.288
Because he must have a cozy, beautiful – cozy,
again I say, cozy house.

23:31.288 --> 23:37.808
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital,
anything drops, you feel frightened: “Oh,

23:37.808 --> 23:38.898
my God."

23:38.898 --> 23:41.618
Then you’ll pick it up.

23:41.618 --> 23:44.488
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable.

23:44.488 --> 23:50.378
It’s all right, in the house, in the home,
if somebody comes and stays.

23:50.378 --> 23:54.548
Then it’s little bit this here and there,
doesn’t matter, then you put it right, but

23:54.548 --> 23:57.337
that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

23:57.337 --> 24:03.748
It should not be taken as a lousy house, but
a house which is inviting.

24:03.748 --> 24:09.538
When people come in, you give them a place
to sit down and make them enjoy.

24:09.538 --> 24:11.678
It’s not done, in India at least.

24:11.678 --> 24:16.588
I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting
westernized, that anybody drops something

24:16.588 --> 24:21.368
on the carpet we’ll never clean it in their
presence because it’s very bad manners.

24:21.368 --> 24:25.508
Carpet is not important than the guest, is
it?

24:25.508 --> 24:33.078
Or if we break something, say, a glass, then
we say: “Very good, it’s something has

24:33.078 --> 24:34.078
gone out, some bad thing has gone out."

24:34.078 --> 24:40.717
Or a thermometer is broken we say the same
thing.

24:40.717 --> 24:56.508
All these things happen, in a way, just to
see how far we are open-hearted or to suggest

24:56.508 --> 25:01.028
to you that something is going wrong.

25:01.028 --> 25:06.478
If something falls off just see what’s going
on in your brain.

25:06.478 --> 25:07.658
What are you thinking?

25:07.658 --> 25:13.520
Is there something funny you are thinking
about somebody or something wrong you are

25:13.520 --> 25:14.520
thinking?

25:14.520 --> 25:17.358
Then it’s up to you.

25:17.358 --> 25:21.348
Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth.

25:21.348 --> 25:27.048
So, another conditioning we have, which is
a very, very funny conditioning, either we’ll

25:27.048 --> 25:34.888
have the lousiest of lousiest houses or we’ll
have houses which will just look like hospitals,

25:34.888 --> 25:38.788
even a rat would not enter there, leave alone
human beings.

25:38.788 --> 25:43.158
They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll
polish everything.

25:43.158 --> 25:46.398
Husband, wife will fight on that.

25:46.398 --> 25:50.067
They’ll have divorces for it.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.447
But not even a rat will enter that house.

25:52.447 --> 25:55.188
I have seen many houses like that.

25:55.188 --> 25:59.488
And I’ve seen the other way round also:
those that are lousiest, where there’s no

25:59.488 --> 26:04.108
garden, there are no flowers, nothing beautiful.

26:04.108 --> 26:15.298
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that
extreme, but something that will give joy

26:15.298 --> 26:20.778
to others, to visitors, to people who come
to your house, we’ll soothe the sick.

26:20.778 --> 26:25.758
People should feel happy to come to your house.

26:25.758 --> 26:31.508
So there’s no showing off.

26:31.508 --> 26:38.658
Not to show off but to make them comfortable
and very happy.

26:38.658 --> 26:44.158
You can do lots of things, very interesting
things, if you have the Lakshmi principle

26:44.158 --> 26:45.158
in you.

26:45.158 --> 26:47.278
I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman.

26:47.278 --> 26:52.587
He had a very beautiful house, everything,
and he was so interesting.

26:52.587 --> 26:57.358
He had made the house very interestingly,
very nice, very beautiful.

26:57.358 --> 27:02.337
And you didn’t feel any aggression at all
in that house.

27:02.337 --> 27:11.798
So, I saw his dining room done with very good,
beautiful, green marble and white lights.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.768
I said: “Must be quite expensive."

27:15.768 --> 27:17.058
“No, that’s the beauty.

27:17.058 --> 27:18.058
It’s very cheap.

27:18.058 --> 27:19.058
You know how I did it cheaply."

27:19.058 --> 27:26.067
All the time he was telling Me how he did
things cheaply, means he has never shown off

27:26.067 --> 27:27.067
it’s expensive.

27:27.067 --> 27:30.697
But a person who’s aggressive will say:
“Oh, you know, this one I got it for so

27:30.697 --> 27:33.648
much, so much, so much."

27:33.648 --> 27:37.498
But a person who wants to give you joy will
say: “No, I tell you it’s so cheap, you

27:37.498 --> 27:40.228
won’t believe what a sum."

27:40.228 --> 27:46.048
That’s the sign of a person who wants to
give joy to his guests.

27:46.048 --> 27:51.817
He’ll never try to say that: “It’s very
expensive, I spent so much money, this is

27:51.817 --> 27:53.188
so, this that."

27:53.188 --> 27:55.888
This is showing off.

27:55.888 --> 27:58.308
And then ultimately you’d say: “It’s
very good,” three times.

27:58.308 --> 27:59.467
“Then it’s yours.

27:59.467 --> 28:00.467
Have it."

28:00.467 --> 28:01.467
Of course he can’t give you the floor.

28:01.467 --> 28:05.628
The rest of it you can take.

28:05.628 --> 28:11.138
That’s, that’s what it is a personality
which is joy-giving.

28:11.138 --> 28:21.128
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also,
a beetle comes, a black beetle with horrible

28:21.128 --> 28:29.248
thorny legs, and enters into this lotus for
a sleeping in the night, you see.

28:29.248 --> 28:36.898
And the lotus closes down its cosiness on
it and sleeps very comfortably.

28:36.898 --> 28:41.937
And then next day it opens out, so it flies
out.

28:41.937 --> 28:49.358
That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your
hearts should be.

28:49.358 --> 28:58.508
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing
and that comforting feeling, when they are

28:58.508 --> 29:00.428
in your company.

29:00.428 --> 29:02.248
But not a person who was reactionary.

29:02.248 --> 29:06.858
Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately
say: “I don’t like this carpet."

29:06.858 --> 29:13.368
See, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners
to say like that, to say that: “I don’t

29:13.368 --> 29:17.368
like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja
Yoga.

29:17.368 --> 29:22.758
Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician
who could be of a very high level, could be

29:22.758 --> 29:29.018
of a very ordinary level, you should be able
to enjoy everything; otherwise you are not

29:29.018 --> 29:30.518
a Sahaja Yogi.

29:30.518 --> 29:34.947
If you are going to criticize a musician that:
“Oh, God, what a musician.

29:34.947 --> 29:39.198
He’s no good this, that” then he’s not
going to improve.

29:39.198 --> 29:44.768
But if you encourage the musician: “Oh,
you are very good.

29:44.768 --> 29:47.368
You are very great,” he’ll play much better
next time; you’ll see that.

29:47.368 --> 29:51.687
There’s no falsehood about it.

29:51.687 --> 29:55.608
Some people think it’s not honest.

29:55.608 --> 30:04.508
But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal
kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga.

30:04.508 --> 30:06.358
You be honest to yourself.

30:06.358 --> 30:12.728
And there’s no need to tell anybody your
opinion very honestly.

30:12.728 --> 30:18.138
Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions,
and direct towards yourself.

30:18.138 --> 30:19.508
Like you see somebody.

30:19.508 --> 30:24.847
Now, honestly you want to tell him that he
is wearing a funny dress, honestly.

30:24.847 --> 30:33.088
You better look at yourself, what sort of
a dress you are wearing.

30:33.088 --> 30:36.138
And what business you have got to tell him
that he’s wearing funny?

30:36.138 --> 30:37.648
On the contrary, you say: “This is very
nice.

30:37.648 --> 30:38.648
I like it.

30:38.648 --> 30:39.648
It’s very nice.

30:39.648 --> 30:40.648
It’s good, good.

30:40.648 --> 30:41.648
Nice one."

30:41.648 --> 30:44.148
They’ll say: “No ” But he’ll say that:
“No, not so good.

30:44.148 --> 30:45.148
Yours is nice."

30:45.148 --> 30:47.778
“Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you
see, very cheaply.

30:47.778 --> 30:49.108
I’ll tell you from where.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.198
And you can have it if you like.

30:50.198 --> 30:51.658
I can take yours.

30:51.658 --> 30:53.518
You take mine."

30:53.518 --> 31:02.847
So the basic, subtle point is that, that with
your love, you are encouraging everyone, you

31:02.847 --> 31:14.868
are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence
in him, [in] his personality and a kind of

31:14.868 --> 31:18.108
a rapport which is very subtle.

31:18.108 --> 31:29.087
So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is
so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything,

31:29.087 --> 31:33.298
like as we see the world is today.

31:33.298 --> 31:39.638
But the lotus covers with his fragrance the
whole of that pond and covers it up completely

31:39.638 --> 31:42.077
and you forget the thing what is behind.

31:42.077 --> 31:48.097
It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves,
you see, like the ears of the elephant and

31:48.097 --> 31:50.888
that covers the whole thing.

31:50.888 --> 31:52.408
So you don’t see any filth or dirt.

31:52.408 --> 31:56.467
What you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves.

31:56.467 --> 32:02.518
Sometimes they are like a “tali”[plate],
like a big tali that we use for eating.

32:02.518 --> 32:09.118
And then all these things are covered with
you.

32:09.118 --> 32:11.288
There’s no honesty about it.

32:11.288 --> 32:18.687
They could say: “Why should we be honest,
let such say all the worms and the filth growing

32:18.687 --> 32:19.687
about?”

32:19.687 --> 32:29.067
But the honesty lies in honestly understanding
what is your job as Sahaja Yogi is.

32:29.067 --> 32:37.577
You are not there to point out the bad points
but you are there to cover all the bad points,

32:37.577 --> 32:40.238
all the loopholes, with your love.

32:40.238 --> 32:46.687
That’s your job, and there you have to be
honest.

32:46.687 --> 32:53.478
Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these
days, it has created only cheats and thugs

32:53.478 --> 32:58.608
and thieves.

32:58.608 --> 33:00.978
Even a thief can be won over.

33:00.978 --> 33:02.488
You can.

33:02.488 --> 33:05.158
I’ll give you an example.

33:05.158 --> 33:08.028
I met one boy in Delhi market.

33:08.028 --> 33:12.638
Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering
so I brought him in the car home.

33:12.638 --> 33:15.878
So in the family, My brother and My husband
both got very worried.

33:15.878 --> 33:18.378
He said: “Who is this brother-in-law you
have brought in?”

33:18.378 --> 33:20.118
I said: “He is My nephew.

33:20.118 --> 33:21.558
All right, let it be.

33:21.558 --> 33:23.878
Doesn’t matter, whatever you say, I’ll
keep him."

33:23.878 --> 33:25.298
So I looked after him.

33:25.298 --> 33:26.628
I treated him.

33:26.628 --> 33:28.398
He got all right.

33:28.398 --> 33:32.168
These two persons got after him: “We could
send him to the police, send him to the police,

33:32.168 --> 33:33.168
this.

33:33.168 --> 33:37.217
I said: “Let’s try now, let us see, he’s
a good man, he’ll be all right."

33:37.217 --> 33:38.217
“No, send him to the police."

33:38.217 --> 33:42.008
Might have been, I don’t know, might have
been.

33:42.008 --> 33:47.498
And they were after his life; till ten days
he was all right, I soothed him down.

33:47.498 --> 33:52.408
After tenth day, he was so fed up with these
two persons, he ran away.

33:52.408 --> 33:55.748
And he ran away, and he ran away with what,
do you know?

33:55.748 --> 34:02.258
He ran away with all the things that belonged
to My brother and My husband.

34:02.258 --> 34:06.148
And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything
nicely.

34:06.148 --> 34:11.668
[Laughter] He didn’t touch that; he didn’t
touch that.

34:11.668 --> 34:16.807
Shri Mataji to someone: Hello, see when I
am talking, don’t talk to each other.

34:16.807 --> 34:18.318
This is a new Sahaja Yogi?

34:18.318 --> 34:20.238
Tell him not to talk.

34:20.238 --> 34:22.338
When I’m talking don’t talk.

34:22.338 --> 34:24.918
That’s not the way.

34:24.918 --> 34:27.748
So he just ran away.

34:27.748 --> 34:31.658
And imagine, he left – I had a necklace,
a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace,

34:31.658 --> 34:35.587
I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t
touch it.

34:35.587 --> 34:41.618
He didn’t touch anything and he took away
whatever was possible from their purse, from

34:41.618 --> 34:45.638
their things, whatever were left, everything
he took away.

34:45.638 --> 34:48.638
“Now,” I said, “now go to the police."

34:48.638 --> 34:51.768
[Laughter] “Fine.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.328
What?”

34:53.328 --> 35:02.207
So, this is how one has to know that the honesty
is for yourself, not for others.

35:02.207 --> 35:05.688
Don’t try to be honest with others.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.238
Be honest to yourself.

35:08.238 --> 35:13.427
Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe
it’s rational and maybe that it is just

35:13.427 --> 35:17.898
a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt
others.

35:17.898 --> 35:22.538
So first check on your mind and find out if
you are trying to hurt others or you are trying

35:22.538 --> 35:23.538
to please others.

35:23.538 --> 35:26.548
Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet.

35:26.548 --> 35:32.288
If you are going to say something to please
others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk.

35:32.288 --> 35:40.678
And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice
things to others, how niceness comes to you.

35:40.678 --> 35:44.648
Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me
that: “Mother, he is very bad.

35:44.648 --> 35:48.807
He has troubled me so much, this thing, that
thing.

35:48.807 --> 35:51.528
I don’t like him,” so I tell him: “No,
no, he was praising you a lot."

35:51.528 --> 35:55.258
It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him.

35:55.258 --> 35:56.658
“He was praising you.

35:56.658 --> 35:58.177
He was so much in love with you.

35:58.177 --> 35:59.187
He’s so kind to you.

35:59.187 --> 36:01.467
He was telling Me he loves you very much."

36:01.467 --> 36:02.478
He said: “Really?”

36:02.478 --> 36:03.998
“Yeah, he did say."

36:03.998 --> 36:11.597
Next day you find them going together.

36:11.597 --> 36:16.738
So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s
very little, is left out, very little here

36:16.738 --> 36:17.738
and there.

36:17.738 --> 36:23.408
And some of them are really very superficial
but most of you have very little things left

36:23.408 --> 36:24.748
here and there.

36:24.748 --> 36:30.048
And only if you can watch that part you can
throw it away and you can really become very

36:30.048 --> 36:36.288
joyous people.

36:36.288 --> 36:46.388
Now there are some people who never smile,
who never laugh.

36:46.388 --> 36:49.038
So then you are allowed to tickle them.

36:49.038 --> 36:52.958
[Laughter] It’s absurd.

36:52.958 --> 37:01.697
It’s said that you have to be like children;
you have to be like children.

37:01.697 --> 37:04.398
You play with something, finished; then you
play with another, finished.

37:04.398 --> 37:05.398
You don’t get involved into anything.

37:05.398 --> 37:08.478
You don’t get attached to anything.

37:08.478 --> 37:14.217
Unless and until you’ve that child-like
heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

37:14.217 --> 37:15.217
It’s useless.

37:15.217 --> 37:20.538
You will be here for years together; you will
be useless, absolutely.

37:20.538 --> 37:24.058
Specially if you are coming from false gurus,
it’s very difficult.

37:24.058 --> 37:26.998
Because what I have known of false gurus,
they never laugh, never smile.

37:26.998 --> 37:28.338
They are very serious.

37:28.338 --> 37:31.668
Only take your money, keep on the backside.

37:31.668 --> 37:44.967
So it is important that we should be in a
very joyous mood, alert, aware, enjoying every

37:44.967 --> 37:46.718
bit of it.

37:46.718 --> 37:50.808
That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles
is.

37:50.808 --> 37:57.239
Now another thing is that, the suggestion
is of the left hand is like this, means She

37:57.239 --> 37:58.437
is giving.

37:58.437 --> 38:06.498
A person who has money must give, not to the
Pope, I never mean that, but must give to

38:06.498 --> 38:08.188
somebody who needs it.

38:08.188 --> 38:14.358
But so secretly that this [right] hand should
not know, is so far away, this one [right

38:14.358 --> 38:15.358
hand is up].

38:15.358 --> 38:17.628
This [left] hand should give, just secretly.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.638
Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to
anyone.

38:19.638 --> 38:24.918
I find it difficult, because I find it that
people will not like it.

38:24.918 --> 38:26.268
So there is a way of giving.

38:26.268 --> 38:30.008
There are so sweet ways of giving.

38:30.008 --> 38:34.848
Just try to notice what that person likes.

38:34.848 --> 38:39.468
Sometimes even children understand.

38:39.468 --> 38:41.978
Like I know, of My granddaughter.

38:41.978 --> 38:48.308
She said: “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even
have any good chappels.

38:48.308 --> 38:49.398
I feel so bad about it.

38:49.398 --> 38:50.398
But how to give him?

38:50.398 --> 38:51.908
He will not take money from me."

38:51.908 --> 38:54.178
So I said: “You do one thing.

38:54.178 --> 38:57.378
You go and do something to his chappel."

38:57.378 --> 39:00.898
So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels
more, you see.

39:00.898 --> 39:02.558
When they were walking together it broke.

39:02.558 --> 39:06.388
So she said: “Ah, see now, the chappels
are broken."

39:06.388 --> 39:07.738
She took him to a chappel shop and bought
him a chappel.

39:07.738 --> 39:09.998
He said: “But I have no money."

39:09.998 --> 39:11.368
“No, just take it.

39:11.368 --> 39:12.368
Just take it.

39:12.368 --> 39:13.368
It’s all right.

39:13.368 --> 39:16.728
Just, I’ll be very happy if you take."

39:16.728 --> 39:17.948
That’s how!

39:17.948 --> 39:24.218
It’s so sweet to hear and to do it, how
beautiful it must be!

39:24.218 --> 39:31.568
We like to hear everything, we want to see
in a film everything good, in a television,

39:31.568 --> 39:35.968
but when it comes to us we are different.

39:35.968 --> 39:41.938
When we see a mother-in-law torturing her
daughter-in-law, we always say: “Oh, look

39:41.938 --> 39:43.208
at her, how cruel she is."

39:43.208 --> 39:47.478
But we don’t want to see we are the same.

39:47.478 --> 39:51.528
So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga.

39:51.528 --> 39:53.938
Out of question!

39:53.938 --> 40:00.128
Nobody has to be cruel to anyone, nobody has
right to be cruel, whether they are leaders

40:00.128 --> 40:07.838
or non-leaders or anything they are, you have
no business anyway to be cruel to anyone,

40:07.838 --> 40:09.348
hurting anyone.

40:09.348 --> 40:13.818
We are not daggers, we are lotuses.

40:13.818 --> 40:20.898
Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with
a lotus.

40:20.898 --> 40:24.538
It’s such a delicate thing.

40:24.538 --> 40:29.338
But it can be only understood if you go deep
into it, into Sahaja Yoga, otherwise it cannot

40:29.338 --> 40:32.958
be understood.

40:32.958 --> 40:36.398
Now, a saint is a saint.

40:36.398 --> 40:39.398
He cannot become cruel, he cannot.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.098
There’s no need.

40:41.098 --> 40:48.138
What is the need to be cruel?

40:48.138 --> 40:52.908
So then with one hand there should be “daana”
[donation], means “giving”.

40:52.908 --> 40:56.258
Giving in a way that is secret.

40:56.258 --> 40:57.548
There’s no need to give Me anything.

40:57.548 --> 40:59.008
I’ve been telling you: “Don’t give Me
anything."

40:59.008 --> 41:00.008
I don’t want to take anything.

41:00.008 --> 41:03.048
If you give Me anything, gold and silver,
I’ll leave it here.

41:03.048 --> 41:04.558
I cannot take it.

41:04.558 --> 41:11.608
The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t
appreciate that you are loving Me, this thing,

41:11.608 --> 41:16.288
but a flower is sufficient for Me.

41:16.288 --> 41:19.128
But a person who needs something you must
give.

41:19.128 --> 41:25.618
I’m so self-contained, you know that very
well, that I can live anywhere, I can live

41:25.618 --> 41:30.458
on the street, I can live anywhere, I have
no problem, I can do without food, no problem.

41:30.458 --> 41:36.298
All right, in adoration you want to give Me
something, but I’ve been telling that: “Don’t

41:36.298 --> 41:37.298
give Me.

41:37.298 --> 41:39.308
If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll
leave it here.

41:39.308 --> 41:41.348
I will not take it."

41:41.348 --> 41:49.898
And we have now passed a law or regulation,
everything, but I hope you’ll listen to

41:49.898 --> 41:51.358
Me.

41:51.358 --> 41:59.358
So what is needed is the thing that we should
know what is the dearth of another person,

41:59.358 --> 42:00.358
what will he need?

42:00.358 --> 42:05.928
You need silver for Puja, all right, I’ll
give you silver, all right.

42:05.928 --> 42:12.398
But in such a sweet manner that you don’t
feel that Mother is giving us it.

42:12.398 --> 42:22.188
So there should be a feeling of giving at
the right time, at the best opportune moment,

42:22.188 --> 42:25.458
to give something.

42:25.458 --> 42:30.438
That is also one thing, just like a cameraman
knows when to click, in the same way you must

42:30.438 --> 42:33.178
know when to click when giving is concerned.

42:33.178 --> 42:48.408
When odd times if you give, it can be a very
hurting thing, the person can feel very hurt,

42:48.408 --> 42:51.368
if you give at the odd time to someone something.

42:51.368 --> 42:56.638
You have so many stories of that kind, like
Sudama’s is that thing, when he went to

42:56.638 --> 42:59.038
see Shri Krishna.

42:59.038 --> 43:03.838
And Shri Krishna took out his procession,
in the procession there were just taking out

43:03.838 --> 43:05.978
his bad eye with some pearls.

43:05.978 --> 43:10.348
So, Sudama said: “Let one pearl fall in
to my lap also."

43:10.348 --> 43:12.348
He was very poor.

43:12.348 --> 43:19.508
But when he went back, he saw his house was
made of gold by Shri Krishna.

43:19.508 --> 43:22.648
It was such a surprise!

43:22.648 --> 43:26.338
So that elevates the heart.

43:26.338 --> 43:28.188
So it should be elevating.

43:28.188 --> 43:37.368
It should not be sensational, but it should
be elevating, and that helps the person because,

43:37.368 --> 43:46.088
whatever you give for spiritual growth, is
the one that is the best thing that you can

43:46.088 --> 43:52.038
give to anyone, even in material things.

43:52.038 --> 43:59.898
Even in material things, you give something
in for spiritual growth.

43:59.898 --> 44:05.038
There are so many ways, if you want to think
about it, of giving someone something that,

44:05.038 --> 44:10.908
spiritually, he feels comforted, he feels
happy and joyous.

44:10.908 --> 44:16.758
Then another hand [right] is like this.

44:16.758 --> 44:24.160
This hand is showing that you have to protect,
you have to protect.

44:24.160 --> 44:29.628
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis, well some of them
who are very superficial join hands with non

44:29.628 --> 44:30.628
Sahaja Yogis.

44:30.628 --> 44:34.088
Immediately, you can make out the fraternity.

44:34.088 --> 44:39.528
If I see one woman going with another woman
whom I know is a bhootish one, I know that

44:39.528 --> 44:40.708
another must be.

44:40.708 --> 44:43.888
That’s how the combination always works.

44:43.888 --> 44:51.708
There’s a fraternity of good Sahaja Yogis
and a fraternity of bad Sahaja Yogis.

44:51.708 --> 44:57.998
So when you see this [right] hand is a protection
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

44:57.998 --> 45:02.528
We all have to protect each other, nobody
should touch you.

45:02.528 --> 45:06.328
Of course, I’m all the time worried about
your protection.

45:06.328 --> 45:11.928
If anybody comes and criticizes a Sahaja Yogi,
any one, he may be the Prime minister and

45:11.928 --> 45:14.648
things, I’ll stand by the Sahaja Yogis.

45:14.648 --> 45:18.958
I’ll go up to any court or anywhere and
I‘ll stand by that Sahaja Yogi.

45:18.958 --> 45:23.158
Even, he may be wrong, still I’ll I‘ll
stand by the Sahaja Yogi because his Spirit

45:23.158 --> 45:25.318
is there.

45:25.318 --> 45:28.628
So we have to protect.

45:28.628 --> 45:33.708
We have to protect our children, we have to
protect our wives, we have to protect our

45:33.708 --> 45:40.228
husbands, we have to protect anaraksha [unsure]
as they call it.

45:40.228 --> 45:46.438
Protect all the artists, protect all the people
who need protection in this world.

45:46.438 --> 45:49.468
So many people need protection from Sahaja
Yogis.

45:49.468 --> 45:55.738
Now see, the classical art is dying out, there
are having funny sort of modern art.

45:55.738 --> 46:00.078
I don’t mind if it is really modern in the
sense that they are evolved people and they

46:00.078 --> 46:02.558
are producing something of a spiritual value.

46:02.558 --> 46:06.598
But one line like that [horizontal] and one
line like that [vertical] makes a drawing

46:06.598 --> 46:07.598
or a painting.

46:07.598 --> 46:08.788
Don’t support such nonsense.

46:08.788 --> 46:12.408
Then poetry, which is wrong, should not be
supported.

46:12.408 --> 46:19.108
Or literature which is talking of filthy things,
ugly things, dirty things should never be

46:19.108 --> 46:20.218
protected.

46:20.218 --> 46:27.058
But whatever is good, whatever is beautiful
produced, created by any one, even by a child,

46:27.058 --> 46:32.008
must be protected.

46:32.008 --> 46:36.618
Like a politician who is a honest politician
is a good politician who is benevolent, he

46:36.618 --> 46:39.068
may not be a Sahaja Yogi, but he should be
protected.

46:39.068 --> 46:42.968
In your heart of hearts you should think:
“Mother, please protect this man."

46:42.968 --> 46:45.998
You must have feelings for them.

46:45.998 --> 46:51.248
So what we have to protect here is the goodness,
is the peace.

46:51.248 --> 46:57.498
That’s our duty, we have to protect.

46:57.498 --> 46:59.048
We should not say: “All right, why should
we care?

46:59.048 --> 47:00.358
He is not a Sahaja Yogi."

47:00.358 --> 47:02.668
No, but he is a good man.

47:02.668 --> 47:06.638
Whether he is a Sahaja Yogi or not doesn’t
matter, but he is a good man so we protect

47:06.638 --> 47:08.378
him because of his virtues.

47:08.378 --> 47:13.428
You must protect a person who is virtuous,
it’s very important.

47:13.428 --> 47:19.918
For his virtuous sake, you must protect him.

47:19.918 --> 47:24.818
And you should not be only limited among yourselves,
Sahaja Yogis, you are the protectors of the

47:24.818 --> 47:26.048
world!

47:26.048 --> 47:31.168
You are the kings of the world, think like
that.

47:31.168 --> 47:36.288
You have to worry about everything, what’s
happening here and what’s happening there.

47:36.288 --> 47:39.688
You must know every thing.

47:39.688 --> 47:43.168
So, some people say: “Mother says, don’t
see television."

47:43.168 --> 47:46.228
I do not say like that, absolutely.

47:46.228 --> 47:51.548
What I was saying, you must see what is happening
in the world.

47:51.548 --> 47:55.468
But all the time glued to the television,
your eyes will be spoiled, and see all dirty,

47:55.468 --> 47:56.758
filthy nonsense, there’s no need.

47:56.758 --> 47:58.058
Why should I tell you?

47:58.058 --> 48:00.638
You yourself will know.

48:00.638 --> 48:06.388
But you must see things, you must be informed,
well informed, specially the ladies must be

48:06.388 --> 48:07.838
very well informed.

48:07.838 --> 48:12.718
It’s very important, because what I found,
ladies in Sahaja Yoga, they come, they just

48:12.718 --> 48:14.918
jump in the sea, finish there, that’s not
the way.

48:14.918 --> 48:21.778
You must learn how to swim, you must know
how to make others also to swim, protect them,

48:21.778 --> 48:25.089
You must know every thing that’s going on
in this world where you are born.

48:25.089 --> 48:28.028
You’re not to be just excluded from there,
you must know everything.

48:28.028 --> 48:32.798
You ask Me, I’m a woman, I know everything
about every country, I know the problem.

48:32.798 --> 48:37.218
That’s how I can solve.

48:37.218 --> 48:43.468
In Colombia I went there, you know what has
happened now in Colombia.

48:43.468 --> 48:47.238
In Russia, everywhere, you have to put your
attention to all these things.

48:47.238 --> 48:54.718
Specially, the women must know they are shaktis
and they’re shaktis of love, of attention.

48:54.718 --> 49:04.028
So this protective speciality has to be with
us and we must know we are in charge.

49:04.028 --> 49:06.008
We are in charge of this world.

49:06.008 --> 49:10.018
We are in charge of the whole humanity; we
have to look after them.

49:10.018 --> 49:12.488
We are not limited Sahaja Yogis.

49:12.488 --> 49:14.298
We are unlimited.

49:14.298 --> 49:16.578
We are eternal beings.

49:16.578 --> 49:21.878
And take up that personality within yourself,
then only the Diwali is completed.

49:21.878 --> 49:26.318
You can’t have Diwali with something that
is short lived, you have to have something

49:26.318 --> 49:30.848
that’s burning for ever.

49:30.848 --> 49:37.158
So this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga is that
you become really a great personality.

49:37.158 --> 49:42.618
But, it’s not the end of it.

49:42.618 --> 49:45.888
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told
you.

49:45.888 --> 49:51.238
But once this Lakshmi principle covers you
up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

49:51.238 --> 49:59.048
is that you think of the world as a great
challenge to you, that you have to give them

49:59.048 --> 50:04.478
Mahlakshmi principle, that you have to give
them Realization.

50:04.478 --> 50:06.468
You have to raise them up.

50:06.468 --> 50:13.588
And this principle, once starts working in
the Mahalaksmi principle, then all the problems

50:13.588 --> 50:16.248
are your own.

50:16.248 --> 50:19.318
You have to start working it out.

50:19.318 --> 50:29.008
Change he attitude, is the best way I can
say towards all other things that we have

50:29.008 --> 50:31.708
to solve the problem, we are here to solve
the problem.

50:31.708 --> 50:37.138
Like, I’ve seen, it’s a very commun thing,
somebody comes out with problem, I tell them:

50:37.138 --> 50:38.138
“Do this."

50:38.138 --> 50:39.758
They’ll say: “But, in this this."

50:39.758 --> 50:40.758
“Then do that."

50:40.758 --> 50:42.058
“But in this, that."

50:42.058 --> 50:46.348
Like that they go on all the loops, false
loops, until I’ll say: “Now this is your

50:46.348 --> 50:47.348
problem, not Mine.

50:47.348 --> 50:53.138
I’m giving you hundred solutions and none
of them suits you."

50:53.138 --> 50:56.138
But here you should know you are the one who
has to solve the problem.

50:56.138 --> 50:57.728
It is your problem.

50:57.728 --> 50:58.850
The world is your problem.

50:58.850 --> 51:01.068
Why were you born at this time?

51:01.068 --> 51:05.888
Why did you get your Realization and why are
you Sahaja yogis?

51:05.888 --> 51:08.328
Just for name’s sake?

51:08.328 --> 51:14.378
So in every field you have to take a responsibility
to see what you can do.

51:14.378 --> 51:18.148
Supposing you are an architect, all right,
have designs made!

51:18.148 --> 51:20.978
Create designs, just try.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.508
I’ll help you.

51:22.508 --> 51:24.548
You are a musician?

51:24.548 --> 51:29.788
Then take up ways and methods of spreading
good music.

51:29.788 --> 51:35.078
If you are writer then write something interesting,
not boring, something interesting, something

51:35.078 --> 51:37.798
which will elevate people.

51:37.798 --> 51:44.218
If you are a government servant, all right,
try to show that you are acting for the government

51:44.218 --> 51:46.638
that is of a much higher level.

51:46.638 --> 51:50.838
And such a person will be respected, very
much respected.

51:50.838 --> 51:55.398
Everybody’s personality will grow, not that
you run away from somewhere because most of

51:55.398 --> 51:59.938
the people say that: “Mother, we get caught
up, this, that, you know."

51:59.938 --> 52:01.288
It depends on.

52:01.288 --> 52:06.248
Now I told you that I have to sometimes shake
hands with six hundred people who are sometimes

52:06.248 --> 52:07.698
absolutely drunk.

52:07.698 --> 52:13.568
So it’s all right; that’s My job.

52:13.568 --> 52:17.879
So we are not going to run away.

52:17.879 --> 52:22.058
We are covered with the protection of the
spirituality.

52:22.058 --> 52:31.478
If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna
nobody can touch you.

52:31.478 --> 52:39.778
So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you
get all the tatwas, all the principles, satisfied

52:39.778 --> 52:46.708
in you, fully, and also the Mahalakshmi principle
flows through your being.

52:46.708 --> 52:52.298
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable
people.

52:52.298 --> 52:53.908
Not to find faults.

52:53.908 --> 53:00.908
If you are finding faults, then know that
you are not Sahaja Yogis.

53:00.908 --> 53:05.138
If you are trying to control others, then
know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

53:05.138 --> 53:10.048
Even the leaders, I would say, should never
try to control.

53:10.048 --> 53:15.668
They must know how the principle is working
in the silence; see for themselves how it

53:15.668 --> 53:17.118
is working.

53:17.118 --> 53:22.638
It’s a trick you must learn.

53:22.638 --> 53:24.838
Of course, little correction is needed.

53:24.838 --> 53:28.258
That time you correct the person, at that
time, doesn’t matter.

53:28.258 --> 53:34.948
But you must know how the whole principle
of benevolence is working itself.

53:34.948 --> 53:39.948
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence
part; you must know that.

53:39.948 --> 53:49.048
As I’ve told you before also, you have to
be like the sea which receives all the rivers

53:49.048 --> 53:50.048
into it.

53:50.048 --> 53:53.248
If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive
anything.

53:53.248 --> 54:01.638
So you have to be like a sea to receive everything
and you have to be at the height.

54:01.638 --> 54:09.258
As I told you the other day, the same way,
that very close to the sea there should be

54:09.258 --> 54:12.358
a personality which is above everything else.

54:12.368 --> 54:17.578
Such a beautiful personality you should have,
is the depth of the sea and the height of

54:17.568 --> 54:19.228
the Kailasha.

54:19.228 --> 54:21.338
May God bless you all.
