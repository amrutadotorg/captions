00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:30.650
I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:41.370
bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:52.610
Today they have decided that I should give
you a general idea about Sahaja Yoga and after

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:07.149
that on Monday and Tuesday I’ll speak to
you about all the details of the mechanism.

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:18.050
I have come to America to give you a great
message of the salvation of human beings.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.000
Everybody is trying to frighten us that there
is going to be a doomsday and we are all going

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.720
to be doomed.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.099
But the one who has created this universe
has some worry about His creation also and

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.270
that He is not going to allow this creation
to be destroyed.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.180
Not only that but He is extremely anxious
that this creation should be saved, that human

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.010
beings must be saved and they should enter
into the kingdom of God to enjoy the realm,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.610
the glory and the blessings of their Father,
the God.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:14.080
It is hard to believe in those days of turmoil
that any such thing can happen to us.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.480
But perhaps we are not aware that we are fantastically
made great instruments of God’s powers.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.420
The only thing needed is that we should be
put to the mains.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.170
Unless and until we have connected to Him
we do not understand the value of this instrument

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.760
which has been created with great care, love
and tenderness.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:54.990
We just believe that this body has come to
us, we take it for granted and we actually

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:04.360
do not even think why we have become a human
being from a small insignificant thing like

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.850
an amoeba.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.610
There must be some reason for becoming a human
being.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.170
And what is the purpose of a life, why are
you on this Earth, what are we doing, what

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.170
are we [UNCLEAR]?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.760
We do not ask these questions to ourselves.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:31.370
On the contrary we have turned our back to
all such questions and we think make the hay

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.400
while the sun shines.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400
But actually we are not.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:45.290
What we are doing in our pursuits also sometimes,
we just go after things which are destructive,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.630
which are negative, which are anti-God because
the discretion, even to understand what is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.130
right and wrong is being lost by our over-thinking
and ego orientation.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:08.209
When for us I use my ego, what I might think
is correct then we do not think that this

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.880
ego can destroy others as well as ourselves.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:22.019
So it is very important to know, first of
all, that we are not our ego, we are not our

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.380
conditionings and our blind faiths, but we
are our Spirit which is absolute and which

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.620
knows the reality.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.370
So we have to become that reality.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.200
Unless and until we become that reality, whatever
we do is just a mental projection.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.560
There are many people in this world who just
abide by their mental projections and that

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.240
explains many things.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.570
Like if you see Mr.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.570
Khomeini.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.400
You may not like him, but if you ask the Iranians
they think he is a god and they think he is

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400
absolutely right.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.350
If you meet somebody else like that, like
Hitler.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:09.270
Hitler thought that he was the best man and
there are many even now, they believe that

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:18.910
it was just a mistake otherwise they would
have to live long to really create a new race

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.910
of Arians.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.370
All these ideas can be explained because people
lived with their rationality and rationality

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:33.090
has no logic in it, it has no binding force,
it has no discretion, it has no understanding

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.910
to what limit one can go.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.700
For example somebody murders someone.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.960
So someone can say, “What’s wrong?

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.080
I murdered because this happened, that happened
so I murdered.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.850
But under law all these things are punishable
so we are frightened to do it and we don’t

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.850
do it.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.430
But God’s laws are not perceived in normal
life.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.360
They start becoming evident when we start
denying the naturalness of life.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.740
When we become extremely sophisticated, so-called,
and artificial.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.710
Or we go too much into some sort of a fanaticism
or some sort of a conditioning by reading

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.480
some books or forming some sort of a club
or forming some sort of an organization.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.419
One has to know that you cannot organize God.

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.160
God cannot be organized.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.400
God can organize you, but you cannot organize
God.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.210
Second simple thing people don’t understand,
especially in America, is that you cannot

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.770
pay for God.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.740
This is something so simple what people don’t
understand because for them money is everything,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.290
perhaps I don’t know what, but recently
one of our persons tried to send an article

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:52.610
about Sahaja Yoga to one of the magazines,
and the people of that magazine asked how

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.740
many Rolls Royces she had and when they said
she doesn’t take any money, they said we

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.180
are not interested in her.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.889
We are not interested in good people.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.449
If there is something sensational, then we’d
like to publish about it.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:08.990
That is what we have come to.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:15.520
That anything good or a message of salvation
is not going to go to many people because

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.110
for them it is not very much pay or I don’t
know whatever it is.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.270
So one has to understand at the very gross
level that you cannot purchase God.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.710
But this simple thing also people don’t
understand and when you are so naîve about

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.710
your spiritual ascent, all kinds of mistakes
can be done.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:43.240
Now when we do mistakes the result of it we
get into problems.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:49.760
I was addressing the Jungian society in New
York and I asked him, “Why do you accept

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.800
people that take you to the subconscious?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:59.290
Why should you accept people who take you
to this kind of mesmerism and hypnotism?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.970
What is the idea behind it?”

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.300
They said, “Actually, because it is unconscious
you have to pass through it.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.610
It’s a hodgepodge or a mixed bag, as you
call it.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.070
That whatever is unconscious within us is
not God.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:26.320
Supposing a bird can hear much more than you
can hear, a fish can understand magnetism

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.820
of the Mother Earth, but you cannot, and there
are so many things which are unconscious to

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:38.060
you, that doesn’t mean that all that is
unconscious is God.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.789
Also whatever is written is not scripture.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:47.070
Now what is unconscious within us and what
is not you must understand very clearly.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:54.180
According to them it was that the unconscious
was placed at the bottom, then on top of that

00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:02.429
some can be made conscious, then on top of
that, they had subconscious, then they had

00:09:02.429 --> 00:09:06.769
conscious mind, then on top of that was the
ego.

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:11.480
It’s absolutely like a bag into which everything
is pushed into.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.220
God is the greatest organizer that you could
think of and He’s so systematic and He knows

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.009
that a day has to come when you have to ascend.

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:24.629
He must keep that road free, like you have
kept this road free for people to pass through.

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:30.740
They don’t have to pass through everybody,
to every bench, to every table to come on

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.740
their seat.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.330
So this is a very wrong conception people
have about unconscious.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:42.879
Now in our body you should how see clearly
unconscious is placed.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:45.959
Whatever I am telling you, you should not
also take me for granted.

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.279
It’s not a correct attitude.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:55.170
But also you should not deny it because, like
a scientist, you should keep your mind open

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.009
to see what I am saying.

00:09:58.009 --> 00:10:03.300
People who deny are the same as who accept
it blindfolded.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.240
You should not accept it blindfolded, but
keep yourself open and keep this as a hypothesis

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:16.079
which is to be proved, and if it is proved
you have to accept it as a fundamental law

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:17.300
of God’s government.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:27.390
Now within us is placed – here you can see,
is a very clear-cut thing – is the lowest

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:36.739
part, is the center that guards this part
of the unconscious called as the Kundalini.

00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:48.470
It is called as Asa in the Koran and also
in the Bible it is said that I will appear

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.130
before you like tongues of flames.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:56.269
Now this is the reflection of the Holy Ghost
about which in the Bible nothing has been

00:10:56.269 --> 00:11:01.800
written and whatever has been written is very
ambiguous or a mystique.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:08.199
This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within
you is this Kundalini, which is the mother,

00:11:08.199 --> 00:11:16.489
which has to ultimately nourish you and to
give you your second birth.

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:24.029
This was known to the Greeks definitely because
they called this triangular bone as sacrum

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:25.029
bone.

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:32.920
Sacrum in Greek language means sacred, so
they were quite aware of the sanctity or sacredness

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.569
of this power which is within us, so they
called it the sacrum bone.

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:49.550
This power resides inside this triangular
bone waiting for a chance where it can ascend

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.839
and nourish you.

00:11:50.839 --> 00:11:55.649
You must know that normally in the body nothing
ascends by itself.

00:11:55.649 --> 00:12:01.739
There is some sort of a force that has to
ascend it or to bring it out like blood has

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:04.480
to circulate to the pumping of the heart.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:12.310
In the same way this Kundalini, when She is
awakened, just like the pulsation of the heart,

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:21.489
rises above and you can see clearly with your
eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini and the

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:25.800
rising of the Kundalini and also the breaking
through of the Kundalini.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:32.170
If you have a second [UNCLEAR] you can feel
the pulsation of the Kundalini, rising of

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.170
the Kundalini.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:40.410
You can hear the same lub-dub of the heartbeat
and on top of the head where you get your

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:47.839
so-called baptism, you feel the throbbing
there and ultimately this break and you start

00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:49.970
feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:56.629
This is the real second birth and not an artificial
birth where we just decide that we have got

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:58.029
a baptism.

00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:59.420
That’s artificial.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.399
That’s just an immature, symbolic thing.

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:12.360
But really what should happen is that the
living process of your evolution must be exhibited

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:20.009
through its happening and not just a mental
projection of accepting that you have become

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:22.699
a person who is twice born.

00:13:22.699 --> 00:13:27.420
It’s just a certification, again a mental
projection.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:35.829
So one has to accept that something living
has to take place, something that you can

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:43.279
see clearly within you happening and you have
to get something that you cannot do.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:48.649
For example you have seen people who say,
“We have got the blessings of the Holy Ghost.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:49.649
So you ask them, “How?”

00:13:49.649 --> 00:13:51.779
They say, “We are jumping."

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:55.889
If you are jumping, anybody can jump; what
is so great about it?

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:57.149
Jumping is not a big thing.

00:13:57.149 --> 00:14:01.799
If you are jumping that doesn’t mean that
you have achieved anything great.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:02.959
Anybody can jump.

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:08.679
But you can not get the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost coming out of your own head.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:14.679
One lady said, “There is always an air conditioner
and you must be feeling the air conditioner."

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:17.709
I said, “All right, but from your head it
is coming out."

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:20.279
She said, “Yes, it’s coming out of my
head."

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:23.310
So I said, “ So that means your head has
become the air conditioner."

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.029
And she said, “That’s true.

00:14:25.029 --> 00:14:27.850
The air conditioner has started working here."

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:33.290
And that’s what one has to know that whatever
will happen to you that is Divine, we cannot

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
[UNCLEAR].

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.779
We cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:14:37.779 --> 00:14:48.439
There’s a thousand and one things we cannot
do which are done by the living power of God’s

00:14:48.439 --> 00:14:54.869
love and that living power of God’s love
is reflected within us as Kundalini.

00:14:54.869 --> 00:14:59.449
So that’s one part of the unconscious.

00:14:59.449 --> 00:15:02.759
This is the one which can become partly conscious.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:10.989
Below that is the consciousness which we call
the collective hell.

00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:12.329
One can go to hell.

00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:13.829
It’s very simple to go to hell.

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:19.180
If you want, the simplest thing to do is to
go to hell.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:28.129
On the left-hand side is another consciousness
– of which we are not aware so it is unconscious

00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:31.680
– where we talk of the subconscious.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.269
Whatever has happened to us in this life or
many lives or to all the world, all the creations

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:42.119
since we were created, all that resides beyond
that point.

00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:46.350
So we have subconscious as well as collective
subconscious.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:51.339
We have another unconscious area which is
not conscious to us.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:56.929
You must have seen some people, like recently
I saw a very good film about a gentleman who

00:15:56.929 --> 00:15:58.489
was never an artist.

00:15:58.489 --> 00:16:04.769
Suddenly he became quite funny and he said,
“I’m Gaugin and I can paint like him."

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:11.480
He started painting on a canvas, you could
see, just like Gaugin style with very bold

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.350
lines and all these colors as you have seen
– exactly the same way.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.350
People couldn’t understand.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.839
This man was never an artist, nothing.

00:16:18.839 --> 00:16:19.930
He has done suddenly.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.610
What has happened to him?

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:26.210
That means he got possessed by someone, must
have been possessed by Gaugin himself because

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:31.739
he was mad when he died, and that he was expressing
himself through this man and he was a medium

00:16:31.739 --> 00:16:33.049
now.

00:16:33.049 --> 00:16:38.939
There are many things like this which act
as mediums and anybody can get possessed by

00:16:38.939 --> 00:16:47.959
this and in my experience I have seen most
of the diseases are called as incurable are

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:52.990
done when people go to the left side.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.319
Any kind of fanaticism can give you.

00:16:56.319 --> 00:17:06.100
Then if you try to bow yourself before people
who are fake, you get problems on the left-hand

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.949
side.

00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:14.299
If you bow to wrong ideas or to wrong conditionings,
also you go to the left side.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:21.640
Or if you just start thinking about your past
and crying and weeping, you can get into it.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:28.500
So the people who are more on the left side,
when they are of an extreme nature, we call

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.500
them masochists.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:36.120
On the right-hand side you have another kind
of unconscious which we call as supraconscious

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120
unconscious.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:45.140
Supraconscious is where you think more of
the future.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.800
Such people are more troublesome to others
than to themselves.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:56.230
They are ego oriented and they talk so much,
they are so aggressive, very argumentative

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.740
– very right-sided people.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.970
They trouble others, they torture others.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.690
They don’t torture themselves.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:10.090
When you have the left-sided problem you suffer
body, but these aggressive people try to trouble

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.460
others and they’re least bothered because
that’s not their problem.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:21.480
What they do is to trouble others and they
enjoy that kind of troubling and that ego

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
orientation.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.930
Beyond that lies another unconscious which
is called as a collective unconscious.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:33.230
This collective unconscious is made up of
people who have died with their ambitions

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.510
still intact.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:42.420
Hitler has used those dead bodies to entice
the whole German nation to do all the things

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.420
that they have done.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.150
No normal human being can be that cruel.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:52.000
This kind of a thing works out in all the
countries where it is very ego oriented.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.870
For example, an ego oriented society can have
very cruel parents, can have very cruel people

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.260
and can be very aggressive people.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:06.090
As a result of their activity on the right-hand
side they develop an institution called as

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:13.960
ego and this ego, when it covers them, they
cannot think that anybody is right.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.440
They think they are always right.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.700
They always try to establish their point,
whatever it comes to and they aggress others

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.560
and try to dominate others.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.010
The other type are the superego people.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.990
So the people who are extremely egoistical,
they call them as sadists.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:37.630
So we have two types of beings within us,
two types of unconscious within us – one

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.390
on the right-hand side and one on the left-hand
side and the third is the hell where people

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:48.700
are thrown when they go too much to the extreme,
to the right or the left.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:55.310
But now here we are dealing with another unconscious
which is the super unconscious which is on

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.892
top of your head and that is what we have
to achieve through our evolutionary process

00:19:59.892 --> 00:20:02.130
– achieve a living process.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:08.690
The Kundalini is the feminine, the mother
within you.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:13.450
That doesn’t mean the feminist society or
the feminist movement, because the feminist

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:20.130
movement is absolutely against it, because
what I am saying that in your evolutionary

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:30.570
process you have to be crowned by the compassionate,
the kind, the soothing, the nourishing quality

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.160
of a mother.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.780
But otherwise what happens is that women think
we should become like men and men start thinking

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.850
we should become like women.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.520
It’s a very funny sort of thing going on.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.480
Actually it’s a pendulous movement, it is
not any evolutionary.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:56.380
In an evolutionary movement you move spirally
and come above a point, much above than where

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.920
you were and start seeing things at a much
better level and a subtler level.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:07.520
But this kind of pendulum movement is very
common with people who want to solve their

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.010
problems by mental projections.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:14.830
They think if you have this kind of government
is good, that kind of government is good,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.660
they try all sorts of things.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.110
Nothing is going to work out because that’s
not reality.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:26.160
Reality is only possible when you are transformed
and you become the Spirit.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:33.460
That time you move spirally and come up and
you become a person who is really an enlightened

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.460
person.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:41.310
As an enlightened person you get the power
to be collectively conscious.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.410
It’s an actualization.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.490
It is not just a lecture that we are all brothers
and sisters.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.990
It is not just a mental understanding that,
“Oh, I’m a twice-born person."

00:21:52.990 --> 00:22:01.280
It happens to you by which you become collectively
conscious, means you actualize the experience

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.650
of self realization.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:12.100
As it is said in the Koran also that at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.700
You’ll be surprised that in the Koran, much
more is written about the resurrection time.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.710
That means He talked about the future.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.560
He said that when the resurrection time will
come your hands will speak.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.360
Now people just want to talk about doomsday.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.530
They don’t want to talk about the resurrection
time.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.500
Like the newspaper, we said that if you have
to give some bad news you’d better give

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.720
us, we don’t want to have good news, that
there is a saving point, we have a right.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.030
Because perhaps they are afraid that their
existence will be lost if you say that there

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.670
is no need to worry, you will all get transformed.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:53.360
So whatever it is, we have to get transformed
and without transformation there is no solution.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:03.730
In Sanskrit language this is called as atma
sakshatkar, means the facing or actualizing

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.270
the Spirit.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.320
Also a twice-born is called as dwijaha.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:19.600
Even a bird is called as twice born because
first it’s an egg and when the egg becomes

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.100
the bird he becomes a dwijaha.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:28.490
So there is a difference in the personality
of an egg and the personality of a bird and

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.110
that’s how this transformation has to take
place.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.580
Like somebody asked me, “Mother, I believe
in this thing."

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.530
I said, “But ask yourself why did you believe?”

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:40.910
He said, “I felt like giving him."

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.130
I said, “This is an explanation."

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:47.030
Then everybody will say, “I believe in it,
I’m believing in that and if everybody believed

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.440
in something, they fight.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.850
Why do they fight?

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:55.770
By believing into something you have just
used your ego, that you have fixed your ego

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:00.030
with certain ideas and you are accepting it,
or on your superego that you have conditioned

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.630
yourself, or this is the thing I have to do,
that thing I have to do.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:11.160
But it is not because maybe it is wrong, maybe
it is right because you are still on a relative

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.340
terminology.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:21.030
To believe into something is all mental projection
again, but you have to keep your mind open

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.310
and see for yourself.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.530
First of all you must see those who believe
into it, what effect it has.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:33.820
Like somebody told me that some people fast
on such and such day in India, or they fast

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.550
in Ramadan on a certain date.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.980
I said, “All right.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:46.420
One should do that in case you find by doing
such and such thing these people are exceptional,

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.570
that they are something great, that they have
achieved something in life, that they can

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:57.550
say that they have become the Spirit, that
they can say that they are collectively conscious,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.820
that they can feel you and feel themselves
on their fingertips.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.810
Not only that but they have to be peaceful
people, they have to be compassionate people

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:09.280
and their presence must nourish you.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.110
If it is done then all right, it is a proper
thing.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.480
But because there is a fashion to club something
like this or another fashion to club like

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.600
that, if you try to club under any banner
like that, then we are sadly mistaken that

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.660
we have not done full justice to our mind.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:33.960
Anything that you cannot reflect back and
where you lose the capacity to reflect is

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.890
a wrong thing.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.810
When you become the Spirit the more you reflect
the more you understand.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:45.630
We had one gentleman who came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:51.170
He got his realization and he said, “Mother,
you said that you become collectively conscious.

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.570
I want to know about my father, what’s wrong
with my father."

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.580
He wanted to question and he wanted to see
if it is true or not.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:05.630
I said, “All right, put your hands towards
your father and just say, ‘I want to know

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:11.610
about my father,’ because you are connected
and your computer is working."

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:17.170
What happened was that he got a burning on
his finger, on this part, He asked, “Mother,

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:18.170
what is the decoding of this?

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:23.070
That you are getting this burning means what?”

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:29.880
So I told him that this means that your father
must be down with very bad bronchitis because

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.880
this center is here [Shri Mataji points to
throat].

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:37.020
And he telephoned to his father and found
out that his mother said – exactly the same

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.970
sentence – that your father is down with
very bad bronchitis.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.030
Now the telecommunication of God has started
working.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.830
You can even cure your father sitting down
here.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:54.120
Then he tried to do it and he asked after
3 or 4 hours and they said he is all right,

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.270
he’s out of his bed.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.840
So first what happens, you start reflecting
about your achievements.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:07.510
Start feeling openly does it work, how it
works, do you see anything like that?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:14.130
and when you are convinced about it then you
start proceeding further with it.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:23.180
But anything that makes you so incapable that
you cannot reflect then I see a kind of enslavement

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.730
of whatever type it is.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.550
Like I have seen people just do it because
they are told to do it.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:35.390
We are people who are freedom loving, especially
in this country has talked a lot about freedom

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.809
and the freedom doesn’t mean abandonment.

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:42.710
It doesn’t mean that you just get lost in
your freedom.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:52.830
But it means that wisdom to balance your freedom,
how to understand the value of your freedom.

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:58.310
If you do not have that sense, all freedom
can be lost.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:05.770
This freedom can only be understood and could
be valued when you become the Spirit.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:11.840
If you are not the Spirit, even if you give
a hundred dollars to somebody, he might immediately

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.170
go to a place which will destroy him.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:23.850
People do not have wisdom to understand even
the value of their money, their position,

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:24.970
their chastity.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:31.090
They have no sense at all of their self also.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:36.570
So how you develop this is through the awakening
of your Spirit within you.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.370
There’s a category of people who are seekers.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.900
They are a category.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.800
Everybody is not a seeker.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.450
They need not be showing that they are seekers,
they may not be apparently seekers but in

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:57.330
their heart of hearts, they are seekers and
they are the epitome of our evolution.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.420
They are the ones who are going to be blessed.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.920
Not every person.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.990
He may be a king, He may be a big man, he
may be a minister, anything.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.690
It makes no difference.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.710
He has to be a seeker and a seeker is going
to be blessed to begin with.

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:17.150
It is a seeker who knows that she’s seeking
something beyond.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.670
But those who are still seeking money, all
right, go ahead with your money.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.730
When you are fed up with it then you will
come to God.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.540
Those who are seeking power, all right, go
ahead with your power.

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.680
Those who are mediocres are not good for Sahaja
Yoga to begin with.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.500
First only the seekers get the blessings.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.390
They can be under any [UNCLEAR], they can
be anything.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:42.250
Only their Kundalini judges them and tells
that they are the seekers.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:50.100
I’ve seen people who have just met me once
and got their realization and settled down.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:57.290
One of them came to America who started giving
realization to so many, another one came to

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.750
Boston, another part of America.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:09.760
He just started giving realization, another
went to Vancouver, they just started giving

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.300
realization to people.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:17.230
It’s not that the realization is a guarantee
for anyone.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:23.130
It depends what is their physical, mental,
emotional and spiritual condition.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.830
If any way there is an imbalance within you,
it has to be balanced and you have to get

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.640
your realization.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.590
Nobody can fight for it, nobody can be aggressive,
you cannot argue it out.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.950
On the contrary those who argue too much seldom
get realization.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.430
You have to be humble about it.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.130
If you are humble about it, you do get your
realization.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:46.540
There is nothing to be given up except for
your ego and superego.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.772
That’s what you have to get of and you can
see that very clearly.

00:30:50.772 --> 00:30:55.580
When the Kundalini rises, when She touches
this point, then an awakening takes place

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.580
here.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.960
By that awakening these two institutions are
sucked in and you get a very soft bone on

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.570
your head like a child.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.060
As Christ has said you have to be like a child
to enter into the kingdom of God and then

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:16.520
you enter into the limbic area and through
this part you enter into the subtle energy

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:24.330
of that all-pervading power which is called
in Sanskrit as gamba shakti.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:29.110
There is no difference in what these people
have been talking, They are all absolutely

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.850
one with each other, complete [UNCLEAR uni-religion].

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.650
There is no difference at all.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:37.330
Christ himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.300
But we never try to find out which are the
ones who are not against Him.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.960
And He also said you will be calling Me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognize you.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.960
Why?

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.890
He said, “By calling Christ, Christ, you
do not become Christians."

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:56.780
You become Christians only by real baptism,
by the awakening of the Kundalini, by breaking

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:04.010
of this area and entering into that subtle
area where you become one with the all-pervading

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.600
Diving power.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.610
And this has to happen, this is your right
to have it.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:14.180
Sahaja Yoga – Saha means with, Ja means
born.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:19.780
It’s spontaneous, the spontaneous yoga of
the Spirit.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:23.860
It’s a living force and you don’t have
to do anything about it.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.420
It just works out.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:33.480
Only in places where people are complicated,
I a little bit regulate the force and then

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.520
it works out.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:41.440
I have to little bit nourish the different
centers which are suffering and it works out.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.920
But in a place like India where, in the villages,
the people are extremely simple.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:48.300
Thousands of them come in and get realization.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.500
So many of them are getting realization and
having a better life.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:57.110
They are no more slaves of any habits, any
diseases.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:02.820
Diseases get cured because of nourishment,
your mental being improves, you get rid of

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:10.700
all your mental sicknesses, you get rid of
all your false guru problems and you get rid

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:17.140
of the oppression of the modern times that
is working on you.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:22.300
You become a free bird and you start seeing
the whole thing as a drama.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.660
This has to happen to many people – not
to one but to many.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:32.470
When it happens you’ll be amazed this is
the time of our last judgment.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:36.410
This is the time where you are going to be
judged by your Kundalini.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:41.510
Nobody is going to put you on a scale to find
out how far you are good.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.910
It’s only the Kundalini which is going to
tell.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.210
When She rises She indicates that this person
has this problem, that problem and not only

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:54.460
that but through Sahaja Yoga problems can
be solved and you can be established into

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.830
Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:56.830
May God bless you all.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:02.679
This is just an introduction to Sahaja Yoga
I’ve given you and again on Monday and Tuesday

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:08.280
I will tell you about the different chakras
and nadis within us, how they work out, how

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:14.040
we get diseases, how to get them cured, how
you can do it yourself, but how you become

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.859
the Spirit, what is the nature of Spirit,
how the Spirit expresses itself within ourselves

00:34:18.859 --> 00:34:20.579
and what are its powers.

00:34:20.579 --> 00:34:21.579
May God bless you.

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:25.790
As today is the first day I would like you
to ask me some questions but not like mad

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.090
people.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.909
Ask good questions, sensible questions which
have some relevance.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.730
There’s no need to be aggressive with me.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.200
Supposing you believe in something.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.280
All right you go ahead with it.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.099
I have not to argue with you.

00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:42.339
I’m here to give you the reality to find
out within yourself what is it.

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:45.109
No use saying this has happened, that has
happened.

00:34:45.109 --> 00:35:10.890
If you belong to any group you go ahead with
it.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:47.259
When you get fed up then you can come to me.

00:35:47.259 --> 00:35:55.200
Still I’m willing to help you all.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.739
May God bless you.

00:35:59.739 --> 00:36:10.200
[Someone in the audience starts delivering
a long rant.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:45.039
He doesn’t seem to

00:36:45.039 --> 00:37:20.069
want to leave so Shri Mataji stands up to
talk to him]

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:34.480
Shri Mataji: No, no, let me handle him.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:39.880
Gentleman, please listen.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.680
Sir?

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.480
Hello?

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.579
Hey, mister, if you are talking about Christ
you have to change your tone.

00:37:50.579 --> 00:37:52.739
This is not the way you should talk as a Christian.

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:54.119
Behave yourself.

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:56.680
This is not a Christian way of talking.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:00.560
If you are talking about Christ, you are talking
like a satanic person.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.660
That’s not the way to talk.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:14.509
Ah, now you want to crucify me?

00:38:14.509 --> 00:38:41.930
Is He in your pocket?

00:38:41.930 --> 00:39:27.500
Was Christ born in America?

00:39:27.500 --> 00:40:12.770
Just look at this madness.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:28.049
What

00:40:28.049 --> 00:40:29.800
to do?

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.640
Nothing you can do with these people.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.140
Seeker: I have been meditating and had a vision
of you.

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.640
He then saw the picture of you.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.609
He heard you were talking about collective
consciousness tonight and I presume he’s

00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:46.470
trying to see through this maze.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.030
Shri Mataji: You are a seeker.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.299
That’s how the unconscious helps.

00:40:51.299 --> 00:40:52.299
Many people dream.

00:40:52.299 --> 00:40:55.930
Look at the unconscious, how helpful it is.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:59.040
But for a person who is gross, what can one
do?

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.839
There are so many ways by which people are
suggested and told because God is anxious

00:41:04.839 --> 00:41:06.460
that people should be saved.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.130
Absolutely, it is true and it’s a good thing
that you have said it.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:18.910
But one should understand the most important
thing is that you must become your own Spirit.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.779
This is just a suggestion to you to come here
to become the Spirit.

00:41:23.779 --> 00:41:26.470
It’s not important, whatever I am.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.829
Supposing I am something, so what?

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:29.890
What have I done for you?

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.440
What you are going to get out of me is important.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.869
So you get something out of me because you
have had a suggestion, you saw, is good.

00:41:38.869 --> 00:41:40.210
So many people dream of me.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:45.279
In India is very common because people are
simple and they go into their deeper sleep

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:48.849
very easily while here, people are not that
simple.

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:52.039
They are so pressurized in life that they
don’t feel that.

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:54.989
But I’m happy that you dreamt about it.

00:41:54.989 --> 00:42:00.930
May God bless you.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.920
Seeker: Will you be performing any healings
tonight?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.410
Shri Mataji: Yes, maybe.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.789
It might work out.

00:42:11.789 --> 00:42:13.039
It just works automatically.

00:42:13.039 --> 00:42:16.539
Actually I do not heal individually anyone.

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:21.410
We’ll give you little guidelines by which
it will work out.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:27.130
In a general way it works out because then
the Kundalini rises She nourishes you and

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:28.130
you get healed.

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.069
I do not do anything particularly on one person.

00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:35.630
You get healed because you have that power
within you to heal yourself.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:42.049
Only what I do is like a candle which is enlightened
enlightens another light.

00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:47.700
Yogi: Actually she is going to give you the
experience of self realization when the questions

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.730
are over.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:54.979
So if you want to stay, please do and feel
it for yourself and then you will start to

00:42:54.979 --> 00:42:56.140
become your own healer.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.190
Shri Mataji: You have to become your own master,
your own guru.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.710
You don’t need any guru.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.700
Once you have your second birth that’s all.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.269
It’s so simple, it’s so fantastic.

00:43:05.269 --> 00:43:06.319
Why not have it?

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:11.229
Why was he fighting with me I just don’t
understand.

00:43:11.229 --> 00:43:12.930
He must be paid by someone.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.599
I don’t know what is the matter.

00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:15.599
Is he drunk?

00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:20.350
I’m saying that you have got something,
your own power, your own diamond within you.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:23.619
Just have it.

00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:31.259
Am I saying anything wrong?

00:43:31.259 --> 00:43:45.519
Seeker: Is

00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:50.210
meditation part of your program and do you
teach a technique of meditation?

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:54.630
Shri Mataji: Actually there is nothing like
doing meditation.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:58.720
What happens is that you become one with your
present.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.810
Means you are in meditation.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:10.800
It is not that you have to do meditation but
you just become in meditation.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:17.809
So the meditation has no technique as far
as the spontaneity is concerned.

00:44:17.809 --> 00:44:22.710
First you are awakened spontaneously, just
like a seed is sprouted.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:28.499
Then you have to look after yourself because
[UNCLEAR at the first shot] the Kundalini

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:31.559
rises, just like a jet it comes up.

00:44:31.559 --> 00:44:36.960
But then it goes back and settles back into
other places where there is a problem.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:43.569
Then you have to learn how to keep it going
and establish yourself like a little seedling

00:44:43.569 --> 00:44:48.880
where you put in a proper place, look after
it properly and then it starts growing well.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.890
So it is in stages.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:58.640
First is the awakening of the Kundalini, secondly
is the breaking of the Sahasrara, and third

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:04.760
is the establishment of yourself as a realized
soul.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.440
Then comes the stage where you are called
a Sahaja Yogi where you master the whole art

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:19.280
of giving realization to others, of understanding
yourself and there is a stage where there

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.380
aren’t any doubts.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:33.930
Seeker: How long does it take generally for
one to get the kind of consciousness where

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:34.930
the Kundalini awakens?

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.859
Shri Mataji: It’s a very good question,
Sir.

00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:40.650
It is the question of a seeker, It takes just
a split of a second.

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.690
But not with everyone.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:50.009
If you say, “How much time does it take
for an aeroplane to take off?

00:45:50.009 --> 00:45:55.160
We say if everything is normal it takes ten
minutes.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.470
But everything has to be all right which is,
normally, you don’t find.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:03.540
That’s an abnormal situation these days,
to find somebody normal.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:09.289
So when they are abnormally like that, it
takes a little time, you have to work it out.

00:46:09.289 --> 00:46:11.519
Otherwise it is spontaneous.

00:46:11.519 --> 00:46:14.029
In a simple person like a child, it just shoots
off.

00:46:14.029 --> 00:46:15.029
Don’t worry.

00:46:15.029 --> 00:46:16.029
It will work out.

00:46:16.029 --> 00:46:17.029
Seeker: One more question?

00:46:17.029 --> 00:46:18.029
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

00:46:18.029 --> 00:46:19.259
Seeker: Somebody wants to get a job.

00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:20.460
They need experience.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.029
So you get experience you are good at job.

00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:27.859
It’s like a big cycle.

00:46:27.859 --> 00:46:35.869
So the profession you are talking about is
it possible that somebody here on the world

00:46:35.869 --> 00:46:43.150
could never be able to awaken the Kundalini
because of his condition.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:48.650
Is it assumed that everybody can do it maybe
in ten years, fifteen years?

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:53.769
Shri Mataji: I wish so, but do you know in
this place how many people have come out of

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:55.559
this great Los Angeles?

00:46:55.559 --> 00:46:56.700
Just see.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.190
This is the condition.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:01.229
But let one fake guru come here.

00:47:01.229 --> 00:47:04.489
He can fill the whole hall and people would
be hanging from there.

00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:05.900
That’s the problem.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.720
I wish that what you say comes true.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.930
If they come they’ll get it.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.269
But if they don’t want to come, you cannot
force it.

00:47:17.269 --> 00:47:19.579
That’s their freedom.

00:47:19.579 --> 00:47:23.759
You cannot hypnotize, you cannot do anything.

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:25.200
They have to come, really.

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:35.970
They have to knock at the door.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:42.190
Seeker: If you are meditating at the moment
should you continue with your present meditation

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:43.969
or does it really matter?

00:47:43.969 --> 00:47:48.299
Shri Mataji: No, you will give up on all that
yourself because you’ll find out that the

00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:53.480
state of meditation is something that is inbuilt.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.619
Once it starts, like, say, you are inside
this room.

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:00.049
You don’t need a car, isn’t it?

00:48:00.049 --> 00:48:03.660
Once you are inside there then you don’t
need anything.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:30.989
Then you have to know how to be there all
the time.

00:48:30.989 --> 00:48:38.900
Seeker: When the Kundalini rises, then you
said it goes down.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:46.059
Does it go down to a place where it has to
help and if that does happen can somebody

00:48:46.059 --> 00:48:47.950
else help to fix it up?

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:54.450
Shri Mataji: Yes, many can, and thank God
now in your Los Angeles we have at least ten

00:48:54.450 --> 00:49:01.650
people who can do that and you’ll be the
eleventh one to help them later on.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:05.200
Don’t you worry on that point.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.960
You have to work it out.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.819
It’s not difficult.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:22.170
It has become very easy now.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:26.999
Seeker: When exactly does the Holy Spirit
reveal things to you?

00:49:26.999 --> 00:49:35.089
Shri Mataji: The Holy Spirit which is reflected
within you as this Kundalini, when She rises,

00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:37.530
She enlightens your centers.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:46.160
By that, what happens is that you start feeling
your centers on your finger tips, on your

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:53.180
central nervous system, on your complete consciousness.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:50:20.510
[Someone in the audience starts interrupting
which becomes more and more shouting and chaos.]

00:50:20.510 --> 00:51:13.499
Shri Mataji: I don’t understand these people.

00:51:13.499 --> 00:51:28.359
It has never happened whatsoever in any country.

00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:31.859
Yogi: He’s probably a born-again Christian.

00:51:31.859 --> 00:51:35.130
Shri Mataji: It must be fine for…

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:39.130
After all, what have you done?

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:43.700
He’s talking so big…

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.769
Now I think we’ll do the questioning tomorrow,
all right?

00:51:46.769 --> 00:51:50.319
Let’s have the realization now my child,
if you don’t mind madame.

00:51:50.319 --> 00:51:53.900
You can write it down, darling.

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.759
You give me all things written down and I
will answer all your questions because this

00:51:58.759 --> 00:51:59.759
thing starts.

00:51:59.759 --> 00:52:04.160
This is a funny thing, I tell you.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.460
Yogi: They’re just saying this is Hollywood
Los Angeles.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:18.249
Yogi: The questions we are going to leave
it for next time.

00:52:18.249 --> 00:52:19.369
Mother wants to give you the experience.

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:22.020
If you want it, please stay.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.030
If you do not want to receive it, that’s
fine.

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:25.280
Shri Mataji: Go away.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.269
Give me my freedom.

00:52:27.269 --> 00:52:34.660
Why are you doing like this?

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:45.680
[Woman in audience wants to continue the conversation.]

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:56.210
Yogi: Please, can we all just turn this way
and Mother is going to give you the experience.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.079
Let’s get on with it.

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:00.510
Shri Mataji: Madame.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:04.799
Hello, madame, can you give them the experience?

00:53:04.799 --> 00:53:07.809
Can you do it?

00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:09.200
No you cannot.

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.519
What you feel is different.

00:53:11.519 --> 00:53:12.519
You are an individual.

00:53:12.519 --> 00:53:13.519
But can you give the experience?

00:53:13.519 --> 00:53:14.519
If you cannot, let me do it.

00:53:14.519 --> 00:53:17.839
If you feel then go ahead with it.

00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:19.579
I’m not saying you don’t feel it.

00:53:19.579 --> 00:53:20.579
You can go out.

00:53:20.579 --> 00:53:21.579
Why are you here disturbing others?

00:53:21.579 --> 00:53:26.029
You can go away if you don’t want to stay
here.

00:53:26.029 --> 00:53:27.069
Let the others feel also.

00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:30.750
You cannot give them the experience, can you?

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.780
So you go away.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:40.479
Yogi: Maybe, I think, she was saying that
these other people have evil spirits and not

00:53:40.479 --> 00:53:41.479
you.

00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:44.269
Shri Mataji: You see, I don’t know what
you were saying.

00:53:44.269 --> 00:53:46.789
Whatever it is now you must understand.

00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:53.750
Woman in audience: Can I say a word?

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:57.260
Maybe it is time to tell you that she loves
you…

00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.859
Shri Mataji: I tell you I can’t hear, I’m
sorry for that.

00:53:58.859 --> 00:53:59.859
Yes, now I understand.

00:53:59.859 --> 00:54:01.540
What I’m trying to tell you: Be simple about
it.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.029
I know that they are evil spirits or whatever
you say.

00:54:04.029 --> 00:54:11.089
I don’t want to call them by any bad names,
I understand that but let it be.

00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:13.109
Forget about that.

00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:15.680
Don’t pay attention to anyone.

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.150
It’s all right.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:18.150
I understand.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.609
Just think, now, I couldn’t hear anything
at all what you were saying.

00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:24.809
So forget it, madame, it’s all right.

00:54:24.809 --> 00:54:27.080
They are not crucifying me at least, isn’t
it?

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:28.900
That’s not so bad.

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.460
It could be much worse.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:34.380
It makes no difference to me.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.970
Now can you much forgive?

00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:37.400
Because they don’t know what they are doing.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.680
They are out of gear.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.810
Man in audience: No, I wouldn’t say they
are out of gear.

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:44.810
I would say they are in gear.

00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:45.810
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:51.030
Man: You used the words of Jesus Christ, right?

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:56.539
Shri Mataji: I have no right?

00:54:56.539 --> 00:54:58.019
Listen now.

00:54:58.019 --> 00:55:02.369
I think some people think that Jesus Christ
was born in America…

00:55:02.369 --> 00:55:33.599
What right do you have on Jesus Christ?…

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:42.519
Why can’t I talk about Christ?

00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:50.279
[unintelligible shouting breaks out]

00:55:50.279 --> 00:56:11.630
Yogi: It looks like an organized group that
came in numbers.

00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:30.119
They’ve all got Bibles and they’re probably
all born-again Christians.

00:56:30.119 --> 00:56:41.730
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying?

00:56:41.730 --> 00:57:08.749
Yogi: He’s advising us not to say anything
just for the moment.

00:57:08.749 --> 00:57:14.920
Shri Mataji: They get angry because I say
you can’t take money.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:25.489
These groups always take money.

00:57:25.489 --> 00:57:36.549
Yogi: Can I suggest that – a good way to
experience this is to slip your shoes off

00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:41.509
to make the contact with the Earth, put your
hands out toward Shri Mataji – socks if

00:57:41.509 --> 00:57:48.400
you wish, it’s up to you.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:54.030
Just simply put your hands out and, in your
heart, all you have to do is ask for it, nothing

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:55.030
else.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.890
Shri Mataji: Now, please, don’t disturb
anyone.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:01.319
I request you, please.

00:58:01.319 --> 00:58:12.829
It’s really sinful to disturb people who
are seeking God, who are seeking reality.

00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:29.349
Yogi: Put your hands comfortably in your lap.

00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:45.099
Shri Mataji: Just put your hands straight
and both your feet touching the Mother Earth.

00:58:45.099 --> 00:58:55.450
Please sit straight, neither bending too much
nor pushing back your neck.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:59:00.349
In a straight way please be seated.

00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:08.529
Now close your eyes.

00:59:08.529 --> 00:59:18.480
You have to keep your eyes closed.

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:56.479
Now as I’ve told you, when we have problems
with our centers we have to nourish them.

00:59:56.479 --> 01:00:04.650
So keep your left hand towards me throughout
because the left hand is the desire power

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:07.279
within you.

01:00:07.279 --> 01:00:18.359
And the right hand you have to use it to nourish
your centers which require nourishment.

01:00:18.359 --> 01:00:23.589
First of all you have to know that we are
all Spirit.

01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:33.609
And so, please put your right hand on your
Heart

01:00:33.609 --> 01:00:43.329
and say – you can ask a question if you
want – to me.

01:00:43.329 --> 01:00:48.180
You can address me as Mother or Shri Mataji
if you can say that.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:52.859
Ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:00:52.859 --> 01:00:54.809
Ask three times.

01:00:54.809 --> 01:00:56.759
Without feeling guilty.

01:00:56.759 --> 01:01:04.160
Don’t feel guilty about anything because
we are in the present now here so you are

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.259
not to feel guilty at all.

01:01:09.259 --> 01:01:26.549
Just ask the question, “Am I the Spirit?”

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:30.890
It’s like watering the plant.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.740
You are nourishing your Heart.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.829
Open your Heart.

01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:39.160
With confidence, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:59.450
Now if you are the Spirit, then you are your
own guide, you are your own master, you are

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.630
your own guru.

01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:04.299
So you have to put your right hand…

01:02:04.299 --> 01:02:05.650
Please don’t feel guilty.

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:07.200
All of you have this problem.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.289
I think you should not feel guilty at all.

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:13.440
At this time you should say, “I don’t
feel guilty at all."

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.819
It’s very important.

01:02:14.819 --> 01:02:15.930
Not to feel guilty.

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.510
Forget about the past.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:22.130
Now put the right hand on the stomach on the
left-hand side.

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:27.910
Put your left hand towards me as it was and
put your right hand on the left-hand side

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:35.519
of the stomach and press it a little.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:44.029
This is the center
of Primordial Master.

01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:51.970
You have to say here in your Heart ten times
with full confidence, “Mother, am I my own

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.109
master?”

01:02:53.109 --> 01:03:00.119
“Am I my own guide?”

01:03:00.119 --> 01:03:25.359
“Am I my own guru?”

01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:41.199
Or you can say with full assertion, “Mother,
I am my own master."

01:03:41.199 --> 01:03:46.519
“Mother I am my own guru."

01:03:46.519 --> 01:03:50.319
“Mother, I am my own guide."

01:03:50.319 --> 01:04:05.980
Because “I” stands for the Spirit and
not for ego.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:56.119
Again raise your hand to your Heart.

01:04:56.119 --> 01:05:01.969
Now without feeling guilty again you have
to assert, no questioning.

01:05:01.969 --> 01:05:08.089
You have to assert, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:10.979
Say it twelve times.

01:05:10.979 --> 01:05:41.700
On the Heart, press it hard without feeling
guilty.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:06:00.729
Now raise your right hand up to your forehead
and put it across.

01:06:00.729 --> 01:06:08.839
At this center, you have to forgive everyone,
just forgive everyone.

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:14.509
Some people say it is very difficult to forgive,
but actually, logically if you see if you

01:06:14.509 --> 01:06:18.420
don’t forgive you are playing into the hands
of others.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:26.390
You must say I forgive everyone.

01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:50.160
Now put this right hand at the back of the
head.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:52.520
There’s another center there.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:07:03.589
If you have forgiven everyone without feeling
guilty – again I say, without feeling guilty

01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:14.489
– you have to say, “If I have done any
mistakes, let God forgive me."

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:24.039
But without feeling guilty.

01:07:24.039 --> 01:08:11.719
It will just work out.

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:16.920
Now raise your hand on the head.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:22.560
Put it on your head, your palm.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.339
Press it and move it clockwise.

01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:35.000
At this point as I have said, I cannot cross
your freedom.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.730
You have to say that you want your realization.

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:49.980
Please say, “I want my realization."

01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:58.520
“Please give me my realization."

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:08.770
I cannot force it on you.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:14.770
Now put your right hand towards me and the
left hand on your head and see if you feel

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:24.670
the cool breeze.

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:33.840
Raise the hand about six inches above.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:10:57.310
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone several
times] Now change your hand and see again.

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:10.910
[Shri Mataji blows again] Change your hand
again and see.

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:52.800
Some of you might feel heat.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:12:00.120
The first state you arrive at is called as
thoughtless awareness.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.940
Now you watch me without thinking.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:02.940
Put your hands like this.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:22.850
Let’s see if you can do it.

01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:26.760
Some of you might be feeling the left hand
or the right hand.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:32.130
On whatever hand you are feeling, you put
it up like that and the other hand towards

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:35.350
me, if you are not feeling in the right.

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:41.160
If you are not feeling in the left hand, you
put your left hand towards me.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.500
In any case you try it this way.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.970
The ventilation helps you.

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:57.700
First you put the left hand towards me and
the right hand up.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:10.170
Now put your right hand towards me (and left
hand up).

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:16.130
It’s better to keep it that way because
more are right.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:26.830
Also tonight I will teach you to raise your
own Kundalini which you should do at home.

01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:32.290
You should go home and sleep – not discussing
it, talking about it but I’ll tell you how

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:37.350
to do it and how to feel the cool breeze in
the hand by that.

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:42.540
You put your left hand which is hand of your
desire in front of your Kundalini, while you

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.540
are sitting down.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:49.010
Just put it like this and you have to move
your right hand in this way such that it goes

01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:54.940
upward, forward, downward, backward – like
in a clockwise manner.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:00.770
So let us move it, one hand like this.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.940
Now move this hand like this.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:11.560
At this point you take it up, push back your
head and give it a twist.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:16.690
And now you put it into a knot.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:36.090
[Shri Mataji demonstrates raising Kundalini
again finishing with a single knot.]

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:37.090
Once more.

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:41.050
This is the last time you have to do it but
three knots we have to give.

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:42.220
Now let’s do it.

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:54.290
You are doing it yourself [Shri Mataji raises
Kundalini a third time giving three knots].

01:14:54.290 --> 01:15:01.840
Now see for yourself.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:18.810
It’s very subtle, a subtle thing, a new
awareness.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:24.750
You can put up your hands like this and ask
a question in your Heart, “Is this the cool

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.310
breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:42.810
Put your hands like this and ask the question…

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:45.760
Now see it for yourself.

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.310
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:55.750
Put down your hands and see for yourself.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:59.730
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands?

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:12.460
Seeker: I feel it in my feet as well.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.980
Shri Mataji: It’s all over.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:18.800
You’ll feel it on your feet, it’s all
around you.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.780
It’s a game sometimes.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.270
It’s all there.

01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:24.740
First experience is very strong.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.180
But you have to keep it on.

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:32.970
Don’t forget the first experience if you
have had and you have to be serious about

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:33.970
it.

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.860
You must understand, it’s a deep thing that
has happened.

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:43.610
This has been what you have been asking for
ages now and you are blessed.

01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:50.880
If you feel extremely peaceful and happy without
any thoughts, go home, don’t talk too much

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.080
and sleep off.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.870
This is you are in meditation.

01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:57.800
Some people haven’t felt, doesn’t matter.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:05.090
There is a way by which we can do it and can
establish it.

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:13.560
So please you go home, be silent about it
and understand that you’ve got it now.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:30.460
Be one with yourself, respect yourself, you
are to be respected and I

01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:31.460
bow to all of you.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:35.560
Yogi: At the end of this program as you go
out, the people here in Los Angeles have asked

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.760
if you would just give them your name and
address so that they can let you know, the

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.090
reason being that they are going to have a
follow up seminar in about a week or ten days

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:50.600
time afterwards and they want to be able to
let you know the dates incase you cannot come

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.400
on a Monday or Tuesday night, they could advise
you so that you could follow this up and get

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.150
the experience deeper and deeper.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:02.170
So please give them the address, there is
literature at the back, they’ll be giving

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:03.180
that out to you.

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.190
Shri Mataji: But don’t read and get confused.

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:12.620
That I must tell you because to put on the
light is very easy, but to understand the

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.540
mechanism and the history and all that is
very complicated.

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:21.580
Of course the first book is very simple, but
you people don’t read it and get worried

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.680
about it.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.280
Just if you want to read it, you can read,
you will, if you don’t read, it’s all

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.280
right.

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.350
We don’t give all the books.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:34.910
Actually, in Sahaja Yoga, we have many books,
but we just give the first book to begin with.

01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.230
I have a very short time with you.

01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:43.560
I think you can read it, you can understand
it and come back again and gradually progress

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.080
with it with respect to yourself.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.240
May God bless you all.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:56.770
Yogi: As you heard her say, the programs are
on Monday and Tuesday night here at the same

01:18:56.770 --> 01:18:57.770
time.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:19:04.480
The experience is something you have to deepen
into, so come back on Monday and Tuesday nights.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:04.850
Thank you very much.
