1
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:58,125
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

2
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:04,208
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

3
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:14,125
Is something very unprecedented

4
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:25,542
and of a very significant value

5
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,834
that you should be celebrating

6
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:43,834
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

7
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,041
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

8
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,750
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

9
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:59,166
and He was the Son of Radha,

10
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:10,417
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

11
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:15,333
So by celebrating this birthday

12
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:20,000
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

13
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:29,250
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

14
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:38,333
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

15
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:47,959
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

16
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:52,333
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

17
00:10:52,709 --> 00:11:00,000
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

18
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:13,166
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

19
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,667
of the antiquities

20
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,333
have been recorded

21
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,291
but today

22
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,000
I feel so gratified that

23
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:35,625
on the human level people have understood,

24
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:48,333
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

25
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,625
He is the Eternal Child

26
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,417
but in the form when He came as Christ,

27
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:06,834
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

28
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,917
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

29
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:19,999
He was the son of Parvati alone.

30
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,917
There was no Father.

31
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:31,125
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

32
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:37,000
There were angels who were dedicated

33
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:41,208
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

34
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:49,917
like ganas were dedicated

35
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:56,166
to Shiva alone.

36
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,709
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

37
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,959
who can

38
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,875
permeate

39
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:21,333
Her powers on this Earth.

40
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:37,083
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

41
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,667
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

42
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:48,333
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

43
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,999
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

44
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:02,750
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

45
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:08,959
which we call as Omkara.

46
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:22,999
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

47
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:27,291
and penetrated into all that is matter.

48
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,458
Matter is innocent.

49
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:37,625
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

50
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,000
because it is built like that.

51
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:44,333
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

52
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,917
except that if you try to hit it,

53
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:53,667
it hits you back, in its own nature.

54
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,250
So it was called as Jada,

55
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:06,458
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

56
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:15,417
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

57
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,917
where the animals do not know

58
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,250
that they are committing crimes.

59
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,583
Animals

60
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,000
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

61
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,458
or trespass your properties,

62
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,041
create nuisance all over,

63
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,709
they don’t know they are committing a sin

64
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,834
or they are disobeying some laws.

65
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,333
They live with the laws that are built within them,

66
00:15:55,792 --> 00:16:00,291
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

67
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,250
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

68
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:10,959
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

69
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,625
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

70
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:29,500
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

71
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:39,125
because there is no development of ego in them.

72
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,458
So they are innocent.

73
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:49,917
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

74
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,750
or an elephant may trample

75
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:59,417
over a human body, still he is innocent.

76
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:10,083
But when going to a higher state,

77
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:15,999
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

78
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,959
of creating a personality

79
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:27,458
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

80
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,250
Above the matter, above the animals,

81
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:36,041
She created Shri Ganesha.

82
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,834
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

83
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,375
how He got the head of an elephant

84
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,750
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

85
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
though He is a human being,

86
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:52,291
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

87
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:58,208
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

88
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,792
He has got the head of an elephant

89
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:11,375
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

90
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:17,709
So in such a head, which is innocent,

91
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,875
ego cannot develop.

92
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:25,166
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

93
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:35,458
But human beings were created in a different manner

94
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:44,583
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

95
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:51,625
it also settled them in motion,

96
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:57,083
a new type of evolution in human beings

97
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:01,875
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

98
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:05,041
[his head] their heads like this.

99
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:08,291
Animals’ heads are on the ground

100
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:17,333
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

101
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:21,041
but when man raised his head above,

102
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,041
against the energy of gravity,

103
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:33,917
then a new complication started in the energy flow

104
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

105
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:44,959
a problem started where Kundalini

106
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,959
could not

107
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,625
nourish

108
00:19:54,999 --> 00:20:00,999
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

109
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:07,125
The reason is when you raise your head

110
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,917
from the Mother Earth,

111
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,959
you remove yourself away

112
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,542
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

113
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:24,291
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

114
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,875
you see the result of that in this country

115
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:34,250
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

116
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:40,875
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

117
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,041
extracting the nature,

118
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:49,709
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

119
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,041
by changing the atom, breaking it.

120
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,709
That means you went against the nature itself

121
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,500
by raising your head.

122
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,792
But if it was done

123
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,583
in complete surrender to God,

124
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:21,917
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

125
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,208
it would not have harmed you.

126
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:34,875
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

127
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,000
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

128
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,041
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

129
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:48,166
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

130
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:55,083
Such a rich country like America,

131
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:01,291
without any gratitude towards its Creator

132
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:04,458
raised its head upward

133
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:10,166
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

134
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:18,625
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

135
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:22,250
was built up to fight the nature,

136
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,417
not to go along with the nature.

137
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:33,250
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

138
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:38,208
– on the Mooladhara itself.

139
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,417
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

140
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:54,041
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

141
00:22:55,333 --> 00:23:02,875
much before Abraham, much before Moses

142
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:15,333
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

143
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,792
was acceptable since long.

144
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,375
But man in his arrogance

145
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:31,959
raised his voice against the marriage,

146
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:40,000
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

147
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:51,959
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

148
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,834
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

149
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,000
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

150
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,709
Because you are anti-nature,

151
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,500
that’s why

152
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,750
in this country now many man and women were murdered

153
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,625
for jealousy?

154
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,625
If it was natural

155
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,875
to be in love with ten men and ten women

156
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,667
then why jealousy?

157
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,959
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

158
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:51,208
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

159
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:57,166
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

160
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:11,750
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

161
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:21,041
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

162
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:27,625
now to the brink of complete destruction.

163
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:33,709
The attack of innocence

164
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:39,709
is the greatest weakness of this country.

165
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:49,959
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

166
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:59,625
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

167
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:05,083
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

168
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:12,417
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

169
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,834
When you go against Shri Ganesh

170
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:22,083
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

171
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:27,125
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

172
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:32,417
anything new that comes up.

173
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:40,709
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

174
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,875
and they forgot Christ,

175
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,041
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

176
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:54,417
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

177
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:59,917
There should be no lust in your eyes.

178
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:06,667
But arrogance

179
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,417
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

180
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,542
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

181
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:22,625
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

182
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:31,458
because of arrogant enterprises.

183
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:44,667
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

184
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:54,166
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

185
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,750
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

186
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:10,500
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

187
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:18,959
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

188
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:26,000
and you can’t get out of it.

189
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,208
Unless and until you understand the importance

190
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,792
of innocence in your life

191
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:40,750
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

192
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:45,500
It’s only you who are going to save it.

193
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,458
It’s only you who are going to make it.

194
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,333
When the Kundalini rises

195
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:02,000
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

196
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:07,999
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

197
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:17,041
slowly comes up from His slumber,

198
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:22,375
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

199
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:26,375
still He stands up.

200
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:27,875
But still we ...?

201
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,000
How are we going to nourish it?

202
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:42,959
How are we going to look after its growth?

203
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:53,750
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

204
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:59,500
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

205
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:05,375
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

206
00:30:05,834 --> 00:30:10,999
The mistakes have been grievous.

207
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:16,667
So you have to take it up as a crusade

208
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,500
against those mistakes

209
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:25,125
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

210
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,291
so that He gives you the necessary balance

211
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:34,041
and the roots to nourish yourself.

212
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,458
It is shocking first.

213
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:40,000
I mean you just can’t understand;

214
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,417
it is impossible

215
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,917
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

216
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:59,458
how you could take to such funny things,

217
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:08,750
which are obviously horrid.

218
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,792
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

219
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,166
And all other dirty words that they use,

220
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:25,291
which I don’t want to say just now,

221
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:30,458
or they have lost their meanings?

222
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:38,125
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

223
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:43,166
[Don’t do that … You should not.

224
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:49,000
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

225
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:55,959
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

226
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,959
that we cannot see

227
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,417
what we have done to ourselves?

228
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:11,041
We have no self-respect.

229
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:19,583
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

230
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:26,625
extremely unpredictable.

231
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,750
And God knows what can come through

232
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:38,041
with all these ventures we have gone into.

233
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,834
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

234
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:49,709
I have given some instructions with people

235
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:56,792
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

236
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:05,000
specially the women of America.

237
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,792
If they have to be the shaktis,

238
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:15,875
they have to respect their chastity.

239
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:26,625
But so surprising that when we see outside

240
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:32,667
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

241
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:40,542
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

242
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,917
If you have to save them,

243
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:53,041
then try to fix your positions, properly.

244
00:33:54,625 --> 00:34:00,125
Shri Ganesha has four hands

245
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:09,041
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

246
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:15,792
is the one you have to be careful about.

247
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,375
That is His job

248
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,542
and if you neglect Him,

249
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,375
that force will act

250
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,875
and act so vehemently

251
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,999
that despite your realization

252
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:46,208
you may not be able to save yourself.

253
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,875
Do not take your realization for granted.

254
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,875
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

255
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,542
your realization has no meaning at all.

256
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,166
Watch yourself,

257
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,709
have you got adulterous eyes?

258
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:13,041
Have you got an adulterous mind?

259
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:23,542
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

260
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:28,291
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

261
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:34,709
then you must get a good amount of health,

262
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,999
money

263
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,333
and position,

264
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,417
power.

265
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:55,542
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

266
00:35:55,917 --> 00:36:00,500
Nirmal Ganesha.

267
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:09,500
“Oh, Mother, please give us

268
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:16,000
the blessings of establishment of purity

269
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:22,333
in our Ganesha principle.”

270
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,250
In relationships,

271
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,542
in attitudes,

272
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,000
in behavior,

273
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:46,792
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

274
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:58,625
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

275
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:04,417
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

276
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:11,041
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

277
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:15,834
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

278
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:22,792
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

279
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:28,417
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

280
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:34,333
Everything that is done against Him after realization

281
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:39,250
will tell upon you

282
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,375
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

283
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,583
as absolutely degraded people.

284
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,999
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

285
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:04,041
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

286
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,333
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

287
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,417
because you are a new bird.

288
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,875
But after becoming this,

289
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:21,750
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

290
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:31,208
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

291
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:40,125
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

292
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:45,834
because He is pure.

293
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:51,709
Now He is not the only son I have.

294
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:55,208
I have so many sons and daughters

295
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,041
and I have made you in the same way

296
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:02,333
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

297
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:06,000
on My own.

298
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:13,667
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

299
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,834
and purity of your body is going to please.

300
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:28,583
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

301
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:33,792
My name itself means purity.

302
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,083
You can do it.

303
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,000
You are empowered to do it.

304
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:40,875
You have a Kundalini to do it.

305
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:47,083
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

306
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,875
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

307
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:56,208
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

308
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:02,000
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

309
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:10,375
All your incurable diseases right from

310
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:17,333
all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that,

311
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:22,667
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

312
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,709
all your psychosomatic problems

313
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:32,583
right from schizophrenia, everything

314
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:37,500
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

315
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:43,875
When the roots are not all right,

316
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:48,166
how can you cure the tree?

317
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,542
If the roots are all right

318
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:54,917
then any medicine can reach any center,

319
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:59,792
any area, any place, any fruit.

320
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,208
But if the roots are not all right,

321
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,709
how can you work it out?

322
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,834
Today you have called Me here,

323
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:18,041
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

324
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:27,000
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

325
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:34,375
While worshipping Him you have to know

326
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:41,250
that such a powerful thing

327
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:45,750
you have to establish within yourself

328
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,125
and by that establishment

329
00:41:52,667 --> 00:42:01,458
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

330
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:08,875
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

331
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:15,291
greatness is auspiciousness.

332
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:24,917
It’s a coefficience;

333
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:31,083
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

334
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:37,750
that emits auspiciousness.

335
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:49,625
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

336
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:54,709
The same magnet is within you,

337
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,000
which is Shri Ganesha.

338
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,750
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

339
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:07,375
which is the north, south, east, west.

340
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:11,000
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

341
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:14,375
You know there are so many birds who fly out

342
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,667
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

343
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,125
because they have that magnet with them,

344
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:22,458
they have that innocence with them.

345
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,333
There are so many fishes,

346
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:29,625
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

347
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,834
Scientists should find out.

348
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:41,125
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

349
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:50,667
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

350
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,667
becomes magnetic

351
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:08,291
and magnet attracts the steel

352
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:14,875
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

353
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,792
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

354
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:22,834
Is a man with the steel, say.

355
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:29,500
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

356
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:34,625
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

357
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,542
is a man of steel.

358
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,208
So this magnet attracts the steel.

359
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:54,583
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

360
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:02,208
not pliable, it’s rather dry

361
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:08,375
but the magnet attracts, means

362
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:14,667
it creates that special quality in the steel

363
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:19,417
that it moves towards the magnet.

364
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,625
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

365
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:32,041
you’ll be amazed.

366
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:34,750
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

367
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,834
they’ll be running towards you.

368
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,542
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

369
00:45:42,291 --> 00:45:47,000
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

370
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:52,959
– anywhere, any place.

371
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,792
So what is this magnet?

372
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:02,208
Is pure love.

373
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:05,291
Is pure love

374
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:10,417
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

375
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,667
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

376
00:46:15,083 --> 00:46:19,250
It is the support of itself.

377
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:23,417
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

378
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,125
doesn’t want anything,

379
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,333
doesn’t expect anything.

380
00:46:27,792 --> 00:46:33,417
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

381
00:46:33,834 --> 00:46:39,709
That’s why they get attracted.

382
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:45,375
Those who have not even seen Me,

383
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,709
those who have not even known Me,

384
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:51,750
just with My name, I’ve seen,

385
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:56,291
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

386
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:58,750
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

387
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:00,792
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

388
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,667
we'll manage somehow.”

389
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:04,458
In Poona we had such crowds

390
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:08,000
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

391
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:11,583
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

392
00:47:11,875 --> 00:47:14,125
where You can sit down in a big open place

393
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,875
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

394
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,083
I said, “You don’t worry,

395
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:24,125
everything will be in proper place.”

396
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,917
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

397
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:32,875
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

398
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:39,291
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

399
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:42,542
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

400
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,667
Just like a picture.

401
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,959
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

402
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:53,375
Just sitting like a picture.

403
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:57,166
And the gentleman who owned that hall

404
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:01,667
had never seen such a thing before.

405
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,917
Throughout for one and half hour,

406
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:08,375
no movement of any kind.

407
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:15,583
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

408
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:20,917
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

409
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,667
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

410
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:28,750
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

411
00:48:29,083 --> 00:48:34,375
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

412
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:45,375
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

413
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:48,375
A child, there’s one child,

414
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:52,208
everybody is attracted towards the child.

415
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:57,083
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

416
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:02,625
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

417
00:49:03,083 --> 00:49:05,291
everybody would be worried about the child.

418
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:06,917
What’s happening to the child?

419
00:49:07,291 --> 00:49:12,208
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

420
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:17,250
Unless and until it’s a devil.

421
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:20,625
Why this attraction for children?

422
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,583
Because their magnets are intact.

423
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,125
Their ego has not yet developed.

424
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:28,583
Our ego developed, had to develop

425
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,999
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

426
00:49:33,375 --> 00:49:36,667
what is right and what is wrong.

427
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:39,125
So the ego developed was all right.

428
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:43,291
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

429
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:47,875
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

430
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,166
overlapped the superego also.

431
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,000
No conditioning, nothing.

432
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:55,417
We’ll do whatever we like.

433
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,959
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

434
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:01,250
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

435
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:05,417
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

436
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:07,917
No conditioning of any kind.

437
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:13,625
All superego was also covered – ego.

438
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,500
This ego would have been all right

439
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:25,458
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

440
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:31,458
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

441
00:50:31,959 --> 00:50:38,041
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

442
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:44,125
If you see a farmer and a big professor

443
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,417
or a very well educated man

444
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,999
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

445
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:58,999
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

446
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:03,250
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

447
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:05,333
He knows the living process.

448
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:11,125
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

449
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:17,458
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

450
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:24,542
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

451
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,750
ten ego-oriented people.

452
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:37,125
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

453
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:42,125
is that you become a wise person.

454
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,041
When you speak, people start looking at you.

455
00:51:46,417 --> 00:51:51,208
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

456
00:51:51,750 --> 00:52:02,917
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

457
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,959
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

458
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:12,125
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

459
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,792
is good for nothing.

460
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:19,125
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

461
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,166
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

462
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,792
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

463
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,792
and hitting that person.

464
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,625
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

465
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,750
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

466
00:52:34,166 --> 00:52:35,875
Everybody reports about the same bull.

467
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:40,917
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

468
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:49,000
So it grants you wisdom.

469
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,750
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

470
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,375
your eyes are radiant.

471
00:52:56,834 --> 00:53:01,333
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

472
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:04,667
when He is enlightening you;

473
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:14,792
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

474
00:53:15,417 --> 00:53:18,625
But this glance is so powerful

475
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:22,333
that even one glance is sufficient

476
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:27,709
to purify thousands of people.

477
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,999
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

478
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:38,500
and you find whole thing changes

479
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:42,166
into a beautiful morning

480
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:48,667
from a complete dark night.

481
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:56,834
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

482
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,875
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

483
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:05,875
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

484
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:10,375
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

485
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:19,333
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

486
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,000
And when the Kundalini rises,

487
00:54:22,417 --> 00:54:28,208
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

488
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,667
But then when He sleeps down,

489
00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:36,208
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

490
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,667
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

491
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:48,000
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

492
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:56,083
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

493
00:54:56,542 --> 00:55:03,041
with something that cannot allow

494
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:07,583
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

495
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:12,458
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

496
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:17,792
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

497
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:24,291
That’s all, but it never dies.

498
00:55:24,834 --> 00:55:31,917
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

499
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:41,375
The another quality of a person who is endowed

500
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:45,625
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

501
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,583
He removes all the hurdles.

502
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:54,667
If one person of this nature is in some place,

503
00:55:55,166 --> 00:55:57,542
all the rest of the people who are nearby

504
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:02,417
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

505
00:56:02,999 --> 00:56:08,417
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

506
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:17,999
You will find this happening.

507
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:25,375
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

508
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:29,166
He guides you.

509
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,500
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

510
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,792
He is the one who is Sahaja.

511
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:40,625
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

512
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:43,583
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

513
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,208
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

514
00:56:47,709 --> 00:56:50,750
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

515
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:58,917
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

516
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,959
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

517
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:15,166
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

518
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:19,000
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

519
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:22,041
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

520
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,208
because all the Gods and Goddesses

521
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:28,875
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

522
00:57:29,291 --> 00:57:31,208
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

523
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:32,959
He knows,

524
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:43,083
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

525
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:46,999
To have all the powers of the world,

526
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:51,999
just keep the Mother pleased.

527
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,166
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

528
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,625
which can be described.

529
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:08,041
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

530
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:17,208
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

531
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:19,999
but He is the one who will tell you

532
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:23,875
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

533
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:28,500
That means He gives you the taste of love

534
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,041
in the food that is cooked for you.

535
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:36,291
Because He is love.

536
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:43,458
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

537
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,583
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

538
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:49,999
I used to sing very well once upon a time

539
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,250
but then after lecturing so many times,

540
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:54,709
you see I think I lost My voice.

541
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,333
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

542
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,625
One day they asked Me to sing a song

543
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:06,333
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

544
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:12,208
And after a year or so in a program they said,

545
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,750
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

546
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:18,291
This was a song unknown to everyone,

547
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,959
I don’t know from where they got it,

548
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,125
from where they made the tune.

549
00:59:23,542 --> 00:59:27,000
They started singing the same song.

550
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,250
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

551
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:36,333
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

552
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:41,709
Now all this feeling of joy

553
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:47,917
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

554
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:54,625
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

555
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,667
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

556
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,750
“All right, so tomorrow morning

557
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:07,291
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

558
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,041
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

559
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:13,583
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

560
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:18,792
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

561
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,999
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

562
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,875
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

563
01:00:36,041 --> 01:00:40,834
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

564
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:47,667
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

565
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:52,291
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

566
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:56,083
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

567
01:00:56,542 --> 01:01:02,375
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

568
01:01:03,625 --> 01:01:09,458
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

569
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:13,291
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

570
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:15,166
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

571
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:22,750
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

572
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:29,333
So a person who is endowed

573
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:33,999
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

574
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:40,000
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

575
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:46,500
sometimes this gardenia.

576
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:50,834
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

577
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:56,834
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

578
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,750
and that is what is the magnet within you.

579
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:11,458
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

580
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:21,083
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

581
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:33,166
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

582
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:41,959
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

583
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:45,750
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

584
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:50,792
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

585
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:54,500
like a lotus in the mud.

586
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:57,667
You just help it out by respecting it

587
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,333
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

588
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:05,375
So important for this country

589
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:14,417
where we have raised our head without surrendering

590
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:23,625
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

591
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:27,333
We have raised our head,

592
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:32,166
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

593
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:37,709
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

594
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,792
All arrogance will disappear at the

595
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,583
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

596
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:45,000
He’ll give us wisdom.

597
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,667
He’ll give us sense to understand.

598
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:50,625
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

599
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,417
that is within us.

600
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:57,625
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

601
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,250
He’s the one who is give us light.

602
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,125
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

603
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,709
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

604
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:13,041
and do all kinds of funny things.

605
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:18,125
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

606
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:22,792
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

607
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:30,125
But understand that it is vital

608
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:34,667
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

609
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:38,583
should establish Shri Ganesha,

610
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,208
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

611
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,041
It’s a silent power, which acts.

612
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:52,041
Just a power that’s dynamic

613
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:59,125
without any noise, without any show.

614
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:04,999
And that is what I would say that today

615
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:11,458
when I have said all these things from My heart,

616
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:17,417
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

617
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:23,000
And from you, you will emit such powers

618
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,625
that others will be able to establish

619
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,333
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

620
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:32,875
May God bless you.

621
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,041
We’ll call her as Gauri.

622
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:03,917
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

623
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:57,291
Hello.

624
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:34,542
Now on a Diwali day to worship Shri Ganesha

625
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:37,917
and also Shri Lakshmi on that day,

626
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:42,250
so today as we are worshipping Shri Ganesha also,

627
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:44,417
we have to worship Shri Lakshmi,

628
01:09:44,834 --> 01:09:47,458
so I’ll call her as Lakshmi today.

629
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:52,000
All right? Thank you.

630
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:11,625
Look at this little baby, doesn’t cry. You’re such a big girl.

631
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,959
But see the little babies do not cry.

632
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,166
You’re a big girl …why are you crying?

633
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:36,208
And what are you wearing on your feet? Let Me see.

634
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:39,834
Do they make a noise?

635
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:40,959
No?

636
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:43,500
So we can get you better ones.

637
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:45,417
Let Me see how big your feet are.

638
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:48,917
Let Me see. They’re very small, aren’t they.

639
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,709
You are a big girl or a small girl?

640
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:56,291
Small? No, no, she’s big, she can stand up, let's see?

641
01:10:56,709 --> 01:11:03,959
Let’s see. Hallo. Come along, come here.

642
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,999
What’s the matter with her?

643
01:11:15,542 --> 01:11:19,917
She always like this?

644
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,875
We’ll call her Siddhi. This is the power.

645
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,250
Siddhi is a good name.

646
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:41,875
All right. May God bless you.

647
01:11:41,999 --> 01:11:43,792
She’ll be all right.

648
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:13,458
Look at that. Take a picture.

649
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:18,000
May God bless you. May God bless you.

650
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,583
Get up now. All right.

651
01:12:21,999 --> 01:12:25,375
You must get up. Come here. Come here. Aah.

652
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,417
So now we’ll call him as Vinayaka.

653
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:32,875
That’s the name of Shri Ganesha, Vinayaka.

654
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,333
Who else is there?

655
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,667
Come along.

656
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:19,542
Hello. We’ll call him Ganapati.

657
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:54,125
May God bless you.

658
01:13:54,999 --> 01:14:01,792
Come here. We’ll call them as Gauri and Ganesha.

659
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:10,041
Gauri and Ganesha.

660
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,333
Can you come?

661
01:14:33,792 --> 01:14:39,500
Ganesha’s another name is Omkara. We’ll call him Omkara.

662
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:44,875
May God bless you.

663
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,709
Come here. Good. You are Omkara now. All right?

664
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:55,375
Good name, Omkara.

665
01:15:30,417 --> 01:15:32,542
So now...

666
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:43,083
Ramma. Ramma is name of the Devi, name of Parvati.

667
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:55,125
Is the name of the Mother of Ganesha, Ramma.

668
01:15:55,583 --> 01:16:05,417
Ramma is the one that plays in the heart.

669
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:13,417
Janaki. Janaki.

01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:21,083
Sharmila, Sharmadayini, Sharmila, Sharmadayani

Giver of bliss. Giver of bliss.

01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:46,125
Sharmila is the name of the Goddess.
