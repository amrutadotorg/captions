00:00.062 --> 00:01.190
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

03:13.980 --> 03:17.631
Today we are going to have a  puja of Fatimabi,

03:18.871 --> 03:22.156
who was the symbol of Gruhalakshmi,

03:23.208 --> 03:25.898
and so we are going to have the puja

03:26.546 --> 03:29.529
of the Gruhalakshmi principle within us.

03:32.544 --> 03:35.868
As the housewife has to finish every work,

03:36.533 --> 03:39.873
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

03:40.509 --> 03:44.473
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

03:44.859 --> 03:47.771
and then I could come for your puja,

03:48.129 --> 03:50.918
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

03:51.373 --> 03:54.817
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

03:58.332 --> 04:03.112
Now, the principle of Gruhalakshmi

04:04.624 --> 04:09.183
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

04:09.295 --> 04:12.900
it’s not a human being’s creation

04:16.057 --> 04:19.519
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

04:22.587 --> 04:28.757
The Gruhalakshmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

04:29.009 --> 04:33.358
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

04:35.125 --> 04:40.220
Now She is always born in a relationship

04:41.965 --> 04:49.886
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

04:50.655 --> 04:53.856
So She comes as sister or

04:54.114 --> 04:57.272
She comes as a daughter.

05:00.739 --> 05:03.381
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

05:04.974 --> 05:08.267
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

05:09.988 --> 05:14.940
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

05:17.114 --> 05:19.280
the religion into their hands

05:19.558 --> 05:23.110
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

05:24.634 --> 05:27.321
The attention was not paid so much

05:27.901 --> 05:30.625
towards the ascent of the person.

05:31.895 --> 05:35.971
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

05:36.677 --> 05:38.614
And He is the only one -

05:38.757 --> 05:42.900
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

05:44.613 --> 05:47.168
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

05:47.232 --> 05:49.485
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

05:49.874 --> 05:54.784
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
[brother of Jnaneshwara],

05:55.131 --> 05:58.276
which, you can go to Pune,

05:58.356 --> 06:00.339
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

06:34.418 --> 06:38.806
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

06:39.804 --> 06:44.837
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

06:48.393 --> 06:52.791
She stayed in her house, in her household

06:53.387 --> 06:57.352
and She observed what you call

06:57.792 --> 07:01.735
a kind of a panda
[? Pata: veil]

07:01.862 --> 07:06.723
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.727
It is a symbol that a woman

07:11.276 --> 07:16.588
who is a housewife has to

07:20.633 --> 07:27.488
save her chastity by covering her face because

07:27.920 --> 07:31.173
She was a beautiful woman and

07:32.629 --> 07:38.857
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

07:39.906 --> 07:42.799
and She would have been definitely attacked

07:43.299 --> 07:47.334
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

07:47.827 --> 07:50.450
As you know, in the time of Christ,

07:51.196 --> 07:55.048
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

07:55.398 --> 07:58.640
had to be very, very potential personality

07:59.315 --> 08:03.192
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

08:06.209 --> 08:09.557
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

08:10.977 --> 08:16.373
so She allowed her sons

08:16.655 --> 08:19.512
or actually ordered them

08:20.642 --> 08:23.025
to fight those fanatics

08:23.698 --> 08:28.960
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

08:30.512 --> 08:34.036
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

08:34.824 --> 08:37.738
It’s a very beautiful thing how

08:38.705 --> 08:41.244
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

08:41.928 --> 08:45.358
took a form of Vishnumaya

08:48.451 --> 08:54.770
just to establish the beautiful principle of

08:58.985 --> 09:01.469
a housewife.

09:03.553 --> 09:06.449
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

09:07.304 --> 09:10.256
and She knew that her children will be killed.

09:12.754 --> 09:15.668
But these people are never killed,

09:16.026 --> 09:19.083
they never die nor do they suffer.

09:19.251 --> 09:22.745
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

09:23.971 --> 09:26.867
As a result of that,

09:29.445 --> 09:34.359
another system started where they respected saints;

09:34.681 --> 09:40.540
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

09:41.052 --> 09:43.276
or we can call them the people

09:43.514 --> 09:46.421
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

09:47.001 --> 09:50.845
Then we have got “Chisti”.

09:51.134 --> 09:57.099
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

09:57.522 --> 10:01.055
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

10:01.646 --> 10:05.790
But still they could not transcend

10:06.213 --> 10:12.512
the limits of religiosity.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.279
So they also became extremely fanatic.

10:18.033 --> 10:23.101
Firstly they would not see to

10:23.765 --> 10:27.320
another religion where they had saints.

10:27.655 --> 10:31.731
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

10:32.846 --> 10:38.681
and even when we had a great saint

10:39.345 --> 10:44.441
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

10:46.223 --> 10:51.380
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

10:51.603 --> 10:55.779
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

10:57.212 --> 11:01.721
We did not deny,

11:02.016 --> 11:04.496
as far as Hindus were concerned,

11:05.197 --> 11:10.326
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

11:11.251 --> 11:14.791
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

11:15.160 --> 11:17.984
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

11:18.704 --> 11:23.904
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

11:24.279 --> 11:27.837
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

11:27.967 --> 11:30.522
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

11:32.044 --> 11:34.273
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

11:35.197 --> 11:41.514
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

11:42.363 --> 11:46.531
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

11:47.019 --> 11:48.853
So they could not get out of it.

11:49.115 --> 11:52.293
So we have another one called Haji Malang

11:52.428 --> 11:56.041
who was worshipped by Hindus.

11:56.686 --> 11:59.680
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

12:02.477 --> 12:04.798
This Haji Malang

12:05.442 --> 12:10.062
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

12:10.505 --> 12:14.480
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

12:15.029 --> 12:17.039
just to counter balance.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.295
They did all kinds of things.

12:19.847 --> 12:22.338
There are many saints like that.

12:23.619 --> 12:29.447
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

12:30.059 --> 12:35.676
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

12:36.722 --> 12:39.287
of that place, which was very bad. Even

12:39.533 --> 12:43.440
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.094
They all make an earnings,

12:46.245 --> 12:49.691
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

12:51.221 --> 12:56.836
So this saint died and was buried there.

12:57.206 --> 12:59.491
There were many people who were depending on it.

12:59.639 --> 13:03.142
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

13:04.102 --> 13:06.312
'What is your religion?'

13:07.071 --> 13:08.714
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

13:09.206 --> 13:12.319
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

13:12.695 --> 13:15.203
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

13:16.763 --> 13:20.432
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

13:20.623 --> 13:22.535
They have no religions.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.610
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

13:29.067 --> 13:32.474
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

13:33.131 --> 13:36.004
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

13:36.060 --> 13:39.792
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

13:39.999 --> 13:42.511
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

13:42.789 --> 13:45.276
that they made a fanatic group.

13:46.057 --> 13:50.461
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

13:51.349 --> 13:54.707
against your innate religion within your-self

13:55.065 --> 13:57.564
because it creates poison.

13:59.292 --> 14:01.443
It's a venomous thing.

14:02.335 --> 14:04.866
It makes you hate others.

14:05.649 --> 14:07.935
When you start hating others,

14:08.430 --> 14:11.985
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

14:12.466 --> 14:16.721
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

14:20.664 --> 14:22.777
Hating any one

14:23.367 --> 14:26.970
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

14:27.122 --> 14:30.472
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

14:30.841 --> 14:33.295
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

14:33.576 --> 14:35.956
They bite some one because that is their nature.

14:36.197 --> 14:38.730
They cut some one because that's their nature.

14:39.009 --> 14:40.954
They never hate someone.

14:41.250 --> 14:44.902
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

14:45.072 --> 14:50.272
is a speciality of human conception

14:50.480 --> 14:53.982
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.331
And this horrible thing hatred

15:00.562 --> 15:04.508
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

15:05.061 --> 15:09.427
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

15:10.320 --> 15:14.750
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

15:14.874 --> 15:17.221
in every religion.

15:18.655 --> 15:21.608
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

15:21.784 --> 15:27.587
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

15:28.383 --> 15:33.670
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

15:34.382 --> 15:39.510
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

15:39.751 --> 15:44.189
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

15:46.870 --> 15:51.572
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

15:52.731 --> 15:55.405
to overcome that hatred,

15:55.874 --> 16:00.823
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

16:01.370 --> 16:04.780
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

16:04.998 --> 16:09.164
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

16:10.042 --> 16:15.393
How? In the family when you have a household,

16:18.926 --> 16:24.705
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

16:25.130 --> 16:31.657
between the children, between the husband and the children.

16:32.257 --> 16:36.901
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

16:37.587 --> 16:40.486
then how can she subdue it?

16:40.685 --> 16:45.704
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

16:45.976 --> 16:48.906
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

16:49.083 --> 16:51.940
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

16:52.560 --> 16:57.606
But the housewife's job is to smooth

16:58.800 --> 17:05.988
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

17:09.671 --> 17:12.575
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.466
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

17:16.756 --> 17:19.930
'wherever the housewife is respected,

17:20.752 --> 17:23.506
there only the Gods reside'.

17:26.367 --> 17:30.552
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

17:31.708 --> 17:33.978
because we are no good for economics,

17:34.003 --> 17:37.004
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.809
Men folk are useless,

17:38.994 --> 17:41.755
they don't know any household work or anything,

17:41.883 --> 17:45.311
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

17:45.454 --> 17:47.984
is maintained by the women of the household.

17:50.361 --> 17:55.157
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

17:56.748 --> 18:00.696
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

18:00.863 --> 18:04.191
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

18:05.728 --> 18:10.112
It's like the preservation of that

18:13.116 --> 18:16.934
principle of a housewife.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.100
But some men, I mean many of them,

18:22.507 --> 18:26.771
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

18:28.363 --> 18:31.172
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

18:32.916 --> 18:35.780
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.041
But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

18:40.222 --> 18:41.980
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

18:42.083 --> 18:46.117
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

18:46.913 --> 18:51.218
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.349
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

18:56.416 --> 18:59.608
[you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

19:00.206 --> 19:03.897
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.289
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

19:06.595 --> 19:08.714
they have no love or respect for each other

19:09.024 --> 19:11.788
but they have an awe or fear.

19:13.545 --> 19:15.642
And they are afraid of such a woman.

19:16.089 --> 19:20.795
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
the husbands are better controlled.

19:22.798 --> 19:26.215
But their basic principle they lose.

19:27.028 --> 19:29.702
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

19:32.214 --> 19:34.597
and they land up in difficulties.

19:36.006 --> 19:39.468
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

19:39.595 --> 19:42.041
is to respect her chastity,

19:44.404 --> 19:48.445
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

19:50.561 --> 19:52.189
That is the steadiness of her.

19:52.369 --> 19:55.324
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

19:56.121 --> 20:00.775
If the wife is docile or obedient,

20:00.983 --> 20:06.752
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
Alright!

20:08.701 --> 20:12.701
But this woman, the housewife,

20:13.483 --> 20:17.500
has to know that she is not docile.

20:18.448 --> 20:23.109
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

20:24.120 --> 20:29.140
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.455
If the husband is stupid, alright,

20:33.672 --> 20:36.116
he's stupid like a child, finished!

20:36.767 --> 20:39.779
But the husband has to know that he must

20:40.063 --> 20:43.035
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

20:44.112 --> 20:46.116
he's good for nothing.

20:48.427 --> 20:50.894
First thing is that he must see

20:51.125 --> 20:55.802
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.545
Then the blessings flow.

20:58.764 --> 21:04.343
But in no way he should insult her

21:04.799 --> 21:07.773
or be unkind to her

21:08.000 --> 21:11.251
and raise his voice or say things to her.

21:11.378 --> 21:16.841
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

21:17.869 --> 21:20.353
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

21:20.476 --> 21:23.972
give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

21:24.589 --> 21:27.473
She has not to be dominating,

21:27.690 --> 21:31.737
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

21:32.434 --> 21:34.862
She is the source of peace,

21:36.714 --> 21:39.161
she is the source of joy

21:39.551 --> 21:41.981
and she is the peacemaker.

21:42.556 --> 21:45.642
If she is the one who creates problems,

21:46.120 --> 21:49.987
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

21:52.112 --> 21:55.622
So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

21:56.990 --> 22:00.555
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

22:00.677 --> 22:06.053
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

22:06.283 --> 22:10.159
your left Nabhi can never improve.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.858
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

22:18.776 --> 22:21.910
Now in the west the problem with women

22:22.026 --> 22:26.351
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

22:30.525 --> 22:34.742
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

22:35.742 --> 22:40.342
They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

22:40.628 --> 22:43.220
They are the queen of the house

22:43.974 --> 22:47.128
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

22:47.414 --> 22:49.414
young frivolous girl.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.206
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

22:54.675 --> 22:58.434
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

22:59.435 --> 23:03.408
that, does not behove a housewife.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.252
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

23:06.752 --> 23:10.454
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

23:10.622 --> 23:12.632
and when they have to fight.

23:13.952 --> 23:17.153
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

23:17.304 --> 23:21.386
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
that's the limit!

23:25.125 --> 23:28.688
They start always comparing themselves

23:29.228 --> 23:31.312
with the husband, to begin with.

23:31.733 --> 23:36.084
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

23:36.236 --> 23:39.769
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

23:39.939 --> 23:42.314
low family he has no money,

23:42.497 --> 23:44.959
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

23:45.444 --> 23:47.940
Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

23:48.647 --> 23:51.998
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

23:54.202 --> 23:59.093
Also in her own ways

23:59.625 --> 24:01.207
she will feel guilty,

24:01.835 --> 24:05.464
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

24:05.719 --> 24:09.610
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

24:11.014 --> 24:17.334
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

24:18.905 --> 24:22.012
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

24:22.339 --> 24:26.338
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

24:26.481 --> 24:29.854
by your strength, by everything

24:32.224 --> 24:36.314
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

24:38.018 --> 24:42.829
by dominating others, by strangling others,

24:43.456 --> 24:47.421
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

24:50.874 --> 24:53.286
frog in the well.

24:54.397 --> 24:58.269
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

24:58.333 --> 24:59.976
Lets have our house separately,

25:00.087 --> 25:03.169
nobody should come in the house'.
Even a rat won't enter that house.

25:05.302 --> 25:10.301
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

25:12.153 --> 25:16.007
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

25:16.801 --> 25:19.567
is the negative form of understanding.

25:20.178 --> 25:23.928
These are absolutely absurd things,

25:24.040 --> 25:28.620
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

25:30.782 --> 25:33.085
All this kind of selfishness,

25:33.371 --> 25:38.143
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

25:40.727 --> 25:43.499
But a thing of a housewife is,

25:43.642 --> 25:47.128
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

25:47.600 --> 25:51.173
For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

25:51.596 --> 25:53.794
So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

25:53.921 --> 25:56.254
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

25:56.734 --> 25:59.254
'But may be they would like to eat more.'

25:59.842 --> 26:02.091
'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

26:02.694 --> 26:05.077
'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

26:05.633 --> 26:09.130
So she thinks of her generosity.

26:09.424 --> 26:11.108
She enjoys her generosity.

26:11.775 --> 26:13.259
I have known many like that.

26:13.394 --> 26:16.298
Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

26:18.541 --> 26:20.842
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

26:20.922 --> 26:22.818
will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

26:22.929 --> 26:25.096
you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

26:25.326 --> 26:28.013
No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

26:28.149 --> 26:30.192
Then she just start thinking immediately.

26:30.344 --> 26:33.251
'What vegetables are available in the market?

26:33.553 --> 26:35.658
What should I get? What is the best?'

26:35.817 --> 26:40.665
I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

26:40.862 --> 26:43.086
I am just a relation,

26:43.929 --> 26:47.066
but they want to express their love through the food,

26:47.205 --> 26:52.118
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

26:53.751 --> 26:56.036
and this is one of  the quality,

26:56.127 --> 26:58.536
the generosity for woman doesn't have

26:58.888 --> 27:02.136
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

27:03.909 --> 27:07.397
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

27:09.902 --> 27:12.245
but wife has to be very generous

27:12.388 --> 27:15.054
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

27:16.258 --> 27:19.536
not to her own children but to others.

27:21.525 --> 27:25.861
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

27:27.117 --> 27:29.850
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

27:31.032 --> 27:34.742
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

27:37.208 --> 27:40.447
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

27:41.107 --> 27:45.794
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

27:49.143 --> 27:52.524
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

27:52.969 --> 27:57.266
but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

27:57.549 --> 28:02.781
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

28:04.059 --> 28:06.302
about your own understanding.

28:06.501 --> 28:09.041
You are not aware of yourself.

28:10.404 --> 28:14.800
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

28:15.305 --> 28:19.146
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.820
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

28:24.963 --> 28:26.685
Alright, leave it for a while.

28:26.862 --> 28:29.049
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

28:29.137 --> 28:31.970
'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

28:33.856 --> 28:36.739
The women must understand the men.

28:37.263 --> 28:40.804
They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

28:42.135 --> 28:44.603
They see everything in a big way, you see.

28:45.187 --> 28:49.130
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

28:50.361 --> 28:52.076
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

28:52.195 --> 28:54.036
They are too above these things.

28:54.406 --> 28:58.323
They are above these things. You must understand that!

28:59.924 --> 29:04.202
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

29:04.936 --> 29:07.785
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

29:08.349 --> 29:11.940
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

29:13.914 --> 29:15.993
It is coming to that point.

29:16.374 --> 29:19.148
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

29:19.283 --> 29:22.293
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

29:22.397 --> 29:24.970
without any moustaches.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.796
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

29:33.170 --> 29:35.712
But there is no subordination of any kind.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.158
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

29:38.342 --> 29:41.597
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

29:41.989 --> 29:44.499
and, above all, to your righteousness

29:45.491 --> 29:48.947
because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

29:50.802 --> 29:53.016
has to look after that side.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.242
How many quarrels you create?

29:56.394 --> 30:00.834
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

30:01.048 --> 30:03.653
Supposing we send two peacemakers

30:03.979 --> 30:07.587
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

30:08.780 --> 30:11.042
what will you say to such a thing?

30:12.753 --> 30:16.032
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

30:17.239 --> 30:21.553
you have  the one who has to bring such

30:22.939 --> 30:26.893
expression of love, such sweet things

30:29.962 --> 30:35.910
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

30:36.445 --> 30:38.428
because you are the mother.

30:38.860 --> 30:41.558
The family must feel secured within you

30:42.497 --> 30:45.801
and this love is your power.

30:48.253 --> 30:50.903
This is your power that you can give love

30:51.334 --> 30:55.781
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

30:57.199 --> 31:00.691
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

31:00.794 --> 31:03.191
I don't know I'll have to build another house!

31:03.392 --> 31:05.629
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

31:05.732 --> 31:07.518
I will not take any individual presents."

31:07.550 --> 31:10.226
Now still despite that. I don't know,

31:10.433 --> 31:16.109
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

31:17.328 --> 31:21.528
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

31:21.639 --> 31:23.752
You are some times surprised.

31:26.013 --> 31:29.735
I'll give you one simple example of my own life

31:29.870 --> 31:33.445
which will tell you how love can work it out.

31:34.064 --> 31:37.385
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

31:38.001 --> 31:40.342
And once I was in Delhi,

31:40.596 --> 31:45.481
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

31:45.596 --> 31:47.049
sitting outside in the lawn,

31:47.422 --> 31:51.156
when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

31:51.514 --> 31:53.826
and they came and said, "See now we are...

31:54.064 --> 31:57.447
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

31:57.566 --> 32:00.237
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

32:00.404 --> 32:01.636
and he is a Muslim,

32:01.811 --> 32:05.042
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

32:05.590 --> 32:07.843
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

32:07.939 --> 32:09.153
they were quite alright.

32:09.610 --> 32:12.748
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

32:12.971 --> 32:15.189
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

32:15.293 --> 32:17.374
and a bathroom and this thing,

32:17.541 --> 32:20.021
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

32:20.154 --> 32:22.410
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

32:23.863 --> 32:25.788
In the evening my brother came in.

32:25.940 --> 32:27.788
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

32:27.924 --> 32:28.957
he said "What is this?

32:29.045 --> 32:31.243
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

32:31.465 --> 32:35.485
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

32:35.723 --> 32:37.373
my husband came, he also joined him

32:37.477 --> 32:40.746
because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

32:41.648 --> 32:43.766
All men just the same, you see,

32:44.069 --> 32:46.000
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

32:46.087 --> 32:48.033
she has kept these three persons here.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.138
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.642
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

32:53.778 --> 32:56.970
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

32:57.097 --> 32:58.599
all kind of things.

33:00.303 --> 33:02.183
Next morning they forgot about that.

33:02.946 --> 33:05.622
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

33:06.162 --> 33:08.109
I can't drag them out today, one night."

33:08.268 --> 33:10.708
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

33:11.049 --> 33:12.130
That's like men!

33:12.226 --> 33:14.194
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

33:14.313 --> 33:17.690
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

33:18.016 --> 33:20.850
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

33:21.494 --> 33:23.879
Next morning they went away for their work.

33:23.982 --> 33:26.577
They had no time. It was, you see,

33:26.689 --> 33:30.206
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

33:30.421 --> 33:33.550
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

33:34.690 --> 33:38.101
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

33:38.470 --> 33:41.647
Then this lady got a job

33:42.687 --> 33:48.185
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

33:48.471 --> 33:53.020
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

33:53.449 --> 34:00.241
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

34:00.702 --> 34:02.507
It had a reflection in Delhi

34:02.587 --> 34:04.920
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

34:05.353 --> 34:09.274
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

34:09.409 --> 34:13.064
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

34:13.392 --> 34:15.209
I said, "No. How can I have?"

34:15.686 --> 34:17.864
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

34:18.135 --> 34:21.049
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

34:21.351 --> 34:23.561
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

34:24.617 --> 34:27.945
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

34:31.690 --> 34:34.469
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

34:34.588 --> 34:37.025
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

34:37.144 --> 34:38.691
because I will not allow you!"

34:38.826 --> 34:40.953
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

34:41.159 --> 34:45.940
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

34:46.078 --> 34:47.985
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

34:48.081 --> 34:50.652
I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

34:51.104 --> 34:52.424
His life was saved.

34:52.929 --> 34:55.397
Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

34:55.539 --> 34:58.532
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

35:00.391 --> 35:03.015
and this lady became a great actress,

35:03.786 --> 35:05.360
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

35:05.527 --> 35:08.042
the one who used to act like a mother?

35:09.516 --> 35:12.693
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

35:14.019 --> 35:16.650
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

35:16.778 --> 35:18.618
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.987
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

35:22.194 --> 35:23.959
they will just go mad about Me,"

35:24.038 --> 35:26.252
and I said "I have no time for all that."

35:26.594 --> 35:31.401
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

35:31.484 --> 35:32.706
to give them some good films.

35:32.793 --> 35:35.485
But it all made into a farce, later on.

35:35.714 --> 35:37.859
They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

35:38.193 --> 35:42.631
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

35:42.949 --> 35:44.629
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

35:44.709 --> 35:46.851
I have said, I have anything to do with it."

35:48.131 --> 35:53.230
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

35:55.291 --> 35:57.999
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

35:58.087 --> 36:00.787
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

36:00.915 --> 36:03.678
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

36:03.814 --> 36:05.172
You will have to give me Sari.

36:05.260 --> 36:07.014
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

36:07.091 --> 36:09.022
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

36:09.141 --> 36:10.865
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

36:10.977 --> 36:13.762
big muhurat is the one where you start it.

36:14.435 --> 36:17.858
So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

36:18.036 --> 36:20.117
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

36:20.237 --> 36:21.905
that she has seen Me after twelve years.

36:22.017 --> 36:24.131
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

36:24.367 --> 36:27.266
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

36:27.925 --> 36:29.872
fell into my arms

36:30.295 --> 36:33.837
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

36:33.988 --> 36:35.990
I have been trying to trace you out."

36:36.254 --> 36:39.447
Then she started describing Me and all.

36:39.590 --> 36:42.378
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

36:42.637 --> 36:45.634
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

36:45.955 --> 36:48.925
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

36:49.036 --> 36:50.726
we'll give our lives for Her!"

36:51.068 --> 36:53.350
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.091
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

36:56.305 --> 36:57.372
Nothing doing. "

36:57.601 --> 36:58.601
See now,

36:59.009 --> 37:02.240
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

37:02.550 --> 37:06.196
I didn't have so many rights on

37:07.018 --> 37:09.980
my husband's property, or anything,

37:10.084 --> 37:12.244
and my brother another dominating fellow,

37:12.474 --> 37:15.103
both of them put together,

37:15.326 --> 37:17.740
just were about to kill me that night,

37:18.558 --> 37:21.594
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

37:22.396 --> 37:24.686
and then you know when I told my husband

37:24.806 --> 37:26.925
and my brother, they were amazed.

37:27.084 --> 37:29.594
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

37:30.032 --> 37:31.540
and see the change,

37:31.969 --> 37:34.306
how much they have...",

37:34.918 --> 37:37.588
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

37:37.676 --> 37:39.526
no to any charitable institution.

37:39.637 --> 37:41.559
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

37:41.726 --> 37:46.746
And the whole idea of a...

37:47.368 --> 37:51.846
earning and money just toppled down.

37:52.119 --> 37:55.364
And she has acted in many films for charity

37:56.079 --> 38:00.704
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

38:03.630 --> 38:08.259
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

38:09.360 --> 38:11.574
because she herself is charitable.

38:12.352 --> 38:14.989
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

38:16.272 --> 38:18.557
And she can create beauty around her,

38:18.878 --> 38:22.800
in her household, in her family, in her society.

38:22.959 --> 38:24.803
Everywhere. But no!

38:24.972 --> 38:28.424
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

38:28.903 --> 38:33.708
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

38:36.009 --> 38:37.581
[UNCLEAR]

38:37.748 --> 38:41.732
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

38:45.121 --> 38:48.859
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

38:48.970 --> 38:52.053
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

38:52.308 --> 38:54.699
and that they have to be told.

38:55.393 --> 38:57.202
But this is not the way!

38:57.713 --> 39:03.220
There is another way of improving these men, who try to

39:04.785 --> 39:06.037
destroy the women,

39:06.307 --> 39:11.246
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

39:13.745 --> 39:16.307
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

39:16.632 --> 39:19.549
He will never side with men if they are chaste

39:19.922 --> 39:22.783
and do not try to show off their body

39:22.974 --> 39:25.616
and show off their beauty and want to make,

39:25.848 --> 39:28.153
sort of, a capital out of it.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.961
Such women are extremely powerful,

39:36.449 --> 39:38.983
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

39:39.261 --> 39:40.787
when it comes to anything

39:40.938 --> 39:44.448
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.347
She fought the British.

39:46.554 --> 39:48.294
And the British also

39:48.715 --> 39:50.971
were surprised at her valour and they said that

39:51.098 --> 39:52.695
we had got Jhansi, alright,

39:53.148 --> 39:55.984
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

39:59.086 --> 40:01.514
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

40:01.745 --> 40:05.231
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

40:05.360 --> 40:08.813
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

40:09.913 --> 40:12.733
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

40:12.940 --> 40:16.330
who have been great women, who were housewives.

40:19.709 --> 40:26.475
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

40:26.706 --> 40:28.266
or potential of any energy.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.314
Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

40:31.441 --> 40:33.769
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

40:34.047 --> 40:37.248
one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

40:38.449 --> 40:40.485
So one has to understand that we are potential

40:40.660 --> 40:44.630
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

40:44.879 --> 40:47.696
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

40:47.943 --> 40:51.527
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

40:51.940 --> 40:53.934
But men are another stupid stuff

40:54.300 --> 40:57.025
because they will not respect a woman

40:57.223 --> 40:59.797
who loves them, who is chaste,

40:59.991 --> 41:03.165
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

41:03.319 --> 41:06.320
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

41:06.487 --> 41:09.942
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

41:10.094 --> 41:13.382
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

41:13.565 --> 41:17.594
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

41:18.041 --> 41:21.805
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

41:24.342 --> 41:29.606
What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

41:30.527 --> 41:32.807
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

41:33.089 --> 41:34.541
that the way they get attracted.

41:35.073 --> 41:37.934
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

41:38.196 --> 41:40.348
women become very insecure

41:40.876 --> 41:43.336
and they get insecured. As a result,

41:43.543 --> 41:46.133
the men suffer and women suffer.

41:47.501 --> 41:50.779
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

41:51.139 --> 41:56.228
will consequently get blood cancer.

42:04.249 --> 42:06.447
And the woman who behaves like this,

42:08.962 --> 42:13.352
in this manner and if she ill-treats

42:13.702 --> 42:17.117
her husband, will get asthma

42:17.723 --> 42:23.124
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

42:25.653 --> 42:29.097
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

42:30.691 --> 42:33.715
could be complete dehydration of the body.

42:38.945 --> 42:41.588
Because left nabhi is so important.

42:42.731 --> 42:46.024
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

42:46.207 --> 42:50.891
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

42:51.607 --> 42:55.633
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

42:56.097 --> 42:57.624
I have always seen

42:57.878 --> 43:02.171
that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

43:04.272 --> 43:06.830
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

43:06.941 --> 43:09.332
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

43:09.396 --> 43:11.953
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

43:12.141 --> 43:14.479
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

43:15.059 --> 43:18.674
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

43:19.892 --> 43:23.068
He gets something for the jumping

43:23.310 --> 43:27.000
and she gets something for her torturing.

43:27.537 --> 43:31.989
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

43:35.694 --> 43:38.030
This so-called figure madness,

43:38.493 --> 43:41.802
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

43:42.186 --> 43:47.132
It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

43:50.282 --> 43:52.900
Women have to be settled down women.

43:54.144 --> 43:56.144
They have to be Grahasthis,

43:56.376 --> 43:58.867
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

43:59.132 --> 44:01.505
Said to be satisfied with her household.

44:02.024 --> 44:03.938
If she is all the time running about,

44:04.041 --> 44:05.622
she doesn't want to stay in the house

44:05.750 --> 44:09.935
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

44:12.364 --> 44:17.142
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

44:17.372 --> 44:19.557
and then she was made a housewife

44:19.907 --> 44:21.973
but she could not stop her running about

44:22.164 --> 44:24.069
because she was a maid servant.

44:25.947 --> 44:27.862
She doesn't settle in the household.

44:28.140 --> 44:32.039
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

44:32.187 --> 44:35.511
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

44:35.834 --> 44:37.929
but for others to welcome.

44:38.628 --> 44:41.647
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

44:41.758 --> 44:44.091
to come and sit and enjoy.

44:45.186 --> 44:47.651
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

44:47.762 --> 44:50.558
we find that people, after marriage,

44:50.694 --> 44:54.959
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

44:56.449 --> 45:00.101
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

45:00.395 --> 45:03.619
and disobedient, torturesome.

45:04.575 --> 45:08.835
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

45:10.423 --> 45:11.943
Not that I punish this,

45:12.107 --> 45:14.487
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

45:14.596 --> 45:17.538
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

45:17.777 --> 45:20.792
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

45:23.776 --> 45:26.352
Then children become funny.

45:28.146 --> 45:30.462
Just for your family, just for your food,

45:30.571 --> 45:34.090
just for your household, this selfishness,

45:35.330 --> 45:38.496
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

45:38.713 --> 45:41.640
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

45:42.109 --> 45:44.612
but if the man is a gone case,

45:48.264 --> 45:50.614
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

45:50.759 --> 45:54.105
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

45:55.526 --> 46:00.127
Our family is not of one man one woman

46:00.487 --> 46:02.983
but the whole universe is our family.

46:05.363 --> 46:07.735
We are not on our own,

46:08.384 --> 46:11.861
and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

46:12.610 --> 46:15.372
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

46:15.770 --> 46:18.416
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

46:18.783 --> 46:20.218
a day will come,

46:20.420 --> 46:24.949
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

46:25.779 --> 46:30.791
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

46:30.899 --> 46:33.813
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

46:36.696 --> 46:40.966
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

46:41.160 --> 46:44.947
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

46:45.064 --> 46:46.290
group of women,

46:46.515 --> 46:50.598
she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

46:57.412 --> 47:00.175
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

47:00.312 --> 47:03.939
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

47:04.149 --> 47:07.712
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

47:11.633 --> 47:14.937
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

47:15.089 --> 47:18.377
Not because it is a punishment from God.

47:22.033 --> 47:25.532
So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

47:27.234 --> 47:32.079
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

47:32.245 --> 47:36.183
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

47:40.422 --> 47:44.072
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

47:46.465 --> 47:49.452
Those women who have tried such tricks,

47:50.338 --> 47:53.440
should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

47:53.556 --> 47:55.632
Nobody respects such a woman.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.348
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

48:01.668 --> 48:03.946
The leader's wife or the leadership

48:04.062 --> 48:11.620
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

48:12.342 --> 48:14.332
Most insignificant.

48:16.624 --> 48:20.606
What you got is much higher than this.

48:22.646 --> 48:27.522
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

48:28.133 --> 48:30.622
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

48:36.795 --> 48:38.533
Is the minimal of minimal.

48:38.886 --> 48:40.560
Is the lowest of lowest.

48:40.877 --> 48:44.714
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

48:46.213 --> 48:48.774
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

48:51.016 --> 48:54.053
But that service itself is enjoyment.

48:55.242 --> 48:57.196
But if you just keep to service.

48:57.435 --> 49:01.510
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

49:02.554 --> 49:08.036
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

49:08.706 --> 49:10.841
You can be used for a cross!

49:16.008 --> 49:18.328
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

49:18.463 --> 49:22.175
unless and until you have that essence

49:22.302 --> 49:25.703
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

49:27.643 --> 49:32.658
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

49:33.856 --> 49:37.824
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

49:38.317 --> 49:40.113
then what is left?

49:41.193 --> 49:44.315
In the same way, all the so-called service

49:44.418 --> 49:46.793
and seva and tapasya

49:47.016 --> 49:50.280
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

49:52.300 --> 49:55.350
So the essence of all this is sweetness

49:56.920 --> 49:59.483
and that is generated by women.

50:01.522 --> 50:03.879
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

50:04.030 --> 50:05.975
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

50:06.143 --> 50:09.526
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

50:15.059 --> 50:18.479
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

50:19.533 --> 50:21.676
It's a good thing in a way.

50:22.883 --> 50:26.973
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

50:31.394 --> 50:33.602
But to make him all the time slave,

50:33.721 --> 50:36.530
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

50:36.693 --> 50:38.914
Is not the job of a housewife!

50:42.930 --> 50:48.157
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

50:49.395 --> 50:50.760
She gives you everything.

50:50.856 --> 50:53.966
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

50:54.544 --> 50:56.062
Such powers She has.

50:56.221 --> 50:59.142
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

50:59.637 --> 51:03.305
You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

51:03.401 --> 51:07.126
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

51:07.352 --> 51:11.774
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

51:11.897 --> 51:14.484
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

51:14.691 --> 51:16.281
Least expected!

51:18.246 --> 51:20.150
Never in life-time.

51:21.428 --> 51:23.439
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

51:23.645 --> 51:25.732
First time, I said something and see the effect.

51:25.836 --> 51:28.359
Because I've never said to him!

51:31.144 --> 51:34.445
So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

51:34.628 --> 51:37.138
satisfied within herself because she has to give.

51:37.237 --> 51:40.118
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

51:40.320 --> 51:43.025
She has to give love because she is love.

51:43.546 --> 51:46.045
She has to give all the services.

51:46.165 --> 51:48.087
She has to give all the possessions;

51:48.230 --> 51:51.542
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

51:51.662 --> 51:53.617
what a responsibility!

51:54.498 --> 51:57.715
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

51:57.885 --> 51:59.615
is the responsibility of a woman,

51:59.750 --> 52:02.943
and she should feel proud of it,
that such a responsibility has come to me.

52:03.674 --> 52:05.046
A housewife

52:05.198 --> 52:08.713
has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

52:09.710 --> 52:13.942
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

52:15.629 --> 52:17.668
because they think they have become leaders.

52:17.819 --> 52:19.385
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

52:19.504 --> 52:23.094
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

52:25.225 --> 52:29.117
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

52:29.696 --> 52:33.677
I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

52:37.611 --> 52:41.082
and each one of them adores Me.

52:41.614 --> 52:44.030
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

52:44.181 --> 52:46.461
all of them will come from all over to see  me

52:46.541 --> 52:49.662
but My husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

52:50.564 --> 52:54.757
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
and they come and see me, not him!

52:57.446 --> 52:59.478
If I had not given them love,

52:59.613 --> 53:02.029
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

53:02.462 --> 53:04.343
they would have not come to Me.

53:05.816 --> 53:09.920
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

53:10.218 --> 53:13.122
They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

53:15.110 --> 53:18.556
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

53:18.691 --> 53:20.321
many stupid women.

53:20.774 --> 53:24.172
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

53:26.337 --> 53:29.305
Because they don't know what power they have got.

53:32.789 --> 53:35.995
They don't know what responsibility they have.

53:37.729 --> 53:39.999
I'm an example before them.

53:44.280 --> 53:47.898
And this is the very big problem with Me that practically

53:48.192 --> 53:51.384
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

53:51.576 --> 53:54.007
I must say, horrible.

53:56.521 --> 53:59.076
And Sahajayoga goes dhap like that with them.

54:00.104 --> 54:02.024
They can't live in an ashram,

54:02.159 --> 54:05.282
they will have their food,
the husband must see that they have their food.

54:05.401 --> 54:08.229
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

54:08.412 --> 54:12.001
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

54:15.605 --> 54:19.065
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

54:19.216 --> 54:22.138
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

54:25.076 --> 54:26.313
But no, they sit down,

54:26.449 --> 54:29.250
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

54:29.933 --> 54:32.634
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

54:32.769 --> 54:34.629
Just do that! Do this!"

54:39.057 --> 54:41.405
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

54:42.434 --> 54:46.187
Every wife of a leader

54:46.436 --> 54:51.332
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

54:56.101 --> 54:58.894
They have to cook. And with heart.

54:59.366 --> 55:03.460
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

55:04.090 --> 55:06.490
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

55:09.016 --> 55:11.920
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

55:12.195 --> 55:15.213
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

55:15.523 --> 55:18.597
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

55:18.727 --> 55:20.925
encourage their niceness.

55:21.227 --> 55:23.683
Also I have seen, some very good ladies

55:23.755 --> 55:26.637
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

55:26.741 --> 55:27.998
After marriage they are lost.

55:28.062 --> 55:31.267
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

55:33.465 --> 55:37.290
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
otherwise they are not there.

55:38.269 --> 55:42.113
Today I was asking Arneau,
he told Me so many of them are like that here.

55:43.021 --> 55:45.841
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

55:47.249 --> 55:49.566
because before marriage they were better off.

55:51.121 --> 55:55.723
So how much it is important, a Gruhalakshmi Principle within us,

55:56.136 --> 55:58.022
for us to be together,

55:58.285 --> 56:01.475
to us to grow together, to feel the togetherness,

56:01.724 --> 56:04.223
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

56:04.896 --> 56:08.364
So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

56:08.523 --> 56:10.181
the Ragas we have.

56:10.412 --> 56:12.226
Ra is energy.

56:13.060 --> 56:16.866
Ga is in Sanskrit language ‘Ga - Geti’ (ग गेती )  means 'which penetrates',

56:17.025 --> 56:18.366
'which moves into everything',

56:19.549 --> 56:22.591
it's the etheric qualities,

56:23.478 --> 56:25.422
etheric, into which you see,

56:25.589 --> 56:28.462
you put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

56:29.272 --> 56:33.719
So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

56:35.248 --> 56:37.684
and touches your spirit.

56:39.576 --> 56:41.020
That is the Raga.

56:41.650 --> 56:47.122
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

56:52.171 --> 56:56.226
Supposing if you stand with a military band

56:56.693 --> 56:59.906
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

57:01.744 --> 57:05.841
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

57:06.051 --> 57:10.901
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

57:12.573 --> 57:15.755
The way the housewife decorates the house,

57:16.211 --> 57:20.347
she smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

57:20.558 --> 57:22.503
then she's looking after everyone.

57:22.583 --> 57:24.702
Everybody knows she is standing there.

57:24.870 --> 57:28.984
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

57:29.247 --> 57:32.805
some people for birthday cake of your child

57:33.059 --> 57:35.134
and you cut the cake first

57:36.079 --> 57:38.026
because you are the housewife.

57:38.892 --> 57:42.490
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

57:43.366 --> 57:46.702
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

57:46.972 --> 57:50.245
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

57:52.242 --> 57:54.261
Look after all of them,

57:55.690 --> 58:00.140
and this is what is a Raga is.

58:00.202 --> 58:04.811
It caters to all your angularities.

58:04.915 --> 58:08.036
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

58:08.124 --> 58:10.793
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

58:11.583 --> 58:13.209
It soothes you down.

58:14.968 --> 58:17.182
It makes you settle down.

58:17.928 --> 58:23.124
Like people come home for five days, live like

58:23.707 --> 58:26.047
I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

58:26.312 --> 58:29.258
and live in a tent-like thing

58:29.409 --> 58:32.507
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

58:33.272 --> 58:35.145
or they go and stay in a hotel.

58:35.550 --> 58:37.791
Nobody wants to stay in the house

58:38.363 --> 58:41.588
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

58:44.353 --> 58:47.945
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

58:48.140 --> 58:51.257
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

58:51.372 --> 58:55.046
Imagine somebody listening to a Raga when he's a jumpy.

58:57.336 --> 58:59.060
So, one has to settle down

58:59.465 --> 59:04.883
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

59:05.162 --> 59:06.783
who is a housewife,

59:07.086 --> 59:10.651
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

59:11.249 --> 59:15.028
As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

59:15.150 --> 59:17.110
in the modern times, much more,

59:17.553 --> 59:22.098
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

59:22.491 --> 59:24.482
Is that the wife...

59:25.232 --> 59:28.321
normally in India before, you see,

59:28.401 --> 59:30.689
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

59:30.919 --> 59:33.041
all the time his wife is not with him.

59:33.303 --> 59:36.178
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

59:36.478 --> 59:40.456
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

59:41.171 --> 59:43.705
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

59:44.033 --> 59:45.715
then they have a divorce.

59:46.465 --> 59:49.333
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

59:49.491 --> 59:51.793
household, Sahajayoga, things like that.

59:52.288 --> 59:55.861
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

59:56.530 --> 59:58.850
sits on the ground, in India.

59:59.041 --> 01:00:01.583
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

01:00:01.686 --> 01:00:04.608
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

01:00:04.746 --> 01:00:09.073
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:12.443
Or  "This lady was quarrelling"

01:00:12.563 --> 01:00:15.231
or "I met another lady she was telling me you were this

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:18.535
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:20.841
That's why in India

01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:23.048
if husband has to show temper he doesn't eat

01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:26.202
his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

01:00:30.411 --> 01:00:32.239
That is how, they show their temper.

01:00:32.493 --> 01:00:35.445
So then she fans the husband slowly

01:00:35.647 --> 01:00:39.299
and tells him good things, "You see, today you know why?

01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:43.589
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:47.149
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes, he said, he said so".

01:00:47.414 --> 01:00:50.692
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.605
but you see all nice things, you see,

01:00:56.774 --> 01:00:59.870
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

01:01:00.032 --> 01:01:02.101
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.833
And your sister is coming.

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:05.937
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:08.113
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

01:01:08.359 --> 01:01:12.581
So he eats his food nicely then he go washes his hands

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:15.606
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.927
where there is a jam, always.

01:01:18.613 --> 01:01:23.726
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:27.414
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:29.917
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

01:01:30.116 --> 01:01:32.554
that on the periphery of the

01:01:33.843 --> 01:01:35.956
wheel you have the speed

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:40.874
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahajayogis have to be at the axis,

01:01:41.622 --> 01:01:45.997
and so the husband and the wife,
the left and the right side of a chariot

01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:48.501
have to be on the axis

01:01:48.724 --> 01:01:51.559
and the left is left and the right is right.

01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:54.754
Now the women always take more time to get ready.

01:01:54.905 --> 01:01:57.240
Not Me, I take less than My husband,

01:01:57.861 --> 01:02:02.172
much less than My husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

01:02:02.715 --> 01:02:06.280
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

01:02:06.425 --> 01:02:09.728
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.111
Men must see their watches ten times.

01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:17.116
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:18.938
if they are real women.

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:22.408
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

01:02:22.824 --> 01:02:26.072
But they are women and you are men,

01:02:26.263 --> 01:02:29.177
and God has made men and women.

01:02:29.426 --> 01:02:31.324
If it was to make a unisex,

01:02:31.467 --> 01:02:33.967
He would have made unisex, He did not.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.652
So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:43.546
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.486
And you must know this is Woman's party!

01:02:46.834 --> 01:02:49.883
In India we have these things like, you know,

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:53.142
I was married in a family,

01:02:53.229 --> 01:02:56.240
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:59.170
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of My husband,

01:02:59.338 --> 01:03:03.324
so, he told My elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

01:03:03.748 --> 01:03:05.607
my friend come and see Me.

01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:11.880
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for Me

01:03:12.082 --> 01:03:15.425
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:19.104
and told his wife that "See that She goes and sees the collector".

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.401
See how beautiful it was,

01:03:25.312 --> 01:03:27.518
how beautiful it was,

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.326
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

01:03:32.438 --> 01:03:36.090
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:42.756
But for this what you need is pure Intelligence.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.878
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

01:03:47.175 --> 01:03:49.979
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down the husband.

01:03:50.297 --> 01:03:54.608
If a woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:59.240
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:03.642
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

01:04:07.023 --> 01:04:10.977
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.751
That person is the most sensitive,

01:04:15.244 --> 01:04:16.968
is the most intelligent.

01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:20.374
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

01:04:21.203 --> 01:04:23.760
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

01:04:23.919 --> 01:04:25.509
so, is better leave it to the book,

01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.781
and today let us have the puja

01:04:27.908 --> 01:04:29.479
May God Bless You.

01:04:29.586 --> 01:04:31.291
Any questions?

01:04:36.983 --> 01:04:39.642
This means, I'll be spending some money!

01:04:41.058 --> 01:04:44.100
I don't know, there's no chance! I don't know when will I spend.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.909
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:48.663
That's why the money is for.

01:04:48.777 --> 01:04:50.515
Must give to others, you see.

01:04:50.578 --> 01:04:52.634
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

01:04:52.686 --> 01:04:54.578
Just enjoy giving others.

01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:58.264
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
