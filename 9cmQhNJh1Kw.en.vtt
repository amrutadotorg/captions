00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:10.867
All kinds of tricks he [Krishna] used to play. 
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:14.387
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.587
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.827
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:25.467
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:29.827
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:34.187
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:37.507
meaning the power of creation,

00:00:37.587 --> 00:00:39.827
because creation has been done already.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:42.987
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.027
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.187
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:50.627
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:53.867
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

00:00:53.947 --> 00:00:57.227
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.187
and she opens her left side.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.267
And in front of her

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:05.507
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:08.347
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.827
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

00:01:10.907 --> 00:01:15.267
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:18.427
But in this one, the one that they have here

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.587
is the child is kept underneath this,

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.067
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:28.267
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:31.267
So I'll tell you the last story about her

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:37.947
which will conclude this talk about

00:01:38.027 --> 00:01:39.907
Radha and Shri Krishna.

00:01:39.987 --> 00:01:43.147
That one day,

00:01:43.227 --> 00:01:49.027
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:50.987
and Narada said, "See,

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.667
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.147
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

00:01:56.227 --> 00:02:01.027
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:05.947
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:09.867
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:13.107
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:18.107
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:21.268
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:22.987
"Narada is just telling you lies,

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:26.907
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:28.867
so don't listen to him."

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:31.227
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:32.987
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:35.272
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:38.707
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:42.507
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:45.667
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

00:02:45.747 --> 00:02:47.627
He said, "There's very simple thing that

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:52.587
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:56.347
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

00:02:56.427 --> 00:02:58.107
then I'll be saved."

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:01.747
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:03.507
"Already he doesn't love us

00:03:03.587 --> 00:03:05.707
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:09.667
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:12.747
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:14.387
it's better to forget about it."

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:17.346
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:20.507
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

00:03:20.587 --> 00:03:23.707
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.947
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:29.467
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:31.947
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:34.507
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:37.347
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

00:03:37.427 --> 00:03:40.587
and he said to her that,

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.867
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:49.427
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

00:03:49.507 --> 00:03:52.227
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:55.747
for that pain, of course, why not?"

00:03:55.827 --> 00:04:01.627
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.827
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:06.147
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:08.147
he has no sense of sin at all.

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:10.427
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:11.947
what am I to worry about sins.

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:15.307
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:16.707
this is his worry."

00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:19.427
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

00:04:19.507 --> 00:04:21.987
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:24.987
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:27.387
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.907
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:33.947
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

00:04:34.027 --> 00:04:35.947
He said, "You'll understand just now."

00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:38.467
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:43.667
you see Radha's feet were dusted

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:45.867
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:52.307
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

00:04:52.387 --> 00:04:54.987
you see, the soil is yellowish

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:59.347
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:01.827
which she removed and took it.

00:05:01.907 --> 00:05:07.347
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

00:05:07.427 --> 00:05:11.107
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:16.107
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

00:05:16.187 --> 00:05:18.347
on the lotus of his heart.

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:24.827
The lotus had the pollen,

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:27.067
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:29.067
and was making it yellow.

00:05:29.147 --> 00:05:32.667
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:38.747
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:45.547
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:48.747
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:52.307
They have to be Radha to understand him.

00:05:52.387 --> 00:05:54.787
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.747
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

00:05:57.827 --> 00:06:03.587
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:07.067
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

00:06:07.147 --> 00:06:10.427
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:13.227
give him the the power and everybody danced.

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:17.067
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

00:06:17.147 --> 00:06:20.707
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

00:06:20.787 --> 00:06:24.987
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:27.067
For a minute you abandon everything."

00:06:27.147 --> 00:06:30.147
And that abandonment has now become a,

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.227
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:36.267
here it has become a year-long Holi.

00:06:36.347 --> 00:06:38.307
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

00:06:38.387 --> 00:06:40.227
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:43.667
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

00:06:43.747 --> 00:06:46.467
And that's why I think, what happens that

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:50.587
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.827
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:57.027
And once they get into you, you get funny,

00:06:57.107 --> 00:07:01.387
you don't know why you behave like this,
why things work out that way.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:03.467
This is why we have to understand

00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:06.347
that we have to be attractive to God.

00:07:06.427 --> 00:07:10.947
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

00:07:11.027 --> 00:07:15.147
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

00:07:15.227 --> 00:07:17.907
So May God Bless You.
