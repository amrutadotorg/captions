00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:11.685
I bow to all those who have found the truth

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.891
and those who are still trying to find.

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:25.360
The greatest problem of human beings is,

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.010
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:33.438
They don’t know what powers they have.

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:37.124
They don’t know what properties they have.

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:40.550
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:46.522
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:51.293
If you could just peep in your heart

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:56.459
and start thinking about the spiritual life

00:00:56.613 --> 00:01:02.417
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:07.330
treasure of powers of love,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.480
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:20.958
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:25.519
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.547
that they do not realize what powers they have,

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:34.655
and sometimes I find they are little shy
to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:41.206
or to tell about others because they think
it might be their ego that is bigger.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:48.656
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:54.005
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.331
Unless and until you face others

00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:01.167
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:08.907
The ego is there because when you think
that others are better than you,

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:15.040
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:22.271
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:29.031
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.876
you are cleansing yourself.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:39.829
You have a power within yourself
which will show its results.

00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:46.400
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:54.572
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

00:02:55.603 --> 00:02:58.974
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:05.052
that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:08.868
they all drop out.

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:12.188
But we must face ourselves.

00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:15.882
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:20.173
that we can become a very great people

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:23.938
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:27.222
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:30.116
It’s not the outside ambition,

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:35.774
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:40.540
All of you are quite intelligent

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:44.532
and are experts, I should say,

00:03:44.635 --> 00:03:48.260
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.939
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:55.077
Do you know about yourself

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.085
what you can do, what you are capable of?

00:03:59.347 --> 00:04:02.420
That’s the point where we are missing.

00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:05.389
All right, it is the urge within

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.715
because you have got your self-realization.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:16.108
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.955
that you know the truth.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.937
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:28.821
is to spread the truth to make

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:34.904
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:38.711
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:44.039
they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.621
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:52.949
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:57.745
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

00:04:57.975 --> 00:05:01.427
by giving realizations to others,

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:05.340
by making them understand what are

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:09.777
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.982
What they can achieve.

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:17.217
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:17.854 --> 00:05:21.979
But this fear that we may develop ego,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.779
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.156
You cannot.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.037
Because the more you will meditate,
the more you will face yourself,

00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:39.181
you will know that you have so many great things within you

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:45.291
just like a storehouse of jewels.

00:05:46.127 --> 00:05:49.047
You must respect yourself

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:53.500
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

00:05:53.612 --> 00:05:56.537
Not what you want to achieve outside.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.383
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

00:06:01.516 --> 00:06:06.196
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:11.952
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.484
of great value system within you

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:18.867
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

00:06:18.997 --> 00:06:23.383
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:28.313
without troubling anybody,
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:33.041
But as it is I find,

00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:36.487
the people are either money oriented

00:06:36.622 --> 00:06:40.550
or power oriented outside.

00:06:41.477 --> 00:06:42.586
Not inside.

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:47.212
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:51.665
inside everything that you can think of.

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.980
There are people I know who never used to
come on the stage to speak even.

00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:00.636
Now, they have become great speakers.

00:07:00.842 --> 00:07:05.292
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:11.181
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.946
and that with that knowledge you change others.

00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:18.528
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

00:07:18.676 --> 00:07:21.355
You have to spread out.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:24.068
This power has been given to you

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.917
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

00:07:28.212 --> 00:07:30.670
and to be kind and gentle

00:07:30.877 --> 00:07:34.188
and talk to people in that way that they know

00:07:34.355 --> 00:07:37.521
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:39.645 --> 00:07:45.192
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:48.168
but to know yourself fully,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.516
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

00:07:53.793 --> 00:07:58.354
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
millions and millions.

00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:01.542
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:01.968 --> 00:08:04.630
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:09.130
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

00:08:09.273 --> 00:08:12.138
that “there must be something in me

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:15.168
that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:17.843
and to understand the subtle system."

00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:19.840
It’s a very subtle system

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:23.634
and it can be known only to very subtle people

00:08:23.737 --> 00:08:26.005
and not to gross people.

00:08:26.294 --> 00:08:31.932
But if you yourself discover yourself

00:08:32.162 --> 00:08:36.376
and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.430
because you are not ego.

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.522
Those who have ego, as I told you,

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.175
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

00:08:45.344 --> 00:08:51.347
to organize things something to promote them.

00:08:51.728 --> 00:08:54.241
They are on a very different level.

00:08:54.456 --> 00:08:59.386
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

00:08:59.489 --> 00:09:03.169
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

00:09:03.962 --> 00:09:05.376
What am I?

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:07.881
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

00:09:08.032 --> 00:09:10.630
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:14.039
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.100
That means you are something great.

00:09:17.203 --> 00:09:22.444
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:26.322
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:30.371
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.097
But you will be an ocean of love.

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:35.681
That’s what it has to be.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:37.707
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.122
I understand that these are the worst days,

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:44.523
it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:48.845
But why are you here during this time?

00:09:49.328 --> 00:09:51.744
To enlighten people.

00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:54.511
To give them the right ideas.

00:09:54.658 --> 00:09:58.561
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:01.916
that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

00:10:02.142 --> 00:10:07.722
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

00:10:08.523 --> 00:10:14.492
He realized in very young age that he has to

00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:19.130
assert on others his own value system

00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:22.085
by showing his own example.

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:27.889
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

00:10:28.082 --> 00:10:32.400
still he has shown such results.

00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:35.516
I have read many lives of this kind.

00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:38.502
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:41.007
We had everywhere one person like that.

00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:44.136
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.663
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:51.029
who used to respect Me so much.

00:10:51.142 --> 00:10:53.814
People would wonder why should he respect Me

00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:56.663
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

00:10:56.915 --> 00:10:59.712
because he realized what I was.

00:10:59.895 --> 00:11:03.275
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:05.332
Now, you people have a chance.

00:11:05.517 --> 00:11:08.477
All right, I am quite old now.

00:11:08.658 --> 00:11:12.070
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

00:11:12.387 --> 00:11:15.561
Till I live I’ll work very hard

00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:19.291
to convince you about your own,

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:24.829
your own personality, your own self.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.560
That’s what I am living for.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.628
Till you are completely convinced.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:34.363
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:38.270
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.805
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:44.373
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:50.185
unless and until you find out what is your personality

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:52.717
in the real sense of the word,

00:11:53.067 --> 00:11:59.829
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

00:12:00.297 --> 00:12:02.399
Sahaja means spontaneous.

00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:05.047
It comes spontaneously to you.

00:12:05.348 --> 00:12:09.624
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:13.774
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

00:12:14.044 --> 00:12:18.384
But that torsion area is there behind you,

00:12:18.463 --> 00:12:21.948
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:25.362
All of you have got this, but despite that

00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:29.815
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

00:12:29.997 --> 00:12:32.993
You have that power within you.

00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.662
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:40.653
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:40.685 --> 00:12:42.980
I should we have lost him.

00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:48.583
So, one day he was going to another island

00:12:49.012 --> 00:12:53.289
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

00:12:53.841 --> 00:13:00.616
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.060
So he came out and he threatened them,

00:13:04.203 --> 00:13:07.705
“I am going for my Mother’s work.

00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:11.645
How dare you bring the rain?

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.952
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:18.175
And, it was surprising.

00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:23.370
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
came back after five hours.

00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:26.851
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:32.876
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

00:13:33.265 --> 00:13:34.632
It helps us.

00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:39.112
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:43.395
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:47.963
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:55.079
but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

00:13:55.322 --> 00:13:58.129
And that I am to be supported.

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:03.145
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:07.769
that you are the people who are here to

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:12.400
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

00:14:12.427 --> 00:14:16.673
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:18.060
But, how can I do it?

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.659
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:22.286
I have to have channels.

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:25.529
And, these channels who know their job,

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:30.599
they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

00:14:31.313 --> 00:14:33.394
You are special people no doubt.

00:14:33.466 --> 00:14:35.726
Otherwise why are you here?

00:14:35.789 --> 00:14:45.271
But that specialty is this
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:47.630
You are a wonderful conductor.

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:49.426
You are an expert on that.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.269
It just works.

00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:58.370
It works automatically
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

00:14:58.775 --> 00:15:02.393
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

00:15:02.555 --> 00:15:07.229
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

00:15:07.444 --> 00:15:12.069
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:15.262
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

00:15:15.473 --> 00:15:18.009
I am just an ordinary housewife.

00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:21.769
What? It’s just My love.

00:15:21.974 --> 00:15:26.109
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:31.139
that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:35.291
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:38.706
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

00:15:38.873 --> 00:15:42.530
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:46.391
The point is, I knew what I was.

00:15:46.544 --> 00:15:51.083
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:53.618
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

00:15:53.831 --> 00:16:00.451
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself,
you can be dynamic.

00:16:00.586 --> 00:16:05.101
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

00:16:05.228 --> 00:16:09.986
you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:12.777
All these drop out like that.

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:17.996
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:25.017
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

00:16:26.051 --> 00:16:29.231
And we should get concerned about that.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:32.829
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

00:16:32.862 --> 00:16:35.158
I went to jail, everything I did.

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:41.195
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.753
That was different.

00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:46.099
But after that independence what should have happened

00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:50.657
is to make people realize what they are.

00:16:51.434 --> 00:16:55.426
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:58.450
what is the need of that country.

00:16:58.632 --> 00:17:06.983
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:12.139
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:16.129
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

00:17:16.264 --> 00:17:22.150
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:24.682
You are so empowered.

00:17:24.968 --> 00:17:29.960
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:34.259
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

00:17:34.439 --> 00:17:37.793
But still all of you have to do it.

00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:42.943
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

00:17:43.031 --> 00:17:47.376
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:50.954
I have not changed much because within Myself

00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:56.271
I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.746
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:05.811
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:13.037
that nothing is important than to know what you are.

00:18:13.236 --> 00:18:16.208
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:18.042
Nothing matters.

00:18:18.179 --> 00:18:21.089
What is important is to know yourself.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.235
I’m surprised very little has been written

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:28.735
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.472
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

00:18:31.703 --> 00:18:36.518
about Tao and meaning that what you are.

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:40.245
Tao means what you are, and he describes

00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:45.896
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

00:18:46.102 --> 00:18:49.499
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

00:18:49.603 --> 00:18:53.295
how to reach that state was not given. He only described

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:57.746
people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

00:18:57.849 --> 00:19:00.912
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.682
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

00:19:04.912 --> 00:19:07.525
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:11.910
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.715
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

00:19:17.343 --> 00:19:20.299
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

00:19:20.362 --> 00:19:22.519
he described so beautifully.

00:19:23.018 --> 00:19:27.387
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

00:19:27.609 --> 00:19:30.130
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:35.230
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:38.750
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.380
it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:47.018
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

00:19:47.222 --> 00:19:51.167
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

00:19:51.187 --> 00:19:54.183
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

00:19:54.568 --> 00:19:56.830
that you should be in your balance.

00:19:56.983 --> 00:20:00.375
Now many people say who have given up smoking

00:20:00.518 --> 00:20:05.426
have again started smoking,
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:08.087
That means you have lost your maryadas.

00:20:08.237 --> 00:20:12.477
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.826
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:18.112
You must watch yourself.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.060
You call him, “Hello Mister.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.000
So now, what are you up to?”

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:25.295
Then you will see how your mind is working.

00:20:25.767 --> 00:20:29.343
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

00:20:29.558 --> 00:20:34.139
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

00:20:35.314 --> 00:20:37.781
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.178
that ocean is the lowest thing.

00:20:41.534 --> 00:20:45.566
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

00:20:45.732 --> 00:20:49.139
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

00:20:49.521 --> 00:20:52.310
So, it keeps at the lowest.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.616
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

00:20:56.735 --> 00:21:01.233
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:06.212
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

00:21:06.792 --> 00:21:09.946
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

00:21:10.168 --> 00:21:16.179
And, the whole circle is created that
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:20.117
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

00:21:20.282 --> 00:21:24.120
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.380
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

00:21:30.525 --> 00:21:32.114
At the lowest point.

00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:36.214
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

00:21:36.302 --> 00:21:39.242
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

00:21:39.306 --> 00:21:41.856
But see that you are the lowest.

00:21:41.943 --> 00:21:47.091
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:50.227
that everything will come to you.

00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:54.606
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

00:21:54.805 --> 00:21:59.477
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:02.663
that you know that you are the highest.

00:22:02.846 --> 00:22:09.773
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

00:22:10.048 --> 00:22:13.476
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

00:22:13.629 --> 00:22:16.039
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

00:22:16.508 --> 00:22:19.078
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

00:22:19.242 --> 00:22:22.049
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:23.902
What is the problem there?

00:22:24.188 --> 00:22:27.963
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

00:22:28.011 --> 00:22:36.538
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:43.210
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

00:22:43.694 --> 00:22:49.667
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:55.749
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

00:22:55.971 --> 00:23:00.799
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:05.286
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:12.622
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:13.017 --> 00:23:14.138
And why not?

00:23:14.263 --> 00:23:17.244
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:20.113
You are My children. You can do it.

00:23:20.262 --> 00:23:24.142
But the confidence should be there that as

00:23:24.365 --> 00:23:29.821
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

00:23:29.964 --> 00:23:33.660
because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

00:23:33.875 --> 00:23:37.554
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:40.467
which stands at the lowest point.

00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:43.169
In the same way, it works out.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.966
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

00:23:46.094 --> 00:23:51.248
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

00:23:51.573 --> 00:23:54.612
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:59.511
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

00:23:59.695 --> 00:24:04.318
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

00:24:04.564 --> 00:24:07.416
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

00:24:07.582 --> 00:24:12.397
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.110
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

00:24:16.393 --> 00:24:19.646
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:24.783
which you should discover.
You have got also peace giving qualities.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.963
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

00:24:29.159 --> 00:24:32.611
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

00:24:32.699 --> 00:24:35.468
in case your peace is established.

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:42.373
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

00:24:43.115 --> 00:24:48.950
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

00:24:49.094 --> 00:24:53.184
and findout what is lacking.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:59.659
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

00:25:01.728 --> 00:25:05.883
They can explode all the myths of the world.

00:25:06.028 --> 00:25:07.494
I know that.

00:25:07.863 --> 00:25:13.065
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

00:25:13.271 --> 00:25:16.665
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

00:25:16.816 --> 00:25:21.319
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:26.125
then give Me this, that you show your confidence

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.734
and you work it out wherever you are.

00:25:28.922 --> 00:25:30.663
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

00:25:30.781 --> 00:25:32.384
You don’t have to change anything.

00:25:32.528 --> 00:25:36.844
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

00:25:36.924 --> 00:25:42.824
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

00:25:43.657 --> 00:25:48.043
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:53.313
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

00:25:53.456 --> 00:25:57.802
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

00:25:57.913 --> 00:26:02.648
subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

00:26:02.915 --> 00:26:04.635
May God Bless you.
