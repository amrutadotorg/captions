1
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:20,139
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

2
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:43,890
We have come to this place many a times,

3
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:45,858
this beautiful place, you all like it.

4
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,640
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

5
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:53,941
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

6
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,325
you have to spend lot of time.

7
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:06,847
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

8
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:09,660
and to be with the nature.

9
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:18,614
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

10
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:22,653
because it is the Sahasrara,

11
00:13:22,853 --> 00:13:26,026
and it’s very surprising

12
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:29,162
that this fruit knows and understands.

13
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:34,445
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

14
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,433
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

15
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:41,086
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

16
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:45,178
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

17
00:13:45,378 --> 00:13:48,404
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

18
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:51,520
we don’t think what we are doing.

19
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:57,901
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

20
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:01,532
and it’s so encouraging.

21
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,833
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

22
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,891
I congratulate them, all of them.

23
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:10,947
Now try to be...

24
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,431
Try to be kind to each other.

25
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:21,132
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

26
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,264
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

27
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:31,268
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

28
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:36,299
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

29
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,686
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

30
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:42,508
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

31
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,034
and you also talk.

32
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:50,641
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

33
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:55,000
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

34
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,426
that will make [you] very happy also.

35
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:02,114
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

36
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:07,495
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

37
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:11,110
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

38
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,066
and they’ll work out many things

39
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:16,188
which we could not work out.

40
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:30,109
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

41
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:34,518
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

42
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,350
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

43
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,593
because we are next to the sea here,

44
00:15:51,794 --> 00:15:55,985
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

45
00:15:56,185 --> 00:15:58,783
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

46
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:06,803
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

47
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:14,088
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

48
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:23,459
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

49
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:28,729
people go and use it for bathrooms.

50
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,394
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

51
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:38,066
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

52
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,049
by which they wear funny dresses

53
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,495
and lead a very licentious life.

54
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:48,406
This is an insult to the sea.

55
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:53,210
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

56
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,410
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

57
00:16:57,611 --> 00:17:03,161
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

58
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:07,606
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

59
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:11,797
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

60
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,673
We cannot be disrespectful.

61
00:17:13,881 --> 00:17:17,592
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

62
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:21,929
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

63
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:28,148
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

64
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:32,280
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

65
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:37,113
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

66
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,549
Sea is so important to our life.

67
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,901
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

68
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:47,882
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

69
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:54,127
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

70
00:17:54,328 --> 00:18:00,407
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

71
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:04,823
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

72
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:08,712
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

73
00:18:08,912 --> 00:18:12,764
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

74
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:17,269
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

75
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,475
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

76
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:23,755
it will appear on the other side.

77
00:18:23,962 --> 00:18:26,104
It always keeps to its maryadas.

78
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:30,457
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

79
00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:32,419
but they keep to their maryadas,

80
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,144
they never cross their maryadas.

81
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:43,745
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

82
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:46,732
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

83
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:51,730
that it just keeps to its own line.

84
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,250
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

85
00:18:55,451 --> 00:18:57,566
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

86
00:18:57,766 --> 00:19:00,485
it will be just there.

87
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:04,263
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

88
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:08,951
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

89
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:12,477
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

90
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:17,476
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

91
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:22,944
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

92
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:26,209
all the animals that are in it.

93
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,312
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

94
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:35,681
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

95
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:38,408
and that’s why it is, we should say,

96
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:42,805
the first life came into being in the sea.

97
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:46,344
So all our forefathers, long time back,

98
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,335
must have been born in the sea,

99
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:51,290
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

100
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,324
So we have no right to insult the sea,

101
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:57,662
where our forefathers must have existed

102
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,641
and then they started coming out, one
by one

103
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:06,186
as the fish came, as a reptile.

104
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:16,646
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

105
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:21,683
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

106
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:25,517
If the depth of the sea is reduced

107
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:33,812
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

108
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:37,023
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

109
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:41,477
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

110
00:20:41,678 --> 00:20:43,965
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

111
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:46,530
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

112
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:51,333
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

113
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,979
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

114
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:57,387
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

115
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,483
deep understanding of ourselves,

116
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:01,684
because that’s the sign of dignity.

117
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:04,087
And that dignity you must have,

118
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:08,496
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

119
00:21:08,697 --> 00:21:12,653
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

120
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:17,673
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

121
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,604
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

122
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:24,711
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

123
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:30,971
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

124
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:33,522
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

125
00:21:33,723 --> 00:21:35,304
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

126
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:39,396
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

127
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:44,251
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

128
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,401
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

129
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:50,007
from places to places as we have been,

130
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:56,425
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

131
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,948
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

132
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:00,893
the whole world can be very rich.

133
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:03,223
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

134
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:07,027
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

135
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:13,381
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

136
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:17,475
And lots of wealth which is of…

137
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:22,850
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

138
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,887
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

139
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:31,201
and we people will be enriched all over.

140
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:34,728
Moreover when we carry the transport,

141
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:39,150
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

142
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:43,826
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

143
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:50,005
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

144
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:53,966
It reacts, because if there’s a light

145
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:59,351
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

146
00:22:59,551 --> 00:23:02,418
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

147
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:05,284
The sea understands Me very well,

148
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:10,610
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

149
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:15,603
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

150
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:18,173
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

151
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:23,676
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

152
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,197
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

153
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:32,556
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

154
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:37,049
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

155
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,499
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

156
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,762
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

157
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:52,547
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

158
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:57,666
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

159
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:06,202
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

160
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:09,785
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

161
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:14,990
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

162
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:18,097
In the same way we have to be;

163
00:24:18,297 --> 00:24:22,006
we have to bear the heat of others,

164
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:26,201
the anger of others and create vapours –

165
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:29,237
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

166
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:31,666
It is with Me, same thing.

167
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:35,099
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

168
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,821
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

169
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:43,581
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

170
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,026
They just start flowing as vibrations.

171
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,197
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

172
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:50,853
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

173
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,616
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

174
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:57,024
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

175
00:24:57,225 --> 00:25:03,380
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

176
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,309
As you all are here, all these vapours

177
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:08,899
as vibrations should flow.

178
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:12,810
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

179
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,773
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

180
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:18,274
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

181
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:23,154
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

182
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,751
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

183
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:29,000
Are you afraid to treat someone?

184
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:32,249
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

185
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,843
Why can’t you treat?

186
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:37,632
You all can treat them, you can help them,

187
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:42,478
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

188
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,986
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

189
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:51,593
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

190
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:55,585
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

191
00:25:55,785 --> 00:26:01,947
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

192
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:03,942
Why should God give you vibrations

193
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:08,343
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

194
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:13,406
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

195
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:19,637
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

196
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:24,834
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

197
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:28,653
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

198
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,603
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

199
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,862
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

200
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,484
if you start using these vibrations.

201
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:43,557
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

202
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:46,738
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

203
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,357
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

204
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,331
because you are not using your vibrations.

205
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:56,452
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

206
00:26:56,653 --> 00:26:59,765
whenever is possible, to help others

207
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:03,315
to get all right, to get well.

208
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,282
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

209
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:09,903
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

210
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:12,349
but at least use My photograph.

211
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,136
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

212
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:22,560
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

213
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,191
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

214
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:31,746
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

215
00:27:31,946 --> 00:27:34,835
You have to be seaworthy.

216
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:40,693
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

217
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,266
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

218
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:47,168
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

219
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,471
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

220
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,651
“We went there, then this happened,

221
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:55,087
then that happened, then this.”

222
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:58,292
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

223
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:02,120
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

224
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:05,327
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

225
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:09,566
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

226
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:14,022
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

227
00:28:14,222 --> 00:28:18,948
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

228
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:22,864
by which you can save so many.

229
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:26,661
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

230
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:29,976
that the more you give, the more you get.

231
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:34,948
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

232
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:41,708
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

233
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:45,383
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

234
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:48,916
comes back at rivers. In the same way

235
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:54,318
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

236
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:59,059
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

237
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:05,611
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

238
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:07,673
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

239
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:12,376
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

240
00:29:12,577 --> 00:29:14,505
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

241
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:18,061
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

242
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:20,702
that you can vibrate your own water,

243
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:22,756
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

244
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:25,134
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

245
00:29:25,335 --> 00:29:29,881
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

246
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:42,258
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

247
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,263
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

248
00:29:45,464 --> 00:29:47,819
but have faith in yourself.

249
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,713
As the sea has faith in itself,

250
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,239
you should have complete faith in yourself.

251
00:29:52,454 --> 00:29:55,426
You must respect your Self Realization.

252
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:59,452
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

253
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:02,090
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

254
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,485
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

255
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:10,688
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

256
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:13,688
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

257
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:18,203
I have to try to work it out this way.”

258
00:30:18,966 --> 00:30:26,584
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

259
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,772
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

260
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:35,445
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

261
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:38,430
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

262
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,069
Nothing else is needed.

263
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,745
May God bless you all.
