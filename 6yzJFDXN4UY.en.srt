1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,500
I would say that your attention becomes enlightened.

2
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,767
That means if this room is enlightened

3
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:18,267
you can see what’s wrong with this room,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
what’s the color of this room.

5
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:24,316
In the same way you start feeling your own chakras.

6
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:26,581
You start feeling your own centers

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,133
and then you don’t feel bad because you are out of yourself,

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,634
you can see yourself, you see the whole drama of yourself.

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,600
And then you say, 
“Oh, I see now, Mr. ego is coming up on you,

10
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:41,334
alright, go ahead.” You just address yourself

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,567
in quite a humorous manner that you have been doing all this.

12
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:48,500
Go ahead for a while and then you will know.

13
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,567
Like one gentleman asked me very seriously,

14
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:55,300
“Mother, if I was Napoleon in last life don’t tell me.”

15
00:00:55,767 --> 00:01:01,834
I said, “But what makes you think that you were Napoleon?

16
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,467
He said, “Because my ego is too big.

17
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:06,534
I can see it and I can draw very well.

18
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,233
I have a very good hand for drawing. He too had it.”

19
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:12,167
I said, “Now rest assured you were not Napoleon.”

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
He said, “Thank God, otherwise I would have thought how much

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,500
I’d have to fight with my ego 
if I was Napoleon in last life.”

22
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:25,667
If I tell somebody you have ego then you will be punched.

23
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,434
You cannot get out of it.

24
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:30,334
But when you start seeing your own problems,

25
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:32,652
then you know you’d better get rid of it.

26
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:37,300
For example, if I have some black spot on my shawl.

27
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,334
If you tell me, I would like to take it out.

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,400
But if I am identified with that one,

29
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:47,200
I will not like it and I will never take it out.

30
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:52,467
So the identification with,
 or we can call the misidentification

31
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:56,567
with yourself, your name, your all that it is artificial

32
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:59,400
drops out and you become an independent,

33
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,867
free personality to judge yourself.

34
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:05,634
That’s how the last judgement is going to work out

35
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:07,767
that you will judge yourself.

36
00:02:07,834 --> 00:02:09,999
You don’t need anybody else to judge you.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,111
And people come and tell me that,

38
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,938
“Mother, my Agnya chakra is catching.” 
means my ego has gone up.

39
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,632
Who will say like that?

40
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:21,141
Have you heard anybody in normal conditions saying like that,

41
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:22,833
that my ego has gone up?

42
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:27,646
But you start seeing it so clearly and you laugh at yourself,

43
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:31,921
“Oh, this Mister Ego was with me and now he is showing his results.”

44
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:35,593
So that is how you start seeing your own problems.

45
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,694
You know how to cure your own problems;

46
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:44,093
that’s how you cure your diseases, you cure your mental conditions;

47
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:47,559
you come to a balanced part. I don’t tell you;

48
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:51,840
All 10 commandments are after realization, not before that.

49
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,655
I don’t tell you don’t do, nothing of the kind,

50
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:57,230
because human beings are such that if you tell them

51
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,779
don’t do it, they will do it.

52
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:03,017
So best thing is not to tell them don’t do it.

53
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:07,037
But when the light comes in, the Sahaja Yoga today

54
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:10,264
is so wonderful that first the light comes in.

55
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,678
There’s no question of cleansing, nothing.

56
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,503
First the light comes into you

57
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,514
and then you start seeing yourself in that light

58
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,848
and correcting yourself.
