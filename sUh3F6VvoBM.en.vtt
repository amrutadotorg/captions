00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:40.260
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.180
Can you hear her there – all the way?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:05.220
Or you may use this. Better. I will just speak. All right.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:20.940
I’m very grateful to the Sahaja yogis of Vienna,

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.340
who have invited Me to this place,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:30.780
and this is My first visit to Vienna.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:48.060
This is the last state that I had to touch in Europe

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.940
and so I must say, lot of work has been already done

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.860
in Sahaja Yoga in other countries.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.940
Somehow it happened that I had to come to Vienna

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.340
after such a long time.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.780
I’m really very happy to see there are so many

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.220
seekers in Vienna.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.180
And they are the seekers of truth.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.060
But first of all, we have to understand what is truth.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.180
Whatever truth we have so far as human beings,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.980
has been known to us through our awareness,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.980
through our central nervous system.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.220
For example, if you see the flowers, the flowers are white;

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:08.500
we can see they are there - this is the truth for us.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.700
I touch this steel and I know it is cold, so I know it

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:22.740
is steel and I know it is cold - is a fact with My fingers.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.980
It is not any imagination or a mental projection to think

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.540
that this is the flute of Shri Krishna.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:51.380
Because I can see, I can hear and I can feel that I know

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.300
this is the truth, because I know through My experiences

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.660
of the central nervous system.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.460
In My own awareness as a human being I know

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.100
there is fragrance in the flowers.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:20.060
In My own understanding I know the aesthetics of this place.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.260
If you take a horse through a dirty lane,

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:33.580
he doesn’t feel the dirt and filth and the smell of that place.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.740
But a human being, when he passes through those lanes,

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.420
he knows that it’s dirty, he can’t bear it,

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.220
because his awareness is such.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.140
This is the difference of awareness in our evolution

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.380
that we have achieved as human beings.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.140
So, one has to know that whatever is going to happen to us

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.820
has to happen in our awareness.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.220
That whatever we achieve or whatever we get in our

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.900
central nervous system is absolutely logical and

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.580
can be experimented with.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.060
That we can verify it.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:48.660
It is not like a dark lane that you move on for years together.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.540
It’s not like a dark lane, dark lane, dark –

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:02.820
but is an enlightened path where you are aware

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.420
of the higher capacities of human beings.

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.220
What is the higher capacity of a saint?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.980
It is not that the kind of dress he wears or the way

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.260
he moves about.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.700
But the higher capacity of a saint is that he is collectively

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:35.740
conscious.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.620
Because he’s connected with the Spirit,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.620
which is a collective being within us.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.220
So that something has to happen in your awareness

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.580
that you should become, again I say become -

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.140
actualize the experience of collective consciousness.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.180
Like Mohammad Sahib has clearly said that,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:24.980
“In the resurrection time your hands will speak.”

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:36.300
That He said that you can feel in your hands – what hands

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.060
are going to speak, there’s not going to be any lips here –

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.140
but you are going to feel something in your hands

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.580
which is going to speak for you.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.140
Now, when we come to truth,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:59.500
we have to know about its other alternatives

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.100
and the fakeness of it.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.740
Every truth can be faked.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.340
Every flower which is living

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.580
can be made into plastic flowers.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.940
And to make plastic flower is very easy,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.620
you can make them by thousands.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:46.060
But the real flowers are rare and are real because

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:53.420
they’re actual flowers living on a living force of life.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:07.060
So the evolution is the living process of the living God.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.700
If that is the truth, then we must understand that

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.380
whatever has happened to us so far in our evolution

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:22.580
spontaneously, in the same way

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:27.380
something has to happen to us, spontaneously.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.300
Like a seed, if it has to sprout,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.380
you have to put it in the Mother Earth because

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.500
She has the quality, She has the authority to germinate it.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.220
Do we pay money to the seed to sprout?

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.180
How can you pay for God?

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.060
I can’t understand the naiveness of the Western people

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.300
not to understand that you cannot pay to someone

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:25.980
who thinks that he can deliver the spiritual life to you.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.900
These are all parasites,

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.700
and if you want to have parasites as your guru,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.460
you go ahead with it.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.220
Nobody can control you in there,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.540
because you have the freedom.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.820
The other school of thought which is revolting against

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.940
this kind of fakeness could be that they are all fake,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:09.500
that’s all falsehood, there’s no truth – that’s also wrong.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.100
So many people who have gone through the

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.180
circus of guru-shopping come to end that

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.780
we should become communists now.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.260
That is also another extreme.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.620
That’s a denial of the truth.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.580
So it is in the center there is the truth, no doubt about it,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.660
but it is not a thing that you can purchase in the market.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.460
Specially in the West people are pampered,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.220
their ego is pampered, if you can pay for something

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.700
or you can purchase something,

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.980
you can possess something.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.060
But I said, “You cannot pay for God.”

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.060
Anybody who takes money in the name of God

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.500
and lives upon it is a parasite.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.860
And the one who is a parasite cannot be your guru,

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.500
he is much less than you;

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.740
you won’t live like a parasite yourself.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.420
And the second point I told you,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.620
when it is a living process within you,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:08.140
then you must know that you cannot put in any effort.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.460
Is a simple thing of a flower becoming a fruit.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.060
Now you jump before it or stand on your head

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.980
or take out your clothes or wear any clothes –

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.260
will it become the fruit?

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.060
How much does it take to jump or to change it or to have

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:54.340
some sort of a nude body, how much does it take?

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.220
Anybody can do that.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.900
Sahaja Yoga is a path for the true seekers,

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.700
and not for the people who run after fake things

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.860
and do not want to face it.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.540
It’s a category of people who are men of God,

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:25.620
who are seeking the Truth, and who do not accept

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.060
anything that is fake.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.220
And is a category of courageous people,

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:49.460
the brave people, who can discard all that is a hang-up

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.900
or a conditioning on them.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.420
Who can discard, who can give up.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.540
So, God has given you everything.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.220
While making you a human being, in His gentle care,

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.660
He has created you a beautiful human being

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.340
and all the roots are within you.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:39.300
Now, when you try to put in your effort to find God,

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.980
then you are not spontaneous.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.060
It’s all man-made.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:59.820
And in that effort you start moving to the left or to the right.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.940
Tomorrow I will tell you in details about the left side

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.540
and the right side, but today I will just tell you that

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.980
when you move to the left, you fall into the trap of your

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:19.220
subconscious or into the collective subconscious.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:37.580
In Sanskrit it is called as Adi Bhautik.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.060
Adi Bhautik.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.580
Bhautik.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.500
Means it is the collective subconscious within us.

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.620
You get drawn into it and you start getting lost and

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:01.540
completely mesmerized and brainwashed.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.060
If you are given an ego trip on the right-hand side,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.740
you can fall a trip to that also.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:33.340
Human beings accept conditionings very fast.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.060
conditionings

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:56.220
There was an experiment with twenty people in England.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.100
They told ten people to behave like prisoners

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.420
and ten people to behave like jailers.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.060
They were just told that, “It’s a drama, you have to be

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.060
there for a month and we want to see

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.260
if there is any change in your behavior.”

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.300
And they were told again and again,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.540
“It’s an enactment, it’s not reality, it’s just enactment.”

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.060
But, when they went into the jail, the jailers became

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.580
very arrogant and egoistical, and the prisoners

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.860
became absolutely slavish and going through all the

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:59.260
hardships which these ego-oriented people poured on them.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.460
Out of the twenty, only one revolted against this

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.500
because he was beaten up by these so-called jailers

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:29.060
who were acting, actually beaten up.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.300
And they came out of the jail and they were surprised

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.740
at their own behavior.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.340
The prisoners had become so weak that they were

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.780
to be admitted in the hospital for all the tortures

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.380
they had to go through.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.740
And the other ten became so ego-oriented, perhaps

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.060
they must have joined some political party.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.300
This is the situation of human beings.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.100
Now with all this,

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.300
the masters of evil geniuses –

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.900
they come as fake gurus.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:45.060
And you are so naive, you play into it.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:56.940
They have in control lots of evil spirits with them.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.540
And they can mesmerize you so well that you’ll do all

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:09.620
kinds of stupid things whatever they want you to do.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:17.180
So they make their money, they have women,

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.660
they drink, they enjoy the life more than any king or

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.260
president or any rich man of the world.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.140
While the poor disciples are finished with their

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:45.980
all wealth, money, health – they look sickly people.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.620
One has to know that when you get your realization,

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.420
your own powers must manifest.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:07.820
So that you become collectively conscious and that

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:12.260
you are spirit, manifest the power of that collective

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.580
consciousness.

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:32.220
Now, the trouble with people is that they are not yet

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:39.100
know the knowledge of Kundalini in the real sense.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.340
I have read – I mean, I’ve seen and not read fully –

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.580
but I’ve read some of the books written by Germans

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.940
and by English and by all Western people,

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.180
and I was shocked.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:02.700
They had no knowledge about Kundalini.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.980
Leave alone the Knowledge –

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:20.900
they had no power from the Divine to awaken the Kundalini.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:30.140
They had no character of a saint, which is required

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.260
to raise the Kundalini.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:42.300
They were ugly slaves of their greed and lust,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.100
and they were using this knowledge

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.420
just to make more money.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:01.660
Now to understand the basic character of Kundalini,

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:09.060
one has to know that She is your mother.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:22.980
I’m told that German people call their motherland as

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:31.460
fatherland, but Father is just a spectator of the play.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.860
Only His Shakti, His power, the Primordial Mother,

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:51.420
the Holy Ghost does all the job to please this spectator

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.460
who is sitting alone and watching it.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:11.060
He resides in your heart as spirit.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.180
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.220
reflected within you.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:31.100
The nature of the Kundalini is that She’s the pure,

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:36.540
ultimate desire.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.180
This power is called as a residual,

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:51.420
because it has not yet manifested itself.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.540
The ultimate desire of every human soul is

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.900
to become the spirit.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.980
You may do this, you may do that, you may try

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.660
everything – ultimately you will come to the conclusion

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.580
that, “I have not become the spirit.”

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.420
So when you become the spirit, then only

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.780
the manifestation of this Kundalini takes place,

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.100
Her ascent takes place and She is the one who

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:50.140
creates the position of yoga, the union with the Divine.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.620
This is the Yoga.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.260
Also yoga means kaushalam, means the deftness,

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:16.980
the deftness, how to handle the Kundalini of others,

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:22.060
the whole knowledge of the divine laws and the divine

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:30.060
manifestation, is also yoga, is also called kaushalam.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.820
There are all types of yogas these days prevalent,

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.060
as there are all types of gurus.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:49.140
Now the physical yoga is another kind of a thing

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:56.060
which people think is the ultimate for spiritual life.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.580
This one comes from Patanjali, who lived

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.860
thousands of years back in India where we had a

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.700
very different system of life.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:20.900
Till the age of twenty-five years, the children lived

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:26.060
in the forest with their realized souls as their gurus.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.860
There, celibacy was so preserved and innocence

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.380
so respected that a person belonging to the same

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.500
university could not marry each other.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.620
The same university; the innocence;

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.980
that the students of the same university

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.340
could not marry.

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:10.940
And these universities were called as gotras.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.540
Even today, you cannot marry in the same gotra.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.940
The yama niyama, the vyayama, the one you do

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.900
the exercise, was only done by people who

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:33.980
were not married,

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.780
according to the need of a particular center

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.580
which was in trouble.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.620
We too use these exercises wherever it is needed.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.300
But today’s yoga system which we see is nothing like,

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:07.300
nothing but taking the whole box of medicine together.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.340
Without even finding out what is your prakruti, means

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.660
what is your temperament, what is the need of your

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.380
particular body, where is the Kundalini,

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.060
what you have to do to open a particular chakra

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:30.180
where you are caught up.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:42.260
I mean, nobody has that knowledge at all.

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.780
It’s such a mechanical process that has started that

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.780
we all want to be of the same size just like

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.780
a machine thing.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.220
This one is a very dangerous move because it

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.060
creates problems for the Kundalini to be awakened.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:16.980
The people who indulge into too much physical attention,

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.860
and work out too much of physical activities and

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:25.620
mental activities become futuristic people.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.740
They become very superficial and dry-tempered.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.300
With such people there’s a possibility of getting

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:48.180
people divorced and fighting and quarreling.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.460
The greatest Hatha yogi which I have known in My life

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.220
was Hitler.

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:08.340
And he used tantrikas from Tibet to get him

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.500
the power to control the ego of people.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:25.500
And he made them so violent that they could not see

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.340
what they were doing.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.580
There are many gurus who do that way today also.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.180
They can make you so violent that you cannot see

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.140
what you are doing.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.100
Or they can make you just cabbages,

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:08.180
so that you lose all your being and become somebody else.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.900
But it is done so well that people who do not know

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.580
about the knowledge of Kundalini and spirit

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.140
can be easily captured.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:36.980
I call the West as the progress of the shoot,

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:41.420
of the outside of the tree.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:51.340
They know science, politics, economics very well.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:58.820
They can create atom bombs to kill themselves.

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:04.260
They can create even worse things than that.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.060
They haven’t got the knowledge of the roots on

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:11.180
which they are growing.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.820
And the knowledge of the root only can be known

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:20.380
when you become the spirit, that’s the beginning.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.180
This is a big disadvantage for the saints who are born

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:35.580
on this beautiful side of the earth.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.780
So many seekers are born in the West.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.900
As the desire of God must have been to give them

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.980
a comfortable life, to get them unemployed, so they

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:59.500
can be used for God’s employment –

00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.060
They got watches to see, to save the time,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.460
save the time, save the time.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:23.820
For what? To go into a pub?

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.620
Or read some horrid books?

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:36.260
Or waste your life with these horrible gurus?

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.780
So, in the West we have the saints,

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.180
in the East we have the wisdom.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.580
In the West, people are seeking because

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.260
they are seekers.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.340
They are a special category of people who are born

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.660
in the West.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.980
But they lack the basic wisdom to understand

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:15.540
what is the truth.

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.060
What do we have to achieve?

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:26.300
What do we have to become?

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.420
This basic wisdom will not be told to you by the people

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:35.980
who want to make money out of you.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.860
They want to make a business out of it.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:52.900
And thus there’s a big problem for the saints of today.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:00.220
As you belong to that area which I call the shoot

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.900
of the tree, people can get enamored by the

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:07.860
superficial things.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.820
You can be impressed by somebody who tries

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.940
to pamper your ego.

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.620
pamper, pamper.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:37.580
Or could be somebody who dominates you, like Hitler.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:46.500
So it is a great responsibility of all the seekers

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:50.980
in the West to take to wisdom, first of all.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.700
Logically, you must reach right conclusions.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.620
right conclusions

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:20.420
So when it comes to spirituality, you are prepared.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:27.380
Supposing I come to Vienna from somewhere lost

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.460
conditions – how will I know this is Vienna,

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:32.060
unless and until somebody says -

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.300
this is the way to go to Vienna?

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:44.100
And how will I know it is Vienna because I should

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.220
know what Vienna is like, first of all.

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.940
So, one comes to another conclusion that the

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.380
description of the collective consciousness

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.940
must be already there in the scriptures

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.180
which are written long time back.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.220
It has to tally with findings of the psychology,

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.860
like Jung psychology.

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.340
It has to tally the many predictions; like thousands

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.140
of years back, there was a book written called

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.900
Nadi Granth

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:44.860
by Bhrigu, who was the pioneer of our astrology.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:52.060
We should find out from other sources like great poets,

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:55.100
like William Blake, I know English, has clearly written

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:59.060
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:08.220
So many such realized people, great people,

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.460
like Dante, you can say, Homer, you can say,

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:18.060
they have written about Sahaja Yoga in so many ways.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.500
If we take to all these things, then we know that

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.420
this is Vienna.

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.460
But we should not be brainwashed by people

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.220
who just give us big stories or read some book and

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.540
convert it into some other knowledge and say,

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:55.140
“This is this, this is this”, and just talk, talk, talk.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:06.940
Now the time has come, to become.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.220
Now the time has come for this divine power

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.620
to manifest itself.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.980
We see a flower becoming a fruit,

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:29.220
billions and billions of them in their seasons.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.820
We see ourselves breathing,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.140
we see ourselves digesting,

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.420
we don’t pay for it, do we?

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:50.940
Then who is doing all this?

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:53.060
Which is that power that is doing?

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.740
We don’t even think about it.

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.820
We just take it for granted.

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:07.580
Look at these eyes that are made, are the best

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:13.140
camera that you can think of, so advanced.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.180
Look at this human body, so great.

00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.420
Look at this human brain, so expansive.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:36.780
Why all this was made, and who has done it?

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:44.060
Why we have become human beings from amoeba?

00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:47.660
What is so great about human beings that they are

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:53.260
the epitome of all the Creation?

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.580
Is it just to sit down and feel guilty about all small

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:03.180
nonsensical things?

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.780
Or to weep over all mundane stuff?

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.500
weep

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:22.420
No, it is to become something that is the instrument,

00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:28.220
to know something that will give you the power.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:35.900
This all-pervading power should become your power.

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.300
Power is always connected with violence somehow

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:50.980
– at this level of human existence.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.460
But I’m talking of the power of divine love

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:06.780
that transforms this flower into fruit,

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.900
that has transformed you from amoeba stage to this,

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.060
and that is going to transform you into your state

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:24.260
of Realization.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:31.700
How an egg grows into a bird?

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.460
And how at the right time

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.940
the bird comes completely transformed from

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:48.620
the ordinary egg?

00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:57.900
This power is the power of Holy Ghost.

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.700
People do not like when I talk about Christ.

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:10.260
The other day in Belgium a lady asked Me why should

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.060
I talk about Christ in an Indian way?

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:26.820
I told her, “Was Christ born in Belgium?

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.860
Or was He born a Westerner?”

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.780
Many know that He lived in India and not in England.

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:45.820
Why, have you taken His contract,

01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:52.780
that you think you know all about Christ?

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.340
You’ll be amazed that about Christ was written

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:02.380
fourteen thousand years back in India.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:11.500
Bible is not enough to contain such a great personality.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.860
By saying, “We love God, we love Christ

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:27.140
and Christ is love”, this is all imaginary behavior.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.500
It’s just a fantasy.

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.260
Reality is that Christ exists within you

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:44.100
and He is to be awakened within you.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:52.460
It is He who said, “You are to be born again.”

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.580
What are we doing about it?

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.660
We call somebody and say, “All right, I’ll baptize

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:02.460
your child”, artificially you take some water, pour on

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:06.820
his head and say, “He’s baptized.”

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.060
This is all artificial.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:20.500
So, when people get disillusioned from this kind

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.180
of artificial behavior, they fall into another mess.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:35.740
You don’t have to go anywhere.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.580
Your spirit resides within you.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.620
You don’t have to go to the forest in seeking.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:53.540
Your Kundalini is within you.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.660
Your centers are there.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.460
The Kundalini will rise and you will become

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.860
Self-realized.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.260
As an egg becomes the transformed bird,

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:16.900
you will become the spirit.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:24.420
You don’t have to run for it.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.860
But first thing one must know that we have to know

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:33.300
all about it, first of all.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:39.740
If you are still busy with your reading and busy with

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.220
your ideas and your conditionings,

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.820
it’s not going to work out.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.620
It’s act better with the people who are simple

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.860
and not so complicated.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.380
So I would request you to ask Me some questions about it.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.420
Today is just an introduction I have given you in short.

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.300
You can ask Me questions,

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:16.100
but the questions should be

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:21.060
suggestive of your seeking, that would be better.

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.180
If you belong to any cult or any opinion,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.580
you better think about it –

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.700
what have you got out of it?

01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.980
Here I am,

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:02.300
I am saying that you have to be your spirit and

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.460
can happen through Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.220
Sahaja means spontaneous happening,

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:22.700
and yoga is the union.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:26.420
And that is what I think we have to achieve,

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.180
and that’s what you want.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.740
But I’ve seen so many people who come just to

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.740
argue with Me when they haven’t got anything,

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.060
as just like unpaid pleaders,

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.820
because they cannot accept

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:56.700
that there might have been some mistake.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.820
Human beings after all, have to make mistakes,

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.820
there’s no wrong in that.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:14.620
They should not feel guilty about it.

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.420
They should not feel guilty about anything whatsoever,

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.100
because I’m talking about God,

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.900
who is the ocean of love;

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:38.060
who is the ocean of compassion;

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:45.740
who is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.420
But we do not even understand that ocean,

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.380
how great it is.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.780
How beautifully it cleanses us,

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.060
gives us a nice bath,

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.700
beautifully traps us into nice warmth,

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:19.340
and takes us to the realm of His kingdom.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:26.060
This is happening en masse now.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:32.220
It is happening in other countries – specially in India

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.900
thousands of people have got realization in the villages.

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.820
And it should happen to all of you here.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:55.900
But if you are not seeking, I cannot force.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.860
You cannot take the horse, you can take the horse

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:10.860
up to the river, put his mouth in the river –

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.900
but the horse has to drink the water

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:24.700
and enjoy the satisfaction.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.060
This is all your freedom.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.820
You have to achieve in your freedom.

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:45.820
We cannot force it on anyone.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:55.500
So there is no need for you to be any way aggressive.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.900
Because even if I want, I may not be able

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:07.540
to give you Realization.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:15.700
It has to work out some time for some people.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:21.060
So I have to request you,

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.500
be kind to yourself and fair to yourself.

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:33.780
You are a seeker and you have to have your Realization.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:41.740
And that is why I’m here.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:47.140
I have come to give you something.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.900
That should in no way challenge your ego.

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.580
As I was telling this morning, I don’t understand

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.580
any laws, I do not understand any copyright,

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:03.380
I do not understand insurance,

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.980
I don’t know how to drive.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.460
But, one thing I know is Kundalini.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:27.660
So you should not feel hurt if I know it,

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.500
but you will know yourself.

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:43.180
You will be able to do it yourself.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.420
There’s one person in India who got realization and so

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:53.660
far he has given realization to ten thousand people.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.980
Tomorrow I will also tell you how Kundalini awakening,

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:09.340
as a by-product, manifests the curing of incurable

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.740
diseases like cancer and other diseases.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.220
How it cures mental diseases and how it takes you out

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:33.660
of the clutches of your bad habits.

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:41.340
And how you become your own guru.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.820
So I would like to have some questions from you.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.260
If you have to ask any questions, please ask Me,

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:54.340
without any fear.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.740
Thank you very much.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:02.980
May God bless you.

01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:32.260
Mataji, he asks the difference between Purusha

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.300
in Indian language and the Holy Ghost?

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.380
Purusha?

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:01.460
Purusha is the God-Almighty.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.580
Holy Ghost is His power which manifests this Universe

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:11.500
and is the Kundalini within you.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:30.420
That is the Holy Ghost. It’s called as Adi Shakti.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:44.060
Adi Shakti means Primordial Power.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:17.420
He asks what kind of meditation do you request?

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.460
That I’ll tell you. A good question.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.060
That’s what I’m going to tell you.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:36.460
Mother, he asks about the manifestations when

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.060
the Kundalini rises?

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.540
That I’m going to tell you later on – the whole thing,

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:44.620
isn’t it, it’s a complete subject which I’ll handle.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.900
I’m going to be here for three lectures now in Vienna.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.220
So in one lecture I thought of giving you the introduction,

01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.900
and later on I’m definitely going to tell you

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.340
all things about it. Everything. No secrets.

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.100
He asks what do you feel physically when the Kundalini rises?

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.100
That I will tell, just now, I will tell.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.620
That the first time you feel the all-Pervading power

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:13.700
as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:22.980
Coming out of your head also.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:30.060
And in your fingers, you start feeling it all around you.

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:39.660
He asks what happens with the breathing and with the heart?

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:44.140
You become very normal.

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.900
He tells it’s not the Kundalini then.

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.820
Why, what should happen, you should die?

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.740
You have read something, now you see for yourself.

01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.260
Reading is not the way to get convinced,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.940
is a mediocracy.

01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:10.900
You may go on reading thousands of books;

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:14.860
you cannot get your realization from books.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:29.260
Mother, do You believe that

01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:32.060
we don’t need a guru in general?

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.100
No, you do need a guru – in the sense that

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:47.460
an enlightened light can only enlighten another light.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.860
But where are the real gurus?

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.260
They are all hiding in the Himalayas or some

01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.700
other places, and when I tell them, they say,

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.500
“We are not interested in these people,

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.180
they are not seekers.”

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:15.540
The only people who are interested in your purses

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.100
are down here, in the market.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:31.300
With great persuasion I sent one guru to America,

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.260
who returned within three days.

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.060
He said, “I had enough of these Americans –

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.780
horrible people.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.380
They only understand dollars,

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.460
they don’t want to have Reality.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.380
They have no time for that.”

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.500
Mother, he asks if to get Realization is only possible

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.300
after certain meditation, or if you can prepare

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:34.060
the people to get this experience?

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:38.060
If you are a human being, you can get Realization.

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.740
You are already prepared

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.060
because you are a human being.

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:55.900
But if your human sustenance is little bit spoiled,

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.300
then the Kundalini, though it comes up, it may go down

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:03.700
a little, come up a little, and it will establish itself.

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.980
Mother, he doesn’t understand how he comes to

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.740
the spontaneous experience?

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.580
He thinks, he has to meditate, or something.

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.340
You cannot meditate, you go into meditation.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.660
That’s very simple, I’ll tell you what happens really.

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.660
You have to put your hands towards Me like this.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.580
How you see the [tree] leaves become green,

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:56.340
in the same way you put your hands towards Me,

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:02.500
and as I am a Realized Soul, the information goes

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.940
through these fingers.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.660
Through them the information goes to the Kundalini,

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.980
and She rises. Spontaneously.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.620
Like the Mother Earth, when you put the seed

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.100
in the Mother Earth, the seed knows it’s

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:21.540
the Mother Earth and the primule –

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:27.780
the germinating power – arises by itself.

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:49.540
Then you are in meditation, you don’t have to do

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.900
meditation, you are in meditation.

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.100
When it is obstructed in some people,

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:08.500
you can see with the naked eye the pulsation

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:13.180
of the Kundalini at the sacrum bone.

01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.180
You can hear the rising of the Kundalini

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:24.060
with the stethoscope, even you can see with your

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.740
naked eyes if there is obstruction.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.660
When She crosses this Agnya Chakra, then you become

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.420
thoughtlessly aware.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.060
You are aware, but there is no thought.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.580
There are many who talk about thoughtless awareness,

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.140
but they never achieve it.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.180
Then you go beyond, when it comes onto the head here,

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.620
you feel the throbbing on your head here.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.900
And then you start feeling the cool breeze coming

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:17.300
out of your head.

01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.700
We must know that what we can do like jumping,

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:29.460
doing all other things, can be done by everyone.

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:39.980
But the living force does something that we cannot do.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:44.820
We cannot make the cool breeze come out of our head,

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.740
can we?

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.980
And you are not to be satisfied,

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.100
give a false certificate about it;

01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.340
you have to certify yourself.

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:11.060
Then your fingers are enlightened.

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:15.620
Because these are the seven centers – five, six

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.940
and seven.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:26.220
About which I’ll tell you tomorrow in details.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:31.900
They will all get enlightened.

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.460
And from the fingers like this you can make out

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:39.780
what chakra of a person is catching.

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:46.780
If the left side is catching that means there’s

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.580
an emotional problem;

01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:50.580
if the right side is catching means there’s physical

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:54.300
or mental problem.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.300
Then you can also know the permutations and

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:14.580
combinations which are decoded, you can verify them.

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.380
Sitting down here you can find out about anyone,

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:21.940
even the dead people –

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:26.820
were they realized or not?

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:38.580
If they were realized you will start getting a cool breeze.

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.820
That’s the rapport established with the Divine.

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.860
Any absolute question you ask – and if it is the answer

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:58.260
is ‘yes’ – then you get a cool breeze flowing.

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:08.820
If somebody is a false person, you get burnings.

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:14.260
If he’s a evil genius, you might get even blisters,

01:25:14.580 --> 01:25:16.220
little bit.

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:25.300
If somebody is going to die, then you get numbness

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.060
on the fingers.

01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.820
If somebody is going to die, then you get

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.380
numbness on the fingers.

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.860
So once you know about the chakras, then you have

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.300
to know how to correct it.

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:54.060
All this knowledge is your own,

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:59.060
and is to be given to you.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.580
It has to be all free, as I said.

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:07.980
Has to be all free, as I said.

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:15.620
It is, I would say, I’m like a cashier in the bank.

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.060
And I am just giving you what you have got already

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.460
within yourself.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.380
Also the knowledge to know the things that

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.340
you have got.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.940
And how to use them.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:45.700
It cannot be believed that there

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.820
could be someone like that.

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:58.420
There have been many more like this - I am One of them.

01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.060
May God bless you.

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:11.700
Which kind of religion do you have, Mother?

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:16.700
Is the religion of all the religions.

01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:21.180
Because it’s the essence of everything.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:28.260
Actually all the religions started with life’s force only.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.740
All the incarnations and prophets were true

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:38.180
and all connected.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.340
Absolute concord.

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.540
And it’s such a coordinated thing within ourselves

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.260
and they are placed within ourselves.

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.700
But all these beautiful flowers which grew onto

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.260
the Tree of Life were taken away by each one of them,

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:09.980
and they have said, “This is mine, this is mine.”

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:21.220
The flowers are dead and ugly.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.100
Mataji, many of us have learned that it is extremely

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:36.300
dangerous to wake up this Kundalini,

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.140
I’m sure You know this.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.340
Yes, yes, they all say so.

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.220
That’s the only escape they can have, My child.

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.580
That’s the only escape they can have.

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.780
That is a very difficult thing is, your karmas,

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.580
your this thing.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.220
See, if I have to handle that camera,

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:08.220
I will say it is very difficult – beyond Me.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.100
But I should be honest to say that,

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:18.220
“I don’t know anything about it.”

01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.940
I must be knowing something about it,

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:29.580
that I say so positively.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:39.260
Three questions. One by one, now, this gentleman

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.820
has asked, this side.

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:52.420
Is there any connection to these para-psychological powers?

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:57.580
No that is Adi Bhautik. Parapsychology.

01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:00.700
The parapsychology has to deal with Adi Bhautik,

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:06.260
is the left side, the collective subconscious.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:11.820
You cannot explain anything, what you are doing,

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.620
you see, you are flying in the air, what you are doing,

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:19.540
you don’t know. How you are curing, you don’t know.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:25.980
You are blind.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:31.860
But in Sahaja Yoga, even a child knows.

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:38.140
If he’s a born-realized, he knows.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:45.060
He knows what chakras people are catching.

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:50.820
If they are very highly Self-realized souls, they also

01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:54.260
know about Kundalini.

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.300
There are many children these days born

01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:03.100
who are realized souls.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.900
But those who are not realized are the parents,

01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:13.300
and they don’t understand their children.

01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.660
Great saints are taking their birth on this earth

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:21.380
these days.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:30.460
Till you get Realization, you won’t understand them.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:35.500
If we have to discuss colors with blind people,

01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.500
how can we?

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.620
If our eyes are open, if the light is on,

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.060
we can see everything.

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:52.980
It is just a wee bit of jumping, the breakthrough –

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:56.100
it’s a little bit.

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:04.220
Is a very little bit of jumping for the breakthrough.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:26.340
Mother, he has something to do with geometry.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:31.660
Is there some power in geometric shapes?

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:33.900
Of course.

01:32:34.420 --> 01:32:38.540
Yes, yes, of course.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:41.780
Everything has power.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:45.180
But you don’t know the essence of anything.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.740
Mathematics has powers –

01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:53.140
how do you get your formulae?

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.620
Your formulae, say for a pi?

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:29.420
(Yogi announces following lectures in Urania, Vienna)

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.060
Now, we can say – what did you say, Gregoire?

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:18.620
Gregoire: I’m just suggesting that as most of the

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:21.420
questions are going to be answered in your next lectures…

01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.860
Is better to write down. You see, I’ll answer them,

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:27.740
is better, in My speech I will give you answers about it,

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:33.260
but moreover it’s the ocean of knowledge.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:42.180
When you will yourself have the light,

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.740
you can see through, yourself.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:52.260
Now there are some books also written by Sahaja yogis

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:56.380
for Sahaja Yoga seekers.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.420
But we don’t give them to people who are not yet

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:05.540
established.

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:10.540
Unless and until your realization is established,

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.700
these books are not given to you.

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:23.140
Because they can be like any other book,

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:32.380
and you may just neglect your growth.

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:01.580
What Gopi Krishna wrote about Kundalini… ?

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:06.580
Gopi Krishna. – You sell that book off. -

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.500
Who is Gopi Krishna?

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:14.540
Has he given Realization to anyone?

01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.740
What is his authority to write on Kundalini?

01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:21.420
He writes like a villager who touches an electric point

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:25.460
and says that electricity burns you.

01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:35.220
He is like – you go and see his private life –

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:39.700
what sort of a life he leads.

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.740
At least you must know that when he talks of Kundalini,

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:48.180
he talks as if he’s a third party. Like a shock.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.980
You see, like, “I say I get a shock out of it,” means

01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:54.940
I don’t know anything about it.

01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:01.900
You want to have another shock?

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.260
Why do you believe in him? What has he done?

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:10.580
You see, just because of reading a book,

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.820
are you satisfied, my child? You are a seeker,

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.460
why should you be satisfied with a book?

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.780
Why don’t you see for yourself?

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:22.060
Again I’ve said, just a book he has bought,

01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.700
and he is wasting everybody’s time for one book.

01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:30.420
He has done no good to anyone.

01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:34.500
What good he has done is only he has taken sixty-five

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.220
lakhs of rupees from Indian government

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:41.380
for a so-called research center in India

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:45.580
which is not yet started.

01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:55.620
Because the then minister who was in charge

01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:00.100
was also a Kashmiri.

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:04.700
I have to tell you one thing:

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.100
Indians are very intelligent people

01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:12.780
and if they come to dishonesty, no-one can beat them.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:29.300
They are past masters, they are past masters.

01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:39.660
I feel otherwise also about Indians that

01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:45.420
the attacks you did on them as white people,

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:48.780
was a gross attack – outside.

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.940
Now this is a subtle attack is coming on you, from them,

01:38:53.420 --> 01:38:56.860
which you must understand.

01:38:58.740 --> 01:38:59.580
Loudly.

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:17.460
So, one must not just believe into something that is published,

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:22.460
how much does it take to create a book?

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.180
Because you have read one book, you have no business

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:35.620
to take the time of others. It’s not being civil.

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:46.980
Thank you. What else, please?

01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:05.380
Mother, he thinks it needs a certain maturity

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:09.260
of character to raise the Kundalini.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.940
Of course, no doubt about it.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:20.420
But this maturity you get with the power of your spirit.

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:29.860
When your spirit shines through,

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.740
your attention becomes enlightened.

01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.740
And then you grow into new areas.

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:55.340
We can give you the example of a bird which comes out of an egg.

01:40:58.580 --> 01:41:02.060
Actually, in Sanskrit language a bird is called as dvija,

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:07.340
and a Self-realized person is also called as dvija.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:16.420
It means ‘twice-born’.

01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:21.860
First the bird comes out of the egg, then it tries

01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.940
to fly a little bit, and ultimately

01:41:27.620 --> 01:41:31.100
it receives the power and it gets confident and it

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:35.860
spreads its wings around.

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.940
But in the beginning, the mother bird looks after

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.180
the baby bird.

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:02.980
She hides behind and calls the little bird

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:08.180
so the little bird takes the courage to fly.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:17.420
And that’s how it works out.

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:31.260
Now we have got many people from Italy and from England

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:35.820
and from Switzerland and from Australia,

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:39.740
who have come to help Me here.

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:52.660
They are realized souls,

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:56.900
they know how to swim.

01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:02.060
So, next time I don’t have to import people from outside,

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.420
I hope in Vienna,

01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:18.580
because you yourself will grow into beautiful people,

01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:24.700
all-powerful and all-glorious.

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.860
I am sure, I can see that.

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:36.420
But be truthful.

01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.860
Be honest to yourself,

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:44.180
and kind to yourself.

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:50.340
Because you are seekers and you do not know your past.

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:57.540
So get your crowning glory,

01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:04.460
and enjoy the eternal bliss of heavens.

01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:09.380
All right.

01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:13.980
Now I think we should go in for the experiment.

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:23.100
It will not take much time.

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:31.700
So, one should go in for it. Without making any effort,

01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:37.100
you have to just put your hands like this.

01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:44.500
Take out your shoes,

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:49.580
just for the Mother Earth to help us.

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:55.300
Put your feet on the ground.

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.940
Please, put your feet on the ground, straight.

01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:10.860
And just spread your hands, just like this.

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.940
And close your eyes.

01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.900
The gentleman who asked question, if he wants to go,

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.740
he can go away, or if he has to sit here,

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.060
you better put your hands like this.

01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:34.940
Because those who are adamant spoil the vibrations of others.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:44.620
They are just here to disturb.

01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:54.460
If they want to have shocks, let them have shocks.

01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.060
All right – put your hands like that.

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:06.500
Close your eyes, please.

01:46:08.580 --> 01:46:12.060
You have to keep your eyes shut.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:18.500
It is just the other way than the hypnotism.

01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:31.980
Now keep your hands straight, relaxed on your lap.

01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:40.980
And keep your eyes shut.

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.860
Be comfortable.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.260
Don’t put in any effort, please.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:00.500
Just keep your eyes shut, that’s important.

01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:08.300
Because when the Kundalini rises above your Agnya,

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:13.540
if the eyes are open, it will be hindered.

01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:28.420
Now few instructions I’ll give you

01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.140
how to raise your Kundalini.

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:40.580
But don’t open your eyes.

01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.380
Put your left hand towards Me

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.420
and right hand on your heart.

01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:57.540
The hand towards Me should be on your lap,

01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:00.740
the way it was before.

01:48:03.180 --> 01:48:07.220
On your lap, upward.

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:13.780
Now putting the hand on the spirit

01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:17.340
you ask a question in your heart,

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:23.380
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:34.820
Ask it thrice.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:46.540
What are you feeling?

01:48:54.860 --> 01:49:01.900
Please put your right hand at the left side of your neck,

01:49:03.260 --> 01:49:05.660
right hand.

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:14.500
From the front.

01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:21.420
Again say it.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:35.900
Now, this is the problem of the West, all the time,

01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:40.820
I find people feel guilty for nothing at all.

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:56.740
And say in your heart,

01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:03.060
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:18.980
Just say it eight times that, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:51.060
Now put the hand down below, on the stomach

01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:01.700
and ask a question, “Mother, am I my own guru?”

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:08.820
Ask ten times.

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:14.100
Put the right hand on your stomach

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:20.140
and ask a question, “Mother am I my own guru?”

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:37.940
Left hand towards Me

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:46.780
and on the stomach

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:48.220
and ask the question,

01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:52.860
“Mother am I my own guru?”

01:51:54.700 --> 01:52:00.780
Left hand should be kept on the lap. Where is your lap?

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.180
Ask the question ten times. Say loudly.

01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:14.820
“Mother am I my own guru?”

01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:25.660
Now just raise the hand again to your heart,

01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:33.540
and say, “Mother I am the spirit.”

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:47.060
Say it twelve times.

01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:52.460
This is the number of sub-plexuses we have.

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:04.780
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:38.700
Now put this hand again at the neck and say thrice,

01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:45.420
“Mother I am not guilty.”

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:52.900
This is very important.

01:54:00.660 --> 01:54:05.220
Now put the right hand across your forehead.

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:15.260
Now you have to say, “Mother I forgive everyone,

01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:23.820
with your heart, with honesty you say it twice.

01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:38.060
Now put the hand on top of your head,

01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:48.260
touching in the center with your fingers,

01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:52.740
where you had the soft bone,

01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:57.060
and move it clockwise.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:55:03.740
Move your scalp clockwise, backwards and forwards.

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:12.540
Now raise your hand and see

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.980
if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:35.060
What’s it?

01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:39.980
Higher. Higher.

01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:57.300
Better.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:00.820
Warm. It’s hot.

01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:05.220
So now you put your left hand on top of your head …

01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:13.300
and see if it is cool.

01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:20.300
Better.

01:56:34.220 --> 01:56:37.460
Again raise your right hand

01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:41.580
and put the left hand on the liver.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.300
Put your right hand on the head.

01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:50.140
Liver.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:59.340
Left hand on the liver. That’s wrong.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:02.900
Good.

01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:12.980
Put them left to the right now if you can.

01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.340
Put them left to the right.

01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:18.220
If you can put them left to the right.

01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:21.260
And then raise it. Left to the right, left to the right.

01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:24.620
That’s all right.

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:29.660
Now see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.620
Ah, better.

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:51.660
Now put both the hands towards Me.

01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:02.260
Now see if there’s cool breeze coming in your hands.

01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:11.300
Just see it.

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:14.060
You go round.

01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:36.780
All right?

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.460
See if he can feel it?

01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:59.260
Lower. Press it hard. Press it hard.

01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:19.700
Just feel his head. Ask him to be comfortable.

01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:30.620
Please don’t feel guilty.

01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:33.820
It will work out.

02:00:25.180 --> 02:00:28.860
How is it? Started?

02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.420
Hah. Right.

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.940
Don’t think about it. It starts working.

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.180
The cool breeze is coming out of many people.

02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:23.860
Just see your, raise your hand and see for yourself.

02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:32.060
Say that the cool breeze is coming out of your head

02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:36.660
in many people and see for yourself.

02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:49.820
And don’t think about it.

02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:34.980
Right.

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:55.540
Shri Mataji sends cool breeze through the microphone

02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:06.860
Its better now.

02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:50.740
First you will feel it on top of your head,

02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.180
and then you will feel it on your fingertips,

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:57.980
as you’ll be growing.

02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:06.780
But some of you might feel both the things.

02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:16.300
They’re feeling it?

02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:53.500
Better?

02:06:54.260 --> 02:06:57.180
Better now?

02:07:28.380 --> 02:07:33.140
Put it on the heart.

02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:39.500
Little higher. Press it hard.

02:08:47.060 --> 02:08:49.660
This side. Move it in the center of the heart.

02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:54.980
In the center, in the center of the heart, this side,

02:08:55.660 --> 02:09:01.540
in the center heart. Press it hard.

02:09:20.060 --> 02:09:21.380
Put it at the Kundalini.

02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:25.420
Put your hand at the Kundalini. Press it hard.

02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:30.140
Little higher. Like that.

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:38.460
Place the other hand like that outside.

02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.740
Left Swadhisthana.

02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:10.220
Right Swadhisthana.

02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:06.620
Some of you have to say again that,

02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:09.780
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.660
Now you have to say,

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:19.340
“Mother, please give me my realization.”

02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:30.620
You have to ask because I cannot overcome your freedom.

02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:56.540
Right heart.

02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:02.220
Ask seven times please.

02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:50.420
Once you feel the cool breeze you’ll tie up …

02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:54.100
all the Sahaja yogis should tie them up.

02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.580
Those who are feeling the cool breeze over their head,

02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:26.380
please raise your hands, all of you.

02:15:31.620 --> 02:15:33.860
You can see for yourself.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:49.980
Just move your hand up and down.

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:12.380
He’s got it.

02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.740
Raise your hand if you have got cool breeze in the hand.

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:31.820
Raise them.

02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:38.740
Got it? Horrible. But it will go out.

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:42.780
You’ll have to give up that man.

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.140
But to keep it up and to establish it

02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:51.340
you have to listen to us.

02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:00.460
You have got it because of your seeking

02:17:03.900 --> 02:17:07.060
but it will go down

02:17:09.260 --> 02:17:12.420
in case you have problems

02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:21.300
or you are doing things which should not be done.

02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:26.860
So please listen to us.

02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:30.540
Again tomorrow please come

02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:38.060
and you’ll grow more

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:48.420
and you will find the difference tomorrow again.

02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:56.220
You must take out everything that is in your neck in the night.

02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:01.420
Take out your watches.

02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:05.100
Place yourself free.

02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:12.060
And they will give you the photograph.

02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:14.820
Have you got? Today?

02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:19.980
All right, tomorrow they’ll give you the photograph.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:28.180
And tomorrow again we have to re-establish.

02:18:35.220 --> 02:18:39.900
Please don’t think about it and discuss it.

02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:48.500
It is beyond thought.

02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:54.060
Maintain your peaceful behavior.

02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:04.540
May God bless you.

02:19:06.300 --> 02:19:10.660
I will teach you now how to raise your Kundalini.

02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:19.140
Get your eyes open.

02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:38.140
You put your hand in the centre of Kundalini, left hand.

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:45.500
And now start rolling, your right hand.

02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:49.420
This is the hand of your action.

02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:55.540
This way. Take it forward, downward,

02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:58.100
backwards and upwards.

02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:06.940
Now put up your hands as much as you can

02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:11.780
and give it a knot, to your Kundalini.

02:20:13.500 --> 02:20:15.700
That’s the first time.

02:20:17.620 --> 02:20:21.060
Now take another, awakening.

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:23.860
Move your hand again the same way slowly.

02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.060
Your hand will roll itself.

02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:29.940
When it is cleared out it will move much faster,

02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:33.180
but do not force it.

02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:37.540
Now take it on top of your head and give it one knot,

02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:38.540
slowly, turn it quite a lot

02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:42.220
and give it a knot and take it down.

02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.900
Now take another one.

02:20:48.380 --> 02:20:51.580
This is the last and the third one.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:05.380
Now take your hands as far as possible and give a big...

02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:07.820
Now do tie these knots -

02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:16.540
one, two and three and bring down.

02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:23.140
Do your hands like this.

02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:27.380
Throw away everything and now see.

02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:33.500
Now see the flow in the hands.

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:39.340
Feeling the cool breeze?

02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:44.780
Some of you will definitely feel it.

02:21:53.940 --> 02:21:57.180
You’ll feel very peaceful, comfortable,

02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:00.380
and you’ll sleep very well.

02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:07.100
Wear plain clothes,

02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.140
loose clothes in the night

02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:14.580
loose clothes and plain; plain; means not colored

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:26.940
and when you come tomorrow, don’t discuss it.

02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:33.940
I’m here for two days and I’m sure I’ll establish it before going.

02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:45.220
I have to make a humble request,

02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:47.780
to people who are wearing orange clothes and all that

02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.900
please take them out.

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:08.180
If time comes tomorrow I’ll tell you the secret

02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:12.140
of that also.

02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:17.420
Listen to Me for six-seven days when you with Me.

02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:33.780
I’m your Mother and I’ve come here to tell you

02:23:34.220 --> 02:23:38.660
something that is the Truth.

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:44.700
So just listen to Me, wear simple dresses,

02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.740
tomorrow come in a simple dress, not tight dresses,

02:23:50.180 --> 02:23:52.620
so that Kundalini is easily...

02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:03.100
Something normal, wear something normal,

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:06.140
whatever is normal for Vienna people,

02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:09.500
they should wear that way.

02:24:11.220 --> 02:24:14.140
Nothing abnormal.

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:18.220
May God bless you.
