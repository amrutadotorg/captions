WEBVTT

00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:12.248
This is the promise of this Mahayoga.

00:00:12.328 --> 00:00:17.553
I hope Delhi people will understand it and will be able

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.270
to achieve their Self-realization in this visit of Mine.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.138
It is very important, time is very important, it is running short, I think,

00:00:25.218 --> 00:00:29.040
and people have to realize it, this is the Last Judgment that is being promised.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.792
Only through Kundalini you're going to be judged otherwise there's no way out.

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:35.761
This is the Last Judgment and don't miss it.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.102
The time is running short - I'm telling all the people
that please be careful.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:44.932
Bring all your friends, tell all your people, get it for yourself and be established

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:49.616
and enjoy the beauty of the Spirit and enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:53.522
who is your very, very loving Father, who wants to give you this.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.946
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:09.936
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,
very important, it’s very important.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:18.295
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.630
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.937
maybe in the evening, anytime.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.690
But you will know that you are meditating when

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.865
you can get into thoughtless awareness.

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:33.039
Then you will know, your reaction will be zero.

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.316
Look at something you will just look at it,

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:38.600
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.640
You won`t react.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.609
When that reaction is not there then everything, you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:52.610
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.086
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.316
you are one with the Divine.

00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:03.066
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:08.158
every moment of your life and looks after you.

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:12.483
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.683
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:25.668
We have to accept that human beings are not at that level

00:02:25.748 --> 00:02:30.268
to understand what's wrong with them.

00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:34.314
They do not want to accept.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:40.288
To them, aggression is the only way

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:44.608
they can propound their own goodness.

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.895
So what is the solution?

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:57.975
The solution is that we should give all of them Self Realisation.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:04.248
They should get their Self Realisation,

00:03:05.328 --> 00:03:08.048
then only things will improve.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:09.741
Now, you might say

00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:14.968
that "Mother in those days of strife and struggle and fighting.

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:22.471
It will work out. Circumstances will tell them.

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:27.228
Life will be so difficult

00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:34.568
with all the time weapons hanging on their heads,

00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:39.568
that they have to also seek the Truth" .

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:45.088
It has to be done very genuinely.

00:03:48.015 --> 00:03:52.488
If they are seeking the Truth, they will be surprised

00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:59.688
that this world is one, all human beings are one,

00:04:00.528 --> 00:04:04.441
and that is the destiny of human beings.

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:09.688
But for that, so many are to be killed,

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:13.488
so many are to be destroyed,

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:18.248
because they don't learn lesson in an easy way.

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:30.208
Now your job is to give them Self Realisation,

00:04:33.134 --> 00:04:36.134
and change the people.

00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:43.381
That's the real thing you have to do as gurus.

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:49.229
Today I'm going to tell you where He resides

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.561
and how we have to awaken Him

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.101
and is so important about Christ's life

00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:59.960
and why did He die on the cross when He could kill every one of them

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.125
and destroy the whole universe.

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:08.989
He has got eleven rudras. That is He has got eleven powers to destroy.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.173
When He will come in His real form,

00:05:11.253 --> 00:05:14.498
then there will be no time for us to think,

00:05:14.578 --> 00:05:17.062
no time for us to meditate,

00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:20.570
no time for Me to counsel or to redeem you.

00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:24.474
That time is such

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:29.070
that you will be just sorted out,

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:33.784
no arguements, no talking, no questioning.

00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:37.594
You will be just redeemed

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:42.745
by just being get sent to the hell or to heaven.

00:05:44.181 --> 00:05:47.257
There won't be any compromise at that time,

00:05:47.337 --> 00:05:52.888
when His powers of the eleven rudras will start working.

00:05:54.205 --> 00:05:58.518
Even today there are people who do not believe in the incarnation of Christ.

00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:07.644
Shri Ganesha has four hands

00:06:09.061 --> 00:06:16.560
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:23.311
is the one you have to be careful about.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:30.894
That is His job

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:36.061
and if you neglect Him,

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:40.433
that force will act

00:06:42.386 --> 00:06:45.939
and act so vehemently

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:48.814
that despite your realization

00:06:48.894 --> 00:06:53.727
you may not be able to save yourself.

00:06:54.353 --> 00:06:57.730
Do not take your realization for granted.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.394
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

00:07:00.913 --> 00:07:04.623
your realization has no meaning at all.

00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:06.744
Watch yourself,

00:07:08.102 --> 00:07:11.228
have you got adulterous eyes?

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:20.712
Have you got an adulterous mind?

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:31.061
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:36.148
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:07:36.228 --> 00:07:42.228
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:07:42.893 --> 00:07:44.684
money

00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:50.022
and position,

00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:52.075
power.

00:07:55.873 --> 00:08:06.529
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha, Nirmal Ganesha.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:17.024
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:08:17.936 --> 00:08:23.519
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:29.852
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:08:31.269 --> 00:08:34.329
In relationships,

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:40.400
in attitudes,

00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:46.070
in behavior,

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:53.917
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

00:08:58.436 --> 00:09:06.522
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:11.936
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:18.560
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

00:09:19.144 --> 00:09:23.730
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:30.730
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.314
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:41.852
Everything that is done against Him after realization

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:46.468
will tell upon you

00:09:49.628 --> 00:09:55.939
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:00.439
as absolutely degraded people.

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:05.035
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

00:10:05.115 --> 00:10:11.739
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

00:10:16.322 --> 00:10:22.853
But the area of Sahasrara is the realm of God.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:32.041
When the Brahmarandra opens fully,

00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:36.246
then the heavens open within yourself.

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:49.199
The Kundalini, which has risen up and given you Realization,

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:53.012
creates that subtle opening, by which

00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:59.659
the Divine starts pouring all its subtleties inside your brain.

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:06.018
But if you are pressing it from both the sides with these balloons,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:09.587
sometimes opening, sometimes closing, sometimes opening,

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:14.110
the Divine recedes Its attention. You must know that.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.194
The attention is receded back and if it is done many a times,

00:11:18.274 --> 00:11:22.141
the Divine doesn't bother.

00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:31.683
So it is you who has to achieve that state

00:11:31.763 --> 00:11:37.231
and all of us can achieve that state of Nirvikalpa.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:44.613
In that there is just progression.

00:11:44.693 --> 00:11:48.552
After Nirvikalpa you cannot come down.

00:11:48.632 --> 00:11:53.174
If somebody is still
going up and down, up and down,

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:59.493
he should know he is still not up to the point

00:11:59.573 --> 00:12:03.284
and he should face up to himself

00:12:03.364 --> 00:12:07.665
and tell himself or herself that

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:14.361
"No, I have to be into Nirvikalpa,

00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:18.159
where I do not come down."

00:12:19.652 --> 00:12:23.800
The people who are not in the Nirvikalpa state

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.059
are not going to be saved. I am very sorry to say that.

00:12:36.627 --> 00:12:41.548
They are not going to be saved.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.300
They will be punished.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.857
May not be in the same way those who are not Realized souls,

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:56.706
but they will not occupy

00:12:56.786 --> 00:13:01.121
the seats in the realm of God Almighty.

00:13:02.044 --> 00:13:06.184
At least you must reach the state of Nirvikalpa.

00:13:09.677 --> 00:13:13.050
I am just the potential energy,

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.983
as the energy is coming from somewhere which is stored

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:19.417
and if I asked you,

00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:22.412
you would not even know where it is stored.

00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:25.879
It is through your behaviour,

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:28.946
through your pure lights,

00:13:29.026 --> 00:13:31.546
through your fragrance,

00:13:31.626 --> 00:13:35.728
people are going to know God Almighty.

00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:41.361
There are some, which can blacken the Face;

00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:43.795
they are lights no doubt,

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:46.361
but can blacken the Face

00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:48.655
if there are impurities,

00:13:48.735 --> 00:13:51.289
blacken the Face of the Divine,

00:13:51.369 --> 00:13:55.495
blacken the Face of your Creator.

00:13:55.575 --> 00:14:00.362
And that is what, one has to be careful,

00:14:00.442 --> 00:14:07.444
that we are not blackening the Name
of God by our misbehaviour.

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:10.196
Now listen to Me very carefully,

00:14:10.276 --> 00:14:15.096
If there is no light out of the lamp,

00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:19.317
it does not blacken nor enlighten.

00:14:19.397 --> 00:14:24.831
But if there is a light,

00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:30.822
it can blacken as well as enlighten.

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:33.817
It’s only the Sahaja Yogis

00:14:33.897 --> 00:14:39.571
who can blacken or enlighten
the Name of God Almighty.

00:14:39.651 --> 00:14:43.605
Say, for example, if you have a fake man,

00:14:43.685 --> 00:14:46.772
he doesn’t blacken the Name of God

00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:49.172
because he is himself black,

00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:52.477
so nobody’s bothered about that.

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:58.211
If there is a person who is teaching about God

00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:01.440
or talking about God, about religion

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.090
and making money out of it,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.917
he blackens his own name.

00:15:06.997 --> 00:15:10.759
He does not blacken the Name of God Almighty.

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:15.993
The Name of God, cannot be blackened,

00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:18.838
It’s ever shining.

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:27.376
But it’s only a Sahaja Yogi which can form that cloud to cover It.

00:15:27.456 --> 00:15:32.773
They can only finish the hope of this world.

00:15:32.853 --> 00:15:38.739
They can only bring the real
destruction of this world.

00:15:38.819 --> 00:15:43.086
They will be held responsible.

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:46.586
And they should be punished in time,

00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:53.038
so that the Name of God should not be ruined.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:58.725
For they have been given the right
to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:15:58.805 --> 00:16:00.807
others are outside.

00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:04.896
They are the only ones who can abuse the right.

00:16:04.976 --> 00:16:08.635
Those who are outside this building,
cannot spoil it.

00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:11.068
You have the special privilege

00:16:11.148 --> 00:16:14.934
to enter into this beautiful building.

00:16:15.014 --> 00:16:22.874
You have got this right because of the
great things you have done in previous lives.

00:16:22.954 --> 00:16:27.608
And if you now want to spoil it,

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:34.843
you’d better understand that
you will be very severely punished.

00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:40.910
The light which can enlighten can also burn.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:48.659
But this light will burn all those
who try to burn the Kingdom of God.

00:16:52.513 --> 00:17:01.288
The Ganesha’s fifth power is the power of wisdom

00:17:01.368 --> 00:17:08.146
and that whatever He knows He can draw it and write it down.

00:17:09.983 --> 00:17:14.377
Even that power you have got.

00:17:14.457 --> 00:17:21.638
When you are raising the Kundalini, you talk to the person in such a manner

00:17:21.718 --> 00:17:27.619
that a person becomes wise.

00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:34.976
And you also talk to him only that which is wisdom

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:43.388
and also you write or show him figures, automatically which are right.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.642
Even if you don’t remember your figures, they’ll come out right.

00:17:54.926 --> 00:18:00.866
Now the three powers of Adi Shakti work in you.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:05.220
One gives you longevity

00:18:09.127 --> 00:18:13.768
and clear-cut idea about your desires.

00:18:18.012 --> 00:18:21.399
See, if your desires are right,

00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:27.885
all your desires are fulfilled by this power – all your desires, all!

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.916
But the first one, one should know, that your desires should be right.

00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:42.100
So you should know also that

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:47.103
our destiny is all also guided and looked after.

00:18:47.183 --> 00:18:50.217
You are already blessed people,

00:18:50.297 --> 00:18:52.617
there is no doubt about it.

00:18:52.697 --> 00:18:58.057
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

00:18:58.696 --> 00:19:02.177
It will all work out very well, you will see,

00:19:02.257 --> 00:19:08.617
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:16.097
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

00:19:16.177 --> 00:19:21.177
This is the promise of Diwali

00:19:22.217 --> 00:19:28.977
to you all, that you will reach highest

00:19:29.057 --> 00:19:33.257
and the noblest way of life.

00:19:36.277 --> 00:19:41.437
Every word I say will be there

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:45.759
to prove what I say is there.

00:19:48.337 --> 00:19:51.337
Whatever petty problems you have,

00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:54.130
they'll all be washed off.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.337
All these are the messages from the Divine,

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:03.097
you don't have to worry about petty things,

00:20:03.177 --> 00:20:10.069
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

00:20:10.737 --> 00:20:14.057
Your destiny will work it out.

00:20:14.137 --> 00:20:20.930

Whenever you will remember me anywhere by just closing your eyes,

00:21:06.272 --> 00:21:08.973
at that moment I'll come to you with all my powers,

00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:13.688

But you will have to be Mine. This is very important.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.734
If you are Mine then I shall not be late even for a moment.

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:25.242
I shall be before you.

00:21:25.322 --> 00:21:32.055
