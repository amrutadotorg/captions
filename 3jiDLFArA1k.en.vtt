WEBVTT

01:11.837 --> 01:22.597
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

01:22.597 --> 01:29.716
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

01:29.716 --> 01:38.147
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

01:38.147 --> 01:46.337
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

01:46.337 --> 01:55.617
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

01:55.617 --> 02:00.776
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

02:00.776 --> 02:15.627
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

02:15.627 --> 02:23.327
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

02:23.327 --> 02:29.587
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

02:29.587 --> 02:43.456
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

02:43.456 --> 02:53.227
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

02:53.227 --> 03:02.497
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

03:02.497 --> 03:15.527
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

03:15.527 --> 03:27.826
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

03:27.826 --> 03:46.817
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

03:46.817 --> 03:55.827
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

03:55.827 --> 03:56.867
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

03:56.867 --> 04:04.817
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

04:04.817 --> 04:09.167
He was a very loving and a kind person.

04:09.167 --> 04:12.607
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

04:12.607 --> 04:20.727
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

04:20.727 --> 04:28.906
You can’t help it.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.253
What are they saying?

04:39.591 --> 04:42.836
Who is it?

04:45.045 --> 04:48.123
What happened?

04:50.841 --> 04:54.404
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

05:15.747 --> 05:19.762
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.030
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

05:24.231 --> 05:25.321
What is it?

05:25.520 --> 05:29.764
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

05:33.137 --> 05:39.037
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

05:44.174 --> 05:47.643
They are very good at fighting.

05:47.844 --> 05:52.781
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

05:54.298 --> 05:58.755
They have no understanding,

05:58.956 --> 06:01.379
always ready to fight,

06:01.580 --> 06:03.984
even with swords.

06:05.430 --> 06:11.846
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

06:12.119 --> 06:17.421
This beautiful new building has been erected

06:17.844 --> 06:19.626
for our classical music.

06:19.809 --> 06:22.308
They fought even on this

06:22.509 --> 06:28.720
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

06:29.188 --> 06:33.455
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

06:34.710 --> 06:38.249
They fight for some reason or the other.

06:38.884 --> 06:42.097
They have no shame, nothing.

06:43.313 --> 06:49.727
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

06:53.127 --> 06:56.413
No maturity at all.

06:58.795 --> 07:04.588
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

07:04.789 --> 07:07.980
And the music has grown so much.

07:10.924 --> 07:13.504
Everybody has the same experience.

07:13.679 --> 07:17.952
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

07:19.422 --> 07:22.413
and I am fed up with it.

07:23.271 --> 07:26.718
Everybody is complaining about something.

07:26.951 --> 07:30.583
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

07:30.784 --> 07:35.261
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

07:35.452 --> 07:39.880
and they have given so much knowledge.

07:40.987 --> 07:45.724
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.589
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

07:48.790 --> 07:52.409
They will fight even in their name,

07:53.520 --> 07:56.587
keep behaving foolishly.

07:56.796 --> 08:02.216
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

08:06.014 --> 08:09.307
They just don’t understand peaceful living

08:09.498 --> 08:15.264
and absorbing everything peacefully.

08:17.241 --> 08:21.207
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

08:23.569 --> 08:26.703
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

08:26.963 --> 08:29.179
"Are they uneducated people?".

08:29.370 --> 08:32.902
No, no, they are very well educated,

08:34.337 --> 08:37.243
but very quarrelsome.

08:37.512 --> 08:40.789
And why they fight, they only know.

08:43.812 --> 08:48.272
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

08:50.489 --> 08:53.330
and be a bit peaceful.

08:53.807 --> 08:55.847
At least try.

08:56.314 --> 08:59.108
We want to change, isn’t it?

09:00.084 --> 09:03.901
Instead of finding faults with others,

09:04.087 --> 09:08.142
see what is wrong with yourself.

09:09.150 --> 09:14.453
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

09:14.796 --> 09:17.160
at Nagpur.

09:17.343 --> 09:22.150
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

09:22.643 --> 09:28.779
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

09:29.245 --> 09:33.292
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

09:34.069 --> 09:42.060
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

09:42.261 --> 09:44.745
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

09:44.944 --> 09:48.555
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

09:49.436 --> 09:51.554
When you think of just making money somehow,

09:51.793 --> 09:55.023
run helter-skelter for it,

09:58.005 --> 10:05.758
have such a low manner thinking,

10:06.536 --> 10:11.518
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

10:14.232 --> 10:17.265
What should we call them?

10:17.591 --> 10:21.035
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

10:21.242 --> 10:22.850
We must achieve some good state”.

10:23.051 --> 10:26.653
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

10:26.854 --> 10:31.063
So [all of you] decide today

10:31.286 --> 10:35.122
to stop fighting from now onwards

10:36.731 --> 10:40.916
and stop being greedy for money,

10:41.128 --> 10:43.729
which is too much in Maharashtra.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.491
Here greed for money is amazing.

10:48.628 --> 10:53.378
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

10:53.585 --> 11:00.748
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

11:00.949 --> 11:04.528
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

11:05.011 --> 11:09.225
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

11:09.426 --> 11:12.295
and live gracefully

11:12.496 --> 11:15.407
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

11:15.614 --> 11:20.074
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

11:22.013 --> 11:24.608
You have not found a place to sit,

11:24.809 --> 11:27.682
or you have not found a place to see…

11:28.037 --> 11:32.450
Is this a political meeting or what?

11:36.043 --> 11:39.837
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

11:40.038 --> 11:44.498
when I saw you I had to say it.

11:45.132 --> 11:50.186
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

11:50.387 --> 11:54.258
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.879
There is no other way to correct this.

11:58.090 --> 12:00.883
Everyone should live with affection.

12:01.371 --> 12:03.674
If you cannot behave yourself,

12:03.857 --> 12:07.380
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

12:10.643 --> 12:13.509
It is our Baba special character

12:13.660 --> 12:16.272
that he never got angry with anybody,

12:16.473 --> 12:19.813
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

12:20.011 --> 12:25.061
and never complained about anybody.

12:25.823 --> 12:28.283
He would praise everybody.

12:28.484 --> 12:31.527
I used to get misguided

12:31.728 --> 12:35.631
how can everybody have such a good state.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.240
I would never understand.

12:38.441 --> 12:43.195
But Baba brought people together with love,

12:43.509 --> 12:46.096
it may be just anybody.

12:46.293 --> 12:50.714
He would never sit in My car,

12:51.928 --> 12:55.975
never visit to My house.

12:56.940 --> 13:00.482
He was very selfless and understanding.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.831
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

13:04.032 --> 13:06.991
but he was never so rude.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.484
Till the end He was not rude.

13:10.685 --> 13:14.248
Such a great personality he was.

13:14.770 --> 13:17.247
You have joined this place,

13:17.448 --> 13:20.908
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

13:23.491 --> 13:25.757
Now, this,

13:37.314 --> 13:41.742
we have built this temple for music

13:42.861 --> 13:45.815
and other form of arts.

13:46.014 --> 13:49.577
Your children must progress in these fields.

13:49.815 --> 13:52.884
They must understand our classical music.

13:53.083 --> 13:59.924
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

14:01.041 --> 14:06.177
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

14:07.468 --> 14:09.960
then what’s the use?

14:10.313 --> 14:13.852
You may not be a student of this place,

14:14.019 --> 14:18.479
still, you must have knowledge about music.

14:18.823 --> 14:25.025
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

14:27.700 --> 14:31.223
you cannot enjoy music.

14:31.947 --> 14:34.890
I request you all

14:35.685 --> 14:40.275
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

14:43.345 --> 14:47.008
and develop goodness within you.

14:47.616 --> 14:50.363
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

14:50.564 --> 14:53.988
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

14:54.189 --> 14:56.346
you cannot reap anything.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.933
I sometimes feel that.

14:59.134 --> 15:01.046
But now things are better

15:01.247 --> 15:06.999
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

15:07.841 --> 15:12.312
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

15:13.249 --> 15:16.248
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

15:16.449 --> 15:18.953
understand the sahaja way,

15:19.154 --> 15:23.137
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

15:23.338 --> 15:26.063
If you don't learn this,

15:26.429 --> 15:28.603
it is useless.

15:29.903 --> 15:33.045
There are many music schools around.

15:33.246 --> 15:35.690
Everywhere there are music schools.

15:35.891 --> 15:39.840
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

15:40.041 --> 15:43.096
it is better not to learn music at all.

15:44.225 --> 15:49.624
So I request you all, please,

15:50.315 --> 15:52.833
that now with this music,

15:53.902 --> 15:57.196
bring the music of your life

15:57.397 --> 16:00.522
into your day-to-day practice.

16:02.268 --> 16:04.739
Unless you follow this,

16:09.326 --> 16:13.827
this program will not be accomplished.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.284
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

16:19.485 --> 16:23.249
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

16:23.450 --> 16:27.059
The second problem here is about making money.

16:27.260 --> 16:30.550
they are not leaving it at all.

16:30.751 --> 16:33.899
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.510
They don't understand.

16:36.711 --> 16:40.655
How did people here get this greed?

16:40.856 --> 16:44.209
It has spread so much

16:47.143 --> 16:50.191
that I am fed up.

16:50.596 --> 16:54.648
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

16:54.849 --> 16:58.441
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

16:58.642 --> 17:01.114
there should be rhythm in our lives.

17:01.315 --> 17:04.638
Instead of being rhythmic,

17:04.839 --> 17:10.101
fighting all the time is not proper.

17:12.183 --> 17:14.891
Thinking bad about others

17:15.097 --> 17:17.279
and seeing only self interest

17:17.480 --> 17:19.680
it's a wrong quality.

17:20.815 --> 17:24.209
Now forget what happened in the past.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.697
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

17:26.898 --> 17:29.317
who are understanding, loving,

17:29.518 --> 17:33.989
and who will bring all people together.

17:37.698 --> 17:42.399
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.440
And the thing is,

17:46.186 --> 17:49.498
now if we take to music,

17:49.699 --> 17:52.577
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

17:52.778 --> 17:54.905
What does it mean?

17:55.106 --> 18:00.861
It means that the state of human beings,

18:03.323 --> 18:06.013
is to be corrected

18:06.601 --> 18:09.336
and has to be made rhythmic

18:09.511 --> 18:12.259
and has to be made organized.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.109
Unless it is done,

18:14.292 --> 18:15.765
it is of no use.

18:15.966 --> 18:19.447
What is the difference between you people and others?

18:19.648 --> 18:22.264
If you also keep fighting,

18:22.465 --> 18:24.796
then what is the use?

18:25.134 --> 18:29.753
The most important thing is that in your mind,

18:29.954 --> 18:34.746
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

18:35.841 --> 18:38.933
so that you become peaceful

18:39.100 --> 18:41.254
and others also become peaceful.

18:41.455 --> 18:44.946
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

18:46.386 --> 18:52.201
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

18:53.045 --> 18:57.478
this beautiful building has been erected.

18:58.891 --> 19:05.000
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

19:05.949 --> 19:11.254
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

19:11.455 --> 19:14.757
Today world needs only Peace.

19:15.107 --> 19:18.248
Everything else we have today is worthless.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.615
We have to see how peaceful we are.

19:21.816 --> 19:27.226
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

19:27.427 --> 19:29.730
then on which country will it have?

19:29.931 --> 19:36.398
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

19:36.599 --> 19:39.107
But, I can’t see anything like it.

19:39.308 --> 19:43.564
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.146
Don't know what to say?

19:47.668 --> 19:50.725
So those who want to learn music,

19:50.926 --> 19:54.079
must have music in their hearts also.

19:55.122 --> 19:58.164
Should think from the heart.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.394
Running after money, running after women,

20:02.595 --> 20:05.700
and doing all sorts of wrong things

20:05.923 --> 20:09.672
is unbecoming of a musician.

20:09.873 --> 20:12.382
My eternal blessings

20:12.581 --> 20:16.183
that this organization should flourish

20:16.914 --> 20:21.285
and people coming here should learn music

20:21.486 --> 20:25.414
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

20:25.615 --> 20:30.153
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

20:31.046 --> 20:35.362
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

20:35.990 --> 20:38.895
whenever you have complains,

20:39.096 --> 20:45.663
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.493
I am different from others,

20:49.694 --> 20:53.144
Mother has transformed me into something else.

20:53.345 --> 20:55.200
If you understand this

20:55.391 --> 20:58.811
you will recognise your glory.

20:59.163 --> 21:02.621
But if you cannot achieve this,

21:02.822 --> 21:05.266
then it is useless.

21:05.467 --> 21:10.083
Then making 50 such organizations

21:10.528 --> 21:13.012
also is of no use.

21:14.184 --> 21:17.745
Fighting for small, small things,

21:18.342 --> 21:20.504
doesn't become you.

21:20.705 --> 21:23.639
You are Saints now.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.413
You have achieved great heights,

21:27.614 --> 21:29.849
very great heights,

21:30.050 --> 21:32.885
And You do not realize that.

21:33.086 --> 21:37.003
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

21:37.204 --> 21:39.310
You think that you are

21:39.511 --> 21:42.391
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.966
No, no.

21:44.547 --> 21:46.910
My special blessings

21:47.505 --> 21:51.188
that you all should become musical.

21:52.548 --> 21:55.444
Today I wanted to bless you all,

21:55.645 --> 22:00.975
that you become completely musical in temperament,

22:01.176 --> 22:03.571
rhythmic

22:04.406 --> 22:12.001
and entertaining to others

22:12.192 --> 22:14.794
and not quarrelsome.

22:15.295 --> 22:19.074
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

22:19.275 --> 22:22.185
is taking to wrong side,

22:22.386 --> 22:24.488
to the wrong progress,

22:24.689 --> 22:27.917
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

22:28.118 --> 22:30.537
This will all disappear, I know,

22:30.681 --> 22:33.664
because it is very destructive.

22:34.469 --> 22:38.306
But, after coming to Sahaja also

22:38.507 --> 22:41.809
if you have the same destructive idea,

22:42.010 --> 22:43.908
how can anybody help you?

22:44.109 --> 22:50.621
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.605
May God bless you.
