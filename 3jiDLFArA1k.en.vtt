00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:22.597
I am very, very happy to see so many of you
coming down here for the program.

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:29.716
Actually, I bought this land at least, at
least twenty-five years back.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:38.147
I couldn’t do anything about it as they
had lots of objections, this and that, but

00:01:38.147 --> 00:01:46.337
then somehow, I planned the whole thing and
it all worked out.

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:55.617
Happy to see you all here but with all those
difficulties ultimately now you find so many

00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.776
Sahaja yogis attending this program, My puja.

00:02:00.776 --> 00:02:15.627
I must remember My brother Baba who has worked
very hard for the propagation of Indian music,

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:23.327
classical music, all types of art, whatever
he could do.

00:02:23.327 --> 00:02:29.587
It’s a very sad thing that he is not here
today to see you all.

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:43.456
He has done so much work religiously without
expecting any reward whatsoever and I wish

00:02:43.456 --> 00:02:53.227
you could have him as your ideal and that
will work it out everything in that way.

00:02:53.227 --> 00:03:02.497
There’s one thing about him I know, he never
tried to show off anything.

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:15.527
He was very intelligent, educated man but
he caught hold of all the people of ordinary

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:27.826
living and he looked after them and he promoted
their skill of music and art.

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:46.817
With the same idea, I decided to have this
place dedicated to his idea of propagating

00:03:46.817 --> 00:03:55.827
music and art and I am happy to see that that
idea has materialized.

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:56.867
But I wish [UNCLEAR.

00:03:56.867 --> 00:04:04.817
EITHER had or that] My brother was here to
make you feel very happy about it.

00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:09.167
He was a very loving and a kind person.

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:12.607
Never used to get angry with anyone, I’ve
seen that.

00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:20.727
But always he gave Me a very good picture
of every person.

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:28.906
You can’t help it.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:29.253
What are they saying?

00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:42.836
Who is it?

00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:48.123
What happened?

00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:54.404
SY: Volunteers just see who is there.

00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:19.762
SM: They are speaking in Marathi.

00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:24.030
They are asking where to sit? Nothing else.

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:25.321
What is it?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.764
They are saying there is no place. They have to sit on ground.

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:39.037
SM: It is the specialty of Maharashtra: quarrelsome nature.

00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:47.643
They are very good at fighting.

00:05:47.844 --> 00:05:52.781
Do anything for them but nothing enters into their head.

00:05:54.298 --> 00:05:58.755
They have no understanding,

00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:01.379
always ready to fight,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.984
even with swords.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.846
I am fed up with your quarrelling nature.

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:17.421
This beautiful new building has been erected

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:19.626
for our classical music.

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.308
They fought even on this

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.720
and many times I felt, why build it in Maharashtra?

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:33.455
No point doing anything for these quarreling people.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.249
They fight for some reason or the other.

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:42.097
They have no shame, nothing.

00:06:43.313 --> 00:06:49.727
If they don’t find a place to sit, what can we do?

00:06:53.127 --> 00:06:56.413
No maturity at all.

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:04.588
I don’t know how there is music in these quarrelsome people.

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:07.980
And the music has grown so much.

00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:13.504
Everybody has the same experience.

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:17.952
In Maharashtra people are very quarrelsome

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:22.413
and I am fed up with it.

00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:26.718
Everybody is complaining about something.

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:30.583
Have you not found peace in Sahaja Yoga?

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:35.261
So many Great Saints & Sages were born in this land

00:07:35.452 --> 00:07:39.880
and they have given so much knowledge.

00:07:40.987 --> 00:07:45.724
They have given so much knowledge but there is no effect.

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:48.589
This quarrelsome nature is not going.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.409
They will fight even in their name,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.587
keep behaving foolishly.

00:07:56.796 --> 00:08:02.216
I don’t know when this foolishness is going to end in Maharashtra.

00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:09.307
They just don’t understand peaceful living

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:15.264
and absorbing everything peacefully.

00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:21.207
They just start shouting all of a sudden.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.703
Our foreign Sahaja Yogis say:

00:08:26.963 --> 00:08:29.179
"Are they uneducated people?".

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.902
No, no, they are very well educated,

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:37.243
but very quarrelsome.

00:08:37.512 --> 00:08:40.789
And why they fight, they only know.

00:08:43.812 --> 00:08:48.272
At least please don’t fight in Sahaja yoga

00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:53.330
and be a bit peaceful.

00:08:53.807 --> 00:08:55.847
At least try.

00:08:56.314 --> 00:08:59.108
We want to change, isn’t it?

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:03.901
Instead of finding faults with others,

00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:08.142
see what is wrong with yourself.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.453
Baba has done a lot of work in this mad Maharashtra,

00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:17.160
at Nagpur.

00:09:17.343 --> 00:09:22.150
There are different type of people in Nagpur,

00:09:22.643 --> 00:09:28.779
I want to say there are not only Maharashtrians.

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:33.292
People in Nagpur are very active and they helped him.

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:42.060
But nobody understands that you must absorb Sahaja yoga

00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:44.745
and become a Saint (Sadhu).

00:09:44.944 --> 00:09:48.555
That doesn't come in anyone's attention.

00:09:49.436 --> 00:09:51.554
When you think of just making money somehow,

00:09:51.793 --> 00:09:55.023
run helter-skelter for it,

00:09:58.005 --> 00:10:05.758
have such a low manner thinking,

00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:11.518
with such a thinking, how can you be a Sahaja Yogi?

00:10:14.232 --> 00:10:17.265
What should we call them?

00:10:17.591 --> 00:10:21.035
One must feel that: ”I am a realized soul.

00:10:21.242 --> 00:10:22.850
We must achieve some good state”.

00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:26.653
Mother has worked so hard and so much for us.

00:10:26.854 --> 00:10:31.063
So [all of you] decide today

00:10:31.286 --> 00:10:35.122
to stop fighting from now onwards

00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:40.916
and stop being greedy for money,

00:10:41.128 --> 00:10:43.729
which is too much in Maharashtra.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.491
Here greed for money is amazing.

00:10:48.628 --> 00:10:53.378
Because of greed for money it is difficult to do Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:11:00.748
I have worked a lot in Maharashtra, beyond the words,

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:04.528
and have had all sorts of experiences in this land.

00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:09.225
Now please realize that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:12.295
and live gracefully

00:11:12.496 --> 00:11:15.407
and be proud of being a Sahaja yogi.

00:11:15.614 --> 00:11:20.074
What is there to fight in Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:24.608
You have not found a place to sit,

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:27.682
or you have not found a place to see…

00:11:28.037 --> 00:11:32.450
Is this a political meeting or what?

00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:39.837
I did not want to speak anything but I had no option

00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:44.498
when I saw you I had to say it.

00:11:45.132 --> 00:11:50.186
Now if any Sahaja Yogi shows quarrelsome attitude,

00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:54.258
he will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:57.879
There is no other way to correct this.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.883
Everyone should live with affection.

00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:03.674
If you cannot behave yourself,

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:07.380
then why are you in Sahaja yoga?

00:12:10.643 --> 00:12:13.509
It is our Baba special character

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.272
that he never got angry with anybody,

00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:19.813
and he would never talk ill of anyone,

00:12:20.011 --> 00:12:25.061
and never complained about anybody.

00:12:25.823 --> 00:12:28.283
He would praise everybody.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:31.527
I used to get misguided

00:12:31.728 --> 00:12:35.631
how can everybody have such a good state.

00:12:35.972 --> 00:12:38.240
I would never understand.

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:43.195
But Baba brought people together with love,

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:46.096
it may be just anybody.

00:12:46.293 --> 00:12:50.714
He would never sit in My car,

00:12:51.928 --> 00:12:55.975
never visit to My house.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.482
He was very selfless and understanding.

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.831
He also belonged to this Maharashtra,

00:13:04.032 --> 00:13:06.991
but he was never so rude.

00:13:07.187 --> 00:13:10.484
Till the end He was not rude.

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:14.248
Such a great personality he was.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.247
You have joined this place,

00:13:17.448 --> 00:13:20.908
so at least follow some of his good qualities.

00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:25.757
Now, this,

00:13:37.314 --> 00:13:41.742
we have built this temple for music

00:13:42.861 --> 00:13:45.815
and other form of arts.

00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:49.577
Your children must progress in these fields.

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:52.884
They must understand our classical music.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:59.924
These foreigners understand your music more than you do, it's a shame.

00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:06.177
We don’t understand basics, taal, nothing,

00:14:07.468 --> 00:14:09.960
then what’s the use?

00:14:10.313 --> 00:14:13.852
You may not be a student of this place,

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:18.479
still, you must have knowledge about music.

00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:25.025
Unless you know, what is raga, what is tala,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.223
you cannot enjoy music.

00:14:31.947 --> 00:14:34.890
I request you all

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:40.275
to leave aside your quarrelling nature

00:14:43.345 --> 00:14:47.008
and develop goodness within you.

00:14:47.616 --> 00:14:50.363
This is the work of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:50.564 --> 00:14:53.988
but, if you sow seeds in unfertile land,

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:56.346
you cannot reap anything.

00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:58.933
I sometimes feel that.

00:14:59.134 --> 00:15:01.046
But now things are better

00:15:01.247 --> 00:15:06.999
with many people coming to Sahaja Yoga and they are welcome.

00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:12.312
So, don’t just come to learn music here.

00:15:13.249 --> 00:15:16.248
You must learn to behave in a sahaja way,

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.953
understand the sahaja way,

00:15:19.154 --> 00:15:23.137
understand the greatness of Sahaja Yoga - you should absorb these things within you.

00:15:23.338 --> 00:15:26.063
If you don't learn this,

00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:28.603
it is useless.

00:15:29.903 --> 00:15:33.045
There are many music schools around.

00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:35.690
Everywhere there are music schools.

00:15:35.891 --> 00:15:39.840
By learning music from these schools if you are going trouble others,

00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:43.096
it is better not to learn music at all.

00:15:44.225 --> 00:15:49.624
So I request you all, please,

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:52.833
that now with this music,

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:57.196
bring the music of your life

00:15:57.397 --> 00:16:00.522
into your day-to-day practice.

00:16:02.268 --> 00:16:04.739
Unless you follow this,

00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:13.827
this program will not be accomplished.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.284
Take a vow today, we will not fight.

00:16:19.485 --> 00:16:23.249
Even if anyone says anything, we will not fight.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.059
The second problem here is about making money.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.550
they are not leaving it at all.

00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:33.899
People make money even in Sahaja yoga.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.510
They don't understand.

00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:40.655
How did people here get this greed?

00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:44.209
It has spread so much

00:16:47.143 --> 00:16:50.191
that I am fed up.

00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:54.648
Are you going to change or not, now you decide.

00:16:54.849 --> 00:16:58.441
Most important thing is that there should be music in our lives,

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:01.114
there should be rhythm in our lives.

00:17:01.315 --> 00:17:04.638
Instead of being rhythmic,

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:10.101
fighting all the time is not proper.

00:17:12.183 --> 00:17:14.891
Thinking bad about others

00:17:15.097 --> 00:17:17.279
and seeing only self interest

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.680
it's a wrong quality.

00:17:20.815 --> 00:17:24.209
Now forget what happened in the past.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.697
You should bring such people in Sahaja Yoga now

00:17:26.898 --> 00:17:29.317
who are understanding, loving,

00:17:29.518 --> 00:17:33.989
and who will bring all people together.

00:17:37.698 --> 00:17:42.399
Fortunately I also know Hindi language.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.440
And the thing is,

00:17:46.186 --> 00:17:49.498
now if we take to music,

00:17:49.699 --> 00:17:52.577
we ourselves should also be in rhythm.

00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:54.905
What does it mean?

00:17:55.106 --> 00:18:00.861
It means that the state of human beings,

00:18:03.323 --> 00:18:06.013
is to be corrected

00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.336
and has to be made rhythmic

00:18:09.511 --> 00:18:12.259
and has to be made organized.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.109
Unless it is done,

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:15.765
it is of no use.

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:19.447
What is the difference between you people and others?

00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:22.264
If you also keep fighting,

00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:24.796
then what is the use?

00:18:25.134 --> 00:18:29.753
The most important thing is that in your mind,

00:18:29.954 --> 00:18:34.746
you should develop love, reverence and devotion.

00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:38.933
so that you become peaceful

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.254
and others also become peaceful.

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.946
Without peace, music has got no meaning.

00:18:46.386 --> 00:18:52.201
Today, with the idea of Baba mama,

00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:57.478
this beautiful building has been erected.

00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:05.000
And with this I wish that people will take to music within them,

00:19:05.949 --> 00:19:11.254
and people have a peaceful atmosphere.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:14.757
Today world needs only Peace.

00:19:15.107 --> 00:19:18.248
Everything else we have today is worthless.

00:19:18.449 --> 00:19:21.615
We have to see how peaceful we are.

00:19:21.816 --> 00:19:27.226
If this peace does not have an effect on our country

00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:29.730
then on which country will it have?

00:19:29.931 --> 00:19:36.398
Everybody says that India is the ambassador of peace.

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:39.107
But, I can’t see anything like it.

00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:43.564
There is quarrel and fighting among one another.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.146
Don't know what to say?

00:19:47.668 --> 00:19:50.725
So those who want to learn music,

00:19:50.926 --> 00:19:54.079
must have music in their hearts also.

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:58.164
Should think from the heart.

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:02.394
Running after money, running after women,

00:20:02.595 --> 00:20:05.700
and doing all sorts of wrong things

00:20:05.923 --> 00:20:09.672
is unbecoming of a musician.

00:20:09.873 --> 00:20:12.382
My eternal blessings

00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:16.183
that this organization should flourish

00:20:16.914 --> 00:20:21.285
and people coming here should learn music

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:25.414
and make their lives rhythmic and full of music.

00:20:25.615 --> 00:20:30.153
Hope you will fulfil my desires.

00:20:31.046 --> 00:20:35.362
Whenever you get angry, get annoyed

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:38.895
whenever you have complains,

00:20:39.096 --> 00:20:45.663
tell yourself that ‘I am a sahaja yogi'.

00:20:47.567 --> 00:20:49.493
I am different from others,

00:20:49.694 --> 00:20:53.144
Mother has transformed me into something else.

00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:55.200
If you understand this

00:20:55.391 --> 00:20:58.811
you will recognise your glory.

00:20:59.163 --> 00:21:02.621
But if you cannot achieve this,

00:21:02.822 --> 00:21:05.266
then it is useless.

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:10.083
Then making 50 such organizations

00:21:10.528 --> 00:21:13.012
also is of no use.

00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:17.745
Fighting for small, small things,

00:21:18.342 --> 00:21:20.504
doesn't become you.

00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:23.639
You are Saints now.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.413
You have achieved great heights,

00:21:27.614 --> 00:21:29.849
very great heights,

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.885
And You do not realize that.

00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:37.003
You don't understand that "We are great saints now".

00:21:37.204 --> 00:21:39.310
You think that you are

00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:42.391
the same beggar on the street as you were before.

00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:43.966
No, no.

00:21:44.547 --> 00:21:46.910
My special blessings

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:51.188
that you all should become musical.

00:21:52.548 --> 00:21:55.444
Today I wanted to bless you all,

00:21:55.645 --> 00:22:00.975
that you become completely musical in temperament,

00:22:01.176 --> 00:22:03.571
rhythmic

00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:12.001
and entertaining to others

00:22:12.192 --> 00:22:14.794
and not quarrelsome.

00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:19.074
Now, as you have seen that how the western music

00:22:19.275 --> 00:22:22.185
is taking to wrong side,

00:22:22.386 --> 00:22:24.488
to the wrong progress,

00:22:24.689 --> 00:22:27.917
and I don’t want you to fall into that.

00:22:28.118 --> 00:22:30.537
This will all disappear, I know,

00:22:30.681 --> 00:22:33.664
because it is very destructive.

00:22:34.469 --> 00:22:38.306
But, after coming to Sahaja also

00:22:38.507 --> 00:22:41.809
if you have the same destructive idea,

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.908
how can anybody help you?

00:22:44.109 --> 00:22:50.621
So I hope you will fulfill my ideal, about you.

00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:53.605
May God bless you.
