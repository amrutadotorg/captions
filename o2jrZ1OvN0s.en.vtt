00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring 
its viewers along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.600
Thanks everyone for joining us today.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.440
In our previous episode, we
started on an exploration

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.680
into the fascinating intersection
of neuroscience and spirituality

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.840
with Dr. Ashish Pradhan,
who is a distinguished leader in neurology

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.680
and cardiovascular medicine,
renowned for his cutting-edge work

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.720
and strategic leadership
in patient-centric care.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.080
He emphasized the importance of understanding
the complexities of the nervous system

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.880
as a foundation for exploring
the spiritual aspects of being human.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.680
Dr. Pradhan also talked to us
about the brain's evolutionary journey,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.280
highlighting the fascinating adaptations
that have shaped its structure and function.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.400
And today we welcome all of you
to this second episode of our enlightening series

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.200
with the esteemed Dr. Ashish Pradhan.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880
Today we're taking this exploration
even deeper.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.640
So get ready for another
thought-provoking conversation

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.360
as we continue to bridge the worlds
of science and spirituality.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.840
Welcome, Dr. Pradhan.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.400
Thank you.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.320
Thank you for the kind words, Monikaji.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.920
Happy to be back.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.600
We definitely look forward to learning
a lot with you in this yet another episode.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.560
So, Dr. Pradhan, like I said,
in our previous episode,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
we delved into the intricate workings
of the human nervous system,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.480
the autonomic nervous system,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.360
and their connections to
our spiritual experiences.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.000
And you also distinguished between
the parasympathetic, the sympathetic,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.880
and explained how they interact
to maintain balance,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.280
regulate essential functions.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.320
Today we would like to know
how the autonomic nervous system intertwines

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.960
with the concept of the human subtle system
that you briefly mentioned,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.440
and how they influence
our spiritual well-being?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.160
Sure.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.840
Let's get started right away.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.240
It's a slightly complex topic.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.720
We'll try to understand this
as best as we can.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.000
At the very outset, I would 
like to once again say

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.840
that whatever we discuss
in response to your questions,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.880
a lot of that knowledge comes from
the teachings of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.360
the founder
of Sahaja Yoga meditation,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.160
and intertwined, of course,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.920
with what we know about
human anatomy and physiology.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.680
So let's get started.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.040
Before we try to understand how the autonomic
nervous system and the subtle system

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.720
sort of are correlated or interact,
let's take a step back

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.520
and see what constitutes 
the subtle system.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.720
And from there we can proceed towards
our understanding of the autonomic nervous system.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.000
The so-called human subtle system,
as you'll see in the animation,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.840
comprises nadis.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.160
Nadis are — it's a Sanskrit word —
and it can have multiple meanings.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.160
It can mean nerves, it can mean channels,
it can mean tubes, it can mean blood vessels,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.400
it can mean lymphatics,
it can mean a whole host of things.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.720
It's almost like one word,
or like a noun for a collective,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.160
for a whole host of individual things
within the body.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.720
This system was described in detail

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.040
by the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.880
This is a very ancient Sanskrit text,
and what you have in those texts

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.600
is a description 
of this subtle anatomy

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.640
or physiology
within the human body,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.040
within the human system.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.240
What the subtle system is actually,
if we step even one step further

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.920
or kind of step behind,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.960
is actually a reflection
within us of the macrocosm.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.400
So, what do we mean?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.880
What we have within us is the microcosm.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.560
What exists outside of us,
is the macrocosm.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.160
And within the macrocosm, if we look
at how things function,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.680
there is a system of balance:
light and dark, heavy and light,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.400
dry and wet, fire and ice.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.080
So, those are naturally occurring phenomena
that are present in nature.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.520
It has also been described—let's say, what
we spiritually or metaphorically refer to

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.960
as yin and yang.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.520
Just as there is daylight, there is night;
there is the sun, there is the moon;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.240
you have high tide, you have low tide,
so on and so forth.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.680
You have summer and spring;
you have fall and winter.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:54.560
So, in nature we have a balance,
and systems which, if overactive,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.480
can trigger an imbalance.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.640
In other words, if we have too much heat,
that isn't good for the system;

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.080
if it's too cold,
it isn't good for the system in general.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.920
So, ecology, or ecosystems
or the universal constants that we see around us

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.560
is a very good way to begin
to get an understanding

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.400
of what the human subtle system is about.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.280
To slowly start coming

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.160
into the details and trying
to answer the question.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.840
As the human being evolved,
or as the Homo sapiens evolved

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.720
as we discussed the last time,
the nervous system was an adaptation

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.120
to evolutionary pressures,
and those evolutionary pressures

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:48.240
engendered two broad
systems of phenomenon

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.000
from a Darwinian point of view.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.240
The first one was
the fight or the flight response.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.120
The fight or flight response
comes into play

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.680
if there is a threat to the
organism in the environment,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.800
and then it leads to what Darwin called
natural selection,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.320
or it brings down pressure upon the system
or upon the species to take

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.240
or to adapt such characteristics
that allows it to thrive in the environment.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.040
So either it can overcome the danger,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.840
a smaller fish
could be gobbled

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:32.320
by a bigger fish, so maybe it needs to develop
more sensory organs, faster fins, faster reflexes.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.320
Similarly, a gazelle on the Serengeti plains
needs to develop responses

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.760
to run away from the lion
that might pursue it.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.320
So, those are flight or flight responses

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.720
that are part of
the evolutionary mechanism.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.320
So, the subtle system
comprises two aspects to it.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.600
One is a passive aspect, and
the other is an active aspect.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.480
So, we see that even in the cosmos around us,
things are dynamic,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.880
and sometimes they are passive,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.160
both at the same time, and
it's not a contradiction.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.920
The whole system through immutable laws,
and we call them the laws of divinity,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.000
the laws of the Almighty,
call it what you will, to each his own,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.520
but the system works
in a state of balance.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.280
So, likewise, in the human body,
now to start coming back to the point,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.800
we have a system
which is the passive system;

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.280
we have a system which 
is the active system.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.440
On the left side, so to speak,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.160
we call it the moon channel,
or we call it the Ida Nadi;

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.840
on the right side, we call it the sun channel,
or we call it the Pingala Nadi.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.000
The left side, or the moon channel, 
is more passive; it allows passivity,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.920
but passivity that doesn't mean
sloth or lethargy.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.400
It can get into it if it is overactive.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.280
Similarly, on the right side,
we have the ability to act,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.320
to bring our desires into fruition,
but again, if that becomes overactive,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.840
that becomes a problem too.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.480
We can become: aggressive, overthinking,
overplanning, that sort of a thing.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.200
So, within the human body, the subtle system
has these two components; they are called Nadis,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.600
and that's how it functions.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.000
Now, back to, once again,
to the evolutionary component.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.240
Within the evolutionary system, as we said,
there is a flight or fight pressures,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.760
but there is also the need to evolve.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.360
The need to evolve into a higher state,
both at a physical,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:53.600
but as well as at a cognitive,
or at a nervous system level,
or at a neural level.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.040
And that is how we described
during the last session

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.520
how the brain evolved
in response to some of these pressures.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.680
So, likewise, in the subtle system,
there is a third component,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.800
the so-called Sushumna Nadi,
and that is a kind of power

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.640
that allows evolution to proceed.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.080
We know how these changes are brought about
through genetic changes that are passed

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:26.080
onto the offspring from the parent
that has allowed it to survive.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.040
These are the three components
of the subtle system.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.960
On the left side, the passive side,
the so-called Ida Nadi;

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.920
on the right side, the so-called sun channel,
the active side or the Pingala Nadi;

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.960
and in the center, we have a power

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.240
that allows evolution but,
evolution in a spiritual sense.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:56.400
The microcosm is reflected in the macrocosm,
and now we come to the autonomic nervous system.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.320
The autonomic nervous system
also has its two components.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:06.160
One is the sympathetic nervous system;
the other is the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.360
The sympathetic nervous system
governs your flight or fight responses.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.400
For example, a human being sees a danger,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.840
either he or she wants to fight

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.280
or to run away from it.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.000
That triggers your heart rate
to either pump faster,
maybe run away from the danger.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.680
So that's one.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.560
The other is the evolutionary,
or the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.160
The parasympathetic nervous system
is your rest-and-digest system.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.080
It allows the individual to repose,
to relax, and to nourish.

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.640
The left and the right,
the subtle systems,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.840
or the sympathetic systems,
are something that are energy-expending systems.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.320
They consume energy; they expend energy.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.720
We either consume energy in our desires,
by having desires,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.800
or we consume energy
bringing those desires into action.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.560
The parasympathetic nervous system allows us
to rest and to nourish ourselves,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.240
and in that way, through mechanisms
that we have not yet biologically elucidated,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.080
allow us to evolve.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.880
I'll stop there.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.040
I hope that that kind of answers the question,
but I'm happy to take more questions

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.560
if that did not fully explain it.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.440
Thanks, Dr. Ashish, for that explanation.
And as we continue to zoom

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.280
into the subtle system,
after having understood a bit about

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.080
these energy channels or these Nadis,
we would like to understand from you

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.240
a little bit about the plexus now.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.960
So, how is a plexus formed?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.040
What role do plexuses play
in the functioning of the human body?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.040
Things of that nature,
if you can explain to the audiences.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:51.760
Sure.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.000
So, a plexus is derived
from the Latin word,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.720
and it means a braid,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.840
like a braid of hair, for example,
like women who have hair, longer hair,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.640
or even men or women, if you tie that in a braid,
that's the word, that's the origin of it.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.360
That's how it looks.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.320
Why is it called a plexus?

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.960
We saw last time that the central nervous system
consists of the brain and the spinal cord,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.480
and through the spinal cord
which passes through the vertebral column,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.400
you have nerves that come out
of the vertebra from the sides.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.720
When the nerves come out from the vertebra,
they come together

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:46.480
from different parts, and the plexus is like,
if you open the electrical box

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.640
in your house, you see a bunch of wires
coming together.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.680
So, a plexus is like nature's way
of organizing the nerves.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.040
The nerves that come out,
and these nerves, as we know, go further out,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.000
and they enter the various organs of the body.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.160
So, whether it is the heart,
whether it is the lungs,

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.160
whether it is the stomach,
the pancreas, the liver.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.600
And also, of course,
the skeletal musculature.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.840
So, these nerves, when they come out,
they bunch together,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:22.320
they come together,
and that is what is called a plexus.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:30.000
A plexus is,
from a Sahaj point of view,

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:40.720
the gross manifestation of what we call
energy centers or chakras within the body.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.560
The Yoga Sutras have described
seven principal energy centers.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.120
There are multiple other centers as well,
but there are seven energy centers

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.600
that start from something
that is below our vertebral column,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.520
right up the way,
right into the crown of our head.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:08.800
The hypothesis is
that the energy center itself exists

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.200
at a very, very subtle level
within the human body.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.400
The energy center, or the chakra,
cannot actually be seen

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.960
through any current means
of diagnostic techniques,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.680
for example, MRI scans
or functional MRI scans or CT scans.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.400
You cannot put something in
and try to see it functionally,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.520
nor can you dissect the body at a level
where you see it,

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:42.720
because these energy centers function
or exist at the plane of energy.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.000
It is not a matter per se; it is energy.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.880
And these energy centers, at specific parts
of the human body,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.800
govern the functioning
of these nerve centers we call plexuses.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:03.680
The energy flow is from the energy center
to the plexus,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.840
and from the plexus, it goes
through the nerves into the organs.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:18.240
That is how the energy center - the chakra -
governs the functioning

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.160
of the human body
in the autonomic nervous system.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.960
That’s essentially the schema.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.400
So, you have the energy center
that has the energy

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.240
that, quote-unquote, controls—
I have to use hand quotes here—

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.280
because there is no real neurotransmitter-y
system, as we discussed last time.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.760
There is no acetylcholine,
there is no adrenaline,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.520
there is no dopamine 
or serotonin that does it.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.080
But through ways that we have not yet elucidated,
but you can feel it through your awareness

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.800
once you practice this form of meditation,
that the energy flows

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:01.120
from the energy center to the plexus,
from the plexus to the organ,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:09.200
and that is how the chakra, plexus, organ system
functions to maintain, once again,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.600
the balance in the body,
the internal ecosystem of the body.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.120
That is how the nadis 
and the chakras come together.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.480
It is very important to remember,
as we go on our journey

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:28.240
and we discuss this in future episodes,
that we should avoid the trap

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:34.560
that modern medicine has fallen into,
which is to look at individual components

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.680
and then try to make a sense of the whole.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.480
To understand the human spiritual system
or the subtle system, one needs to take, in fact,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.760
the directly opposite approach,
which is a holistic approach,

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.760
to start from understanding
that the system functions in an integrated fashion,

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.360
and to try to break it down

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.040
into its components 
is a reductive approach.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.320
But, at the same time, it does help
to understand a little bit,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.880
but that is how it functions.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.680
So, even if one chakra controls,
maybe in theory, one plexus,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.400
in reality, it probably controls
many, many more plexuses

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.440
and functions in ways that are very complex,
that human understanding still hasn't

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.640
been able to pattern.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.360
I will stop there.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.280
I hope that provides some perspective
of why the plexus is so important to understand

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.600
within the broader concept
of human spirituality.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.640
Thanks, Dr. Ashish, for that understanding,
because all along I always thought

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.240
that chakra, energy center, and plexus
are all the same things,

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.280
and I know we use these terms
without knowing so much about them,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.200
but thanks for explaining that.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.200
If you can talk to us

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.800
about the hypothesis that
underlies the relationship

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.720
between a chakra and a plexus,
and why is it important for us to understand that?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.280
Excellent.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.560
So, the chakra is,
from a Sahaj point of view,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.560
the seat of divine power.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.480
It expresses itself as pure love,
and each of these energy centers, or chakras,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.280
manifest different qualities.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:21.280
And it is through the energy center -
that is, the chakra -

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.960
that the energy transmitted to the plexus
governs the functioning

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.320
of that particular organ system or organs
within the remit of that plexus.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.320
So, as we will see as we move along,
there are specific plexuses

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.640
that look after specific organs.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.320
The reason why this is important

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.880
is to understand both the
physiology and the pathology.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.600
The physiology is very simple,
as we just expressed.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.600
Energy transmitted to the plexus
and therefore the functioning of the organ system.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.200
Equally important, if
the energy center is overused,

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.520
there is a finite amount of energy

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.080
that is present at each
of the individual chakra levels

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.840
when an individual takes birth.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.920
And throughout our life, we keep on expending
that energy that we are born with,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.760
unless and until you get into a state
we call self-realization,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.240
and then that energy can be replenished.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.440
But for most individuals,
from the time of their birth

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.960
till they pass on,
is a limited amount of energy.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.600
If that energy is not used
in a wise and an optimal manner,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.120
then it places strain on that chakra.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.480
That strain is then reflected
at the level of the plexus

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.160
because there is an imbalance.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.440
The key to understanding everything
is the balance of this ecosystem.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.280
And if that plexus gets into a state
of imbalance, quote-unquote.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.080
Medicine doesn't 
easily explain this,

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.240
but at the spiritual level, 
we can explain it

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.440
through our growth in our
self-awareness through Sahaj.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.440
If the plexus gets imbalanced,
then the organ systems it governs

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.880
get imbalanced as well.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.840
Which - in other words -
is what we mean by imbalance?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.560
Imbalance implies the beginning
of a pathological state,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.600
which may or may not be easily detectable,
but it starts at a very subtle level,

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:22.720
and then over a period of time,
it manifests as gross pathology.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.840
And that is why it is important
to understand the governance structure

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.760
from the energy center, that is the chakra,
to the plexus, to the organ system.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.560
Doctor, from what you mentioned, it seems like
there has to be a wise use

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.560
of the finite energy that we are born with.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.480
If you can help us understand
what does it mean to use that energy wisely

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.800
or discreetly so that we don't get
our chakras out of balance?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.240
Let's take an example of
a heart chakra,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:02.000
the one that governs the cardiac plexus
and our cardiovascular system,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.920
but basically the cardiac system.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.840
For example, if we overwork,
if we overstrain ourselves,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.960
we know that we are pursuing something,
maybe it's a career opportunity,

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.960
we want to work, and everybody wants
to get ahead in life, and that's okay.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.280
The question is, is your ambition,
is your drive putting you in a place

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.600
where you can actually feel
that you are under stress,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.920
and that stress,
at some point,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.880
is manifesting in the form
of essential hypertension.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.360
Your systolic is going up,
your diastolic is going up,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.800
at a certain age or whatever the case may be;
then knowingly doing it,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.000
or continuing to do it,
is being unwise about it,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.400
because now we should know.
Most people don't have knowledge

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.800
about the chakras, but they do understand
blood pressure or hypertension—

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.640
because, potentially, it's a silent thing.
But if you get the symptoms,

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.960
and if you are diagnosed with it,
that's different.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.400
So, this is what we mean by being wise about it:
that whatever your drives in life,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.200
whatever your desires,
wisdom, which is, again, an innate quality

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.000
that comes to us from the first energy center,
which we shall be talking about shortly,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.360
needs to manifest itself
in both our desires as well as our actions,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.880
because otherwise the system
goes out of that.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.440
The energy center for that particular organ,
or for that particular system,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.280
can start manifesting in ways
that we now describe as, maybe, diseases

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.400
or disorders of the human body.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:44.960
It is said that we often lead our lives
in ignorance and, unknowingly or knowingly,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.600
put so much demand on our energy centers
to the extent that we are creating

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.600
pathological conditions for us,
like you explained.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.560
Doctor, we'd like to understand
if modern medicine historically has studied

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.000
or tried to study any connection
between the autonomic nervous system

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.320
and the subtle system.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.080
That's a great question, Monikaji.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.080
Modern medicine
has not really tried,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.000
though if we look
at the Hippocratic tradition,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:22.000
it certainly tried in the past, particularly 
during the time of Hippocrates, to make that linkage.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:31.120
For example, Hippocrates was known to use methods
that would bring the systems into balance.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.960
But Galen, who succeeded Hippocrates
for about 1500 years,

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.960
his theory of humors (H-U-M-O-R,
as in humours),

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:45.440
looked at trying
to balance out the systems

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.280
between hot and cold,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.120
like the subtle system does,
and then look at it from that point of view.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.040
So, medicine had some,
maybe in the distant past,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:03.120
an understanding of the need
to balance these elements within us.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:09.280
So, that was one, and Galen's theory of humours
dominated medicine till about the Renaissance

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:16.560
and the arrival of the scientific method,
the dissection of the human body,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.080
the understanding of physiologic mechanisms,
and then we lost it.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.680
So, modern medicine doesn't really
investigate it that much.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:28.720
In Ayurveda, it's probably become closest
to bridging that gap

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.640
between the subtle system
and the autonomic nervous system,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.120
particularly through the tridosha theory,
which is the kapha-pitta-vata theory,

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.760
which looks at the body
as a composition of five elements:

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:45.440
earth, fire, water, ether, and air.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.760
So, it is through the tridosha theory—
this tripartite theory—

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:58.320
that we try to understand the relationship
between the subtle system and the gross system,

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:05.120
and Ayurveda tries to use these elements
to bring the body to a state of balance.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.560
But that's as far as medical systems go.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.600
There are other systems of medicine;
the Chinese system tries to balance

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.440
the yin and yang part of it.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.160
So, medicine historically has had
an understanding of it,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.560
but not to the extent
that Sahaj can provide.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.280
Now that we understand
that there are these energy centers,

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:30.560
let's begin by talking about
the very first energy center.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:35.040
Could we understand a little bit about this
and its role in human evolution

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.680
as well as in spirituality?

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:44.320
The first energy center is,
it would not be an overstatement to say,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:51.040
hypercritical to understand it,
because it truly is the beginning of it all.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.760
It is called the Muladhara chakra.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.840
It sits outside of the vertebral column,
just below it.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.560
It exists at an extremely subtle level.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.960
As we said, there is no way
to see these energy centers,

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.120
but we can perceive them.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.040
So that chakra, Muladhara,
essentially means the primordial support.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.240
It really is the fulcrum of everything.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.880
Before we start to understand
the Muladhara chakra,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.800
maybe just a step back into 
basic physics or quantum mechanics,

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.160
or quantum field theory.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.200
Why is that important?

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:34.160
It's very important because, if you remember,
in 2012, the CERN particle collider

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.200
found the Higgs boson particle.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.800
Why was that important?

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.200
Why was the Nobel Prize awarded
to the individuals who had, 40 years ago,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.720
propounded that theory?

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:48.000
And the reason is the existence
of the Higgs field,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.280
which is supposed to permeate
all known universes.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:28:00.640
And what the Higgs boson proved
was that energy somehow imparts properties

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.200
to electromagnetic particles,
or at that quantum level,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.840
in that quantum state,
that gives them mass.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.000
Mass, in turn, produces gravity.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.200
What is gravity?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.040
It's the curvature of space-time.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.480
So, whatever mass you have,
it leads to that part of gravity,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.520
and that is a constant.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:31.760
Newton showed us that there is
a constant in terms of gravity.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:34.400
Why is that important?

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.280
This is important to know
that energy preceded the creation of matter,

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.800
and that helps us to understand
our subtle system and also our chakras.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:52.560
The Muladhara chakra,
or the first energy center, represents

00:28:52.560 --> 00:29:00.880
that first primordial step after the Big Bang,
or around that time, or just following that,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:06.400
as this heat was released,
and then that heat started slowly,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.640
as the system started coalescing,

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:15.520
leading to the formation of the big stars.
And within the cores of these big stars,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.960
you had fusion reactions
where hydrogen and helium nuclei

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.240
started coming together,
and elements were formed.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.640
And a key element was carbon.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.680
And carbon, as we know, is tetravalent.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.320
It has four valencies,
and it is the basic molecule

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.760
that leads to formation
of organic compounds.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.480
And the human being,
or everything that we see around us,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.720
animals, plants, whatever,

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.160
is a product of that organic chemistry.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.160
So this element, carbon,
which has four valencies,

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.400
is also interestingly represented
in some ways as the swastika,

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.360
which is a very traditional ancient symbol.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.800
Unfortunately, in the last century,
it got a very bad reputation,

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.320
but it has nothing to do with it.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.880
It has been recognized as a symbol
of auspiciousness and purity

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.960
and everything that goes with it.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.200
So, that is how it starts.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.800
So, this is the Muladhara chakra.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:21.440
The Muladhara chakra is the fulcrum,
literally the support of the entire system,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:30.160
and it is governed by an aspect of divinity
whose manifestation is primordial innocence.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.240
So, once again, to recap,
you have energy,

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:40.640
that is the primordial energy
that somehow imparted its properties

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.680
to electromagnetic particles
that created mass, and that mass led to gravity.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.960
And without gravity,
we would not have existed,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.880
because otherwise we would have just been,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:54.480
like electrons spinning
forever at the speed of light.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.960
And that gravity is also kept
at a very specific constant,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.480
because if that constant were to be
a little less or a little more

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:08.480
we would have
just collapsed together into

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.880
a hyperdense kind of matter
that would be impossible to define;

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.920
or if it had been less,
we would have just been flying into space.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:22.160
Muladhara chakra is very important
because it represents that primordial purity

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.640
of the power that created us,
and at a gross level, it is represented

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.480
by the pelvic plexus.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.840
The pelvic plexus is formed by nerves
that come out of the sacrum bone

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.000
and as well as the last parts
of the lumbar vertebra.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.160
They come together, they exist on both sides,
and the pelvic plexus innervates

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.400
the excretory organs
as well as the reproductive organs

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.240
in the human body,
in males as well as females,

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.400
as shown in the animation.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.040
For example, the uterus
or the urinary bladder,

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:08.320
the excretory organs, those are the organs
that are controlled —

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:13.200
again, the word 'control' is used
in a spiritual sense, not just in a physical sense —

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.720
by the pelvic plexus.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.200
The pelvic plexus—there are two of them
on either side of the vertebral column

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.400
at the lower part of the body (the lower pelvis).
That's why it's called the pelvic plexus,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.520
and that's how they control these organs.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.440
But the power that controls the plexuses
is represented by the Muladhara chakra.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.320
Before we end this question,
to re-emphasize what we said

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.400
in answer to a previous question,
the Muladhara chakra should not be

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:49.600
looked at in a unitary fashion;
it is to be seen as part of an integral system

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.920
that literally sits above it,
but the Muladhara chakra provides

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:59.760
the support to it all, and its main function
is to provide gravity,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.400
and through that gravity, it allows
the support of the entire system.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:11.840
It is an extraordinarily important
energy center to be aware of.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.680
You mentioned two things:
you mentioned the sacrum bone,

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:20.320
and we'd like to understand
why it is considered relevant in this context.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:25.120
You also mentioned primordial energy.
Is this the same as the Kundalini energy

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.760
that we hear about, and
what is this Kundalini energy,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.200
and what role does it play
in human spirituality?

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.440
That is indeed true.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:40.160
Once again, as we look at the graphics,
we look at the animation,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.520
we see that at the bottom
of the vertebral column

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.600
is a triangular bone called the os sacrum.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.160
The Greeks realized
that this was a very sacred place,

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.840
and there is no reason to know so far,
as far as we know,

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.240
why they would call it that particular bone.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.000
There are theories about it;
it is said that that is amongst the last bones

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.880
to be destroyed in the human body
if a body is interred or is buried.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:16.080
It is an extremely strong bone;
it looks like the hood of a snake,

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:23.840
and within this os sacrum, and this is why
we believe in human spirituality,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.000
resides the primordial energy in
three and a half coils,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.920
in the serpentine coils,
and that energy is referred to in the yoga sutras

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.200
or in classical Sanskrit texts as Kundalini.

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.720
Kundala means coiled and it sits
there in three and a half coils.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.960
Other texts refer to it
as the serpent power,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.760
or that power that resides within us.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:56.720
It is very interesting that ancient Greeks
used to worship a god called Asclepius,

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.480
and Asclepius was known to cure diseases
with the use of serpent power.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.680
So, even now, if you look
at the most visible symbol of most physicians

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.760
or medical societies you see a staff,
and you see two serpents coiled around it,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.880
and that comes from the legend of Asclepius,
who was believed to cure diseases

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.880
using serpent power.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.320
So, this is this energy that resides within us;
this is the energy that allows us

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:35.600
to raise our consciousness from a human level
to a level whereby we can perceive

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.560
this existential reality
that is absolute,

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.440
that we referred to in one
of our previous episodes.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.880
The sympathetic nervous system has nerves

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.080
that permeate each part of our body,
including our nerves,

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:55.680
and when this energy is awakened within us,
as it rises through the other energy centers,

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.800
which we will talk about
in subsequent episodes,

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.120
and it arrives and it pierces
through the limbic system,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:11.120
the fontanel area in that part of the brain,
it allows us to feel that energy around us

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.240
that we otherwise cannot at a sensory level,
and that is very important.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.440
Biologically, it's interesting
that it may not be

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.920
the Kundalini energy per se,
but the Kundalini energy —

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.320
the fact that it allows an evolution —
bears an interesting parallel

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:34.640
to the double helical structure
of the DNA molecule.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:41.040
The DNA molecule, which exists
within every cell and is the fundamental unit

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.680
of all living organisms in every cell,
consists of two strands

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.080
that spiral around each other.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.560
One goes up, one goes down,
and it contains the genetic code within itself,

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.240
and the reason why, as the founder of Sahaja,
Shri Mataji, once explained, it is helical

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:07.040
is because a helical movement allows you,
if you move it, to arrive at a higher plane.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.200
Circular movement allows you
to only come back to the starting point,

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.000
but a helical movement allows you to rise up.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
That's why you have a spiral staircase.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.840
So, in a kind of analogous fashion,
the Kundalini energy allows us,

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.960
when it uncoils and as it rises,
to raise our consciousness.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:34.160
This is present in every human being,
and it is also called the mother energy.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.600
It is your individual mother
because this is the energy that knows best

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.640
what is good for you, what is best for you.
And it is a female energy

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.560
that resides within each one of us,
dormant in the sacrum.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.480
And it is the awakening of this energy

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:56.800
which is the ultimate object
of all yoga practices.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.440
In fact, yoga is defined as the awakening
of this energy and its piercing

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.080
through the fontanel area,
and the awakening of the limbic system.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:11.440
So, that's the Kundalini energy,
which resides in the sacrum,

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.480
and which certain systems of medicine,
particularly in the past, were kind of aware of.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.480
But it is extraordinarily challenging
to awaken that energy,

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.680
to make it uncoil itself
and rise through the Sushumna Nadi,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:31.040
which, at a gross level,

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.080
is represented by
the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.280
So, you mentioned every human being
has this energy,

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.360
and you also mentioned that this energy
helps us raise our consciousness.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.360
So, I guess my question is then,
why does every human being not evolve

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.960
up to a certain level of consciousness?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.840
Why is that different?

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.680
That's again a wonderful question.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:39:00.480
The reason is that this energy is a power
that can be awakened, or is awakened,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:07.360
only through the grace of a master.
And unless and until there is a master

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.680
who has the, quote-unquote, authority
or the ability to awaken it,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.600
this energy does not rise.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.760
This energy, let's just say,
has a mind of its own;

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.640
that is because it is of divine origin.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.480
It is divinity personified
within a human being,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.680
and that cannot be raised;
that cannot come up;

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.520
it doesn't uncoil itself and start rising
just because somebody wants it to be so.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.440
It has to happen, or it can only happen,
if that individual, that said individual,

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:49.280
comes in contact with a person who is a master
and whose own energy is awakened to a state

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:54.640
that can then allow for that other individual,
who doesn't have it awakened,

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.320
to be able to be awakened.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.080
We call it having a guru.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:02.720
It's a kind of traditional way of saying it,
but it is only through the grace of the guru—

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:09.440
of a true guru, a primordial,
a person who is truly a true master,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:16.880
who has nothing but pure benevolence
in his or her heart towards this other individual

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.360
can facilitate the awakening of this inner energy,

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.960
which is very, very relatively
straightforward in Sahaj,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.400
but that experience we can have
after this session,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.600
as the session that is led
by Shri Mataji herself.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.120
That's what I was going to say.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.440
I think it is, on that note,
perfect time for our audiences

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.720
to have that experience and then,
just follow the instructions that the founder has,

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.680
because, like you mentioned, there has to be
some expert or guru

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.000
who has to be able to do this for you.
And I would like to thank you, Dr. Ashish,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.440
for your time today,
and we look forward to talking to you again

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.400
on the next energy center
in our subtle system,

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.640
but thanks again for your time today.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.440
Thank you very much.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.160
Great questions.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.040
Enjoyed it.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.360
Thank you.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.720
I hope everybody enjoys
the meditation session as well.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.440
Yes, we do hope that.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.920
Shri Mataji: Called as the Muladhara chakra,
which manifests the pelvic plexus outside.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:26.240
Now, this center is placed below the Kundalini,
which is placed in the sacrum bone.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.160
This is called sacrum
because it is a sacred bone.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:36.640
In this bone lies the Kundalini,
the residual power of our germination.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:42.320
During the process of Kundalini awakening,
you can see the pulsation down here.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.400
You can also, through a stethoscope,
see the rising of the Kundalini,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:53.120
and you can see the pulsation in the backbone
till it reaches here in the fontanel bone area,

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.040
where it breaks through.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.200
At that point,
you do not feel any pulsation.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.440
As soon as this happens,
from your hands, a cool breeze starts to flow.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.120
You can feel it on your fingers,
as shown here.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:12.240
These are the terminal points
of the sympathetic nervous system within us.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.680
These represent all the centers
that are inside us,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:24.083
and you start feeling them on your fingers
as absolutely your own experience.

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.480
Keep your eyes closed.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.360
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.360
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:55.680
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.320
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:02.430
This is a very fundamental question.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:27.680
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.600
in the upper part.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.960
Here press it.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:41.440
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.840
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.160
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:53.991
Mother, am I my own master?

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:13.920
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:21.600
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.400
all the pure work is done.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.520
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.200
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.400
Six times you just ask.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.631
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:59.280
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.440
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:12.640
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:18.320
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:25.040
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.280
This you have to say ten times.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.320
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.055
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:17.840
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:27.920
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:34.800
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.200
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.600
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.040
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.796
This you have to say twelve times.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:24.400
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.280
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.120
So He forgives.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.760
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:41.440
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:49.920
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:54.080
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:57.840
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.120
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.560
Sixteen times.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.923
I am not guilty at all.

00:48:07.923 --> 00:48:16.059
Please say it.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:55.600
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:06.400
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.640
Please say it from your heart.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.720
How many times is not the point.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.120
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.800
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.720
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.600
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.600
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:38.588
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:53.200
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:58.240
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.600
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:12.080
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.390
please forgive me.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:29.600
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:36.160
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:44.960
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.160
Press it hard.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.680
Press hard your scalp.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.920
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:01.200
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.920
So you have to ask for it.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:12.480
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.774
Slowly saying that.
