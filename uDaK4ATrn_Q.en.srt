1
01:12:57,648 --> 01:13:03,098
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:11,514
At the very outset,

3
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:16,923
I have to tell you that Truth is what it is.

4
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:19,409
You cannot change it,

5
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,385
you cannot transform it,

6
01:13:22,389 --> 01:13:24,915
you cannot explain it.

7
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:28,290
Only thing you can experience it.

8
01:13:31,245 --> 01:13:33,352
In this Kali Yuga

9
01:13:33,502 --> 01:13:37,643
there is a special category of people born

10
01:13:37,672 --> 01:13:40,673
in all the countries very surprisingly,

11
01:13:40,712 --> 01:13:44,438
who are seekers of Truth.

12
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:51,414
And William Blake, the great poet of England

13
01:13:51,484 --> 01:13:53,734
has said that

14
01:13:55,073 --> 01:13:59,887
these men of God will be born during this time

15
01:13:59,938 --> 01:14:03,147
and they will know the truth

16
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,418
So many have said about this.

17
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:10,605
Even in our old books of prophecies.

18
01:14:13,114 --> 01:14:15,594
You have known so many of them

19
01:14:15,674 --> 01:14:19,442
but especially the one which is described

20
01:14:19,513 --> 01:14:23,007
in Nadi Granth written by Bhrigu Muni

21
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:25,977
is clearly said that at this time

22
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:30,882
people will know the Truth through the Kundalini Awakening.

23
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:33,883
The knowledge of Kundalini was known to us,

24
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:37,414
I don’t know how many years back.

25
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:42,147
You cannot say because our history is so unknown.

26
01:14:42,203 --> 01:14:47,938
But at the time of a great saint

27
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:51,389
called as Macchindra Nath and Gorakh Nath,

28
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:55,700
they were indulging into

29
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:58,816
awakening of Kundalini

30
01:14:58,865 --> 01:15:04,240
but the condition was that one Guru should give Realisation to only one person.

31
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:06,361
Went on like this

32
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,750
till the twelfth century when

33
01:15:08,758 --> 01:15:11,351
Gyandeva first of all asked his Guru,

34
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:14,680
his own Master was his own brother.

35
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:15,720
asked him that,

36
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:20,869
“You please allow me to at least write about Kundalini.”

37
01:15:20,908 --> 01:15:25,956
Because in the Gita it was not described.

38
01:15:25,982 --> 01:15:29,546
Though Shri Krishna has talked of Sthit Pragnya and all those things

39
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:33,112
but he didn’t talk about:

40
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:34,131
How to get it?

41
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,429
What is the mechanism within us which works it out?

42
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:43,220
Then he wrote it in his Gyaneshwari

43
01:15:43,268 --> 01:15:46,018
which is just a, I think,

44
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:48,797
explanation of Gita very clearly

45
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:52,818
that there is a power within us.

46
01:15:54,088 --> 01:15:56,957
In the sixth chapter he wrote about Kundalini

47
01:15:57,218 --> 01:16:01,476
but the people who were in charge of religion didn’t want that.

48
01:16:01,501 --> 01:16:04,161
So they said, “This is a Nishiddha (prohibited) part

49
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:07,523
and you should not read this part of Kundalini.”

50
01:16:07,531 --> 01:16:09,792
But in the sixteenth century

51
01:16:09,811 --> 01:16:12,619
under the guidance of Guru Nanaka,

52
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:13,660
Namdeva,

53
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:15,053
Kabira,

54
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:21,555
all these people, clearly, clearly, very clearly wrote about Kundalini

55
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:25,855
but the way it was mutilated

56
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,918
by

57
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:31,481
people which is very surprising.

58
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:33,311
Everything has been mutilated

59
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:36,055
but this one was very surprising

60
01:16:36,086 --> 01:16:39,985
because Kabira was in Bihar

61
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:42,285
and he called Kundalini as Surti.

62
01:16:42,304 --> 01:16:44,885
Very clearly, he said about Surti

63
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:50,834
but in Bihar, ‘Surti’ is what you call ‘tobacco’.

64
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:52,614
They call ‘tobacco’ as ‘Surti’,

65
01:16:52,617 --> 01:16:55,690
so you can imagine what is the mutilation.

66
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:58,887
Now this power is within you.

67
01:16:58,936 --> 01:17:00,787
If I am telling you something today

68
01:17:00,808 --> 01:17:02,588
you need not accept it.

69
01:17:02,628 --> 01:17:05,207
Blind folded acceptance is of no use.

70
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:08,634
We have had enough problems with blind faiths.

71
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:10,600
So, first of all

72
01:17:10,601 --> 01:17:12,170
you must get the experience

73
01:17:12,182 --> 01:17:16,004
and then you will not doubt it.

74
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:19,848
This science was known to us since long

75
01:17:19,888 --> 01:17:22,208
but as it was only done for one person

76
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,458
or say ten persons at the most,

77
01:17:25,468 --> 01:17:28,318
I decided to find out a method by which

78
01:17:28,348 --> 01:17:32,218
an en-masse Realisation could be given.

79
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,110
Luckily my father was a very social person

80
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:37,809
and I could meet many people.

81
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:42,153
Even my husband’s life was such that I could meet many people.

82
01:17:42,203 --> 01:17:48,804
So, I worked out the permutations and combinations of human problems

83
01:17:48,855 --> 01:17:50,669
and then I discovered

84
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,388
how we can easily solve this problem

85
01:17:53,405 --> 01:17:55,528
of Kundalini awakening.

86
01:17:55,516 --> 01:17:57,898
Because there are problems

87
01:17:57,936 --> 01:18:00,049
on the way of its ascent

88
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:03,771
then Kundalini doesn’t, Kundalini doesn’t come up.

89
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:05,340
Now

90
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,829
there are seven chakras

91
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:10,699
basically within us.

92
01:18:10,742 --> 01:18:13,826
These seven chakras are responsible

93
01:18:13,888 --> 01:18:18,484
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

94
01:18:18,497 --> 01:18:20,184
There is no doubt about it

95
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:22,528
but you have to first find out

96
01:18:22,521 --> 01:18:23,614
and then believe in it.

97
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:25,814
Don’t believe because I am saying so

98
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:30,117
or anybody says so. You have to experience it and feel it.

99
01:18:30,124 --> 01:18:32,427
There are many ways we can also judge.

100
01:18:32,434 --> 01:18:34,927
For example,

101
01:18:34,948 --> 01:18:36,477
in the Koran,

102
01:18:36,487 --> 01:18:41,427
Mohammed Sahib has said, “At the time of Kayama, means this time of Resurrection,

103
01:18:41,468 --> 01:18:43,328
your hands will speak.”

104
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:45,287
He also calls it ‘Kayamat’

105
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:48,341
means ‘those who will not accept will suffer’.

106
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:50,782
But who will accept their hands will speak,

107
01:18:50,802 --> 01:18:52,073
their

108
01:18:52,133 --> 01:18:54,773
mouth will be shut and their hands will speak?

109
01:18:54,843 --> 01:18:57,033
This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga

110
01:18:57,112 --> 01:19:00,071
that once you get your Self-realisation

111
01:19:00,117 --> 01:19:03,521
you can feel those subtle centres within you.

112
01:19:03,557 --> 01:19:05,674
These subtle centres of energy

113
01:19:05,703 --> 01:19:07,393
are seven in number

114
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:15,328
and are acting for giving us all kinds of energies.

115
01:19:15,377 --> 01:19:18,244
Now the problem is how to make

116
01:19:18,258 --> 01:19:20,114
people believe in Kundalini.

117
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:22,014
It’s a difficult task

118
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,905
because you are all intellectuals

119
01:19:23,917 --> 01:19:27,645
and you have had your medical education

120
01:19:27,657 --> 01:19:30,557
from England and all these places you see.

121
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:32,287
It is more westernised

122
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,562
and to believe in something Indian

123
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,403
is rather difficult for people that it’s all Indian after all.

124
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,550
But actually, even in medical science

125
01:19:41,621 --> 01:19:44,751
we have to understand the limitations of a science.

126
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:49,059
First of all, science is amoral.

127
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:53,412
Secondly, it does not go to the roots.

128
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:57,782
So, it starts like we have to treat a tree.

129
01:19:57,787 --> 01:19:59,432
So, we treat the leaves,

130
01:19:59,448 --> 01:20:00,843
treat the branches

131
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:03,182
but Sahaja Yoga is going to the roots,

132
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:04,900
is the knowledge of the roots.

133
01:20:04,924 --> 01:20:09,888
And the roots are the seven chakras and our Kundalini.

134
01:20:10,188 --> 01:20:13,560
Of course, without medical science you cannot also understand Sahaja Yoga.

135
01:20:13,581 --> 01:20:19,714
That is also one of the things because you can relate very easily. It is very scientific.

136
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:22,490
Now there are three Nadis also

137
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:25,219
Left, Right and Centre.

138
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,048
Left is called as Ida Nadi,

139
01:20:28,129 --> 01:20:29,848
right as Pingala

140
01:20:29,928 --> 01:20:36,959
and the central one is called as Sushumna Nadi.

141
01:20:40,677 --> 01:20:43,267
Kabira has described it very clearly

142
01:20:43,327 --> 01:20:46,213
and it is in the Granth Sahib

143
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:49,783
written down but nobody tries to understand

144
01:20:49,824 --> 01:20:51,343
or to go beyond the words.

145
01:20:51,363 --> 01:20:54,513
Just go and read the words that is not going to help.

146
01:20:54,533 --> 01:20:55,943
You have to go beyond it.

147
01:20:55,945 --> 01:21:01,043
It is like this, you see a beautiful picture say where it’s raining,

148
01:21:01,074 --> 01:21:05,703
it’s very beautiful and you are seeing it, that’s all.

149
01:21:05,721 --> 01:21:09,209
But you are not inside it to experience it.

150
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:11,829
So, to enter inside was difficult one

151
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:15,411
because of the tradition of giving to one person only,

152
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,889
or to few persons

153
01:21:16,899 --> 01:21:18,961
and secondly the greatest objection

154
01:21:18,971 --> 01:21:22,721
came from people, who were in charge of religion

155
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:24,240
so called

156
01:21:24,265 --> 01:21:26,255
Nowadays those who are intellectuals,

157
01:21:26,276 --> 01:21:32,497
you should say medias and other people

158
01:21:32,526 --> 01:21:35,634
who have a feeling that they know everything,

159
01:21:35,643 --> 01:21:39,300
they don’t want to take anything, that is to begin with.

160
01:21:39,324 --> 01:21:41,401
This is one of the reasons why

161
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:46,559
people don’t turn their eyes to the great knowledge we have in this country

162
01:21:46,576 --> 01:21:50,829
I am so very happy today that

163
01:21:50,847 --> 01:21:53,499
Indian Medical Association

164
01:21:53,526 --> 01:21:56,133
has given me this honour first of all

165
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:59,478
because I could never imagine in my lifetime,

166
01:21:59,496 --> 01:22:01,553
I would be able to talk with you.

167
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:06,037
I also did my medicine and I knew how difficult it was

168
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:08,021
and how people were blind.

169
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:11,417
So, I used to think, “How will I explain to them”,

170
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,742
like Kabira has said,

171
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:17,982
“Kaise samjhau, sab jag andha” (How to make them understand when the whole world is blind?)

172
01:22:18,006 --> 01:22:20,642
But the time has come because there are seekers now.

173
01:22:20,666 --> 01:22:22,811
And they should also know one more thing,

174
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:25,252
that this country is the Yogabhoomi.

175
01:22:25,286 --> 01:22:27,291
They have given us science all right

176
01:22:27,328 --> 01:22:28,698
but we will give them Yoga.

177
01:22:28,747 --> 01:22:34,723
We will give them the real basic knowledge

178
01:22:34,753 --> 01:22:39,822
what is the foundation of Medical Science,

179
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:41,849
is the foundation!

180
01:22:41,869 --> 01:22:46,049
Now by experimenting this and that

181
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:49,526
also you have seen that it is neutralised by challenges.

182
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:51,569
Every theory is neutralised

183
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:54,214
so that means it is not Absolute.

184
01:22:54,241 --> 01:22:58,253
So, we have to go to something that is absolutely Absolute

185
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:01,251
You have seen that Einstein found out something

186
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,054
then our people are after him

187
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:06,073
this is wrong, that is wrong, going on like that.

188
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,543
All the time something comes up, people go on criticising

189
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:14,155
and the whole knowledge goes into oblivion.

190
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:19,015
So now we have to understand that if this is the Yogabhoomi,

191
01:23:19,335 --> 01:23:21,167
this is our country

192
01:23:21,187 --> 01:23:23,969
and if it has given us such a knowledge,

193
01:23:23,996 --> 01:23:27,267
why should we not also listen to it,

194
01:23:27,276 --> 01:23:32,772
because not only that it will flower your knowledge of medicine,

195
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:39,537
not only that but it will give you such a confidence while practicing,

196
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:42,313
while talking about medicine.

197
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:45,523
Now as it is a subject,

198
01:23:45,544 --> 01:23:47,133
is on medicine

199
01:23:47,153 --> 01:23:50,147
I would like to speak on one of the centres

200
01:23:50,177 --> 01:23:54,824
which is very important because doctors are always affected by that centre.

201
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:58,874
So, I better tell them what can go wrong with doctors

202
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,757
and what they should be careful about.

203
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:13,045
It is to be understood that there is a centre,

204
01:24:13,094 --> 01:24:17,605
is the second centre which we call as Swadishthan.

205
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,545
This centre is very interesting.

206
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:23,465
It comes out of the Solar Plexus

207
01:24:23,499 --> 01:24:27,556
we call it a Nabhi Chakra

208
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:30,946
and like a lotus and it moves all round you see,

209
01:24:30,959 --> 01:24:34,826
as you can say in gross way it is Aortic Plexus.

210
01:24:34,849 --> 01:24:37,028
It supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

211
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:41,516
It is not Aortic Plexus but supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

212
01:24:41,527 --> 01:24:46,267
Now this centre is very important

213
01:24:46,307 --> 01:24:49,128
because it gives energy to our liver,

214
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:52,119
to pancreas,

215
01:24:52,147 --> 01:24:55,689
to our spleen, to our intestines,

216
01:24:55,704 --> 01:24:56,849
to our kidneys,

217
01:24:56,854 --> 01:24:59,964
can you imagine such an important centre it is!

218
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:01,152
This Swadishthan!

219
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:04,262
But the most important work it does is very...

220
01:25:04,286 --> 01:25:06,612
which I don’t know you will accept or not

221
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:10,686
but it supplies energy to our grey cells

222
01:25:10,701 --> 01:25:13,956
which we are using all the time.

223
01:25:13,941 --> 01:25:15,924
When we are thinking too much,

224
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:19,394
when we are acting physically and mentally,

225
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:24,568
this centre has to supply energy to our brain,

226
01:25:24,561 --> 01:25:28,118
we can call it to our grey cells

227
01:25:28,142 --> 01:25:31,778
which we are using all the time.

228
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:33,118
When we are doctors,

229
01:25:33,146 --> 01:25:35,426
we are using our grey cells how much?

230
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:36,159
We have no idea.

231
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,882
There is nobody who has found out

232
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:40,685
how much we use our brains,

233
01:25:40,756 --> 01:25:45,718
but we are going exhausting our brains and also, we are very futuristic.

234
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,888
All doctors are futuristic.

235
01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:52,632
Maybe they want to find out something

236
01:25:52,692 --> 01:25:54,753
in the pure sense of the word

237
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:57,363
or maybe they have certain ideas

238
01:25:57,384 --> 01:25:59,170
or maybe it is money,

239
01:25:59,181 --> 01:26:02,190
may be anything but they are very, very futuristic

240
01:26:02,201 --> 01:26:05,863
and in that trend of futuristic behaviour also

241
01:26:05,892 --> 01:26:07,728
there is a big competition

242
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:09,448
so they don’t know what to do.

243
01:26:09,474 --> 01:26:13,018
They have to be futuristic and think but what will happen.

244
01:26:13,028 --> 01:26:20,497
Now in this kind of movement of the mind

245
01:26:20,512 --> 01:26:21,310
what happens

246
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,899
we start becoming very right sided,

247
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:25,489
extremely right sided.

248
01:26:25,517 --> 01:26:27,289
Now as a result of that,

249
01:26:27,295 --> 01:26:29,545
as a right sided man, you know

250
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,834
I would say what medically can happen,

251
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:35,559
of course also happens lot of things mentally also.

252
01:26:35,574 --> 01:26:40,205
But what can happen medically,

253
01:26:40,214 --> 01:26:42,175
this Swadishthan Chakra

254
01:26:42,224 --> 01:26:44,264
which has to supply to your liver.

255
01:26:44,275 --> 01:26:45,974
Why do you call it ‘liver’?

256
01:26:45,994 --> 01:26:47,805
Because of liver we live.

257
01:26:47,805 --> 01:26:51,926
Liver is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

258
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:55,166
I know that in medicine we don’t know much about liver

259
01:26:55,171 --> 01:26:59,725
and it is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

260
01:26:59,732 --> 01:27:01,166
But now what happens,

261
01:27:01,195 --> 01:27:06,634
liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body

262
01:27:06,652 --> 01:27:11,191
and throws it into the circulation.

263
01:27:11,205 --> 01:27:13,744
That everyone knows, all right!

264
01:27:13,752 --> 01:27:18,272
Now when liver is looked after it is normal,

265
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:20,451
then we have also a pancreas,

266
01:27:20,482 --> 01:27:23,112
then we have spleen

267
01:27:23,161 --> 01:27:25,181
and also kidneys

268
01:27:25,216 --> 01:27:28,392
and the last part of intestines,

269
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:31,757
intestines as a whole but the last part is very important.

270
01:27:31,778 --> 01:27:34,538
So, such a man who is always thinking

271
01:27:34,589 --> 01:27:37,817
all his energy is going to his brain

272
01:27:37,829 --> 01:27:40,209
and all these organs are neglected

273
01:27:40,278 --> 01:27:43,663
and he can be affected by any one of them

274
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:47,523
So, the first thing he is affected is bad liver.

275
01:27:47,546 --> 01:27:49,329
Now this bad liver

276
01:27:49,344 --> 01:27:53,498
because it cannot throw its heat,

277
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:55,547
which is the poison of the body

278
01:27:55,557 --> 01:27:56,858
into the circulation.

279
01:27:56,907 --> 01:28:00,057
What happens that it starts, heat starts rising,

280
01:28:00,088 --> 01:28:03,588
this heat goes higher on the right side.

281
01:28:03,647 --> 01:28:05,318
We call it Right Heart

282
01:28:05,297 --> 01:28:08,778
which is the centre which controls the lungs.

283
01:28:08,758 --> 01:28:11,718
So, such a person can get Asthma.

284
01:28:11,735 --> 01:28:14,428
Now Asthma has been cured through Sahaja Yoga,

285
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:16,018
very simple way.

286
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:17,625
But it can be cured,

287
01:28:17,638 --> 01:28:23,215
it gets Asthma. We say it is incurable because we don't know about Swadishthan.

288
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:26,985
Now this same thing happens to our…

289
01:28:27,056 --> 01:28:30,017
when it moves to the left side pancreas.

290
01:28:30,046 --> 01:28:32,447
Mostly people who are sitting on their chairs

291
01:28:32,484 --> 01:28:35,004
and thinking too much and planning too much

292
01:28:35,012 --> 01:28:36,484
get diabetes.

293
01:28:41,205 --> 01:28:43,945
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

294
01:28:43,959 --> 01:28:47,650
In Maharashtra, I don’t know maybe here also in the villages,

295
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:51,235
a villager will take sugar

296
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:54,505
in such a way that the spoon must stand at the right angles

297
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,945
That’s the way

298
01:28:56,975 --> 01:28:59,309
a tea has to be made otherwise it is not tea,

299
01:28:59,329 --> 01:29:00,869
but he never gets diabetes,

300
01:29:00,844 --> 01:29:06,458
because he earns without any insurance or anything, spends it sleeps off.

301
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:07,838
Next day he earns.

302
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,017
He does not have botheration about future.

303
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,141
What he should do?

304
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,646
He should accumulate money

305
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:15,417
or he should give it to somebody? Nothing.

306
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:18,372
He just lives with himself.

307
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:21,652
Now this goes to pancreas,

308
01:29:21,682 --> 01:29:23,262
gives you diabetes,

309
01:29:23,272 --> 01:29:24,091
this heat

310
01:29:24,132 --> 01:29:25,953
Then it goes down

311
01:29:25,972 --> 01:29:29,613
then the kidney, kidney it coagulates.

312
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:31,833
Now for kidney if you go to dialysis,

313
01:29:31,853 --> 01:29:32,953
I must tell you

314
01:29:32,963 --> 01:29:34,271
not that only you die

315
01:29:34,282 --> 01:29:38,583
but you die bankrupt it is a fact.

316
01:29:39,968 --> 01:29:43,983
Now in no way I want to criticise doctors,

317
01:29:44,044 --> 01:29:45,964
they have to earn after all,

318
01:29:45,974 --> 01:29:47,794
but there is a simple way

319
01:29:47,814 --> 01:29:50,594
of curing this kidney trouble

320
01:29:50,574 --> 01:29:52,474
And once this kidney is cured,

321
01:29:52,464 --> 01:29:54,939
it is cured forever

322
01:29:54,946 --> 01:29:57,660
So, by helping Swadishthan

323
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:01,076
you can cure also kidney.

324
01:30:01,076 --> 01:30:03,290
But the most difficult thing

325
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:04,877
is the spleen.

326
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:08,377
Now in modern times

327
01:30:08,418 --> 01:30:10,234
we are very hectic

328
01:30:10,248 --> 01:30:11,044
For example,

329
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:14,393
most of the doctors have to get up early in the morning

330
01:30:14,413 --> 01:30:15,913
on duty.

331
01:30:15,948 --> 01:30:18,785
In college we also used to do the same thing.

332
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:19,805
Then we have no time

333
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:21,951
to eat our food properly nothing.

334
01:30:21,971 --> 01:30:24,384
And we take our breakfast with us sometimes.

335
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,296
In America

336
01:30:25,315 --> 01:30:27,716
I have seen doctors even brushing their teeth

337
01:30:27,736 --> 01:30:30,012
in the car.

338
01:30:30,026 --> 01:30:31,825
It is the limit of things.

339
01:30:31,825 --> 01:30:35,124
So, in this kind of a hectic life

340
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:36,344
what happens:

341
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,454
the spleen, poor thing

342
01:30:37,495 --> 01:30:41,075
which has to produce RBCs for emergencies

343
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:42,212
gets mad.

344
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,084
She can’t understand,

345
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:46,293
“What is the matter with this gentleman?”

346
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:51,761
and it cannot also a sort of cooperate

347
01:30:51,805 --> 01:30:53,954
with all the madness we have.

348
01:30:53,985 --> 01:30:55,469
Then we read newspapers.

349
01:30:55,485 --> 01:30:57,798
Reading newspapers in the morning

350
01:30:57,825 --> 01:30:59,568
is a very dangerous thing

351
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:02,016
because every day you see something horrible

352
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,486
and you get such a fright.

353
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:06,437
For example, these days our country is in doldrums.

354
01:31:06,477 --> 01:31:07,681
I never read it in the morning

355
01:31:07,730 --> 01:31:08,997
at any cost

356
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,470
But if you read it early in the morning any newspaper

357
01:31:11,561 --> 01:31:13,514
then finished, you will get some…

358
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:17,217
They only tell you about what has gone wrong;

359
01:31:17,237 --> 01:31:19,487
disasters, accidents,

360
01:31:19,546 --> 01:31:21,991
if not that then political crisis,

361
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:24,740
this that which upsets you.

362
01:31:24,777 --> 01:31:26,631
Whether you like it or not

363
01:31:26,664 --> 01:31:28,601
but it upsets you.

364
01:31:28,626 --> 01:31:32,040
So, reading newspaper early in the morning,

365
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:36,573
then just running forward.

366
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:37,823
No time for wife,

367
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:40,043
no time for children, nothing.

368
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:43,973
Formerly I remember that husband used to eat nicely

369
01:31:43,992 --> 01:31:45,234
at about ten o’clock.

370
01:31:45,237 --> 01:31:47,056
The wife used to fan him

371
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:51,717
because there might be some flies around.

372
01:31:51,717 --> 01:31:53,998
She used to fan

373
01:31:54,017 --> 01:31:59,758
and relaxed way they used to eat food and live relaxed.

374
01:31:59,778 --> 01:32:03,149
Now what you call in Urdu language

375
01:32:03,169 --> 01:32:05,669
‘Kashmakash’ (Mental Struggle) is so much,

376
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,859
that people are just running mad.

377
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:09,565
They don’t know what to do.

378
01:32:09,635 --> 01:32:10,796
Now they go to the office,

379
01:32:10,796 --> 01:32:12,885
then they find, doctors especially,

380
01:32:12,885 --> 01:32:14,440
the boss is angry

381
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:17,104
or there is some very serious patient has come,

382
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:19,220
somebody has died by mistake.

383
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:23,270
I mean doctors are completely treated

384
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,881
like criminals in America,

385
01:32:24,931 --> 01:32:26,720
absolutely like criminals.

386
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,861
So, this is also coming here.

387
01:32:28,874 --> 01:32:30,694
If they do anything wrong by mistake,

388
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:33,755
they do something, finished.

389
01:32:33,785 --> 01:32:35,090
Their practice is gone,

390
01:32:35,124 --> 01:32:37,370
they are put in jail.

391
01:32:37,384 --> 01:32:40,132
I mean after all they're human beings

392
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:42,363
but this consideration is not there

393
01:32:42,373 --> 01:32:47,502
And so, this futuristic life makes them really crazy people.

394
01:32:47,553 --> 01:32:49,103
Then they become very hot tempered.

395
01:32:49,113 --> 01:32:50,138
Liver gives you heat,

396
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:52,943
you become very hot tempered at the slightest thing,

397
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,318
you just shoot off

398
01:32:54,334 --> 01:32:57,152
and start saying things which you should never have said.

399
01:32:57,173 --> 01:32:58,752
Then you feel guilty.

400
01:32:58,768 --> 01:33:02,139
When you feel guilty you catch this centre here,

401
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:03,528
left Vishuddhi we call it

402
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,939
by which you develop spondylitis.

403
01:33:06,008 --> 01:33:07,425
If not spondylitis,

404
01:33:07,459 --> 01:33:10,365
there is something horrible thing can happen to you.

405
01:33:10,391 --> 01:33:12,686
Now according to Sahaja Yoga,

406
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:14,936
we have two types of heart attacks.

407
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,982
One is an active massive heart attack

408
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:21,734
and another one is what you call lethargic

409
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:23,567
like angina.

410
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:28,158
So, the first one which happens

411
01:33:28,153 --> 01:33:29,698
is the massive one

412
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:33,249
where same thing the heat reaches the heart.

413
01:33:33,258 --> 01:33:34,769
Now say there is a boy

414
01:33:34,778 --> 01:33:36,719
who is playing tennis

415
01:33:36,738 --> 01:33:38,739
at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two

416
01:33:38,778 --> 01:33:42,122
and is drinking also, competing with his father.

417
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,462
So, he gets that massive heart attack

418
01:33:46,109 --> 01:33:48,274
and it is absolutely fatal.

419
01:33:48,354 --> 01:33:50,725
He cannot live after that.

420
01:33:50,784 --> 01:33:53,521
This is a very common case you must have also seen.

421
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:56,477
I am not telling you something out of the blue.

422
01:33:56,491 --> 01:33:58,697
But the another one is

423
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:01,629
if you continue with this kind of thing

424
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:06,098
then maybe one day you might get massive heart attacks

425
01:34:06,129 --> 01:34:07,908
especially the industrialists.

426
01:34:07,949 --> 01:34:10,868
Industrialists are so much futuristic,

427
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:12,360
so much calculating

428
01:34:12,409 --> 01:34:18,789
that they don’t calculate that this will entail

429
01:34:18,803 --> 01:34:21,274
their own heart trouble

430
01:34:21,333 --> 01:34:25,242
So, this heart suddenly collapses and they die.

431
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:29,101
This is a, we call it an active heart attack

432
01:34:29,166 --> 01:34:30,805
due to over acting.

433
01:34:30,876 --> 01:34:33,015
Another one is lethargic heart attack

434
01:34:33,075 --> 01:34:34,285
like angina,

435
01:34:34,356 --> 01:34:38,485
that is if this centre is caught here, if you feel guilty.

436
01:34:38,515 --> 01:34:42,216
Some people are very sensitive and very formal type

437
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:43,588
you know, they feel guilty,

438
01:34:43,606 --> 01:34:45,188
“I should have done this.”

439
01:34:45,206 --> 01:34:46,348
I have known people

440
01:34:46,366 --> 01:34:47,866
who have been crying all their life,

441
01:34:47,886 --> 01:34:51,093
“I spilled coffee on the table of such and such.”

442
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:53,918
I say, “Let it be, now gone finished. Why are you bothered?”

443
01:34:53,914 --> 01:34:55,448
But they’ll go on and on and on.

444
01:34:55,444 --> 01:34:57,744
It’s a habit they have formed

445
01:34:57,793 --> 01:34:59,714
to feel guilty about this.

446
01:34:59,764 --> 01:35:02,394
So, about anything they start feeling guilty.

447
01:35:02,414 --> 01:35:06,536
In India we are not so much I think formal type

448
01:35:06,627 --> 01:35:07,974
of people, thank God.

449
01:35:08,016 --> 01:35:10,177
So, I find less cases of this

450
01:35:10,226 --> 01:35:14,194
but still there are many people who develop this left side.

451
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:18,342
Not only with that you develop your spondylitis,

452
01:35:18,371 --> 01:35:22,672
but you develop a situation

453
01:35:22,683 --> 01:35:27,534
where heart cannot pump blood for your brain,

454
01:35:27,544 --> 01:35:30,266
that is angina.

455
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,834
Nobody knows that it comes from this left side problem;

456
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:36,475
Left side problems come from other things also,

457
01:35:36,514 --> 01:35:39,986
but one of them is feeling guilty.

458
01:35:40,003 --> 01:35:41,948
This is something I am telling you which

459
01:35:41,973 --> 01:35:45,047
is not yet told in medical science.

460
01:35:45,062 --> 01:35:48,099
But I am sure one day we will have it from India.

461
01:35:48,126 --> 01:35:49,286
We will tell these people

462
01:35:49,337 --> 01:35:54,076
what we know about the roots of trouble.

463
01:35:54,097 --> 01:35:56,581
The root of trouble is like that.

464
01:35:56,597 --> 01:35:59,680
So now the last but not the least

465
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:02,091
is the effect of Swadishthan

466
01:36:02,107 --> 01:36:04,887
is this heat reaches the brain

467
01:36:04,937 --> 01:36:07,687
and gives you paralysis on the left hand side

468
01:36:07,687 --> 01:36:10,347
because you know it crosses over nerves.

469
01:36:10,377 --> 01:36:13,177
So, it gives you a terrible paralysis

470
01:36:13,157 --> 01:36:15,956
on the left-hand side but you feel it on the right-hand side.

471
01:36:15,966 --> 01:36:19,706
Also, nature is the one which tries to stop it.

472
01:36:19,726 --> 01:36:22,766
If you don’t stop, it says, “All right, I will stop your right side.”

473
01:36:22,763 --> 01:36:25,626
Left side will be all right.

474
01:36:25,632 --> 01:36:30,137
Now the one side of life is also right side.

475
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:34,120
Second side, another side we can say

476
01:36:34,097 --> 01:36:36,006
is the side which is left side.

477
01:36:36,066 --> 01:36:38,326
And the left side and right side when they meet,

478
01:36:38,387 --> 01:36:41,316
you get psychosomatic trouble.

479
01:36:41,326 --> 01:36:44,197
With this Kundalini rising what happens

480
01:36:44,187 --> 01:36:46,816
that it nourishes those centres.

481
01:36:46,837 --> 01:36:49,306
For example, see this is one centre formed

482
01:36:49,347 --> 01:36:50,986
by two left and right side.

483
01:36:50,986 --> 01:36:53,830
This is a centre; left and right side.

484
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:56,399
Now the Kundalini passes through this.

485
01:36:56,428 --> 01:36:59,669
But supposing you are using right side too much like this

486
01:36:59,687 --> 01:37:01,729
and suddenly left side breaks sometimes

487
01:37:01,737 --> 01:37:03,536
then what happens

488
01:37:03,588 --> 01:37:09,725
that your connection with the main,

489
01:37:09,754 --> 01:37:11,841
you should say

490
01:37:11,864 --> 01:37:13,431
mains is lost.

491
01:37:13,465 --> 01:37:17,312
You are on your own and cancer starts.

492
01:37:17,334 --> 01:37:19,542
Now this cancer can be cured also;

493
01:37:19,564 --> 01:37:21,705
I am sorry to say but it is a fact.

494
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:22,730
It can be cured.

495
01:37:22,745 --> 01:37:25,650
Cancer can be cured,

496
01:37:25,670 --> 01:37:29,333
not at a galloping stage I think but at an early stage.

497
01:37:29,352 --> 01:37:33,406
We have also tried some galloping stage people.

498
01:37:33,426 --> 01:37:34,666
They have improved

499
01:37:34,686 --> 01:37:37,847
but still I would say it is not guaranteed at that stage.

500
01:37:37,861 --> 01:37:40,232
After all nothing is guaranteed

501
01:37:40,302 --> 01:37:43,893
but still it works and it has worked.

502
01:37:43,931 --> 01:37:47,726
Now when this cancer is caused

503
01:37:47,746 --> 01:37:49,556
you see, what is our job

504
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,996
is to push back this left side with the right

505
01:37:51,994 --> 01:37:55,379
and also through Kundalini awakening to nourish,

506
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:56,599
nourish the centre

507
01:37:56,668 --> 01:38:00,138
You see this is the basis for our health

508
01:38:00,148 --> 01:38:04,738
our... you can say... mind,

509
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:08,264
everything it’s a mental, physical and emotional

510
01:38:08,354 --> 01:38:10,185
but also spiritual

511
01:38:10,245 --> 01:38:13,308
because when Kundalini rises like this;

512
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:18,462
it goes crosses over this fontanelle bone area.

513
01:38:18,482 --> 01:38:21,131
This is Kabira has said,

514
01:38:21,191 --> 01:38:23,341
“Shunya shikhar par anahat baje re.”

515
01:38:23,422 --> 01:38:26,593
Nobody can explain what does he say.

516
01:38:26,611 --> 01:38:28,194
“Shunya shikhar par anahat,”

517
01:38:28,216 --> 01:38:29,073
is the heartbeat.

518
01:38:29,095 --> 01:38:33,956
How can a heartbeat come up? ‘Shunya shikhar’ means ‘on the fontanelle bone area’

519
01:38:34,026 --> 01:38:35,046
He was not mad

520
01:38:35,095 --> 01:38:38,366
but the people who do not understand

521
01:38:38,436 --> 01:38:43,116
cannot think that this Kundalini reaches here. It does.

522
01:38:43,146 --> 01:38:44,666
You can see for yourself;

523
01:38:44,696 --> 01:38:46,216
it does reach here

524
01:38:46,265 --> 01:38:50,763
and once it breaks, this sound is finished

525
01:38:50,785 --> 01:38:52,063
Then on your nerves,

526
01:38:52,093 --> 01:38:54,859
you are amazed on your central nervous system

527
01:38:54,918 --> 01:38:57,238
you start feeling the cool breeze

528
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:00,764
of the Holy Ghost as they call it in the Bible

529
01:39:00,799 --> 01:39:04,860
or they call it as the Alakh Niranjan

530
01:39:04,914 --> 01:39:07,174
or they call it as Brahma Chaitanya.

531
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:10,090
You start feeling it on your fingertips,

532
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:12,274
on your hands, you can.

533
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:16,583
If you experience that, still you go on saying, “No, no, no. I do not believe in anything.”

534
01:39:16,633 --> 01:39:17,714
It’s all right.

535
01:39:17,774 --> 01:39:20,484
But if you really start moving into that line

536
01:39:20,533 --> 01:39:22,745
and start feeling that,

537
01:39:22,764 --> 01:39:24,515
then you are amazed

538
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:28,406
because when the Kundalini rises as I told you,

539
01:39:28,435 --> 01:39:29,844
She helps you physically.

540
01:39:29,854 --> 01:39:33,296
I have told you about only one chakra but there are seven chakras.

541
01:39:33,314 --> 01:39:35,126
So, all these seven chakras,

542
01:39:35,176 --> 01:39:39,276
they give permutation, combination of these three channels.

543
01:39:39,285 --> 01:39:40,897
It cures all.

544
01:39:40,896 --> 01:39:47,289
As a result, you start enjoying your life.

545
01:39:47,305 --> 01:39:47,904
You become

546
01:39:47,918 --> 01:39:51,464
what you call a person who is a witness to this whole thing.

547
01:39:51,504 --> 01:39:53,573
The whole thing becomes just a drama

548
01:39:53,593 --> 01:39:55,745
and you start living,

549
01:39:55,764 --> 01:39:58,135
seeing it so clearly.

550
01:39:58,135 --> 01:40:00,641
This is first thing happens to you.

551
01:40:00,681 --> 01:40:03,823
Now if you have something serious

552
01:40:03,841 --> 01:40:06,520
or say something you have to operate somewhere

553
01:40:06,532 --> 01:40:08,570
then you are nervous already,

554
01:40:08,581 --> 01:40:09,443
“How can I do it?”

555
01:40:09,483 --> 01:40:11,911
If you are nervous, then how can you operate?

556
01:40:11,973 --> 01:40:14,669
And also because of specialisation

557
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:16,618
you can only do one part.

558
01:40:16,661 --> 01:40:18,927
I have known people, surgeons also,

559
01:40:18,937 --> 01:40:21,628
who have opened the body they said, “No this is not my job.

560
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:24,706
This is the job of that doctor.”

561
01:40:24,747 --> 01:40:27,828
So, you know the complete knowledge

562
01:40:27,838 --> 01:40:29,684
of medical science, complete!

563
01:40:29,707 --> 01:40:31,363
It’s not only surgery,

564
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:35,661
it’s not only what you call medicine and others;

565
01:40:35,661 --> 01:40:37,745
we have learnt so many.

566
01:40:37,754 --> 01:40:40,454
So, all that becomes a totality.

567
01:40:40,483 --> 01:40:41,908
In totality you know

568
01:40:41,914 --> 01:40:44,944
what is wrong with it on your fingertips.

569
01:40:44,959 --> 01:40:50,139
For diagnosis, you know a patient dies after it

570
01:40:50,152 --> 01:40:52,225
If somebody goes to say

571
01:40:52,253 --> 01:40:55,646
“Houston” for diagnosis,

572
01:40:55,651 --> 01:40:56,935
you should insure him

573
01:40:56,941 --> 01:40:59,574
because maybe he might die with diagnosis only.

574
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:00,656
It’s like this,

575
01:41:00,681 --> 01:41:03,136
here diagnosis is only on fingertips.

576
01:41:03,161 --> 01:41:05,270
On the fingertips you can feel very easily

577
01:41:05,266 --> 01:41:07,419
what is the central catch.

578
01:41:07,407 --> 01:41:08,560
Now if you learn

579
01:41:08,546 --> 01:41:09,449
or if you know

580
01:41:09,447 --> 01:41:11,790
what are these centres meant for,

581
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:13,719
if you know what they are related to

582
01:41:13,736 --> 01:41:15,469
as far as your physical side is concerned

583
01:41:15,478 --> 01:41:16,600
for doctors,

584
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:18,249
then you will know

585
01:41:18,271 --> 01:41:21,231
that this person is suffering from this disease.

586
01:41:21,261 --> 01:41:24,190
Even small children, say ten children,

587
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:28,964
you tie up their eyes and ask them,

588
01:41:29,014 --> 01:41:30,792
“What is this person suffering from?”

589
01:41:30,816 --> 01:41:33,215
So immediately supposing they give this

590
01:41:33,222 --> 01:41:36,435
you ask that fellow, “What about your throat? Is it all right?”

591
01:41:36,421 --> 01:41:37,745
“Ah no, it is not all right.”

592
01:41:37,764 --> 01:41:39,004
But how do they know?

593
01:41:39,002 --> 01:41:41,462
Because on the fingertip they know,

594
01:41:41,478 --> 01:41:43,032
they show the finger.

595
01:41:43,081 --> 01:41:45,591
So, everybody will say the same thing,

596
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,802
because it is Absolute.

597
01:41:47,871 --> 01:41:49,345
This All-pervading Power

598
01:41:49,341 --> 01:41:51,315
about which people have talked about,

599
01:41:51,331 --> 01:41:52,985
they have called it Brahma Chaitanya

600
01:41:52,991 --> 01:41:54,926
They have called it all kinds of things

601
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:57,515
but they don’t know what it is.

602
01:41:57,515 --> 01:42:01,810
It is this power that starts flowing

603
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:03,739
and when it starts flowing through you,

604
01:42:03,739 --> 01:42:05,909
tremendous things happen,

605
01:42:05,909 --> 01:42:08,760
tremendous things happen.

606
01:42:08,780 --> 01:42:10,481
I have known so many bureaucrats

607
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:12,251
you see, were so much worried, upset;

608
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:14,751
because they were honest people and were suffering.

609
01:42:14,781 --> 01:42:15,781
They took to Sahaja Yoga.

610
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,640
Their lives are changed now, they are enjoying themselves.

611
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:20,160
They are not bothered.

612
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,504
Because this not only guides you,

613
01:42:23,501 --> 01:42:25,174
this not only gives you knowledge

614
01:42:25,177 --> 01:42:27,393
but also protects you all the time.

615
01:42:27,397 --> 01:42:28,616
I have seen many doctors

616
01:42:28,617 --> 01:42:30,745
who are doing say heart trouble.

617
01:42:30,756 --> 01:42:33,835
Heart patients they are looking after.

618
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:36,762
There are doctors who are curing cancer patients

619
01:42:36,792 --> 01:42:41,581
I met one doctor who has a dialysis hospital;

620
01:42:41,641 --> 01:42:45,899
but his kidneys.

621
01:42:45,948 --> 01:42:48,695
I said, “Doctor, how have you got this?”

622
01:42:48,688 --> 01:42:53,415
So, he is just treating only people for dialysis and he gets his kidneys

623
01:42:53,438 --> 01:42:56,145
So, there is no protection.

624
01:42:56,156 --> 01:42:59,736
You should also have the protection as a surgeon has.

625
01:42:59,768 --> 01:43:01,819
He will tie up his hands and everything.

626
01:43:01,869 --> 01:43:06,056
But then otherwise normally doctors have no protection of any kind

627
01:43:06,084 --> 01:43:08,044
when they treat another person

628
01:43:08,064 --> 01:43:09,514
and if they are sensitive,

629
01:43:09,574 --> 01:43:12,610
they may catch from them slowly, slowly the diseases,

630
01:43:12,635 --> 01:43:14,460
which they are going to cure.

631
01:43:14,492 --> 01:43:17,591
This is also a point nobody thinks of.

632
01:43:17,588 --> 01:43:20,301
We are not machines, we are human beings,

633
01:43:20,297 --> 01:43:24,772
we are not a stone, but we are sensitive

634
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:27,351
and when you see somebody suffering

635
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,076
you catch from them.

636
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,351
You definitely catch

637
01:43:31,367 --> 01:43:33,809
but in Sahaja Yoga you know you are catching.

638
01:43:33,836 --> 01:43:36,509
In Sahaja Yoga you know what you are catching

639
01:43:36,529 --> 01:43:40,829
and you know how to clear it out and how to protect yourself.

640
01:43:40,899 --> 01:43:43,399
Now this is what one doesn’t understand

641
01:43:43,458 --> 01:43:46,896
that all human beings can get their Self-realisation,

642
01:43:46,908 --> 01:43:47,976
all of them.

643
01:43:48,003 --> 01:43:51,132
Only thing if you are thinking

644
01:43:51,142 --> 01:43:54,166
that you are a great scientist

645
01:43:54,183 --> 01:43:57,907
and you are above everything and you have read everything,

646
01:43:57,933 --> 01:43:59,881
“I don’t have to know anything”,

647
01:43:59,897 --> 01:44:01,661
then it doesn’t work.

648
01:44:01,677 --> 01:44:03,052
It cannot force.

649
01:44:03,056 --> 01:44:06,171
Sahaja Yoga cannot force on you its knowledge, nothing.

650
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:09,830
It respects you, and respects your freedom.

651
01:44:09,844 --> 01:44:11,354
Freedom has been given to you

652
01:44:11,385 --> 01:44:14,885
whether you take to it or don’t take to it, is your own.

653
01:44:14,885 --> 01:44:19,874
But if you want it, if you are really desirous of getting it

654
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:21,844
then you get it.

655
01:44:21,851 --> 01:44:23,562
But with that you get knowledge

656
01:44:23,621 --> 01:44:25,604
not only about medical science

657
01:44:25,591 --> 01:44:28,025
but also about people.

658
01:44:28,069 --> 01:44:33,324
Now there are so many types of God men coming.

659
01:44:33,338 --> 01:44:35,797
Now how will you know they are not correct?

660
01:44:35,813 --> 01:44:37,813
How will you?

661
01:44:37,853 --> 01:44:41,994
How will you know that Guru Nanaka was a great,

662
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,754
not only saint but an incarnation?

663
01:44:44,754 --> 01:44:46,246
How will you know about Christ?

664
01:44:46,296 --> 01:44:48,947
How will you know about anyone of them

665
01:44:48,956 --> 01:44:50,746
because you don’t know the Absolute?

666
01:44:50,766 --> 01:44:52,124
You are born like that,

667
01:44:52,137 --> 01:44:53,937
but once you are born in Sahaja Yoga,

668
01:44:53,986 --> 01:44:55,476
you become a Yogi.

669
01:44:55,526 --> 01:44:59,012
And then you know exactly that they are all one.

670
01:44:59,014 --> 01:45:00,572
All the Sufis are one,

671
01:45:00,573 --> 01:45:03,282
all these great Prophets are one.

672
01:45:03,312 --> 01:45:08,241
All these we can call them Prophets

673
01:45:08,254 --> 01:45:10,281
and also incarnations,

674
01:45:10,287 --> 01:45:12,610
they're altogether one.

675
01:45:12,588 --> 01:45:14,168
Christ himself has said,

676
01:45:14,237 --> 01:45:16,437
“Those who are not against us are with us.”

677
01:45:16,487 --> 01:45:18,849
But how many Christians understand this?

678
01:45:18,878 --> 01:45:21,559
So, there is no need to have different, different religions.

679
01:45:21,563 --> 01:45:25,343
It’s in one big huge ocean of knowledge

680
01:45:25,393 --> 01:45:29,613
which has different, different, we can say, ports

681
01:45:29,664 --> 01:45:32,421
but that doesn’t mean the ocean is different.

682
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:34,417
All your problems will be solved

683
01:45:34,496 --> 01:45:38,387
as far as integration of religions are concerned

684
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:40,837
and you don’t have to give up anything

685
01:45:40,839 --> 01:45:42,437
but respect everything

686
01:45:42,438 --> 01:45:47,066
in the right manner that you know about them.

687
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:48,834
There is nothing to discard,

688
01:45:48,905 --> 01:45:51,487
nothing to condemn

689
01:45:51,504 --> 01:45:54,385
but you just, to know about them,

690
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:56,431
then you are amazed

691
01:45:56,451 --> 01:45:59,674
how they are talking the same thing what you are talking.

692
01:45:59,681 --> 01:46:01,534
I have read a book

693
01:46:01,534 --> 01:46:06,414
written by a one great Sufi from Turkey

694
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:11,311
and another I have read it with our Nisamuddin

695
01:46:11,335 --> 01:46:14,331
here who had written something

696
01:46:14,366 --> 01:46:16,781
and his disciples, just the same,

697
01:46:16,774 --> 01:46:18,621
they write the same thing.

698
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:20,446
I mean there is no difference

699
01:46:20,466 --> 01:46:22,613
because absolute knowledge is the same,

700
01:46:22,643 --> 01:46:24,533
only expression may be different.

701
01:46:24,603 --> 01:46:27,264
They might use different expressions.

702
01:46:27,323 --> 01:46:31,246
So, you get out of this madness of religion also.

703
01:46:31,246 --> 01:46:33,928
Religion can never teach you to hate anyone,

704
01:46:33,937 --> 01:46:34,808
can never,

705
01:46:34,867 --> 01:46:39,368
because I am talking here about the power of love.

706
01:46:39,398 --> 01:46:43,016
This All-pervading Power is the power of love.

707
01:46:43,026 --> 01:46:44,036
It guides you;

708
01:46:44,056 --> 01:46:45,306
it looks after you,

709
01:46:45,357 --> 01:46:47,792
it cooperates, it coordinates.

710
01:46:47,812 --> 01:46:50,512
It is so efficient a government

711
01:46:50,541 --> 01:46:55,297
that I don’t think we can ever imagine how efficient it is

712
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:57,637
and it works just like this.

713
01:46:58,505 --> 01:47:00,344
Sometimes it is very amazing

714
01:47:00,364 --> 01:47:03,025
I will tell you now, today a case of a lady

715
01:47:03,114 --> 01:47:06,840
which is a true case. Is she here now?

716
01:47:06,844 --> 01:47:08,449
Mexican, no?

717
01:47:08,459 --> 01:47:10,120
She might be here

718
01:47:10,130 --> 01:47:12,318
See, there's a lady. You are there!

719
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,888
She is a lady here.

720
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:17,823
She was working with the UN and when I went to New York, she got her Realisation

721
01:47:17,882 --> 01:47:21,783
and she became a very ardent Sahaja Yogi.

722
01:47:21,792 --> 01:47:24,752
It rose to that thing where we call shraddha.

723
01:47:28,893 --> 01:47:31,518
Then she wrote to me three letters

724
01:47:31,578 --> 01:47:36,263
telling me about some disease her son has got

725
01:47:36,332 --> 01:47:40,553
who is only eighteen years of age studying in Harvard University or something.

726
01:47:40,652 --> 01:47:45,280
She said, “Mother this disease some people get it in my family at old age and they die.”

727
01:47:45,301 --> 01:47:47,272
” It’s a special Mexican disease,

728
01:47:47,321 --> 01:47:49,710
it’s a big name as usual you see.

729
01:47:49,723 --> 01:47:53,984
So, I was thinking what to write to her

730
01:47:53,982 --> 01:47:56,333
and we’re just paying attention.

731
01:47:56,393 --> 01:47:59,904
And she said, “Should I bring my child there, what should I do?” and all that.

732
01:47:59,913 --> 01:48:01,714
And the fourth letter I find

733
01:48:01,794 --> 01:48:06,165
that the doctors have said that he is completely cured,

734
01:48:06,174 --> 01:48:08,056
there is nothing in it.

735
01:48:08,062 --> 01:48:10,598
Just imagine how quick it was.

736
01:48:12,716 --> 01:48:14,208
I mean, I was amazed.

737
01:48:14,214 --> 01:48:15,818
There are so many cases like that

738
01:48:15,833 --> 01:48:17,388
but this is something remarkable.

739
01:48:17,413 --> 01:48:19,882
Where is Mexico! I was in Pune

740
01:48:19,973 --> 01:48:24,062
and just see how this Paramchaitanya has done it.

741
01:48:25,022 --> 01:48:27,272
How it is kind!

742
01:48:27,332 --> 01:48:31,690
It is the power of love of God which looks after you.

743
01:48:31,699 --> 01:48:33,429
After all the One who has created us,

744
01:48:33,419 --> 01:48:36,669
the Creator is going to look after us, isn’t it?

745
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:44,328
But we should have also little attention towards finding out what is the truth.

746
01:48:44,335 --> 01:48:46,138
Don’t accept anything,

747
01:48:46,145 --> 01:48:48,628
you have to find out the truth first of all

748
01:48:48,645 --> 01:48:50,614
and everybody has said that

749
01:48:50,674 --> 01:48:53,209
it is the same thing as everybody has said,

750
01:48:53,225 --> 01:48:55,015
you should know about yourself.

751
01:48:56,054 --> 01:48:58,109
Guru Nanaka’s thing I will say:

752
01:48:58,109 --> 01:49:04,425
Kahe ray Ban khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi Sada Alepa, Tohey sang samai

753
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:09,069
Pusp maday jo Bas Basat Hai, Mukur Mahey ras chayi

754
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:13,895
Taisai hi Hari basay nirantar, Ghat hi khojo bhai

755
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:18,355
Kahay nanak bin aapa chinay, Mitay na bhram ki kai’

756
01:49:18,395 --> 01:49:21,924
He said you must know yourself. “Know thyself” Christ has said.

757
01:49:22,015 --> 01:49:24,205
Everybody has said you should know yourself.

758
01:49:24,265 --> 01:49:26,185
Now what is that knowing yourself?

759
01:49:26,234 --> 01:49:30,191
That is nothing but you are

760
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:33,241
the principle is that the truth is this

761
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:37,157
that you are not this body, this mind,

762
01:49:37,167 --> 01:49:39,517
you are not these emotions,

763
01:49:39,517 --> 01:49:41,897
you are not this ego,

764
01:49:42,017 --> 01:49:46,310
you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

765
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:48,464
All our saints have said that.

766
01:49:48,484 --> 01:49:51,103
Now we are not on that path.

767
01:49:51,123 --> 01:49:54,431
We are not looking out for what are we.

768
01:49:54,433 --> 01:49:55,865
If we are the Spirit,

769
01:49:55,893 --> 01:49:58,875
then how are we to become the Spirit?

770
01:49:58,893 --> 01:50:01,175
Now anybody who starts talking like that,

771
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,705
I mean, I was very much opposed by many people

772
01:50:03,756 --> 01:50:06,636
because they thought I was just telling lies,

773
01:50:06,625 --> 01:50:10,892
I am this thing, that thing, but when they got sick, they came to Me.

774
01:50:10,892 --> 01:50:12,504
That’s not the way.

775
01:50:12,504 --> 01:50:17,881
The way is to try to know that we do not know the absolute.

776
01:50:17,893 --> 01:50:20,250
Once you become a little humble about it

777
01:50:20,243 --> 01:50:22,060
that we don’t know the absolute,

778
01:50:22,105 --> 01:50:25,355
so the religion and science become one

779
01:50:25,355 --> 01:50:30,535
because you can explain it scientifically as Dr. U.C. Rai has done

780
01:50:30,558 --> 01:50:34,058
Scientifically, you can explain what happens.

781
01:50:34,047 --> 01:50:35,667
Now you don’t have to become

782
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:38,940
what you call ‘karm-kandi’, ‘ritualistic’, no need

783
01:50:38,969 --> 01:50:41,710
There is nothing to be done ritualistically, nothing.

784
01:50:41,739 --> 01:50:43,701
Once you are really realised,

785
01:50:43,699 --> 01:50:46,359
you have to do a little meditation everyday,

786
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:47,810
in the evening.

787
01:50:47,819 --> 01:50:53,556
Now what I also would I should say this Paramchaitanya

788
01:50:53,565 --> 01:50:57,214
that it gave us a chance to have a hospital in Vashi

789
01:50:57,216 --> 01:50:59,564
and the results are very good in Vashi.

790
01:50:59,596 --> 01:51:02,384
They never use to charge anything for the outdoor patients

791
01:51:02,384 --> 01:51:03,687
but they said, “Mother,

792
01:51:03,683 --> 01:51:05,277
please allow us to take ten Rupees.”

793
01:51:05,306 --> 01:51:08,406
I said, “All right, take ten Rupees, is all right for everything."

794
01:51:08,417 --> 01:51:11,906
but the people who are living inside,

795
01:51:11,926 --> 01:51:14,064
they are also paying little amount;

796
01:51:14,087 --> 01:51:16,920
nothing compared to what people pay in the hospitals.

797
01:51:16,933 --> 01:51:20,583
And Dr. Rai has so sacrificingly accepted.

798
01:51:20,603 --> 01:51:23,359
And the doctors are coming from Russia all the way.

799
01:51:23,388 --> 01:51:26,399
You know, Russian doctors are wonderful doctors.

800
01:51:26,419 --> 01:51:29,248
They are very great scientists, I must say.

801
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:35,437
They have gone very far in scientific approach.

802
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:38,161
They have tried to find out the energies,

803
01:51:38,198 --> 01:51:39,448
which are subtle energies,

804
01:51:39,457 --> 01:51:41,036
and lots of things they have done,

805
01:51:41,047 --> 01:51:42,897
but specially, they are very much interested

806
01:51:42,968 --> 01:51:47,725
in working through Sahaja Yoga and they are coming down here to work.

807
01:51:47,728 --> 01:51:52,015
Now I would not expect our doctors to come and work like that,

808
01:51:52,027 --> 01:51:54,515
but at least for once a week,

809
01:51:54,527 --> 01:51:56,205
they can give some time

810
01:51:56,227 --> 01:52:02,670
and they can practice Sahaja Yoga just as a blessing to the people.

811
01:52:02,672 --> 01:52:05,073
Our country is full of very poor people,

812
01:52:05,082 --> 01:52:08,002
very, very poor people, extremely poor

813
01:52:08,013 --> 01:52:10,402
and we feel very much concerned.

814
01:52:10,433 --> 01:52:11,610
People always ask Me,

815
01:52:11,614 --> 01:52:13,580
“Yours is such a Yoga Bhoomi

816
01:52:13,594 --> 01:52:15,424
then, the, why the people are poor?

817
01:52:15,453 --> 01:52:16,694
The poor they are,

818
01:52:16,703 --> 01:52:20,359
because they do not follow the right path.

819
01:52:20,353 --> 01:52:22,560
You see, if they follow the right path,

820
01:52:22,583 --> 01:52:25,042
Lakshmi is also there to bless you.

821
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,902
There is nothing to worry about money,

822
01:52:26,919 --> 01:52:28,637
nothing to worry about anything

823
01:52:28,643 --> 01:52:34,487
and you become a person who is absolutely in balance.

824
01:52:34,493 --> 01:52:37,152
As soon as something comes up,

825
01:52:37,172 --> 01:52:38,603
some crisis come up,

826
01:52:38,611 --> 01:52:41,212
immediately you all become silent

827
01:52:41,283 --> 01:52:44,303
and you start seeing what’s wrong,

828
01:52:44,312 --> 01:52:45,683
what is the problem.

829
01:52:45,703 --> 01:52:47,613
Because you are not silent,

830
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:48,763
always in the conflict,

831
01:52:48,776 --> 01:52:50,713
you cannot see the problem clearly

832
01:52:50,736 --> 01:52:52,713
and you cannot solve it,

833
01:52:52,716 --> 01:52:56,515
but, you actually, you don’t solve any problem.

834
01:52:56,536 --> 01:52:58,886
It is this, I must say this power.

835
01:52:58,955 --> 01:53:02,060
I also tell them I don’t do anything; I am just sitting down;

836
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,405
this power is doing everything.

837
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:04,555
They don’t believe it

838
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:05,975
but it is a fact.

839
01:53:05,971 --> 01:53:07,675
I am not doing anything, I am just sitting,

840
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:10,775
I am not planning, I am not doing anything whatsoever

841
01:53:10,786 --> 01:53:12,866
but this power does everything for us

842
01:53:12,915 --> 01:53:14,085
so why should I do it.

843
01:53:14,156 --> 01:53:18,397
But, it’s rather difficult for human beings to leave things to this power.

844
01:53:18,415 --> 01:53:21,877
Even some doctors, who have been practising Medical Science

845
01:53:21,895 --> 01:53:25,716
have had very funny experiences

846
01:53:25,727 --> 01:53:28,397
Like there’s one Dr. Amjad Ali in Australia

847
01:53:28,417 --> 01:53:30,354
who is very well qualified

848
01:53:30,348 --> 01:53:33,164
and he was experimenting

849
01:53:33,167 --> 01:53:36,598
on some sort of “kya kar rahe they.”

850
01:53:40,116 --> 01:53:42,558
So, you see that what he found

851
01:53:42,638 --> 01:53:46,699
when he went close to them, they start becoming smaller.

852
01:53:46,707 --> 01:53:47,879
He could not experiment.

853
01:53:47,884 --> 01:53:50,239
He said, “How my experiment will go?

854
01:53:50,274 --> 01:53:53,824
Because I cannot! As soon as I go near them, everything disappears,

855
01:53:53,824 --> 01:53:55,031
all the disease disappears,

856
01:53:55,054 --> 01:53:56,011
so what can I do?”

857
01:53:56,015 --> 01:53:58,111
I said, “You don’t experiment with that

858
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:03,031
but you can experiment with the people who are already sick and do something about it.”

859
01:54:03,011 --> 01:54:04,500
So, there are many things like that.

860
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,602
And another person told me that in England

861
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,971
there is a craze for research.

862
01:54:09,011 --> 01:54:14,520
So, one scientist, they told him, “You find out what is minus 273,

863
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,911
the absolute zero.

864
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:21,278
So, he said, “I cannot, because the formula is such that some heat will remain always there.”

865
01:54:21,279 --> 01:54:22,298
I said, “All right,

866
01:54:22,295 --> 01:54:23,928
do one thing,

867
01:54:23,935 --> 01:54:27,495
you go and tell them this is absolute and how can we find absolute.”

868
01:54:27,511 --> 01:54:29,292
“We cannot find Absolute.

869
01:54:29,326 --> 01:54:32,683
It is absolutely, absolutely beyond us”.

870
01:54:32,692 --> 01:54:36,362
Then I said, “You use vibrations and you use these Divine vibrations.”

871
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:39,428
And he achieved it. He got his doctorate and he did it.

872
01:54:39,435 --> 01:54:40,969
So, they asked him, “How did you do it?”

873
01:54:40,978 --> 01:54:42,759
He said, “I cannot explain to you.”

874
01:54:42,757 --> 01:54:44,129
“Because if I talk to them,

875
01:54:44,147 --> 01:54:45,448
they will never listen to me.

876
01:54:45,457 --> 01:54:47,830
These scientists, you know, they think no end of themselves.

877
01:54:47,848 --> 01:54:50,929
How can I tell them that I did it with this Divine Power?”

878
01:54:50,944 --> 01:54:53,547
They cannot believe that there is another big power

879
01:54:53,567 --> 01:54:55,446
After all who runs our heart?

880
01:54:55,466 --> 01:54:58,056
Ask the doctors who runs our heart.

881
01:54:58,076 --> 01:54:59,926
They will say Autonomous Nervous System.

882
01:54:59,957 --> 01:55:01,917
Now who is this Auto?

883
01:55:01,926 --> 01:55:03,464
Ask this question second one.

884
01:55:03,477 --> 01:55:04,554
You can’t answer.

885
01:55:04,569 --> 01:55:05,815
Who is this Auto?

886
01:55:05,821 --> 01:55:06,955
‘Auto’ you don’t know.

887
01:55:06,978 --> 01:55:09,728
They will just…

888
01:55:09,908 --> 01:55:13,768
But they are honest because they say, “We don’t know”

889
01:55:13,838 --> 01:55:16,548
and they have put it the name ‘Autonomous’.

890
01:55:16,649 --> 01:55:19,649
Now I am talking of parasympathetic nervous system,

891
01:55:24,729 --> 01:55:26,526
as you know very well.

892
01:55:26,539 --> 01:55:28,796
And we know very little about parasympathetic.

893
01:55:28,809 --> 01:55:29,835
It’s a fact.

894
01:55:29,865 --> 01:55:31,356
How for other people

895
01:55:31,363 --> 01:55:36,113
I will tell you that in very simple words what is parasympathetic.

896
01:55:36,133 --> 01:55:38,522
Now when there is some emergency,

897
01:55:38,512 --> 01:55:42,044
our sympathetic nervous system which is to the left and right side

898
01:55:42,044 --> 01:55:44,347
go into motion.

899
01:55:44,345 --> 01:55:45,818
Like, we have to run,

900
01:55:45,814 --> 01:55:50,568
then if you are running, our heart will start pumping blood.

901
01:55:50,584 --> 01:55:53,928
But what brings it back to normal,

902
01:55:53,943 --> 01:55:56,584
is the parasympathetic, in simple words.

903
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:03,667
So, this parasympathetic nervous system,

904
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:05,878
when it is filled with energy,

905
01:56:05,861 --> 01:56:09,408
when it is filled with energy it just settles down.

906
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:11,097
It gets nourished

907
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:14,747
and then it starts working in such a beautiful manner

908
01:56:14,771 --> 01:56:19,568
that you achieve so many things which you could not normally achieve.

909
01:56:19,579 --> 01:56:24,160
First thing that happens that you become a very peaceful personality,

910
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:27,899
very peaceful.

911
01:56:27,919 --> 01:56:30,071
Because we are thinking,

912
01:56:30,075 --> 01:56:34,082
now the thoughts are rising and falling, again thoughts are rising and falling,

913
01:56:34,104 --> 01:56:36,222
again thoughts are rising and falling.

914
01:56:36,245 --> 01:56:40,131
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

915
01:56:40,151 --> 01:56:43,392
But there is a space in between

916
01:56:43,432 --> 01:56:45,861
and that is in Sanskrit called ‘vilambha’.

917
01:56:45,921 --> 01:56:49,387
But we can call it ‘pause’ in English language.

918
01:56:49,396 --> 01:56:52,437
Now this is the time

919
01:56:52,455 --> 01:56:55,666
where we never see that point.

920
01:56:55,675 --> 01:56:57,077
We never are there.

921
01:56:57,086 --> 01:56:58,546
So, when we are jumping,

922
01:56:58,566 --> 01:57:01,332
we are jumping in the future or in the past

923
01:57:01,329 --> 01:57:03,618
For example, just now, you are sitting before Me,

924
01:57:03,608 --> 01:57:06,028
maybe you are thinking if they will get a train or not,

925
01:57:06,039 --> 01:57:08,178
a bus or not, this and that,

926
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:10,649
or maybe you are thinking about your past.

927
01:57:10,698 --> 01:57:13,321
But you cannot be in the centre.

928
01:57:13,349 --> 01:57:14,872
This is the big problem.

929
01:57:14,892 --> 01:57:18,711
You cannot be in the present.

930
01:57:18,722 --> 01:57:21,662
If I say, “Be in the present”, you cannot.

931
01:57:21,682 --> 01:57:24,122
And in the present is reality.

932
01:57:24,142 --> 01:57:28,481
In the present is totality and in the present is silence.

933
01:57:28,481 --> 01:57:30,071
You don’t think.

934
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,466
So, according to even to Patanjali

935
01:57:33,461 --> 01:57:35,966
you have to become Nirvichar.

936
01:57:35,975 --> 01:57:38,417
These thoughts which are bombarding your head,

937
01:57:38,407 --> 01:57:41,097
you have to become in charge of them,

938
01:57:41,167 --> 01:57:43,167
you have to be in control with them.

939
01:57:43,157 --> 01:57:45,653
So, what happens? You become Nirvichar,

940
01:57:45,657 --> 01:57:46,943
without any thoughts.

941
01:57:46,977 --> 01:57:48,412
It’s a thoughtless awareness.

942
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:51,343
And this thoughtless awareness

943
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:55,943
is the one that gives you complete peace within yourself.

944
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:57,874
People talk of peace, other.

945
01:57:57,881 --> 01:58:00,200
I know of people who have got peace awards,

946
01:58:00,193 --> 01:58:03,206
big, big, such hot-tempered people

947
01:58:03,216 --> 01:58:06,789
that you have to approach them with a barge pole.

948
01:58:06,798 --> 01:58:10,399
I don’t know from what angle they are talking about peace

949
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:12,541
but they have got peace awards.

950
01:58:12,561 --> 01:58:16,173
Big, big people like that I have known who have got peace awards.

951
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:18,541
Peace has to come within.

952
01:58:18,566 --> 01:58:20,986
When human beings become peaceful,

953
01:58:20,990 --> 01:58:22,280
there won’t be any quarrels,

954
01:58:22,321 --> 01:58:26,515
no fights, no wars and no politics.

955
01:58:26,532 --> 01:58:28,042
If you are peaceful,

956
01:58:28,111 --> 01:58:30,575
then you are so satisfied,

957
01:58:30,602 --> 01:58:34,975
you're as in Hindi, they say, “Apney me hi sama jatey hai,”

958
01:58:34,961 --> 01:58:37,254
you are satisfied with yourself.

959
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:41,222
You don’t get into the mad rush

960
01:58:41,265 --> 01:58:46,483
of approaching somebody, encroaching somebody,

961
01:58:46,521 --> 01:58:48,640
aggressing on someone;

962
01:58:48,651 --> 01:58:52,341
no, you are with yourself in complete peace.

963
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:55,530
As a result, so many things happen.

964
01:58:55,580 --> 01:58:58,704
Maybe I am the oldest person living here.

965
01:58:58,693 --> 01:59:02,133
Nobody can be more in age

966
01:59:02,182 --> 01:59:04,499
because I am seventy-four now. I will be seventy-five.

967
01:59:04,522 --> 01:59:05,760
So, you can imagine.

968
01:59:05,783 --> 01:59:11,394
But at peace when you are, you are not having any such ideas of aggression,

969
01:59:11,414 --> 01:59:12,954
aggression or anything.

970
01:59:12,954 --> 01:59:15,535
You become absolutely peaceful

971
01:59:15,553 --> 01:59:18,658
and this peace is very required today

972
01:59:18,664 --> 01:59:21,193
for this world to come to something

973
01:59:21,225 --> 01:59:24,028
which we call as a peaceful world.

974
01:59:24,044 --> 01:59:27,198
By fighting, by quarrelling you can never achieve peace.

975
01:59:27,213 --> 01:59:29,943
I have seen people going with the flags,

976
01:59:30,012 --> 01:59:33,504
now fight for peace and fight for this, no need.

977
01:59:33,483 --> 01:59:37,285
If you become peaceful everything works out so well

978
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:40,986
and this Paramchaitanya is with you to help you.

979
01:59:41,010 --> 01:59:43,256
There is no need to fight anybody,

980
01:59:43,271 --> 01:59:46,535
to aggress anybody or to trouble anybody

981
01:59:46,561 --> 01:59:49,586
This is very important for doctors

982
01:59:49,595 --> 01:59:52,327
and for also business people

983
01:59:52,336 --> 01:59:54,146
Now the problem of business people

984
01:59:54,146 --> 01:59:56,526
because they told me there are some business people also

985
01:59:56,557 --> 01:59:59,876
is their stress which is a common disease.

986
02:00:01,318 --> 02:00:04,160
They are the same, very futuristic, you know,

987
02:00:04,178 --> 02:00:07,343
all the time calculating, very, very futuristic.

988
02:00:07,339 --> 02:00:09,593
And in America, a new disease has developed,

989
02:00:09,609 --> 02:00:11,689
they call it ‘yuppies disease'

990
02:00:25,174 --> 02:00:27,874
That disease is such a horrible thing it is,

991
02:00:27,955 --> 02:00:31,423
it is that your rational mind just goes out,

992
02:00:31,444 --> 02:00:33,644
your conscious mind just goes out,

993
02:00:33,665 --> 02:00:35,544
you can’t even lift your hand,

994
02:00:35,555 --> 02:00:37,883
you can’t even lift your fingers

995
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:42,627
and people carry you just like what you can call a

996
02:00:42,629 --> 02:00:44,278
reptile on your body.

997
02:00:44,289 --> 02:00:46,247
You can think all right,

998
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:51,470
you can talk all right,

999
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,118
you can plan all right,

1000
02:00:53,131 --> 02:00:54,778
calculate all right

1001
02:00:54,778 --> 02:00:55,857
but you cannot walk,

1002
02:00:55,838 --> 02:00:57,077
you cannot lift your hand,

1003
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,948
you cannot do anything.

1004
02:00:58,968 --> 02:01:01,807
This is a new disease that has come in America

1005
02:01:01,818 --> 02:01:06,231
and is spreading all over and I have seen one patient also here.

1006
02:01:06,251 --> 02:01:10,580
So, what I am trying to say that going with this your stress,

1007
02:01:10,582 --> 02:01:12,970
all kind of things can happen.

1008
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:16,675
Now why this stress is there, that also we should know.

1009
02:01:17,562 --> 02:01:18,999
First of all,

1010
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:22,198
the Kundalini has started working in this Kali Yuga

1011
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,448
in these times.

1012
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:25,857
Secondly, if you see these two centres,

1013
02:01:25,874 --> 02:01:28,354
two Nadis or two channels,

1014
02:01:28,405 --> 02:01:30,185
we call Ida and Pingala Nadi.

1015
02:01:30,194 --> 02:01:34,490
So, the Pingala Nadi creates Ego within us,

1016
02:01:34,515 --> 02:01:36,310
as it is shown there,

1017
02:01:36,314 --> 02:01:37,470
you see, the yellow one.

1018
02:01:37,473 --> 02:01:41,551
It creates a balloon like.

1019
02:01:41,566 --> 02:01:44,892
Then the second one is the Ida Nadi

1020
02:01:44,926 --> 02:01:48,281
which also creates a balloon.

1021
02:01:48,303 --> 02:01:51,499
Now Ida [Pingala] Nadi creates the ego balloon

1022
02:01:51,522 --> 02:01:56,260
and the left side one creates the superego, means conditionings

1023
02:01:56,283 --> 02:01:58,180
Now if you are identified with something,

1024
02:01:58,187 --> 02:02:00,109
if you are conditioned within you with something,

1025
02:02:00,127 --> 02:02:02,098
then these two are there.

1026
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:04,352
But when you are too much right sided,

1027
02:02:04,388 --> 02:02:08,995
these are all – you see the ego moves and covers the left side.

1028
02:02:08,995 --> 02:02:11,365
So, there is a blockage, complete blockage.

1029
02:02:11,424 --> 02:02:13,825
Now whatever problems you have

1030
02:02:13,885 --> 02:02:16,381
they cannot pass out of your body.

1031
02:02:16,388 --> 02:02:18,671
That makes you weaker and weaker

1032
02:02:18,678 --> 02:02:21,611
and that’s how you have stress.

1033
02:02:21,638 --> 02:02:23,202
With this Kundalini,

1034
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:25,341
these two move out like that

1035
02:02:25,399 --> 02:02:30,100
and is opened out and you become one with this Divine Power.

1036
02:02:30,129 --> 02:02:34,223
Now as far as the brain is, for there are some neurosurgeons also,

1037
02:02:34,249 --> 02:02:36,392
as far as the brain is concerned,

1038
02:02:36,452 --> 02:02:39,213
we know that we use wee part of our brain,

1039
02:02:39,223 --> 02:02:41,162
very little part of our brain.

1040
02:02:41,162 --> 02:02:44,981
But once you get this Kundalini then it enlightens

1041
02:02:44,992 --> 02:02:50,222
so many areas of your head that you just know

1042
02:02:50,292 --> 02:02:52,452
Sometimes people ask Me, “Mother, how do you know?”

1043
02:02:52,492 --> 02:02:55,252
“I know. I don’t know how I know.”

1044
02:02:55,263 --> 02:02:56,903
There is no technique for it.

1045
02:02:56,903 --> 02:02:58,073
Just I know.

1046
02:02:58,093 --> 02:02:59,832
They say, “Mother, how do you know this thing?

1047
02:02:59,854 --> 02:03:00,872
How do you know?”

1048
02:03:00,883 --> 02:03:02,182
Somebody wrote me a letter

1049
02:03:02,203 --> 02:03:04,522
and I said, “Who has written this letter, I know.”

1050
02:03:04,533 --> 02:03:05,921
And I told them,

1051
02:03:05,921 --> 02:03:07,392
they said, “Mother, how do you know?”

1052
02:03:07,421 --> 02:03:10,682
I said, “I know for definite this is the one who has written.”

1053
02:03:10,682 --> 02:03:12,511
I don’t know that person. I have never seen him.

1054
02:03:12,511 --> 02:03:14,450
I've never seen his hand writing

1055
02:03:14,531 --> 02:03:16,671
but I said, “I know who has written this letter.”

1056
02:03:16,667 --> 02:03:18,031
Just I know.

1057
02:03:18,037 --> 02:03:21,354
But I wouldn’t say that it’s something great

1058
02:03:21,364 --> 02:03:25,744
that I should know because I just know without any work,

1059
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:28,422
without any thinking,

1060
02:03:28,463 --> 02:03:32,664
without any managing. Just automatically I know everything.

1061
02:03:32,813 --> 02:03:36,353
So, once you become that, you don’t have to worry.

1062
02:03:36,527 --> 02:03:41,428
Now, for example, I know, also, a lady doctor in Delhi,

1063
02:03:41,467 --> 02:03:43,096
no in Bombay.

1064
02:03:43,107 --> 02:03:45,906
She is the one who is a surgeon.

1065
02:03:45,908 --> 02:03:52,263
She said, “Mother I could know that this man has tumour,

1066
02:03:52,263 --> 02:03:56,263
very much low in his brains but it will come out.”

1067
02:03:56,274 --> 02:04:00,013
So, she said, “Then I was just giving vibrations first.

1068
02:04:00,027 --> 02:04:02,670
I said let me try first the vibrations on that.”

1069
02:04:02,667 --> 02:04:05,270
They said, “No, No, there is no tumour on that side.”

1070
02:04:05,288 --> 02:04:08,100
She said, “It is here. I know I can feel it; it is here.”

1071
02:04:08,098 --> 02:04:10,429
They wouldn’t, they started arguing with her

1072
02:04:10,457 --> 02:04:12,975
and then they found out the tumour where she said,

1073
02:04:12,987 --> 02:04:14,364
exactly there.

1074
02:04:14,377 --> 02:04:15,705
They said, “How do you know?”

1075
02:04:15,726 --> 02:04:17,933
She said, “I don’t know how do I know.”

1076
02:04:17,957 --> 02:04:21,085
So even the children can tell where is the problem,

1077
02:04:21,087 --> 02:04:25,415
in your head, in your brain, what is happening.

1078
02:04:25,415 --> 02:04:30,766
Now to look after your brain is very important that you don’t go into imbalances

1079
02:04:30,757 --> 02:04:32,527
because if you go into imbalance,

1080
02:04:32,576 --> 02:04:36,261
your right side will develop or your left side will develop.

1081
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:39,204
Actually, the right side develops on the left

1082
02:04:39,319 --> 02:04:41,934
and the left side develops on the right.

1083
02:04:42,224 --> 02:04:45,635
Now also I don’t know how far the medical science has gone

1084
02:04:45,684 --> 02:04:49,575
up to the understanding as to left and right side

1085
02:04:49,635 --> 02:04:53,401
are two different complementary systems.

1086
02:04:53,456 --> 02:04:56,267
I don’t know if that they accept, do they?

1087
02:04:59,249 --> 02:05:05,012
But in Sahaja Yoga you will discover that there are two complementary systems.

1088
02:05:07,242 --> 02:05:10,086
One is right sided; one is left sided.

1089
02:05:10,102 --> 02:05:14,226
And when the right side is too much then the left side might act

1090
02:05:14,226 --> 02:05:17,526
or when the left side is too much, then right side may act.

1091
02:05:17,535 --> 02:05:20,126
You see it’s a complimentary two systems

1092
02:05:20,195 --> 02:05:22,814
and if you go on one system all the time

1093
02:05:22,863 --> 02:05:26,064
then you become right sided or left sided.

1094
02:05:26,073 --> 02:05:28,874
Now left sided are the people who are not futuristic

1095
02:05:28,883 --> 02:05:32,403
but who are the people who live in the past.

1096
02:05:32,412 --> 02:05:36,003
Now of course I don’t want to, just now, discuss about it very much

1097
02:05:36,026 --> 02:05:40,829
because it’s also more confusing for people.

1098
02:05:40,836 --> 02:05:42,488
Because they don’t want to believe

1099
02:05:42,506 --> 02:05:44,885
that there is something like dead souls

1100
02:05:44,925 --> 02:05:51,479
or they don’t want to believe in the viruses being dead vegetables

1101
02:05:51,483 --> 02:05:54,731
and things like that but it is.

1102
02:05:54,744 --> 02:05:56,180
On the left-hand side,

1103
02:05:56,171 --> 02:05:59,430
we have got all our past since our creation.

1104
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:01,842
So, if somebody gets virus you give antibiotics,

1105
02:06:01,856 --> 02:06:04,861
you do what you like, it won’t go.

1106
02:06:04,885 --> 02:06:07,537
Only Sahaja Yoga can drive it out.

1107
02:06:07,537 --> 02:06:10,702
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can cure viruses

1108
02:06:10,717 --> 02:06:13,626
because only Sahaja Yoga can act on the left side.

1109
02:06:13,637 --> 02:06:18,796
Many mad people, crazy people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

1110
02:06:18,807 --> 02:06:24,820
Also, it gives you a good idea about

1111
02:06:24,816 --> 02:06:27,881
how you can show people,

1112
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:30,459
who is mad and who is not mad.

1113
02:06:30,461 --> 02:06:33,530
Like I had a program in Pune in the beginning

1114
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:39,910
and they arranged it in a hall which was owned by some Brahmins.

1115
02:06:39,943 --> 02:06:43,197
So, when I went there, they said, “No, no, She is not a Brahmin

1116
02:06:43,182 --> 02:06:44,847
so we can’t give Her the hall.

1117
02:06:44,858 --> 02:06:46,706
So, Sahaja Yogis were mischievous,

1118
02:06:46,738 --> 02:06:49,956
they said, “All right, we will give it in the newspaper that they are refusing

1119
02:06:49,968 --> 02:06:51,456
because She is not a Brahmin.”

1120
02:06:51,459 --> 02:06:54,175
“No, no, don’t do like that we will have it.”

1121
02:06:54,198 --> 02:06:56,956
So, I didn’t know what was happening behind the back.

1122
02:06:57,015 --> 02:06:58,776
When I went there, I was sitting there.

1123
02:06:58,785 --> 02:07:03,240
Very interesting I saw about twenty-five people sitting in front of me shaking

1124
02:07:03,229 --> 02:07:04,809
like this

1125
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,965
“Mother, stop it, stop it

1126
02:07:05,979 --> 02:07:07,360
we know Your powers, stop it.”

1127
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,130
I said, “I am not doing anything, you are….”

1128
02:07:09,149 --> 02:07:12,997
They said, “Now, also there are people who are shaking like this.”

1129
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:15,427
So, I said, “Ask them, who they are?”

1130
02:07:15,443 --> 02:07:19,706
They said, “We are certified mad from Thana.

1131
02:07:19,713 --> 02:07:22,073
We have come here with our superintendent

1132
02:07:22,093 --> 02:07:24,637
because You had cured one mad man.”

1133
02:07:24,646 --> 02:07:28,097
“So”, they said, “Are we also mad?” “Yes, there is something wrong.”

1134
02:07:28,115 --> 02:07:29,686
So, the thing was

1135
02:07:29,706 --> 02:07:32,965
they were thinking the Brahmins are the highest or something like that.

1136
02:07:32,995 --> 02:07:35,349
Is all nonsensical ideas

1137
02:07:35,378 --> 02:07:38,157
because Brahmin is that which knows the Brahma,

1138
02:07:38,178 --> 02:07:40,856
which knows All Pervading Power.

1139
02:07:40,878 --> 02:07:44,709
And because of these funny ideas, they have tortured all the saints.

1140
02:07:44,769 --> 02:07:47,227
Specially in Maharashtra

1141
02:07:47,227 --> 02:07:51,146
people have tortured all the saints all the time.

1142
02:07:51,171 --> 02:07:54,390
So, where you have so many saints

1143
02:07:54,441 --> 02:07:55,603
and so many people

1144
02:07:55,613 --> 02:07:59,048
then you must know that it was just to work out

1145
02:07:59,066 --> 02:08:02,418
the brains of these close-minded people.

1146
02:08:02,445 --> 02:08:07,666
But to open them out is only possible I think when they are in difficulties.

1147
02:08:07,726 --> 02:08:10,662
When they are not in difficulties they don’t want to accept.

1148
02:08:10,675 --> 02:08:13,671
Supposing they are sick then they will come to Me.

1149
02:08:13,684 --> 02:08:17,300
Now if you cure somebody sick, you see once he is cured, he is finished.

1150
02:08:17,305 --> 02:08:21,125
He doesn’t do any Sahaja Yoga; he doesn’t want to help anyone.

1151
02:08:21,195 --> 02:08:25,355
But if there is a person who is healthy,

1152
02:08:25,386 --> 02:08:27,690
who is perfectly all right

1153
02:08:27,686 --> 02:08:30,141
and who is knowledgeable,

1154
02:08:30,136 --> 02:08:32,581
if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will be such a help

1155
02:08:32,581 --> 02:08:37,083
to this, I should say, to this poor country.

1156
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:40,382
This country is suffering from tremendous poverty.

1157
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,246
Now only saying,

1158
02:08:42,275 --> 02:08:45,666
“Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao” (“Eliminate poverty!”)

1159
02:08:45,657 --> 02:08:49,056
I know of one gentleman who was a great corrupt fellow

1160
02:08:49,076 --> 02:08:52,532
and who used to live in one room with a little cot.

1161
02:08:52,552 --> 02:08:54,384
I said, “Why do you live like this?”

1162
02:08:54,402 --> 02:08:57,324
He said, “Because, everybody is garib [poor] so I want to live like garib.”

1163
02:08:57,333 --> 02:08:59,554
I said, “Why don’t you give all this money to these garibs?

1164
02:08:59,572 --> 02:09:01,413
Why are you lying like this?”

1165
02:09:01,433 --> 02:09:04,052
He said, “All right, you suggest to me any organisation

1166
02:09:04,123 --> 02:09:08,433
which is absolutely above board and I will move.”

1167
02:09:08,433 --> 02:09:11,090
That was a difficult thing, a decision.

1168
02:09:11,092 --> 02:09:12,349
But what I am trying to say

1169
02:09:12,382 --> 02:09:14,791
only by saying people are garib, garib,

1170
02:09:14,851 --> 02:09:17,181
you have to attend to that

1171
02:09:17,191 --> 02:09:19,923
and is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

1172
02:09:19,923 --> 02:09:20,822
How?

1173
02:09:20,828 --> 02:09:25,387
Sahaja Yoga is practiced mostly by middle class.

1174
02:09:25,407 --> 02:09:29,777
Both the sides are – one side are the poor, another side are the rich.

1175
02:09:29,848 --> 02:09:33,157
Rich are very few. But more by the middle class.

1176
02:09:33,170 --> 02:09:37,047
Then it’s like a river which expands on both the sides

1177
02:09:37,067 --> 02:09:41,594
This time I was, I mean, I have been always thinking that

1178
02:09:41,596 --> 02:09:44,407
I have to do something for the poor people,

1179
02:09:44,434 --> 02:09:47,826
something, always and I have done also, on my own,

1180
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,996
but I wanted Sahaja Yogis to contribute, Indian Sahaja Yogis.

1181
02:09:50,991 --> 02:09:53,645
So, I told them I want to start a place

1182
02:09:53,641 --> 02:09:57,380
where we could have these women

1183
02:09:57,375 --> 02:10:01,465
who are standing on the roads with their children asking for alms.

1184
02:10:01,509 --> 02:10:04,316
We can have something to help them.

1185
02:10:04,336 --> 02:10:07,520
Immediately, I was surprised Sahaja Yogis contributed to me

1186
02:10:07,549 --> 02:10:11,739
for that and I was so amazed at their enthusiasm.

1187
02:10:11,762 --> 02:10:14,000
I said, “This is the generosity.

1188
02:10:14,544 --> 02:10:17,750
This generosity that has come to Sahaja Yogis.”

1189
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,580
And then when they said, “Mother this is we have got all this through Sahaja Yoga

1190
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:26,660
We have improved so much that we don’t have to worry.”

1191
02:10:26,694 --> 02:10:31,013
And they so generously, I mean a person becomes extremely generous.

1192
02:10:31,033 --> 02:10:33,093
He becomes very peaceful;

1193
02:10:33,114 --> 02:10:37,464
he becomes generous and he starts enjoying the generosity.

1194
02:10:37,468 --> 02:10:39,964
I mean people earn such a lot of money.

1195
02:10:39,959 --> 02:10:42,618
Everything they should do there is no harm.

1196
02:10:42,689 --> 02:10:45,388
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like sanyasa.

1197
02:10:45,448 --> 02:10:47,192
Nobody has to take sanyas.

1198
02:10:47,178 --> 02:10:49,953
Nobody has to go out of his family,

1199
02:10:49,982 --> 02:10:54,924
out of his … nothing. It’s all here. Why to go anywhere?

1200
02:10:54,924 --> 02:10:58,390
So, you have to be a very normal person.

1201
02:10:58,439 --> 02:11:00,739
But one thing is important,

1202
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:05,623
you must have the pure desire to get your Realisation.

1203
02:11:05,642 --> 02:11:09,681
If you don’t have that pure Realisation then it doesn’t work out.

1204
02:11:09,692 --> 02:11:11,524
Apart from that it might work

1205
02:11:11,542 --> 02:11:13,163
but you go on dropping down

1206
02:11:13,174 --> 02:11:15,736
because if you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga

1207
02:11:15,725 --> 02:11:19,926
or if you want to, say, achieve some power out of it.

1208
02:11:19,924 --> 02:11:21,232
You see, you are so powerful

1209
02:11:21,254 --> 02:11:24,497
that you don’t have to ask for power or anything.

1210
02:11:24,522 --> 02:11:28,047
You don’t know how it works and how it gives.

1211
02:11:28,053 --> 02:11:30,837
First of all, only we have to believe

1212
02:11:30,837 --> 02:11:36,058
that we are reflections of God Almighty.

1213
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:38,618
We're not just human beings.

1214
02:11:38,627 --> 02:11:42,109
Specially, to be born in India

1215
02:11:42,118 --> 02:11:44,091
you must have done lots of punyas,

1216
02:11:44,118 --> 02:11:48,459
otherwise you cannot be born in this great country I can tell you.

1217
02:11:48,489 --> 02:11:52,138
All this, you see, is all nonsense that is going on,

1218
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:55,707
is just skirmishes on the periphery,

1219
02:11:55,730 --> 02:11:59,719
but if you see the culture,

1220
02:11:59,770 --> 02:12:03,011
the love, affection we have,

1221
02:12:03,024 --> 02:12:06,301
the understanding of value system we have,

1222
02:12:06,305 --> 02:12:07,571
you can’t imagine it.

1223
02:12:07,596 --> 02:12:09,620
When you go abroad, you are amazed.

1224
02:12:09,636 --> 02:12:12,540
you don’t know how to tell them.

1225
02:12:12,555 --> 02:12:13,870
They're so stupid,

1226
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:17,821
I tell you, very stupid people, nothing to learn from them.

1227
02:12:17,881 --> 02:12:22,770
I have been fighting with the stupidity of people specially Americans.

1228
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:27,496
I'm surprised, I think that they are not yet grown up as human beings.

1229
02:12:27,695 --> 02:12:30,496
The way they talk, the way they understand.

1230
02:12:30,536 --> 02:12:34,219
They only like people who will come and tell them stories

1231
02:12:34,245 --> 02:12:36,975
and make fool out of them, make lot of money.

1232
02:12:37,026 --> 02:12:39,298
To me they said, “We cannot take to Sahaja Yoga.”

1233
02:12:39,277 --> 02:12:40,318
I said, “Why?”

1234
02:12:40,306 --> 02:12:41,594
“Because you don’t take money,

1235
02:12:41,607 --> 02:12:43,346
what is your validity?

1236
02:12:43,357 --> 02:12:45,886
If you don’t take money then you have no validity,

1237
02:12:45,946 --> 02:12:48,684
why should we believe in you because …”

1238
02:12:48,687 --> 02:12:53,287
I said, “Supposing I take money, then?” “Then we can prosecute you.”

1239
02:12:53,327 --> 02:12:56,537
I said, “Go and prosecute all these people who have looted you”.

1240
02:12:56,647 --> 02:12:58,753
Nobody could prosecute them.

1241
02:12:58,767 --> 02:13:04,439
So, this is we should not look to them for understanding of life.

1242
02:13:04,443 --> 02:13:05,838
They have not yet understood.

1243
02:13:05,828 --> 02:13:07,969
We have to look to ourselves.

1244
02:13:07,994 --> 02:13:10,060
We have such a heritage.

1245
02:13:10,104 --> 02:13:12,229
You can imagine, thousands of years back,

1246
02:13:12,223 --> 02:13:14,263
we have been talking of Brahma,

1247
02:13:14,314 --> 02:13:19,638
we have been talking of absolute truth.

1248
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:22,938
In what country they have this kind of knowledge.

1249
02:13:22,938 --> 02:13:23,925
No country.

1250
02:13:23,928 --> 02:13:28,292
So, first of all we should be very proud to be an Indian.

1251
02:13:28,309 --> 02:13:29,731
That’s very important.

1252
02:13:29,742 --> 02:13:32,481
Even Sahaja Yogis from abroad they dress up like Indians

1253
02:13:32,522 --> 02:13:34,611
and they have taken to our culture,

1254
02:13:34,611 --> 02:13:36,298
our style of culture.

1255
02:13:36,287 --> 02:13:38,653
I need not tell you about the Western Culture

1256
02:13:38,713 --> 02:13:41,327
as I was really shocked.

1257
02:13:41,334 --> 02:13:44,988
Then I thought I better write down something about them

1258
02:13:45,098 --> 02:13:46,859
as a witness whatever I saw.

1259
02:13:46,857 --> 02:13:49,238
So, there is nothing to learn from them,

1260
02:13:49,308 --> 02:13:53,247
but one day will come, they have to come here.

1261
02:13:53,257 --> 02:13:55,716
All the doctors have to come here.

1262
02:13:55,745 --> 02:13:59,796
I am very thankful, very, very thankful

1263
02:13:59,805 --> 02:14:03,566
to this Indian Medical Association especially.

1264
02:14:03,613 --> 02:14:09,276
I never expected and I am very grateful to them for this

1265
02:14:09,279 --> 02:14:13,326
because I know in this country if the doctors take it up,

1266
02:14:13,346 --> 02:14:16,931
all over the world they will have to understand

1267
02:14:23,019 --> 02:14:29,812
the value of our knowledge of life and of Medical Science.

1268
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:34,831
I would say that I have seen so many people sitting here

1269
02:14:34,871 --> 02:14:36,232
I don’t know how many are doctors,

1270
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:39,922
how many are from industries and how many are Sahaja Yogis.

1271
02:14:39,918 --> 02:14:43,432
Whatever it is, one has to know that all of us

1272
02:14:43,445 --> 02:14:47,056
are blessed by the same reflection of God Almighty

1273
02:14:47,115 --> 02:14:50,428
within ourselves which we should experience.

1274
02:14:50,868 --> 02:14:54,334
After that you will tell me what has happened to you,

1275
02:14:54,338 --> 02:14:57,464
what you have felt and what you had.

1276
02:14:57,479 --> 02:15:01,274
It’s a thing, is a matter of your right to have it.

1277
02:15:01,281 --> 02:15:03,904
It’s your right to have that power

1278
02:15:03,915 --> 02:15:06,816
but you have to ask for it.

1279
02:15:06,876 --> 02:15:09,595
If you don’t ask for it, I cannot force it on you.

1280
02:15:09,646 --> 02:15:11,595
Nobody can force it on you.

1281
02:15:11,655 --> 02:15:13,597
It is a very spontaneous happening

1282
02:15:13,676 --> 02:15:18,486
and it works out, so fast, so fast.

1283
02:15:18,486 --> 02:15:20,539
I must tell you in Russia,

1284
02:15:20,546 --> 02:15:23,256
this hall of course has fallen short

1285
02:15:23,316 --> 02:15:28,644
but in Russia you always have it in big-big huge places

1286
02:15:28,653 --> 02:15:31,653
with sixteen thousand, eighteen thousand

1287
02:15:31,734 --> 02:15:35,323
and they are so much

1288
02:15:35,403 --> 02:15:38,010
I don’t know, endowed with shraddha,

1289
02:15:38,001 --> 02:15:41,160
so much that in the program only they get it.

1290
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:44,780
Only in the program! I could not understand.

1291
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:47,551
And they had a meeting of the scientists there,

1292
02:15:47,571 --> 02:15:50,299
about two hundred and fifty scientists came.

1293
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:53,100
So, I started telling them about science to begin with.

1294
02:15:53,169 --> 02:15:56,419
I said better be on their level at least to talk to them.

1295
02:15:56,439 --> 02:15:59,448
So, one of them got up and said,

1296
02:15:59,464 --> 02:16:02,439
“Mother, don’t tell us about this science, we know everything.

1297
02:16:02,459 --> 02:16:04,919
Now, you tell us the science of God,

1298
02:16:04,899 --> 02:16:05,839
science of Divine.

1299
02:16:05,841 --> 02:16:07,048
You tell us about this.”

1300
02:16:07,051 --> 02:16:09,790
I was amazed, look at these Russians!

1301
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:12,410
So, I found out all these countries

1302
02:16:12,421 --> 02:16:16,706
like Bulgaria, Russia, Romania and all these five countries,

1303
02:16:16,711 --> 02:16:19,706
there the people are like clean slates,

1304
02:16:19,694 --> 02:16:21,504
they have no conditioning,

1305
02:16:21,575 --> 02:16:23,015
they don’t know anything about God,

1306
02:16:23,075 --> 02:16:25,955
they don’t know anything about books, nothing.

1307
02:16:26,004 --> 02:16:27,885
Absolutely, they are not conditioned

1308
02:16:27,874 --> 02:16:30,195
and the way they have achieved this Sahaja Yoga

1309
02:16:30,178 --> 02:16:32,336
I have been really amazed at this.

1310
02:16:32,397 --> 02:16:36,809
Romania I was amazed and I just told them,

1311
02:16:36,827 --> 02:16:41,669
one paper I read – not read, I never read – I told them about one thing

1312
02:16:41,689 --> 02:16:45,156
and the medical, same thing like this, was there

1313
02:16:45,176 --> 02:16:47,626
and they gave me a Doctorate,

1314
02:16:47,647 --> 02:16:51,327
not honorary but real Doctorate, on that knowledge.

1315
02:16:51,323 --> 02:16:52,336
Can you imagine?

1316
02:16:52,312 --> 02:16:54,687
I mean it’s not possible.

1317
02:16:54,702 --> 02:16:57,358
First, I didn’t know, I have never known these things,

1318
02:16:57,352 --> 02:17:00,278
so one of my disciples, “Mother, you have become a Doctor!”

1319
02:17:00,283 --> 02:17:02,687
I said, “That I think I have, already.”

1320
02:17:02,705 --> 02:17:05,126
“No, no this is a real Doctorate, real.”

1321
02:17:05,176 --> 02:17:07,363
I said, “Really, how they have done?”

1322
02:17:07,365 --> 02:17:09,024
Such sensitive people

1323
02:17:09,024 --> 02:17:11,303
but this sensitivity comes

1324
02:17:11,305 --> 02:17:15,113
perhaps may be that they were very much oppressed and troubled

1325
02:17:15,142 --> 02:17:19,564
and also, they had no conditioning of anything.

1326
02:17:19,551 --> 02:17:23,635
And it’s very surprising they have no sense of possessiveness.

1327
02:17:23,647 --> 02:17:27,807
Their Government said, “You take your own flats and look after.”

1328
02:17:27,847 --> 02:17:31,527
So, they said, “No, no, no we don’t want. You look after.”

1329
02:17:31,538 --> 02:17:33,958
They said, “All right whatever cars you have given, you take them.”

1330
02:17:34,027 --> 02:17:36,620
“No, no, no, no. What a headache. You better look after.

1331
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:38,485
What is the use of taking them?

1332
02:17:38,534 --> 02:17:41,860
Because after all when we die it will be left here.”

1333
02:17:41,894 --> 02:17:44,350
So, such unconditioned minds

1334
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:46,450
and such clean slates I tell you!

1335
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:49,643
In the same way we are also very much,

1336
02:17:49,639 --> 02:17:53,779
Indians are very much capable,

1337
02:17:53,817 --> 02:17:57,041
very much more capable than they are.

1338
02:17:57,531 --> 02:17:59,031
Once they get it, they get it

1339
02:17:59,101 --> 02:18:01,330
and they can go very deep into it

1340
02:18:01,351 --> 02:18:03,920
because our life is very deep.

1341
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:07,080
Our, culture is very deep.

1342
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:10,460
We have had thanks to all the Saints and all the Sufis

1343
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:18,600
and all the incarnations that basically our genes are very good.

1344
02:18:18,621 --> 02:18:22,200
But with Sahaja Yoga you can even change the genes,

1345
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:23,560
we have shown you.

1346
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:26,999
You can change the genes also in Sahaja Yoga.

1347
02:18:26,999 --> 02:18:30,159
And we should not accept anybody because he says,

1348
02:18:30,219 --> 02:18:34,393
“His genes are bad, so he should be allowed to be what he is.”

1349
02:18:34,464 --> 02:18:35,683
It’s not that.

1350
02:18:35,754 --> 02:18:39,663
Everything changeable and to say that genes are

1351
02:18:39,734 --> 02:18:43,889
just the cause of your own style,

1352
02:18:43,886 --> 02:18:45,270
it’s not so.

1353
02:18:45,275 --> 02:18:48,179
Because one child will have different genes,

1354
02:18:48,199 --> 02:18:50,170
another child will have another genes

1355
02:18:50,190 --> 02:18:51,940
So how can that be?

1356
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:53,670
So, it’s not from the parents,

1357
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:55,630
it’s not from anything,

1358
02:18:55,659 --> 02:19:02,898
circumstances but it is with your own reactions to things that you develop genes.

1359
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:06,548
So, what happens with genes is that

1360
02:19:06,568 --> 02:19:11,312
you become a very, very religious man,

1361
02:19:11,402 --> 02:19:14,935
very religious in the real sense

1362
02:19:14,904 --> 02:19:19,565
Not religion because you pray too much nothing but inside,

1363
02:19:19,585 --> 02:19:21,485
inside you are so religious.

1364
02:19:21,505 --> 02:19:23,731
And religion is what is love,

1365
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:26,985
love for humanity is religion

1366
02:19:26,996 --> 02:19:28,966
and that becomes so innate

1367
02:19:28,976 --> 02:19:31,576
and so in born and you enjoy.

1368
02:19:31,605 --> 02:19:32,935
you see loving people.

1369
02:19:32,926 --> 02:19:35,438
You enjoy giving your love to others.

1370
02:19:35,455 --> 02:19:37,708
Even those who hate you,

1371
02:19:37,716 --> 02:19:40,558
you love to give them love

1372
02:19:40,574 --> 02:19:44,574
because you think hatred after all is due to ignorance,

1373
02:19:44,623 --> 02:19:48,456
is not because he hates you really but ignorance.

1374
02:19:48,536 --> 02:19:52,116
And you start seeing the whole thing in a very different vision.

1375
02:19:52,181 --> 02:19:55,520
So, I have a great vision of our country

1376
02:19:55,580 --> 02:20:00,298
achieving that en masse emancipation,

1377
02:20:00,310 --> 02:20:03,538
awakening and so let the whole world come here.

1378
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:07,471
Once, they came just to give us slavery.

1379
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:12,041
Now, let them come here to learn what is Divine.

1380
02:20:12,051 --> 02:20:14,531
And you all can do it very well.

1381
02:20:14,682 --> 02:20:16,981
You don’t have to read many books,

1382
02:20:17,021 --> 02:20:18,171
nothing of the kind.

1383
02:20:18,191 --> 02:20:19,852
We don’t give also books to people

1384
02:20:19,912 --> 02:20:22,051
because if you give them books

1385
02:20:22,172 --> 02:20:25,236
they will just become masters of the books

1386
02:20:25,236 --> 02:20:28,550
and will not achieve anything they should go deep down

1387
02:20:28,630 --> 02:20:31,231
First of all, they should be themselves

1388
02:20:31,232 --> 02:20:33,552
completely one with the Divine.

1389
02:20:33,619 --> 02:20:35,681
Otherwise they are not entitled,

1390
02:20:35,715 --> 02:20:37,615
they have no powers.

1391
02:20:37,674 --> 02:20:40,751
When you are not empowered, how will you do the job?

1392
02:20:41,034 --> 02:20:43,811
But for that you don’t have to spend too much time,

1393
02:20:43,844 --> 02:20:46,405
five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

1394
02:20:46,465 --> 02:20:48,408
If you can meditate nothing like it

1395
02:20:48,411 --> 02:20:50,070
and you will be surprised

1396
02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:52,900
that all your thought process will slow down

1397
02:20:52,931 --> 02:20:56,260
so much so that you can see clearly

1398
02:20:56,320 --> 02:21:00,199
what is right, what is wrong.

1399
02:21:00,210 --> 02:21:02,389
What’s going wrong with you also

1400
02:21:02,449 --> 02:21:03,980
because you get self-knowledge.

1401
02:21:04,039 --> 02:21:05,889
And also, with others

1402
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:08,800
because you develop a new dimension

1403
02:21:08,871 --> 02:21:12,590
which we call as collective consciousness,

1404
02:21:12,610 --> 02:21:14,630
Samuhik Chaitanya,

1405
02:21:14,670 --> 02:21:16,250
collective consciousness.

1406
02:21:16,331 --> 02:21:20,215
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of Mr. Clinton.

1407
02:21:20,275 --> 02:21:24,204
or you can feel the vibrations of any person anywhere,

1408
02:21:24,224 --> 02:21:25,763
sitting down here.

1409
02:21:25,795 --> 02:21:28,664
Now if you know how to correct these vibrations,

1410
02:21:28,655 --> 02:21:30,103
your own vibrations,

1411
02:21:30,123 --> 02:21:32,605
you can correct the vibrations of others.

1412
02:21:32,675 --> 02:21:36,246
You can correct the vibrations sitting down here

1413
02:21:36,278 --> 02:21:38,246
of other people who are far away.

1414
02:21:38,239 --> 02:21:41,079
But of course, you can also correct the vibrations

1415
02:21:41,128 --> 02:21:43,646
of people who are with you.

1416
02:21:43,676 --> 02:21:46,856
In your family there are people who are mad,

1417
02:21:47,316 --> 02:21:48,703
You can correct them.

1418
02:21:48,725 --> 02:21:50,867
So, we can have very good families

1419
02:21:50,876 --> 02:21:53,127
and we could have very good marriages.

1420
02:21:53,145 --> 02:21:55,087
It has many dimensions Sahaja Yoga

1421
02:21:55,115 --> 02:21:59,030
but today is the day I want to really thank you all

1422
02:21:59,091 --> 02:22:02,980
the medical science people, and the industrialists,

1423
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:05,629
that they should now take to Sahaja Yoga

1424
02:22:05,690 --> 02:22:08,066
and make the best of their lives,

1425
02:22:08,127 --> 02:22:12,026
lives which are brought in this great country of Yoga

1426
02:22:12,037 --> 02:22:14,157
where you can easily achieve.

1427
02:22:14,226 --> 02:22:17,236
In this country, it is so full of vibrations,

1428
02:22:17,316 --> 02:22:19,963
so full of vibrations, you won’t believe.

1429
02:22:20,043 --> 02:22:22,324
I was coming from London with my husband,

1430
02:22:22,394 --> 02:22:24,436
and I told him, “We have touched India.”

1431
02:22:24,444 --> 02:22:27,266
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “See the vibrations all around.

1432
02:22:27,274 --> 02:22:29,316
It’s only in India you feel these vibrations.”

1433
02:22:29,324 --> 02:22:31,566
So, he went to the pilot just to find out.

1434
02:22:31,574 --> 02:22:35,225
He said, “Sir, only a minute back we touched India.”

1435
02:22:35,244 --> 02:22:37,966
So, this is such a great country you have.

1436
02:22:42,455 --> 02:22:44,951
And if we could just develop that feeling

1437
02:22:44,955 --> 02:22:46,921
that we are Indians

1438
02:22:46,955 --> 02:22:49,425
and it is our responsibility

1439
02:22:49,455 --> 02:22:52,415
to see that our knowledge goes all over

1440
02:22:52,455 --> 02:22:54,599
and let people take advantage of it.

1441
02:22:54,689 --> 02:22:56,628
By that we don’t criticise anyone.

1442
02:22:56,718 --> 02:22:59,149
By that we don’t condemn anybody, as I have told you,

1443
02:22:59,218 --> 02:23:04,210
but we give them the basis of all the knowledge,

1444
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:09,490
and that, in Sahaja Yoga, you can do it very well.

1445
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:12,228
I would say that instead of reading the book

1446
02:23:12,244 --> 02:23:14,458
better get your Realisation

1447
02:23:14,466 --> 02:23:15,966
because Kabira himself has said it,

1448
02:23:16,035 --> 02:23:19,098
“Padhi Padhi pundit murakh bhayo,

1449
02:23:19,138 --> 02:23:22,358
pundit bhayo na koye, dhai akshar prem ka,

1450
02:23:22,378 --> 02:23:24,638
seekhe to pundit hoye.”

1451
02:23:24,652 --> 02:23:31,259
Even after studying all books and scriptures a scholar becomes a fool, nobody becomes a scholar.

1452
02:23:31,259 --> 02:23:35,859
Whoever learns two and a half words of love, he becomes a scholar.

1453
02:23:35,918 --> 02:23:38,040
Thank you very much.

1454
02:26:29,758 --> 02:26:39,880
