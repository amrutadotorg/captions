00:08.767 --> 00:11.434
Today we have gathered here

00:11.601 --> 00:17.634
to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

00:17.767 --> 00:20.801
as well as your own Kundalini.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.868
First of all,

00:30.534 --> 00:34.601
I think this is the most important thing to understand

00:34.734 --> 00:36.968
about your own Kundalini,

00:37.067 --> 00:41.767
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

00:41.868 --> 00:45.033
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge

00:45.167 --> 00:48.567
is this, your own Kundalini

00:49.000 --> 00:52.167
because, when she rises,

00:52.267 --> 00:57.033
she points it out,what are the problems on your chakras.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.868
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

01:03.734 --> 01:06.467
but we do not know what purity means.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.200
It means your chaste desire.

01:12.534 --> 01:15.167
It means it has

01:15.267 --> 01:18.968
no lust, greed, anything in it.

01:20.734 --> 01:23.467
That power is your own Mother

01:24.434 --> 01:28.367
and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother.

01:28.467 --> 01:32.200
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.734
She knows everything about you

01:36.000 --> 01:41.434
and she is absolutely

01:46.000 --> 01:47.601
the knowledge

01:48.567 --> 01:50.801
because she’s so pure.

01:55.667 --> 02:00.067
And, whatever chakras she touches, she also knows

02:00.234 --> 02:05.934
what's wrong with that chakra

02:06.934 --> 02:08.601
beforehand,

02:11.767 --> 02:14.367
so she's quite prepared,

02:15.200 --> 02:17.634
and she adjusts herself

02:18.801 --> 02:20.634
fully

02:21.868 --> 02:28.234
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

02:28.834 --> 02:34.367
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

02:35.734 --> 02:41.667
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

02:44.934 --> 02:47.267
Now, this Kundalini

02:47.400 --> 02:52.601
is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

02:53.334 --> 02:56.634
and within you, in a human being,

02:57.167 --> 03:06.267
it is like many strands of energy.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.834
So it’s like a rope

03:09.834 --> 03:16.133
and these energies are all twisted together

03:16.234 --> 03:18.667
to form this Kundalini.

03:20.400 --> 03:26.000
In a human being these strands are

03:26.133 --> 03:30.934
3 into 7 — that is 21 raised to power 108!.

03:32.067 --> 03:37.367
But when your Kundalini rises, one or two strands out of this

03:37.467 --> 03:41.634
come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

03:41.868 --> 03:43.968
Only one or two

03:45.868 --> 03:48.334
because it has to pass

03:48.434 --> 03:53.267
through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

03:55.734 --> 03:58.400
It’s all a spiral throughout

03:59.000 --> 04:02.601
because Kundalini is a spiral

04:02.734 --> 04:11.367
and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

04:12.167 --> 04:15.667
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

04:17.868 --> 04:24.667
The outermost nadi is the right side [Pingala nadi]

04:25.868 --> 04:32.534
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi [Left side].

04:34.934 --> 04:41.634
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

04:42.234 --> 04:48.334
By that, they relax the center.

04:48.434 --> 04:51.834
By the relaxation of the center,

04:53.601 --> 04:59.534
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

05:00.767 --> 05:05.334
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

05:05.767 --> 05:09.834
then your eyes start relaxing,

05:09.968 --> 05:12.434
your pupils start dilating and

05:12.567 --> 05:20.167
your eyes can become like Mine, very black,

05:20.267 --> 05:22.267
absolutely relaxed.

05:22.968 --> 05:25.334
So, you can easily see in a person

05:25.434 --> 05:27.634
how far is the Kundalini.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.567
If it has pierced the Agnya,

05:30.667 --> 05:34.667
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

05:35.734 --> 05:39.334
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

05:40.734 --> 05:46.400
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

05:47.400 --> 05:51.400
love, compassion and attention;

05:55.400 --> 06:01.534
all these three things are in that energy.

06:02.767 --> 06:06.868
We know of many energies; like electrical energy,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.067
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

06:12.133 --> 06:16.167
But these energies cannot think,

06:16.267 --> 06:18.968
they cannot adjust,

06:19.167 --> 06:22.567
they cannot work on their own.

06:24.834 --> 06:28.367
They are to be handled by us.

06:28.534 --> 06:33.067
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

06:33.200 --> 06:36.801
and knows how to handle itself.

06:38.334 --> 06:41.200
It thinks.

06:44.734 --> 06:49.000
If you see a seed being sprouted,

06:49.267 --> 06:54.200
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

06:54.868 --> 06:58.734
which knows how to go around the soft places

06:58.834 --> 07:01.868
and then how to encircle the stones

07:02.000 --> 07:06.634
and then how to find its way to the source.

07:08.400 --> 07:13.734
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.133
the way it moves.

07:16.234 --> 07:18.834
But within you is

07:19.534 --> 07:24.067
a tremendous force of Kundalini existing.

07:25.767 --> 07:30.000
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

07:31.133 --> 07:35.467
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

07:36.133 --> 07:42.868
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

07:43.868 --> 07:49.334
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

07:52.534 --> 07:55.467
When people get realization,

07:55.601 --> 07:59.367
they do not understand that they have to now grow.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.934
And why they don’t grow? Because

08:03.067 --> 08:07.000
they do not ask for these energies.

08:07.267 --> 08:11.334
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

08:11.801 --> 08:15.133
“I have to have more compassion.

08:16.934 --> 08:20.033
My compassion is not all right.

08:20.934 --> 08:25.067
My concern about others is not all right.

08:25.601 --> 08:28.334
My generosity is not all right.

08:28.467 --> 08:35.167
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love,”

08:36.334 --> 08:42.267
then this energy starts moving,

08:42.868 --> 08:47.634
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

08:48.067 --> 08:53.234
But, if you do not want

09:01.234 --> 09:06.801
to be growing in your awareness, then she says “All right,

09:06.934 --> 09:10.767
he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

09:10.868 --> 09:14.934
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored wit hin you.

09:15.067 --> 09:20.427
I told you, 3 into 7, that is 21,

09:21.220 --> 09:25.834
raised to power hundred and eight.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.000
So what a storage you have within yourself!
