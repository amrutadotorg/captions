00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.434
Today we have gathered here

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:17.634
to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:20.801
as well as your own Kundalini.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:29.868
First of all,

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:34.601
I think this is the most important thing to understand

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.968
about your own Kundalini,

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:41.767
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

00:00:41.868 --> 00:00:45.033
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:48.567
is this, your own Kundalini

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.167
because, when she rises,

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:57.033
she points it out,what are the problems on your chakras.

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.868
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.467
but we do not know what purity means.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.200
It means your chaste desire.

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:15.167
It means it has

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:18.968
no lust, greed, anything in it.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.467
That power is your own Mother

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:28.367
and is settled in your triangular bone. She’s your own mother.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:32.200
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.734
She knows everything about you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.434
and she is absolutely

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.601
the knowledge

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.801
because she’s so pure.

00:01:55.667 --> 00:02:00.067
And, whatever chakras she touches, she also knows

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:05.934
what's wrong with that chakra

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:08.601
beforehand,

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.367
so she's quite prepared,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.634
and she adjusts herself

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.634
fully

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:28.234
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:34.367
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:41.667
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:47.267
Now, this Kundalini

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.601
is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

00:02:53.334 --> 00:02:56.634
and within you, in a human being,

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:06.267
it is like many strands of energy.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.834
So it’s like a rope

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:16.133
and these energies are all twisted together

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:18.667
to form this Kundalini.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.000
In a human being these strands are

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:30.934
3 into 7 — that is 21 raised to power 108!.

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:37.367
But when your Kundalini rises, one or two strands out of this

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:41.634
come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:43.968
Only one or two

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:48.334
because it has to pass

00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:53.267
through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:58.400
It’s all a spiral throughout

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.601
because Kundalini is a spiral

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:11.367
and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:15.667
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:24.667
The outermost nadi is the right side [Pingala nadi]

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:32.534
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi [Left side].

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:41.634
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:48.334
By that, they relax the center.

00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:51.834
By the relaxation of the center,

00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:59.534
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:05.334
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:09.834
then your eyes start relaxing,

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.434
your pupils start dilating and

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:20.167
your eyes can become like Mine, very black,

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:22.267
absolutely relaxed.

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:25.334
So, you can easily see in a person

00:05:25.434 --> 00:05:27.634
how far is the Kundalini.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:30.567
If it has pierced the Agnya,

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:34.667
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:39.334
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:05:40.734 --> 00:05:46.400
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.400
love, compassion and attention;

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.534
all these three things are in that energy.

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:06.868
We know of many energies; like electrical energy,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.067
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:16.167
But these energies cannot think,

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:18.968
they cannot adjust,

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.567
they cannot work on their own.

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.367
They are to be handled by us.

00:06:28.534 --> 00:06:33.067
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.801
and knows how to handle itself.

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:41.200
It thinks.

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:49.000
If you see a seed being sprouted,

00:06:49.267 --> 00:06:54.200
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

00:06:54.868 --> 00:06:58.734
which knows how to go around the soft places

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:01.868
and then how to encircle the stones

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.634
and then how to find its way to the source.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.734
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:16.133
the way it moves.

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.834
But within you is

00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:24.067
a tremendous force of Kundalini existing.

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:30.000
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:35.467
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:42.868
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:49.334
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

00:07:52.534 --> 00:07:55.467
When people get realization,

00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:59.367
they do not understand that they have to now grow.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.934
And why they don’t grow? Because

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:07.000
they do not ask for these energies.

00:08:07.267 --> 00:08:11.334
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:15.133
“I have to have more compassion.

00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:20.033
My compassion is not all right.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:25.067
My concern about others is not all right.

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:28.334
My generosity is not all right.

00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:35.167
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love,”

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:42.267
then this energy starts moving,

00:08:42.868 --> 00:08:47.634
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

00:08:48.067 --> 00:08:53.234
But, if you do not want

00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:06.801
to be growing in your awareness, then she says “All right,

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:10.767
he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:14.934
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored wit hin you.

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:20.427
I told you, 3 into 7, that is 21,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.834
raised to power hundred and eight.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.000
So what a storage you have within yourself!
