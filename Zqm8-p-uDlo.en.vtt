00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:16.099
Today, we are all here assembled

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:21.099
in Turkey, in Istanbul,

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:25.939
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ

00:08:26.619 --> 00:08:32.579
and, with that also, your celebration of your resurrection.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:37.699
Christ's resurrection was a great message for us.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.299
He won over the death

00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:52.699
and came out of that dead body

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:58.099
with another body which was living body.

00:08:59.179 --> 00:09:03.819
The body was the same, but one was a dead body

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:09.059
and another one was a body which was living.

00:09:12.099 --> 00:09:16.259
It's not only symbolic, it actually happened within.

00:09:16.419 --> 00:09:23.739
After all, He was a divine child, He was a divine person.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:28.939
Actually it has happened within. It's not just a symbolic thing

00:09:29.099 --> 00:09:36.459
that He died and He was resurrected into another person

00:09:36.619 --> 00:09:40.939
or, you can say, into a living person.

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:52.699
For Him, what is the death? For eternal beings, there are no deaths.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:58.619
There's no death for a person who's eternal.

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:02.859
He may, for the time being, look as if He is dead,

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.619
but He can never die.

00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:10.739
Christ was like that, a very, very special incarnation,

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:16.699
which came on this earth to be reborn out of the dead.

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:23.019
Now we are also, when we are not yet realized souls,

00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:27.339
when we are not yet enlightened.

00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:34.179
We are also dead in the sense, our awareness is very, very...

00:10:35.939 --> 00:10:40.859
I should say, absolutely dull and dead.

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:46.859
We can see flowers, we can see faces, we can see buildings,

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:50.939
we can see cities, we can see all those things.

00:10:51.099 --> 00:10:55.139
All these things we see and we feel we are quite aware,

00:10:55.299 --> 00:10:57.899
which we are not.

00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.779
Actual awareness comes to us

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:04.139
when we cross the limits of our mind,

00:11:04.299 --> 00:11:08.779
go beyond the mind, and this was only possible

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:13.419
because of the resurrection of Christ.

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:18.019
He resurrected Himself because He was a divine person.

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:26.339
But also we are resurrected because we are blessed by Divinity.

00:11:26.659 --> 00:11:31.819
Now this mind of ours, which is in between,

00:11:31.979 --> 00:11:38.499
is controlled by Shri Jesus Christ.

00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:42.539
He controls through your Agnya, both the sides.

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:47.339
He controls your conditionings and He controls your ego

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:51.139
and brings a balance in you.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:59.019
But when this Agnya Chakra starts sprinkling,

00:11:59.179 --> 00:12:03.899
all sorts of ideas, sometimes reacting,

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:07.179
sometimes accepting conditionings...

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:11.299
it is a slave, it is not a free thing,

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:17.699
because it is working under the influence of your ego

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:20.939
or your superego.

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:28.019
For that is the death of our awareness,

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:34.699
that we cannot, we cannot understand something beyond.

00:12:34.859 --> 00:12:40.299
That there exists a life beyond this, we cannot accept.

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:42.779
This is... We have seen now

00:12:42.939 --> 00:12:50.619
that we were all in a condition that one was deadened.

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:54.259
We were feeling bad, we were feeling anxious,

00:12:54.419 --> 00:12:57.139
we were fighting and we were thinking:

00:12:57.299 --> 00:13:01.539
"There's something wrong with our present life."

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:07.259
There's something definitely which makes us slave,

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.019
by which we are slavish.

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:16.099
That we realized, no doubt, and we started seeking the Truth.

00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:20.739
We started seeking the Truth in so many ways,

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:25.499
I know so many were... also went astray,

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:33.219
and they lost their balance and have fallen into a complete demise.

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:37.099
But so many of you have been salvaged,

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:44.419
have been saved by the great example of Christ's resurrection.

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:47.099
He had to venture it,

00:13:47.259 --> 00:13:50.979
He had to do it and He worked it out.

00:13:51.139 --> 00:13:56.219
Without Him, our Agnya would not have been that flexible.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:58.779
As it is, the human beings

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:02.779
in the olden times were conditioned very much.

00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:07.219
And when they have become modern, they are full of ego,

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:09.059
nothing in between.

00:14:09.219 --> 00:14:12.779
With these two influences, we are imprisoned,

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:18.059
we are absolutely dead people.

00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:21.379
We have no sensitivity for anything.

00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:25.219
I've seen now... even today, you can see

00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:27.739
about things are happening across,

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:32.979
is people are very anxious to kill each other.

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:36.579
Human beings want to kill human beings, can you imagine?

00:14:36.739 --> 00:14:42.979
Such a stupid thing that we should kill our kith and kin.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:46.419
Then, there are children who are killing,

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:51.619
parents that are killing, no relationship is accepted.

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:57.779
It's a sign of a person whose awareness is completely dead.

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.819
In our awareness, at least

00:14:59.979 --> 00:15:04.299
we should have feelings of compassion and love.

00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:09.779
But that one is lost, it's not there, we don't have it.

00:15:09.939 --> 00:15:13.899
The whole world is a flame, when you read about

00:15:14.059 --> 00:15:16.099
all the wars that are going on,

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:18.179
the way they are killing children,

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:23.579
the way they are destroying human beings.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:29.539
It is a wrong attitude

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:34.019
that with destruction of human beings, things will improve.

00:15:34.179 --> 00:15:36.819
It's a very, very wrong concept

00:15:36.979 --> 00:15:42.099
that by destroying them, one can achieve something.

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:48.699
Our work in Sahaja Yoga is doing well, I must say,

00:15:48.859 --> 00:15:53.899
but it has to stop this horrible attitude of human beings

00:15:54.059 --> 00:15:56.059
to destroy.

00:15:56.219 --> 00:15:58.779
So you might ask then: "What to do, Mother?

00:15:58.939 --> 00:16:03.339
What to do to stop this destruction?"

00:16:03.499 --> 00:16:05.819
Answer is in the life of Christ.

00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:07.899
You resurrect people,

00:16:08.059 --> 00:16:12.339
you resurrect them, enlighten them, bring them

00:16:12.499 --> 00:16:17.339
to a state where they understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:21.859
Let them feel, let them feel the compassion

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:24.659
and love that is within you.

00:16:24.819 --> 00:16:28.779
When that starts, that third force within us starts acting,

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:36.699
our ego also comes down,

00:16:36.859 --> 00:16:39.739
our conditionings also come down.

00:16:39.899 --> 00:16:42.499
For example, if you think: "We are Muslims,

00:16:42.659 --> 00:16:45.899
we have a right to kill others", if you think:

00:16:46.059 --> 00:16:49.059
"We are Jews, we have a right to kill others."

00:16:49.219 --> 00:16:52.179
All these differentiations and

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:57.019
this kind of discrimination that we have is so stupid,

00:16:57.179 --> 00:16:59.619
because you are human beings,

00:16:59.779 --> 00:17:01.539
they are human beings.

00:17:01.699 --> 00:17:06.939
You are killing human beings!

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:10.539
Not that they have committed any sin

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:12.619
or they have done anything wrong,

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:16.699
except that, in their foolishness, they believe that

00:17:16.859 --> 00:17:19.859
they are this and they are that.

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:23.379
You are not! You are just human beings.

00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:28.379
In every human being, as you know very well, there is Kundalini.

00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:30.979
There's no discrimination, everyone,

00:17:31.139 --> 00:17:36.059
whether you are a Muslim, a Jew, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Parsee,

00:17:36.219 --> 00:17:40.139
anyone, you may call by any name.

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:46.579
Now just look at how we accept a certain denomination for ourselves!

00:17:46.739 --> 00:17:50.339
You are born, say, to a Christian family

00:17:50.499 --> 00:17:53.619
or you are born to a Hindu family:

00:17:53.779 --> 00:17:58.219
immediately you start thinking you are there to uphold

00:17:58.379 --> 00:18:05.979
all the flags of that religion in which you are born.

00:18:06.219 --> 00:18:09.899
You are born in that religion without your knowledge,

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:13.979
without your permission, without any understanding.

00:18:14.139 --> 00:18:17.419
So how can you belong to that religion?

00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:21.459
You have got Kundalini, everybody else has got Kundalini.

00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:26.339
So you can only belong to the religion of humanity,

00:18:26.499 --> 00:18:29.299
where every human being has got Kundalini.

00:18:29.459 --> 00:18:31.539
So, you are nothing but human beings.

00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:33.739
All these false ideas, that:

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:36.459
"We are Hindus, we are Muslims, we are Christians",

00:18:36.619 --> 00:18:42.859
is all man-created. I mean, man can create anything,

00:18:43.019 --> 00:18:46.579
and human beings have no brain to understand

00:18:46.739 --> 00:18:48.659
that is all man creating.

00:18:48.819 --> 00:18:52.339
For example, you see in America,

00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:57.299
they create associations and big organizations and all that,

00:18:57.459 --> 00:19:04.259
based on absolute falsehood, absolute wrong ideas,

00:19:04.419 --> 00:19:08.539
absolute destructiveness, but they form it,

00:19:08.699 --> 00:19:11.419
they form their groups, they have this, they have...

00:19:11.579 --> 00:19:15.219
and they are prospering.

00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:20.419
But it has a repercussion, they don't know.

00:19:20.579 --> 00:19:25.219
If you start doing such false things against human beings

00:19:25.379 --> 00:19:30.179
who are created by God, and nobody can destroy them,

00:19:30.339 --> 00:19:32.779
then there are repercussions.

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:36.619
Many, many countries, who were, once upon a time, rulers,

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:40.899
were known as great things, have come down.

00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:43.739
And all such countries who now think they are very rich

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:46.739
and all that, will have to come down.

00:19:46.899 --> 00:19:51.099
All of them have to come down, is just an ultimate result

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:55.379
of this stupidity to believe that you are higher than others,

00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:59.739
that you can kill others.

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:04.699
So, a non-violent method started

00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:07.259
which is of another absurdity, I think,

00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:15.019
because then they start saving mosquitoes and also the bugs,

00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:17.979
while mosquitoes and bugs are,

00:20:18.139 --> 00:20:23.499
you must know, are the greatest blood-suckers.

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:26.859
They live only on human blood.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:31.099
Such things, what's the use of saving them?

00:20:31.259 --> 00:20:38.659
So, human beings take to something that is absurd, stupid, foolish.

00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:41.339
I don't know what is the reason.

00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:46.059
The way they accept things is absolutely unbelievable.

00:20:46.219 --> 00:20:49.899
I think it is a kind of a slavish mentality

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:51.659
which does not give them freedom

00:20:51.819 --> 00:20:54.019
to think what is right, what is wrong.

00:20:54.179 --> 00:20:59.019
For this, we have Christ. We have Christ, a person

00:20:59.179 --> 00:21:02.179
who was absolutely free,

00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:06.539
free from all kinds of prejudices,

00:21:07.459 --> 00:21:11.139
all kinds of temptations,

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:15.939
all kinds of nonsense that human beings follow.

00:21:16.099 --> 00:21:19.939
But one may say that: "Mother, after all, He was divine!"

00:21:20.099 --> 00:21:23.979
He was divine and now you are made divine also.

00:21:24.139 --> 00:21:32.579
So, how can we now join together to make a full effort,

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:37.459
a full effort, to tell people that:

00:21:37.619 --> 00:21:43.219
"What are you doing? Why are you doing it?

00:21:43.379 --> 00:21:46.019
What is the need to do such things?"

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:50.619
On one side is, we can say, a mass destruction

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:57.259
through stupidity, another side is your own self-destruction.

00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:05.459
Take to drinking, take to other self-destructive things

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.379
which are immoral,

00:22:08.539 --> 00:22:12.619
that's very easily available, and people like it very much.

00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:18.019
They don't like when you talk that: "This is destructive."

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:22.859
So, either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

00:22:23.019 --> 00:22:29.299
Christ was destroyed by others and He resurrected by Himself.

00:22:29.459 --> 00:22:32.139
So we are also in the same position now.

00:22:32.299 --> 00:22:35.379
I know many a times Sahaja Yoga was challenged.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:38.019
Now it's much better, not so bad...

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:41.299
was challenged and there were so many problems.

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:45.339
But now it's smoothing down,

00:22:45.499 --> 00:22:48.819
because that's the Truth, that's the Reality,

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:50.979
that's what is Divinity.

00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:53.619
So, you should not be afraid.

00:22:53.779 --> 00:23:00.299
All these funny ideas about Sahaja Yoga also will die out.

00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:04.979
It's a resurrection, not only of you people,

00:23:05.139 --> 00:23:09.699
but also of your ideologies.

00:23:09.859 --> 00:23:11.979
Now the ideologies change,

00:23:12.139 --> 00:23:16.259
that our awareness should be enlightened.

00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:19.059
We should have light in our awareness.

00:23:19.219 --> 00:23:22.379
This has come suddenly through Sahaja Yoga to people, that:

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:24.499
"If you don't have the light,

00:23:24.659 --> 00:23:30.019
how can you go further in the right path?"

00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:34.979
It's not easy to describe Christ's life, how He went through that.

00:23:35.459 --> 00:23:40.659
He died so young and brutally He was killed.

00:23:40.899 --> 00:23:45.579
But still all that, He resurrected Himself.

00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:49.819
He came out of all that, came out of that ordeal.

00:23:49.979 --> 00:23:53.619
So for us also, when we are in Sahaja Yoga problems,

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:56.739
we should know we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

00:23:56.899 --> 00:24:00.939
No one can destroy us! No one can finish us off,

00:24:01.099 --> 00:24:05.219
because we have a power to resurrect ourselves.

00:24:05.499 --> 00:24:08.499
This special power that we have to resurrect,

00:24:08.659 --> 00:24:14.139
you should all the time understand and feel it and meditate on that.

00:24:14.299 --> 00:24:17.539
I hear from people from every country:

00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:19.139
"The government is doing like this,

00:24:19.299 --> 00:24:20.819
the government is doing like this!"

00:24:20.979 --> 00:24:22.499
or they are having some trouble,

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:26.219
they call you a sect, they call you this and that...

00:24:26.379 --> 00:24:28.619
Alright, doesn't matter!

00:24:28.779 --> 00:24:30.819
Your duty is to believe

00:24:30.979 --> 00:24:35.139
that you are following the footsteps of Christ.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:37.979
And no one can destroy it!

00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:40.699
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:44.859
that divine life cannot be destroyed.

00:24:45.739 --> 00:24:48.099
When this body could not be destroyed,

00:24:48.259 --> 00:24:52.419
then how can you destroy the divine light in Him?

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:54.579
So many Sahaja Yogis are here,

00:24:54.739 --> 00:24:57.859
who have been since long in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:58.019 --> 00:24:59.819
and they have had problems,

00:24:59.979 --> 00:25:02.939
and they went through lot of troubles, I agree!

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:05.979
But all these things have subsided.

00:25:06.139 --> 00:25:09.259
And now you are in such a resurrected position

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:12.139
that, after some time, -you'll be amazed-

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:17.339
Sahaja Yoga will take over, all over the world.

00:25:17.499 --> 00:25:20.579
All over the world, people will take to Sahaja Yoga

00:25:20.739 --> 00:25:24.699
and we'll have such a lot of Sahaja Yogis all over the world

00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:30.819
that all this minority of some stupid people will disappear.

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:34.859
For that, what have you to do? Sometimes, people ask Me:

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:39.139
"What do we have to do?" You must have also read the Bible,

00:25:39.299 --> 00:25:43.939
that Christ prayed and He was praying.

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:47.899
In the same way, we can say, we have to meditate.

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:51.019
Through meditation, we'll grow in our awareness,

00:25:51.179 --> 00:25:57.859
in our new personality, in our strengthened personality.

00:25:58.019 --> 00:26:01.099
Meditation is the only way we can grow,

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:04.419
and then no one can destroy you,

00:26:04.579 --> 00:26:08.059
because you are all protected by the Divine Love.

00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:09.379
You don't have to worry

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:12.259
as to who will destroy you, what will happen.

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:15.419
Of course, in the beginning there's little agitation,

00:26:15.579 --> 00:26:18.299
people feel a little bad about it, it's alright!

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:22.539
But actually, NO ONE can destroy you.

00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:24.619
Have this faith in you!

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:27.139
Christ had no organization;

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:31.859
He had no Adi Shakti to support Him, in no way.

00:26:32.019 --> 00:26:36.299
But only through His divine personality,

00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:39.379
He managed to get out of all the problems,

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:45.179
of all the tortures, of all the atrocities on Him.

00:26:45.499 --> 00:26:48.019
So now, you have better advantage,

00:26:48.179 --> 00:26:49.939
because you are enlightened.

00:26:50.099 --> 00:26:54.899
Firstly, He was a divine person and He could go through that.

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:56.739
You don't have to!

00:26:56.899 --> 00:26:58.979
Nobody will torture you, nobody will put you in jail,

00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:00.939
nobody will crucify you.

00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:03.579
Nobody will, that's not possible.

00:27:03.739 --> 00:27:08.659
But mentally, if you are upset, sometimes you get upset I know,

00:27:08.819 --> 00:27:11.259
in certain countries people get upset,

00:27:11.419 --> 00:27:14.579
because they think they are oppressed because they are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:19.419
I assure you, no one can do that.

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:24.939
You must know that you are all the time protected.

00:27:26.379 --> 00:27:30.619
Christ is there as your elder brother, I always said that.

00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.139
But also you have your Mother,

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:37.339
and you have all the Ganas and all the Angels around you.

00:27:37.499 --> 00:27:40.779
When I see this, I just thought: "Look at this,

00:27:40.939 --> 00:27:47.219
in every country they have shown Angels and Ganas are there!"

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:51.059
Such pure forms of protection you have.

00:27:51.219 --> 00:27:54.259
So there's nothing to worry about

00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:58.619
your destruction or your impediments,

00:27:58.779 --> 00:28:00.459
or whatever you may call it,

00:28:00.619 --> 00:28:06.459
a kind of destructive forces acting on you.

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:12.459
From the life of Christ, you have to know that no one can destroy

00:28:12.619 --> 00:28:16.139
a realised soul in these modern times.

00:28:16.299 --> 00:28:18.219
As it is, they never destroyed.

00:28:18.379 --> 00:28:22.659
We had so many Saints who were killed, who were tortured,

00:28:22.819 --> 00:28:27.099
but see, they still exist as poetry, as poems,

00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:35.539
also as blessings, everywhere they are not finished.

00:28:35.699 --> 00:28:39.179
They are not dead, though it seems that they are no more,

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:46.859
but even to take their names and even to call them, they work out.

00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:50.979
They are there in their Spirit and they help.

00:28:51.139 --> 00:28:54.419
Assured by Christ's life,

00:28:54.579 --> 00:28:59.659
by His resurrection, we are resurrected people.

00:28:59.899 --> 00:29:03.379
Of course, our body also has changed.

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:07.739
After resurrection, you know that your Chakras work out

00:29:07.899 --> 00:29:11.579
all the curing and all the blessings.

00:29:11.739 --> 00:29:15.299
Our attitude, our mental attitude also changes,

00:29:15.459 --> 00:29:18.419
and also your ego subsides.

00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:21.779
Not only that, also our conditionings go out.

00:29:21.939 --> 00:29:26.179
Specially I was so happy that those people, say,

00:29:26.339 --> 00:29:28.539
who are born in a particular religion,

00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:32.059
immediately they see what's wrong with that religion,

00:29:32.219 --> 00:29:37.419
as if they turn round and see the image of their society

00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:39.339
and know what's wrong with them.

00:29:39.499 --> 00:29:45.219
And when they start meditating on those corrections,

00:29:45.379 --> 00:29:49.099
it works, societies are improving.

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:54.099
You see, so-called religious ideas are falling into their own traps,

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:57.379
and they will all fall because they're falsehood.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:59.099
That's not real religion.

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:03.619
The religion is within ourselves and this pure religion

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:07.259
is the one which is a global religion.

00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:12.899
The solution comes like that: supposing you have wars...

00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.939
wars in the name of religion,

00:30:20.099 --> 00:30:22.579
in the name of God specially.

00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:26.899
And in the name of religions they have wars.

00:30:27.059 --> 00:30:29.379
So now, what happens?

00:30:29.539 --> 00:30:36.819
All these wars that take place cannot destroy Reality,

00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:39.019
cannot destroy the Truth.

00:30:39.179 --> 00:30:42.499
This is another message of Christ's resurrection.

00:30:42.659 --> 00:30:44.019
You cannot!

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:47.419
You may think that today you have destroyed these people,

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:50.379
but they are there.

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:55.379
All the Saints, all the great people

00:30:55.539 --> 00:31:02.259
who have been resurrected in life are all the time there.

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:05.819
Their protections are there, their guidance is there,

00:31:05.979 --> 00:31:11.979
you can see them in a way that they are there.

00:31:12.379 --> 00:31:19.939
So one should have no fear. The fear of death has to go.

00:31:20.179 --> 00:31:22.339
So many of them have said the same

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:24.339
that: "What is death after all?"

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:29.139
Death dies itself, once you are resurrected.

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:32.059
So one should not be afraid of death.

00:31:32.219 --> 00:31:35.779
Now how many of you have been afraid of death

00:31:35.939 --> 00:31:39.379
before your resurrection, but not now?

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:43.099
You are not bothered as to when the death comes, what happens

00:31:43.259 --> 00:31:47.819
or which way you are going to be so-called destroyed.

00:31:47.979 --> 00:31:50.059
You know you cannot be destroyed.

00:31:50.219 --> 00:31:53.339
In your heart of hearts, you all know this very well,

00:31:53.499 --> 00:31:57.019
that you cannot be destroyed.

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:05.939
The fear of our destruction goes away, no doubt.

00:32:06.059 --> 00:32:10.139
But there is one thing, is the compassion.

00:32:10.299 --> 00:32:12.459
When you see all these bad things are happening

00:32:12.619 --> 00:32:18.299
and people are being tortured, your mind is... you see...

00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:20.699
cannot take it for granted.

00:32:20.859 --> 00:32:25.459
It starts responding to that,

00:32:25.619 --> 00:32:31.099
and it feels the pain of others, tremendous!

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:35.899
But as a result of that, your will power,

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:40.779
your thinking on those lines, your tears even are powerful

00:32:40.939 --> 00:32:44.019
and they can bring solace to those people

00:32:44.179 --> 00:32:46.459
who are suffering unnecessarily.

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:51.339
You have to experiment with it.

00:32:51.499 --> 00:33:02.219
Just having a feeling of compassion and love, things will improve.

00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:06.539
Now, as it is, we meditate.

00:33:06.699 --> 00:33:12.019
But we can meditate also with such compassion

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:18.619
and such love that your tears can also have an effect

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:21.179
on these people who are so cruel

00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:25.179
and stupid and killing each other.

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:30.299
But it is important for you to know that now

00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:33.859
you are not an individual, but you have become a global personality,

00:33:34.019 --> 00:33:36.259
a global personality.

00:33:36.419 --> 00:33:40.659
You are not an individual, you are a global personality,

00:33:40.819 --> 00:33:47.019
and sitting down here, you are working out all the global problems.

00:33:47.579 --> 00:33:49.939
You are not a small person now,

00:33:50.139 --> 00:33:52.139
who's only worried about your own children,

00:33:52.299 --> 00:33:55.659
about your family, about this and that, no!

00:33:55.819 --> 00:34:00.499
This mind of yours has expanded, expanded like this,

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:07.139
that it works automatically for all the problems of the world.

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:09.979
When for a woman I read newspapers,

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:12.859
specially women seldom read newspapers,

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:15.499
they think it's stupidity to read those papers.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:21.419
But I read, I read and I read those where My attention is in it.

00:34:21.579 --> 00:34:26.099
I've seen it works! But all of you put together, if you understand

00:34:26.259 --> 00:34:29.499
that this is your responsibility to correct

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:35.779
all the destructive forces, to put them right,

00:34:35.939 --> 00:34:40.139
we just have to collectively meditate on the points

00:34:40.299 --> 00:34:44.099
where you find there's a big problem.

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:48.899
Now the problem mainly is because of religions, mainly.

00:34:49.059 --> 00:34:52.459
Now, if they can all jump into the new religion,

00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:56.899
global religion, they all are one.

00:34:57.059 --> 00:35:00.459
They cannot then fight because there's one religion.

00:35:00.619 --> 00:35:02.659
But they don't want to have one religion,

00:35:02.819 --> 00:35:05.499
because they want to fight. They're fighting cocks.

00:35:05.659 --> 00:35:10.779
But if they come to Sahaj, if they become enlightened,

00:35:10.939 --> 00:35:14.619
then they will only enjoy love of each other

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:19.579
and not killing of each other, destruction of others.

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:23.939
And this is what we have to learn from life of Christ,

00:35:24.139 --> 00:35:25.859
who was alone, who was single.

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:28.379
He did not have such a collective behind Him.

00:35:28.539 --> 00:35:32.819
But how powerful He was that He fought the death

00:35:32.979 --> 00:35:37.699
and came out of it so clearly at the stage of Agnya!

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:41.219
Without Him, we could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:41.379 --> 00:35:43.659
Kundalini would not have gone through,

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:46.379
unless and until He had sacrificed His life.

00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:48.379
And He readily sacrificed,

00:35:48.539 --> 00:35:53.419
He accepted the task of sacrificing His life,

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:55.499
and then resurrected.

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:58.619
He passed through that, I should say,

00:35:58.779 --> 00:36:02.179
a very constricted channel of Agnya,

00:36:02.339 --> 00:36:09.619
to put you people right, by saying: "You forgive everyone."

00:36:09.779 --> 00:36:12.459
If forgiving was such a powerful thing

00:36:12.619 --> 00:36:16.579
that you can even fight your death, then why not forgive?

00:36:16.739 --> 00:36:19.139
Many people say: "Mother, we can't forgive!"

00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:20.819
and I've told hundred times that:

00:36:20.939 --> 00:36:24.339
"What are you doing if not forgiving?"

00:36:24.499 --> 00:36:28.179
So, the message of Christ's life is that He forgot,

00:36:28.339 --> 00:36:31.259
forgave all the people who troubled Him.

00:36:31.419 --> 00:36:34.699
Even He said that: "O God, please forgive them,

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:38.379
because they don't know what they are doing!"

00:36:38.539 --> 00:36:43.499
On the cross, He said those things, when He was tortured, insulted,

00:36:43.659 --> 00:36:46.219
He's saying what? "You forgive them,

00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:49.499
have pity, have sympathy for them,

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.859
because they don't know what they are doing!" They are killing

00:36:53.019 --> 00:36:55.819
the Son of God, and what will happen to them?

00:36:55.979 --> 00:37:00.459
Where will they go? What will be their situation?

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:08.459
This one is a big message for us,

00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:12.499
that even on the cross, He said: "Forgive,

00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:16.419
O God, O Father, forgive them!"

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:20.499
In the same way, we have to also forgive people.

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:26.379
It's very important from the life of Christ that we have to forgive.

00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:32.179
His forgiveness was of the greatest importance.

00:37:32.339 --> 00:37:35.339
For the whole world to understand, you must forgive.

00:37:35.499 --> 00:37:38.339
If you learn how to forgive, you'll be amazed,

00:37:38.499 --> 00:37:41.819
half of the wars of this world will be finished!

00:37:41.939 --> 00:37:45.099
Now, something happened thousands of years back.

00:37:45.259 --> 00:37:49.379
Still people are fighting, still they are fighting,

00:37:49.539 --> 00:37:52.139
thinking these things happened so many years back,

00:37:52.299 --> 00:37:54.939
so they are our ennemies.

00:37:56.499 --> 00:37:59.619
If He can really forgive those people,

00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:04.899
what happened before we were even born,

00:38:05.059 --> 00:38:10.419
why should we form a group of such people, why?

00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:15.739
Because there is something called hatred in human beings,

00:38:16.339 --> 00:38:20.539
they have hatred, hatred for this, hatred for that,

00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:24.859
even in small things they'll say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

00:38:25.019 --> 00:38:27.419
It's very common,

00:38:31.619 --> 00:38:34.099
nowadays specially.

00:38:34.259 --> 00:38:37.059
When we were young, we were not supposed to say such a thing:

00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:40.539
"I don't like it, I like it!",

00:38:40.699 --> 00:38:42.459
we were not supposed to say.

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:46.379
But now their freedom has given them to talk like this:

00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:48.899
"I don't like it, I don't like that,

00:38:49.059 --> 00:38:54.419
I don't like that, I don't like that person!" Who are you?

00:38:54.579 --> 00:38:58.699
What do you think of yourself to judge others?

00:38:58.859 --> 00:39:00.819
You don't know how to appreciate,

00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:02.819
you don't know how to enjoy

00:39:02.939 --> 00:39:05.579
and only what you go on is: "I don't like it!"

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:08.499
And supposing you like it, what will you do?

00:39:08.659 --> 00:39:13.019
Whether you like it or don't like is just the same!

00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:16.059
But just to show off their ego, we say:

00:39:16.219 --> 00:39:21.459
"I don't like this way, I don't like!"

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:25.419
Because there's no love!

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:31.659
If there is love, then you can enjoy everything.

00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:35.539
We'll never say: "I don't like it, I like it!"

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:42.419
You will definitely enjoy if you really say

00:39:42.579 --> 00:39:46.419
that: "I enjoy, I enjoy everything!"

00:39:46.579 --> 00:39:49.259
You are closing down yourself by saying:

00:39:49.419 --> 00:39:53.619
"I don't like it, I don't like it, I don't like!"

00:39:53.779 --> 00:39:55.819
as if you are a great connoisseur,

00:39:55.939 --> 00:40:00.779
or a person, a judge, to say this!

00:40:00.939 --> 00:40:06.139
It is very remarkable that in the West it's even more prominent

00:40:06.299 --> 00:40:09.819
that they will say: "I don't like it, I don't like!"

00:40:09.979 --> 00:40:12.939
Of course, in the East, I would say in India,

00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:15.099
if somebody says like that, people will say

00:40:15.259 --> 00:40:18.419
he's just trying to show off. On the face!

00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:25.779
But showing off is not regarded as bad manners.

00:40:25.939 --> 00:40:28.779
It's not regarded as bad manners in the West.

00:40:28.939 --> 00:40:33.419
To feel shy of anything is regarded as bad manners,

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:40.779
but to boast of something, nobody feels that it is a bad thing.

00:40:41.019 --> 00:40:44.739
Did Christ boast of anything? Never!

00:40:44.899 --> 00:40:48.059
He never boasted of anything,

00:40:48.219 --> 00:40:56.139
but when He saw people were selling things in the holy places,

00:40:56.299 --> 00:40:57.899
what did He do?

00:40:58.059 --> 00:41:01.259
He started beating them with a hunter,

00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:04.259
because that was wrong, absolutely wrong,

00:41:04.419 --> 00:41:08.539
against the holiness of the place.

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.179
But He did not say: "I don't like it!" No!

00:41:11.339 --> 00:41:17.339
He just showed His complete disapproval

00:41:17.499 --> 00:41:20.699
of the whole system of selling things

00:41:20.859 --> 00:41:25.739
in the temple or in a holy place.

00:41:25.899 --> 00:41:28.579
People go there to worship.

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:35.379
They need a mind which is devoid of money orientation.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:44.779
There should be no money orientation when you are meditating.

00:41:44.939 --> 00:41:48.339
This is the biggest problem of today.

00:41:48.619 --> 00:41:51.899
Everything is money orientation.

00:41:52.219 --> 00:41:58.099
You like a car which is very expensive, so you want to have.

00:41:58.259 --> 00:42:01.579
By hook and crook, you will get that car and sit in there.

00:42:01.739 --> 00:42:08.979
You might be a thief, but you buy an expensive car to show off,

00:42:09.299 --> 00:42:13.339
perhaps maybe because you are a thief, that's why you want to hide

00:42:13.499 --> 00:42:15.619
your personality.

00:42:15.779 --> 00:42:20.619
So there is no truthful life, it's all just showing off

00:42:20.779 --> 00:42:22.939
and thinking no end of yourself.

00:42:23.139 --> 00:42:29.099
But when the death will come at your doorstep, what will you do?

00:42:29.259 --> 00:42:34.579
At that time, you will be trembling

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:38.059
with all your so-called achievements

00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:39.979
and your so-called showing off.

00:42:40.139 --> 00:42:43.939
You will just tremble before death.

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:47.459
But a Sahaja Yogi cannot!

00:42:47.619 --> 00:42:52.539
He will like, if the death has to come, it has to come!

00:42:52.699 --> 00:42:58.299
He will not tremble that the death is something dangerous,

00:42:58.459 --> 00:43:01.619
but is a place where he can go and rest.

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:05.059
He won't mind, he won't mind anything,

00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:10.459
because he is above that, he is above destruction.

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:13.859
So, he won't mind anything, whatever comes his way

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:18.579
and he will surrender to it easily.

00:43:18.739 --> 00:43:22.419
We have Kabir. Kabir has written so many poems,

00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:27.539
mostly about death.

00:43:27.939 --> 00:43:32.539
He said: "When death came, I didn't say a single word,

00:43:32.699 --> 00:43:35.979
I didn't fight, but what I did,

00:43:36.139 --> 00:43:42.499
I took a sheet on top of me and went off to sleep!"

00:43:42.659 --> 00:43:45.539
How sweetly he described death sometimes,

00:43:45.699 --> 00:43:49.579
and Kabir then reminds Me of Christ.

00:43:49.739 --> 00:43:54.939
How sweetly Christ also went through all these things,

00:43:55.139 --> 00:44:03.259
and when He died, the whole elements shook.

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:06.179
He was the master of elements.

00:44:06.339 --> 00:44:07.579
They shook,

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:12.059
there was earthquake and all kinds of things that happened.

00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:16.779
They, they felt His death, not Him!

00:44:16.939 --> 00:44:21.099
They felt that such a great divinity

00:44:21.259 --> 00:44:29.819
which is the essence of existence has been killed like this.

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:33.859
They also didn't know that He is going to come back to His life.

00:44:34.019 --> 00:44:36.979
They also were not aware of it, but He did.

00:44:37.139 --> 00:44:42.139
He did come out of that deadening thing, for which

00:44:42.299 --> 00:44:46.659
everybody was so much shocked.

00:44:48.299 --> 00:44:52.979
His death itself gives us strength,

00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:56.939
that we have no death, we have resurrected

00:44:57.099 --> 00:45:01.339
and resurrection is with us.

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:03.339
But we have to establish,

00:45:03.499 --> 00:45:08.459
we have to establish our Sahaja Yoga, our meditation.

00:45:08.619 --> 00:45:10.299
That's very important.

00:45:10.459 --> 00:45:13.099
The other day, I met a lady.

00:45:13.259 --> 00:45:18.379
She told of a miracle in her life, how she was saved.

00:45:18.539 --> 00:45:24.019
She was about to die, she came across an accident, all kind...

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:28.459
But how she was saved, while her husband,

00:45:28.619 --> 00:45:31.859
he succumbs to all kinds of things. So I said:

00:45:32.019 --> 00:45:34.459
"What do you mean, how it happened?" She said:

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:38.139
"Mother, it's nothing but Shraddha!"

00:45:38.299 --> 00:45:43.259
Shraddha is dedication, surrendering.

00:45:43.419 --> 00:45:48.579
"Surrendering, because I'm surrendered!"

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:53.019
But I said: "How?" "That, I don't know, I'm just surrendered.

00:45:53.179 --> 00:45:59.379
I feel so comfortable, so lively and so much out of fear

00:45:59.539 --> 00:46:01.739
when I know I'm surrendered,

00:46:01.899 --> 00:46:04.859
completely surrendered to my Spirit!"

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:07.419
And this what it is what we have to learn

00:46:07.579 --> 00:46:10.859
when we meditate, that we have to surrender.

00:46:11.019 --> 00:46:14.539
Muhammad has called "Islam". Islam means surrender,

00:46:14.699 --> 00:46:17.699
though they don't surrender -otherwise you see...-

00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:21.579
but what is that you must surrender

00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:26.779
to your global nature, to your higher nature.

00:46:26.939 --> 00:46:30.339
You must not die out,

00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:32.579
you must not fizzle out

00:46:32.739 --> 00:46:37.859
into these worldly turmoil and worldly things.

00:46:38.019 --> 00:46:43.699
It's a very strength-giving example of Christ.

00:46:43.859 --> 00:46:48.819
And He's with us, He will always guide us, He'll look after us,

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:51.859
not only but He'll give us strength.

00:46:52.019 --> 00:46:57.979
He will destroy all those who will be against eternal life.

00:46:58.139 --> 00:47:00.179
He'll destroy nonsensical things.

00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:05.259
And you are seeing now how in Kali Yuga all these institutions

00:47:05.419 --> 00:47:10.099
who talk of religion and fights are getting destroyed.

00:47:10.259 --> 00:47:12.939
Automatically, we have done nothing.

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:17.419
On their own only, while they're doing, they are finishing,

00:47:17.579 --> 00:47:21.859
because there's no Reality, there's no Spirit in it,

00:47:22.019 --> 00:47:27.899
and without the Spirit, what is left is nothing but a dead body.

00:47:28.059 --> 00:47:33.099
The whole understanding should be for Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:33.259 --> 00:47:37.499
that we have to be Spirit-oriented,

00:47:37.659 --> 00:47:43.419
not money-oriented, body-oriented, emotion-oriented,

00:47:43.579 --> 00:47:45.619
but Spirit-oriented,

00:47:45.779 --> 00:47:48.059
which is a joy-giving thing.

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:51.819
And you'll be surprised with that orientation,

00:47:51.939 --> 00:48:00.259
you will be the most happy, most loving,

00:48:00.419 --> 00:48:04.739
most beautiful person.

00:48:04.899 --> 00:48:07.139
Immediately, people will know around

00:48:07.299 --> 00:48:10.299
that there's something about this man, some spark

00:48:10.459 --> 00:48:16.779
about this lady, some sort of a spark that she is or he is

00:48:16.939 --> 00:48:23.059
so much different from us. It can be recognized in no time.

00:48:23.299 --> 00:48:29.339
Now, at the time of Christ, very few people could recognize,

00:48:29.499 --> 00:48:32.699
because they were not enlightened,

00:48:32.859 --> 00:48:39.979
because they were very much below the level of human beings,

00:48:40.139 --> 00:48:42.859
I should say. But you are not!

00:48:43.019 --> 00:48:47.019
You are quite aware, you are born in modern times,

00:48:47.179 --> 00:48:49.939
and at this time, when we think of Christ,

00:48:50.059 --> 00:48:52.459
we should know what a life it was,

00:48:52.619 --> 00:48:55.939
what a grand personality it was,

00:48:56.139 --> 00:48:59.699
that He subjected to this kind of a torture.

00:48:59.859 --> 00:49:02.459
He could have destroyed all of them in no time.

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:06.459
He was so powerful, such a powerful personality,

00:49:06.619 --> 00:49:10.859
but He did not! He forgave them.

00:49:11.019 --> 00:49:13.699
He gave you the message of forgiveness,

00:49:13.859 --> 00:49:16.619
the greatest force that can work out.

00:49:16.779 --> 00:49:19.139
Now also, you should surrender yourself

00:49:19.299 --> 00:49:24.459
to this idea of forgiveness and really try to forgive.

00:49:24.619 --> 00:49:28.299
You'll be amazed, you will feel very much peaceful, very happy,

00:49:28.459 --> 00:49:33.379
and the person who has tortured you will come round.

00:49:34.059 --> 00:49:38.619
What we have to do is now to transform people. That's our job.

00:49:38.779 --> 00:49:41.379
We have to transform them. We are transformed.

00:49:41.539 --> 00:49:44.419
We are at a point, we can call it, we are resurrected.

00:49:44.579 --> 00:49:47.859
We have to resurrect the whole world, that's our job,

00:49:48.059 --> 00:49:51.379
so that all these fights, all these quarrels,

00:49:51.539 --> 00:49:55.899
all these falsehoods will just be finished.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:59.779
For us, Christ is our leader, who has done this for us.

00:49:59.939 --> 00:50:01.699
He came as an ordinary human being,

00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:03.779
lived like an ordinary human being,

00:50:03.939 --> 00:50:06.339
with all these powers within Him.

00:50:06.499 --> 00:50:08.779
He never used them to destroy.

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:13.699
In the same way, we can also with love and affection,

00:50:13.859 --> 00:50:18.659
we can also really come out of our deaths,

00:50:18.819 --> 00:50:21.059
come out of our misgivings,

00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:24.539
come out of our destructive nature.

00:50:24.699 --> 00:50:31.059
This destructive nature is the most dangerous thing for Yogis.

00:50:31.219 --> 00:50:37.779
That's the only hope we have, that Sahaja Yogis are resurrected.

00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:42.259
Only thing I know is that,

00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:47.219
if we have so many Sahaja Yogis, this world will change.

00:50:47.379 --> 00:50:49.059
This world has to change.

00:50:49.219 --> 00:50:51.539
But your progress should go on,

00:50:51.699 --> 00:50:56.339
you should progress more and more, not you should not regress back.

00:50:56.499 --> 00:50:59.219
For small things here and there, don't worry!

00:50:59.379 --> 00:51:02.139
You have a very great responsibility,

00:51:02.299 --> 00:51:07.619
and that responsibility is to transform the human beings.

00:51:07.779 --> 00:51:12.699
That's your due. How many have you transformed?

00:51:12.859 --> 00:51:18.059
How many have you changed? It's all right for men or women.

00:51:18.219 --> 00:51:21.379
You have to change people, this is your job

00:51:21.539 --> 00:51:25.059
and this is the power you have got from Christ,

00:51:25.219 --> 00:51:28.379
that you have to change them, transform them

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:31.939
into the new world of happiness and joy

00:51:32.139 --> 00:51:38.379
which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma.

00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:42.219
If it works out, if it really works out,

00:51:42.379 --> 00:51:47.099
think of the world, how beautiful it will become for us!

00:51:47.259 --> 00:51:49.859
It's the duty of every Sahaja Yogi

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:55.139
to go into this kind of a new venture

00:51:55.299 --> 00:52:00.379
and try to find out how many people he can convert

00:52:00.539 --> 00:52:03.459
and how many people he can bring round.

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:07.379
I hope next time we'll have doubled the number of people

00:52:07.539 --> 00:52:11.699
that are here from all these eight countries who are hosting now.

00:52:11.859 --> 00:52:14.179
All My love to you all.

00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:18.819
Great days are waiting us.

00:52:18.979 --> 00:52:24.699
We have to now understand only our responsibility.

00:52:24.859 --> 00:52:28.379
Main thing is how many people we have converted,

00:52:28.539 --> 00:52:30.899
how many people we have resurrected.

00:52:31.059 --> 00:52:33.699
That is the record, not what,

00:52:33.859 --> 00:52:36.099
how many Pujas you have attended and all that.

00:52:36.259 --> 00:52:37.539
It's not so important.

00:52:37.699 --> 00:52:41.179
Pujas are just to give you strength and to give you power,

00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:45.379
but they are not your work. That's not your work.

00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:47.899
For your work, you can take from Pujas

00:52:48.059 --> 00:52:49.779
all the strength that you need.

00:52:49.939 --> 00:52:55.299
But if you don't use this power, then what's the use?

00:52:55.779 --> 00:52:58.419
So now, I leave it to you to remember

00:52:58.579 --> 00:53:02.339
that you are resurrected and you have to resurrect others.

00:53:02.499 --> 00:53:04.779
It's a very, very important job

00:53:04.939 --> 00:53:09.459
at this time of complete turmoil and destruction.

00:53:09.459 --> 00:53:12.299
May God bless you!
