00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:27.040
At the very outset we have to know that truth is
what it is.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.600
We cannot change it,

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.940
we cannot transform it

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:37.960
and we cannot know the absolute truth
at this human awareness

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:43.940
So we have to become something subtler

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.440
As Christ has said you are to be born again

00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:50.320
Doesn’t mean we can brand ourselves as born again

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:57.540
but is a happening of becoming something else than what you are.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.660
And that something else is the Spirit

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:04.460
So whatever we are going to tell you today

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.040
about this mechanism within you

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.240
and the way you reveal the truth

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.720
you should not accept it

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.220
with blind faith

00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.420
but as scientists keep your mind open

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.400
Take it as a hypothesis

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:35.980
If you think it is all right

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:41.900
when you have experimented with it and you have experimented

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.060
and whatever I say comes true

00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:47.100
then as honest people you have to accept it

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.980
because this is for your benevolence

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.800
for the benevolence of your country

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.240
and the whole universe at large

00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.540
It is to be understood

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.640
that we are created as human beings from amoeba to this stage

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.780
it’s not the ultimate.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.980
If it was there would have been all these problems not created by us

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:20.120
Start from ecology, to political, to economic, to all these problems; are the creation of human beings.

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.920
So we have missed some point somewhere

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:25.160
that’s what we have to find out

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:27.400
what is that we have to be

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:37.580
If you look at the development
of the civilization, of this modern civilization,

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:41.800
you can easily find out that we have really outgrown ourselves

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.900
without any sense of proportion and limitation

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:49.160
As a result even in science we have discovered

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:56.240
horrible things like atom bomb, hydrogen bomb; all these horrible things which are just destructive

00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.540
So somehow or other, whatever we try

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:04.920
whatever is the mental projection of human beings
it boomerangs back.

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.760
Whatever we go up to a point, comes back to you

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.860
and is destructive.

00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:21.580
So what is the reason why we cannot reach that point where we are at the best and then stop there?

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:29.240
This cannot be worked out because at a human level we always go to extremes.

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:35.940
To understand yourself first of all you have to become the Spirit

00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:38.160
We do not understand ourselves

00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:41.200
We think we know ourselves; this is not true

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.420
Because we are made up of these seven centers which are subtle within you

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:51.000
and unless and until you know about these centers you cannot know yourself

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.880
and you cannot know others as well.

00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.300
Now then many people who are fed-up and are seekers

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:08.580
I mean this is a special category of people as William Blake has said that, there will be men of God

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:14.920
who will become Godly, and make others also Godly.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.680
These are the seekers.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.480
Seekers which are trying to find out why

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:23.920
when we have done everything that is prescribed

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:27.740
we have acted according to what is written down

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.740
still why is it we haven’t got the satisfaction
and the joy of life

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.720
which has been promised?

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:36.640
here is nothing wrong with Bible;

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.620
there is nothing wrong with Koran

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.160
nothing wrong with all these great books, no doubt.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:48.820
But why it is not going into our heart? It’s all mental.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.520
When we read about Koran, I am surprised

01:00:51.640 --> 01:01:00.420
I was reading a book about Koran written by some intellectuals like this Christian Science or even other books in Indian philosophies

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.660
is all a mental process.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.540
Adi Shankaracharya has called his as [unclear sounds like: “Subkajalum”]

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.680
meaning: the net of words.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.500
You get lost in the net of words

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:12.820
But there is no experience of it

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.880
and that’s why whatever we may follow. We like to follow

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.720
Everything that is given to us: all right, follow this, follow that, follow that, follow that, and then what?

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.400
Anybody who follows any religion

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.760
ny religion whatsoever which are absolutely all right

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:32.500
can commit any mistake, so they don’t follow actually.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:36.240
That shows that it has not gone inside them

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:41.580
It’s not ingrained; it’s not innate with their being

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:46.020
So what is the reason why we cannot have it?

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.300
Those who were saints in any country;

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:58.840
take it Lao-Tse, you can take from Socrates onward this side Mohammedsahab, Nanaksahab

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.580
all of these people.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.480
You’ll be amazed to find

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.320
that all these people behaved in such a manner

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.900
that we cannot find faults with them

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.280
I mean if you want to find, you may with your ignorance

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.240
But the kind of life they led; how is it that they were like that? What was so great?

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.620
It was the Divinity which expressed.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.940
While we all have this Divinity within ourselves,

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.240
we have all these powers within ourselves,

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:35.180
, only thing, we have to use those powers, we have to manifest them

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:40.500
and for that manifestation it is important that we have to become self-realized

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:44.280
in the sense that you have to get your second birth.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.980
In Sanskrit language

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.960
for a realized soul they use a word called Vijaha, means twice born.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.560
And also for a bird, they call it the word Vijaha meaning twice born

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.820
first is the egg and then it becomes a bird.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.000
So our freedom is also limited.

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:14.280
We do not have full freedom because we lack in our confidence in our wisdom

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:22.440
because the wisdom has also not manifested and has not shown us how it asserts in the right way,

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:30.020
so most of the time we are living in the relative world, not in the absolute world.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.520
What one has to understand that there is something missing and that missing point we have to find out

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760
Now let’s see what is the truth?

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:53.060
The truth is, the first and foremost truth is, that there is an all-pervading power of God’s Love,

01:03:54.440 --> 01:04:01.700
which is called as Brahmachaitanya in Sanskrit, Rue in Koran and in every, every scripture it is described.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.300
Now this all-pervading power resides, which does all the living work.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:12.540
We see beautiful flowers all over,I saw the beautiful trees you have in the Botanical Garden

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.720
you have such nice things there

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:20.240
we never even think how this miracle has taken place

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.900
how this Mother Earth has done this job

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:29.120
How she got this power to sprout a seed?

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:34.160
We just accept it. We don’t think it’s a miracle, we just accept it

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.180
and without thinking about it, it becomes just a part and parcel of our life.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:47.700
Look at your eyes. Your eyes
are also absolutely a miracle

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.240
they are such a camera. Look at your brain; it’s such a computer

01:04:52.440 --> 01:05:00.780
but we just accept it, accept our human life also
just as if it’s nothing great.

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.560
Even the miracle to become from amoeba to human beings

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:08.520
by any law of chance you would not
have become a human being

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.140
But we just accept it

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.280
and we don’t want to think that there could be
any power that could have achieved it

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:22.740
This is what one has to little bit project, and see for yourself

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:27.680
that there must some power and if I say there is a power you have to feel it

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520
we have to know it.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.400
The second truth is that you are not this body

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.160
you are not this mind

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.560
you are not these conditionings, Ego, and your emotions,

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.680
no, you are the pure Spirit.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.680
This is the fact. That is the Divinity within you

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.760
Unless and until you become that

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.800
no use reading books; by reading books you become fundamentalist

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:03.280
Absolutely fundamentalism has the basis in the books, because the book said so; so I say so.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:10.400
Everybody tries to read the books and just want to use it as a norm for oneself; is not true.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.860
Whatever is written in the book, whatever you have read in the book has not gone inside your heart

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.320
and so there is a problem that today we are having the first problem

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:28.300
not so much of political because thanks to Gorbechev who is another realized soul, that one problem is over

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.040
the second problem is of fundamentalism.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:37.140
We look at the Islam as if they are Moslems.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.480
Moslems and Islam are very different,
as Christ and Christians are.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:50.840
One has to understand that the life of Christ was of sacrifice and great penance for us

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.340
He did such a great penance for us.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:07:00.040
But what about the Christians; they went all over the world to conquer everything and to kill so many people.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:03.280
How can they be the people who are following Christ

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.900
without any compassion, without any mercy?

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:12.980
Same about Hinduism when it is said that in everybody’s heart resides the Spirit.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.520
If so then how can you have caste system?

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.160
How can you justify caste system?

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.060
But caste system is very strong among them

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:31.660
and they will also become fundamentalist if they just follow what ever written in the Purannas or in their scriptures

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:39.880
So this is what we are now, after this political and also economical things that we had on our heads

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:43.580
now it is coming to fundamentalism
and it is taking charge.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:50.160
I was amazed to read in the newspaper that now many Christians are leaving the church

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.320
and joining Islam and Buddhism

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.660
It’s nonsense. It’s just the same. What is the difference?

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:06.000
Going from as they say that: from one end to another end, reaching nowhere

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:11.520
And that is what one has to understand, that the religion is within us. It is like a valency.

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.540
As carbon has four valencies, we have ten valencies,

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.900
which are, we know as the Ten Commandments

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.940
Unless and until they are awakened within us

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.900
unless and until we become innately enlightened by them

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:37.340
we cannot, cannot behave in the manner that the scriptures wanted us to behave

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.580
but not only that

01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:58.440
Religion that is within us when it is enlightened, you become absolutely aware

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:01.440
of what the mistake people have been committing

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.280
what the mistake you have been committing

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.600
and that this God’s love how it works.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.320
Also you become a witness; witness of the whole play

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.500
When the Kundalini goes through this centre of Agnya

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:27.020
you just become a witness. You start seeing the whole thing as a drama.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:31.520
If you are standing in the water
and there are waves in the sea,

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:38.400
they come up and go and
you are frightened of getting drowned

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:44.760
but supposing you are in a boat then you enjoy the waves and supposing you know how to swim

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.340
you can jump back and get so many people on the boat

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:56.920
This is what happens to you that when you get your realization you reach a state of self-awareness

01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:04.660
meaning not selfishness but the awareness of these centers, awareness of your self, and awareness of others also

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.420
You can feel the centers of others on your fingertips, so you become collectively conscious

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.860
Then who is the other? You can feel anyone on your centers so easily.

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:23.200
It’s a fact that through this Kundalini awakening many people have been cured automatically

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:27.940
by your own power , which is there, residual,
waiting for you.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:31.280
Because wh en She passes through these centers

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.720
She penetrates through them

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.580
and She puts them right

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:39.060
For example supposing, this is the left and the right side and we are using too much of right side,

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.560
then it is pulled on this side and the centers become very constricted

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:50.780
But supposing the Kundalini passes through them, She puts them right like this and nourishes them.

01:10:50.980 --> 01:11:01.480
Now cancer is caused when this union is broken like this by some sort of a jerk.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:07.800
Now supposing the Kundalini can go through this and this like this because She understands everything

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:12.300
then cancer can be cured and we have done that

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:22.280
There are three doctors in Delhi University who have got their MD after doing MBBS through Sahaja Yoga

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.820
One of them is blood cancer subject,

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:33.200
another I think is epilepsy and
the third, third one, is asthma.

01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:38.620
These three doctors have got their MD in Delhi University

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.720
and we know of many cases which have been cured.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:47.140
So now not only the health;
also the mental [sounds like: health]

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:56.800
People are really these days under stress with schizophrenia all kinds of mental problems.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:06.360
Most of them can be cured if you really get your realization and fix your connection with this all-pervading power.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:15.040
If it is fixed then you don’t have to go to doctors, you don’t have to take to medicines

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.060
and you yourself can diagnose people and you can cure people

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:27.260
But first you have to get to your self and establish your connections with this all-pervading power

01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:38.120
so that you become collectively conscious and you can definitely help anyone who needs help from you.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.840
The third thing that happens to you is very interesting that you

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.780
, you become the joy. You become the source of joy.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.860
Joy is not happiness and unhappiness

01:12:55.180 --> 01:13:00.500
but joy is an absolute thing and you jump into the ocean of joy

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:07.340
And when you jump into the ocean of joy you just start enjoying everything

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.960
and the state that you achieve is first is thoughtless awareness

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.420
You are aware but without any thoughts. The thoughts will not bombard you.

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.720
If you want to think you can think but if you don’t want to think you can stop it.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:28.700
So the thoughtless awareness comes to you as a blessing first

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:34.260
and then the second awareness is called as the doubtless awareness.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:41.320
This is all described in the Hatha Yoga that you get into Nirvichar Samadhi and then Nirvikulpa Samadhi.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:48.800
This old science is not only from India it comes from everywhere as I told you

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:58.200
Confucius knew this, Socrates knew this and also many people like William Blake, and C.S. Lewis all these people knew about it

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:03.620
but nobody could put it through to people because I think people did not want to accept it.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:09.540
Like Kabir has said how am I to explain when everybody is blind?

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.180
He was quite frustrated about it

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:17.800
but today we have so many people who are really seeking honestly the truth

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:21.740
and they would like to find it out and it is a remarkable thing

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.980
that so much is happening even in Christchurch.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:30.520
I am very happy to come to Christchurch to see that you still have lots of English traditions.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:36.460
. I have known England for so many years and it has so much changed now in this like twenty-five years.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.780
It’s all gone into another kind of a wasteland

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:46.900
I think the way people are lost into the maze of this modernism, hippyism

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.240
all kinds of funny things going on there and I don’t know what will happen to it if it doesn’t stop

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:57.320
For about twenty years what will be the situation of England?

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:06.180
In the beginning I had to work on
about seven Sahaja Yogis

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:11.660
who were hippies actually, and I took four years to give them realization.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.300
So I said the English have hard nuts but once the nuts are broken they are very good Sahaja Yogis

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:23.820
but immediately after that they went to libraries and to all the places and they found out everything
about Kundalini

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:29.140
they’re very scholarly. They were all professors and teachers, very well educated, scientists;

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
they all had become hippies you see.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.440
Some sort of a fashion of hippyism started; they all had become hippies. Can you imagine

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.440
a professor of physics in Cambridge University was one of them and he was an Australian

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.920
but I don’t know, he is lost after that because they said he is no more. He was quite an old gentleman

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.720
he came here and I think he is no more.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.900
. Whatever it is but it was quite a hard time for me

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:59.400
but I found out that they were very, very, good Sahaja Yogis and they are the foundation of Sahaja Yoga in the Western countries.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:05.860
It can work out very well but we have to understand that we are seekers of truth

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.980
and honestly if you are seeking the truth we should keep our minds open

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.560
Of course you can’t pay for it
because it is a living process.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.020
You cannot pay for living processes anyway.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:21.200
See the Mother Earth: how much do we pay to her for giving us these flowers?

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.260
How much do we pay to our heart for pulsating?

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.660
How much do we pay to our intestines for digesting our food?

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.600
It’s all done free. In the same way this has to be absolutely free.

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:41.700
Another reason why religions have failed because they are either money oriented or power oriented

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.580
They are not Spirit oriented.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:50.460
So because of that you should not blame them
but it was a wrong deviated line they took and that’s why it has failed

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:55.780
Now as it is, I am here only for one day.

01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:01.220
I am happy Brian has agreed to be here and he is going to work out something I am sure.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:11.440
I would of course like you to ask me some questions if you have before we start our self-realization

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.860
But of course we cannot force it on anyone. It cannot be forced.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.300
It has to be asked for. It cannot be done by force.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:26.000
So if you have any questions you can ask me and I am quite good at it I must tell you.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.280
For the last twenty-two years I have been doing this job of just answering questions

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:40.100
but this is just a mental feat and this mental feat is not going to guarantee your awakening

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:48.200
but if you have any questions you better ask otherwise at the time of Kundalini awakening your mind will come and tell you, oh you didn’t ask this question.

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.280
I don’t know throat has gone out today. I’ve been speaking everyday for hours.

01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:14.500
What happens, Shri Mataji, if you have realization without understanding all about chakras and the subtle energy system?

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:22.040
That’s the best, if you could do. I mean see, now there are so many lights here

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.580
and if you have to put on the light you just have to go switch on, finished.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:33.360
But those who don’t believe in it you have to say there are lights, you see this electricity was discovered at this time

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.460
you have to talk of all these things.

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.020
There is no need at all, you can just put on, because it is all built in, it is all built in within you.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.900
There is no need at all to know about chakras or anything

01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:50.360
but later on when you have to talk to others, because you can’t enjoy it yourself you have to give it to others

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.920
Look at me. I don’t need Sahaja Yoga but I am traveling at this old age all over the world.

01:18:55.940 --> 01:19:03.240
So you can’t, you see, help it. It’s like capitalist like me

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:08.820
who has the powers and can’t live without giving like a real communist.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:12.040
I am going around the whole world you see so you won’t be able to rest.

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.060
So then you have to know about these things, but for getting realization you need not know.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.100
At all

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.340
You mentioned quite a lot about the spirit, Shri Mataji, but nothing about the soul.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.880
Spirit and soul. You see in this small lecture how many things can I tell you?

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:49.800
But spirit is the one which is enveloped by the subtle causals of elements which have made this body. That becomes the soul.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:18.380
God says we must live abundantly. What is your attitude, Shri Mataji, about money which is necessary to abundance?

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.680
Of course you will have; lot of it.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:36.340
So many people have got it and some of them did get lost because it is a temptation also

01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:43.040
but I have seen people say who were taking drugs, this that, they were completely cured.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.500
Their attention is all right, they have started working, they are getting good jobs

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:55.420
so you see once you are a normal person and
all your capacities are expressing

01:20:55.420 --> 01:21:01.920
Like there some artists who came to Sahaja Yoga and now they are world famous artists.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.440
In India lots of them are world famous

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.560
and some of them were Muslims and they are world famous today making, minting money.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.560
Is there a connection between the body and the spirit? Are they connected or are they separate?

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:31.320
No, connection in the same
way as a mirror has the reflection

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:41.900
Body is the reflector of the spirit. Without the body you cannot have spirit

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:54.860
and if you have the spirit which is enveloped as I said in a soul that also contains a kind of a body in the [unclear…] in a subtler way.

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.520
So the spirit can only be expressed in a body.

01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:09.320
Do you put more emphasis on the spirit side of things than the soul side of things?

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.140
Of course.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:18.240
Soul is not so important because you see those people who have, everybody can have a soul

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:22.140
say a criminal can have a soul, a person who is frustrated in life

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.740
when they die
the soul comes out you see.

01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:30.820
So depends on the person what sort of a person he is, what sort of a soul he has

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:37.160
But supposing if you get your spirit, means your spirit shines in your attention

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.960
means all your elements are enlightened and you are an enlightened soul.

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.480
So There are two types of souls we can say, minimum.

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.880
One is enlightened, one is unenlightened

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:50.520
but among the unenlightened there could be criminals, there could be horrible people

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:58.800
could be very, very horrible people some of them hang in the limbo I think and some of them hang around us also sometimes to possess us.

01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:07.100
What are your views, Shri Mataji, on reincarnation?

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:14.520
Oh reincarnation is only possible
for the great souls or absolutely devils

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:17.240
is not done for young people

01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:25.000
You see sometimes I hear that people had said about their previous lives and all that but it is a possession;

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:30.640
it is a possession of some spirit which is hanging around, takes over and talks.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:37.420
But that’s not any reincarnation means the same soul coming in developing into another.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:40.840
That’s only possible if you are a realized soul

01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:51.400
or if you are a saint, you are a prophet, or if you are an incarnation or if you are a devil

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.980
one of the two things

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.600
Where do animals come into all this, Mother?

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:04.680
Animals are under the bondage of God you see

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:08.220
so they haven’t got the freedom as we have.

01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.360
A tiger will be a tiger, a lion a tiger, a snake will be a snake

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.960
but human beings you cannot say.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.840
They can be a tiger at the same time
they can be a snake

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.660
They have the freedom to be anything.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:36.220
Reincarnation you said, Shri Mataji, was for the great souls. What happens to the rest of us?

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.300
Why are you worried so much about this, the future?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.500
You have to be in the present. Future doesn’t exist, you see

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.500
and we should not waste our time
about the future so much.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.760
What we should think about the present
because that is the reality.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.120
In the present you exist and in the present
only you can grow in your spirituality.

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:05.340
When you are meditating, you get into this
state of thoughtless awareness

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:13.120
because one thought is from the say from the future, maybe another from the past, it comes and falls

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.440
again another thought comes and falls

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.820
and we are jumping on the cusp of these, either future or past.

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:28.500
But there is a space in between two thoughts. That is the thought, that is the time that you are in the present

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:34.080
and with realization that space starts increasing and when you are thoughtlessly aware

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.840
means you are in the present

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.460
Then your memory becomes so clear cut, like a photogenic memory.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:45.360
You are in the present, you see someone, you see someplace, anything,

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:51.620
it just goes into your mind like a photo.

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.700
Whenever you want you can think of it.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.360
I mean you really become so dynamic with that because you live in the present

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.740
In every way you become extremely alert

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.520
and immediately you understand
the depth of every problem

01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:08.120
It’s a very different human being you become

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:13.960
that people start [unclear sounds like: “wanting to”] understanding that how this man has come so intelligent

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.320
Actually it’s not the intelligence

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:23.980
but that state where your intelligence becomes so expressive, so manifesting and so absorbing

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.560
Some people have an understanding
and a feeling on the chakras

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:48.720
Does one have to have that feeling
to understand them to develop?

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:57.700
Have you got to understand the feelings
that come from the chakras at all?

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.400
Not at all, you don’t feel anything;
you just feel it on the finger tips
if you are a realized soul

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:07.100
but maybe, if you are going to
some wrong type of people

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.180
they enter into you through your sympathetic
and then maybe.

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:17.360
Like they will make you stand on your head, do this, do that, jump and do all kinds of things,

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:20.580
say mantras this that and then
they are on the sympathetic,

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.220
that is on these two things, left and right.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:27.640
Like TM for example, take for TM

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.000
TM now is one of the most dangerous things I think

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:38.880
because we had one gentleman, long time back, from a place called [unclear sounds like:Ronock] near Scotland

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:45.500
He was the director of the flying academy, director.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:50.900
His wife was the grand-daughter of a duke, he was himself was a diamond merchant

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:57.400
and he had a friend who was his deputy director also very rich man and the daughter

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.260
All of them got epilepsy. They came to us
and we had to cure

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:08.080
When we cured them they told us the whole story.
Is horrible story about it.

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:11.840
You see they are all epileptic, absolutely suffering

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.520
and they went to a doctor then he came and asked Me how did you cure these people?

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:20.960
So what they do is to give you some sort of a mantra.

01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:26.060
Now the first thing is three thousand pounds they had to pay to get a mantra.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.260
The mantras were to begin with were three very funny ones.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.886
This gentleman, this so-called Maharishi,

01:28:32.886 --> 01:28:34.920
This gentleman, this so-called Maharishi,
doesn’t know a word of Sanskrit.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.780
He gave them three mantras.
One was inga, pinga and tinga

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.960
these three mantras he gave them.

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:47.480
Now inga means, not in Sanskrit but in local languages, means the scorpion bite.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.520
The pinga means when you get possessed
you go round and round

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.220
and tinga means when you show somebody like this. Now what do you see?

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.360
And they are going on and on and on

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.460
and concentrate and concentrate

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:02.820
and keep the husband separate and
the wife separate and all that and they develop

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.500
all kinds of funny things, very unnatural

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:10.100
And when you go on concentrating on anything you see this center gets spoilt

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.780
They all got possessed

01:29:11.780 --> 01:29:13.460
All got possessed

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.860
After that they had a program for seven days

01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:22.160
for meditation in some remote hotel in Switzerland

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:27.660
where they asked them to sit on some foams and jump

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.120
They all broke their bottoms you know

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:36.480
and they also filed suits against them and they got money, in America there is a case like that

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.720
But this gentleman, you see very nicely told them that you have to be very light.

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:47.260
For that you have to take a course,
of some sort of a diet,

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:53.480
in which they had to have for six days
the water that has boiled some potatoes

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.600
and the seventh day some rind

01:29:55.660 --> 01:30:00.120
and the eighth day they have to take the potatoes

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:04.540
Can you imagine? And they paid six thousand pounds for that kind of a nonsense

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:12.020
But why do, people are stupid also, why do they want to fly about three feet higher, what is the need?

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:17.840
What is the saving in that? I mean imagine already we are having traffic problems and this.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:24.240
It is also complete stupidity on the part of
the people who are seekers

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:26.880
who are seeking to fly about three feet high.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:29.160
What are you seeking? One should know.

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.640
What are we asking for?

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.680
That’s how things have been going on.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:37.840
I mean I am just giving you one example.
There are thousand and one.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:39.160
Thank God most of them are exposed

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.340
and this TM is also exposed very much in Europe
but it has not come up here I think

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.480
They will have to send all the pamphlets out

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:53.920
He smuggled from Philippines lots of drugs for people

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:55.920
It started with the drugs

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.440
It’s a fact.

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.740
And this is what it is. What are we seeking?

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.920
Whatever they promised why should we go there?

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.640
We should find out what are the disciples doing.
Where are they?

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.160
Most of them are recluses

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:21.460
Just go and see. They can’t even see a garlic. If you show them a garlic or a lemon they will run away

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:24.500
Most of them are like that

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.120
because of what he does, he puts
some sort of a spirit on them.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:33.400
That’s what is called as [unclear sounds like: “pretavidya”] we call it.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.780
Is the science of the dead and
then they use those dead spirits on them

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.400
and on one personality there are
two or three spirits sitting

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:49.340
so such a person for the time being becomes over-active and then is lost completely.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:01.680
It’s a very interesting thing that people don’t know
what they are seeking.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:13.960
There was Rajneesh who was buying Rolls-Royces.
Why should any Divine person care for a Rolls, I just don’t understand.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.480
Why should they? Rolls-Royce, buying so many Rolls-Royces

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:24.260
and then another 14 year old fellow buying Rolls-Royces; for such a person they should be put to the dust of his feet

01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:27.700
Somehow or another I was born in a very rich family

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.540
and also My husband is very well to do and all that

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.960
but I never care for anything like that

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:38.780
I can sleep here, I can sleep on the street,
I can sleep anywhere, I have no problems

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.920
On the contrary if there is too much comfort I don’t like it.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:48.360
I prefer my comfort of my spirit.
This is happening to the Sahaja Yogis also.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:54.920
Apart from that a great society has been created, a great society just like angels

01:32:55.580 --> 01:33:01.400
We have people from all over the world, especially sixty-two countries Sahaja Yoga is working

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.360
Out of that at least fifty-two we have good centers, especially in Australia we have many

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:11.900
and if you see them, they are so beautiful, so angelic

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:20.860
I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting except for some places where some spirits have entered or some sort of a sabotage has been done

01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.780
most of them are beautiful people.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:32.540
So why not have that beautiful life and that promised society which is so kind and nice?

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.960
We do not have these problems of marriages,

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:40.400
we don’t have problems of children, we don’t have all these problems at all that you are facing;

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.640
beautiful families, beautiful relationships
all over the world, imagine.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:53.080
The best are Russians, you will be surprised, apart from Indians of course, because Indians have this background,

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.000
but best are Russians

01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:07.140
In one village, [spelling : Taliati]
I had there told 22,000 Sahaja Yoga practicing and

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:18.320
the embassy in, this Russian Embassy in India wants to honour me, and Gorbechev wants to meet me

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:20.740
can you imagine, how sensitive they are

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:26.620
because they didn’t have these conditionings, they are not materialistic people, they are very good seekers

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:34.840
There are about thirty, forty percent who are not, who are just doing menial works but most of them are scientists

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.800
this that, and I was surprised the scientists, two hundred scientists,

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:45.960
one of them who was the sputnik man, invited Me for their science conference

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:49.440
and when I started talking about science they said Mother don’t talk about science

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.540
let us know about spirit, don’t want to hear, we have had enough of science;

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.200
uch sensitivity they had.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:04.580
Just with my photograph,
I don’t know how they can recognize.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:12.380
They are very introspective. Even if you read Tolstoy, or any of those writers, they are very introspective.

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:18.160
When their heroes are introspective they do not take things for granted, they don’t think end of themselves, nothing.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.500
They are never in a fool’s paradise, I have seen.

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:25.140
They try to see what’s wrong with me, why am I doing this? It’s very interesting.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:33.740
Have you read Crime and Punishment? Isn’t it so, with the hero? It’s very interesting.

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:44.520
They have had the best writers, scholars, musicians, dancers, all kinds of things they had

01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:49.040
ut still they are very humble; very, very humble. Even their media is so humble

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:57.440
They said, Mother we are nowhere in spirituality, how do you say we are sensitive to spirituality? Such humble people they are

01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:02.320
extremely humble. No arrogance, no arrogance at all.

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:09.380
Yes, there is some question.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:40.740
The essence of this question I think is, Shri Mother, at the separation at the time of death

01:36:40.820 --> 01:36:47.580
at the separation of the spirit and the body, what happens? What happens to the spirit?

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:52.640
Again, you all seem to be quite
infatuated by death I think.

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:57.020
You see when you are a realized soul

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:05.540
then what happens you see that it is just another dress that you have to change

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.520
You never worry about death. Never

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:15.620
and those who have written about death,
Kabir, has written beautifully.

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:22.780
He says that, when my beloved left me,
means my life, I didn’t cry,

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:26.100
I didn’t say anything, I didn’t fuss

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:32.520
I just asked my friend, I was nicely covered myself with a little sheet and I was lying down

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.100
and just seeing my beloved left me

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.880
He said that all the doors were closed, but I don’t know some window was opened must be the Sahasrara,

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.140
was opened, because he was a realized soul,
so the life went through that.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:52.180
So you see the thing is this problem is always haunt you when you are not a realized soul

01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:54.520
Be so much worried about death

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:58.400
but after that you will know that death
is just a change of life

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:00.860
it’s just a change of life.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:05.200
Then whenever you want to take your birth
you can take if you are a realized soul

01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:11.660
but if you are not, I have told you, you may possess someone, or you may hang in the limbo,
I don’t know whenever

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:17.080
Some people take birth just after thirteen fourteen days, again into another nonsensical place.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.920
Whatever you’ll earn now will show
at the time of your death

01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:33.440
but if you are not earn any good deeds
you call it, punyas,

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.620
then it will show at the time of your death
whether you go to hell or to heaven

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.940
It is your choice, is your freedom. What do you want?

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:49.280
You want to go to hell or to heaven is your own choice and your own discretion. That’s very important.

01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:02.840
He wants to know what your thoughts are
on the teachings of Maharishi?

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:07.480
I have already told you, this Maharishi TM fellow, about him I’ve already told you

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:12.680
Horrible what is he teaching? Nothing. What is he teaching? He is incapable

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.640
he is not a learned man, no way, nothing at all,

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:21.480
and he has no sense, he has no sense of
culture or anything

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:26.260
He was actually used to giggle at people because he thought he was nicely befooling everybody

01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:28.200
and so he was called as the giggly guru

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.540
He used to giggle at people because they were all befooled and so he used to giggle at them

01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:36.400
What is his bona fide?

01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.660
He was a ticket collector, did all kinds of wrong things.

01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:55.620
Shri Mataji, what is the best quality we can develop to gain our self-realization?

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:57.300
God’s realization

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.620
That you will know gradually.
You can develop all that, is very nice

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.720
After sometime, like a drop becomes the ocean, you become the ocean that’s all

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:14.280
That’s a good idea, about the future, instead of death.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:21.960
All right, now I think we should have
our self-realization, all of us.

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.820
I have to tell you one thing

01:40:46.980 --> 01:40:51.620
that, I can not force it on you, I respect your freedom

01:40:51.820 --> 01:40:55.400
so, Those who do not want to have self-realization should leave the hall.

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.360
They should not sit down and watch others.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:00.040
The second thing is important

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.800
that you all have to have full confidence in yourself that you will get your self-realization

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.840
Nobody should think that how can I get it,
this and that, nothing of the kind.

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:15.420
I assure you will be in the present;
you’ll be just in the present

01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:21.520
and know that you all are capable of getting
your self-realization. No doubt about it.

01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:31.140
This is one condition; the second condition
is that you have to forgive everyone,

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.220
without thinking about them.
Now for some people it is very difficult to forgive

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:43.440
but logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. What do you do? Nothing

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:47.920
It’s just a mental idea that I don’t forgive.
But as a result of that

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:51.740
as a result of that what happens;
you play into wrong hands.

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.560
Those who have troubled you, tortured you, now you are torturing yourself while they are very happy.

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:01.880
So what’s the use of remembering such people?

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.440
You don’t even have to remember them

01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:06.860
you have to just say in your heart with full faith in yourself

01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:12.200
that I forgive everyone, everyone, in general.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:22.120
The third condition is that none of you should
feel guilty at all at this moment. Forget the past.

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.680
At this moment forget the past

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.520
not to feel guilty.

01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:33.320
This is another thing that has happened to us by conditioning, that we should feel guilty for everything

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:36.200
we should confess. Nothing of the kind, there’s no need

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.020
after all you are human beings and
only human beings can do mistakes

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:46.360
How can you not do mistakes, after all you are human beings.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.720
You are not Gods, you are not realized souls, so doesn’t matter

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:56.720
So don’t feel guilty at all. Please if you are feeling guilty, is also physically very wrong

01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:06.780
because this centre here between, in the corner of your shoulder and your neck, here

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:12.280
you get a catch of this left Vishuddhi we call it;
the left side of the center

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:22.400
As a result you get angina, or you may get spondillitis, or you may get very lethargic organs on the left hand side

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:28.100
So is very important not to feel guilty, because this is also mental idea I am feeling guilty

01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.480
Who has told you, you are guilty?
No judge has told you. Why do you feel guilty?

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.060
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:39.200
For that you should be really pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:46.080
In short you all have to be respectful, loving toward yourself and will be the best for Me.

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:52.020
So these are three conditions which are very simple
and they are just your mental attitudes

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.820
which must be, at this moment,
must not be used. That’s all.

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:07.300
So now we’ll show you how you have to do the nourishing of your centers.

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.520
It is absolutely spontaneous,
and doesn’t need much effort,

01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:18.320
but I just want to show you the different centers on the left hand side, how you can nourish it.

01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.760
This has to be done only once.
You don’t have to repeat it again and again.

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:28.520
Now please take out your shoes if possible, because this Mother Earth helps us a lot to suck in our problems.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.520
Please take out your shoes.

01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:53.660
You have seen these Australians singing Indian songs and one of them is a song sung

01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:57.480
about sixteenth century,
you see sixteenth century they are singing,

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:04.060
which says in the last one, that oh Kundalini just rise and let us have the Yoga.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.440
Oh, Mother give us the Yoga, is the one they are talking about; the union with the Divine.

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:11.680
But they just singing all these years,
nothing happens to them

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.020
nor did they think what are we singing about?

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:18.440
So from the sixteenth century, is going on
in the villages of India

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:22.520
Of course this just has given them an understanding, that’s all,

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:28.780
but they are not seeking the Yoga, there is just singing all over in the village.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:36.920
Also they can sing Sanskrit songs. I mean it is not easy thing for Western people to sing Sanskrit

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:39.760
You see the English were in India
for three hundred years

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:44.100
they couldn’t speak one sentence of Hindi language,
it’s so difficult for them.

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:49.380
They used to call it a tongue twister. If Hindi is tongue twister I don’t know what they will call to Sanskrit

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.620
so but now look at these people, how they have become, they sing so well

01:45:53.660 --> 01:46:02.700
in proper melody, in proper rhythm, everything. It’s very surprising in such a short time they have picked it up

01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:07.380
and also the Indians now sing very beautiful
English songs and everything.

01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:11.380
It’s very surprising how it has become so easy for them

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:18.360
All right, so please put your left hand towards me as he will show you, just like this

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:25.340
Now the left is suggestive that
you want to have your realization

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:31.700
because the left side represents your desire, the left side, represents your desire

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:39.600
and you have to use your right hand because this represents the power of action

01:46:39.660 --> 01:46:43.320
the power of desire on the left,
the power of action on the right side

01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:51.740
So you have to use your right hand on the different centers on the left hand side which I will tell you later.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:58.800
Now you have to know that this is a normal
desire which is never fulfilled.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:05.380
You go on jumping from one desire to another and the pure desire is the power of Kundalini.

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:11.080
The pure desire whether you know or not is
to be one with this all-pervading power

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:15.720
So you should have desire within you
that you want to have your self realization.

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.940
That is important because I respect your freedom.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.600
So put your left hand like this and with the right hand we put it on our different centers.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:28.220
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be comfortable,
you have to sit comfortably,

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.280
neither too much slouching or bending behind

01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.900
but you have to sit straight
and put your hand on your heart.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:41.660
First you put on your heart.
In the heart resides the spirit.

01:47:41.820 --> 01:47:44.240
In the heart resides the spirit

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:52.680
So if you become the spirit; you become your own guide, you become your own master.

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:59.680
So you have to put now your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side

01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:04.120
and press it hard. This is the centre of your mastery;

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.840
mastery over the knowledge, the pure knowledge, the true knowledge of the divine laws

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.260
and also you become your own master.

01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:22.000
Now you take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it hard

01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:26.600
and this is the centre of your pure knowledge.

01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:31.520
This knowledge is the one which works through your central nervous system

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:38.840
and gives you ability to work out
the divine power which is flowing through you

01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:46.480
Now you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.680
again on your heart

01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:58.080
now in the angle which is created by
your shoulder and by your neck

01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:05.000
and now put your head to your right, full right.

01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:15.780
All right, now, you have to now take your right hand on top of your forehead

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.600
and bend your head as far as possible

01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:25.860
by putting your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other. Press it hard and put down your head as far as possible.

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:39.980
This is the center where you have to ask,
you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:48.380
Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head,

01:49:48.380 --> 01:50:00.520
and here you have to ask forgiveness from
this Divine power

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.700
without feeling guilty,

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:07.360
without counting your mistakes,
just for your satisfaction

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.740
now the last center

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:13.880
is very important,  stretch your hand, stretch your palm

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.880
put the centre of your palm on top of your head

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.120
now push back your fingers,
so there is a good pressure on your scalp

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.860
Now in the fontanel bone area is the soft bone which you had in your childhood

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:41.980
there you have to put it, the centre of your palm, push back your fingers, put down your head.

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.700
Here now

01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:52.620
you have to move your scalp,
not your hand so much as your scalp

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:56.560
with pressure, seven times clockwise

01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.820
Seven times clockwise

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.460
Slowly.

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:15.200
That’s all we have to do altogether. That’s all.

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.340
Now please remember to push back your fingers,
is important.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:23.360
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:29.200
Please put both your feet apart from each other because these are two powers.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:39.780
If there is anything tight on your neck or in your shoulder you can loosen it.

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:46.520
Now put your left hand towards Me like this, could be on your lap if it is uncomfortable.

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.460
Now

01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:49.760
Please

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.280
put your right hand on your heart

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.700
and now close your eyes.
You can remove your spectacles

01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:04.440
and don’t open your eyes please till I tell you.
Please don’t open till I tell you.

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:12.380
Here now you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself.

01:52:15.140 --> 01:52:20.160
You can call Me mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.640
Now please say it three times

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:32.700
Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question three times within your heart. Mother, am I the spirit?

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:55.480
If you are the spirit, you are your master

01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:02.680
So now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, put your fingers there

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:07.560
and press it hard, not very hard, press it and

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.440
again ask another fundamental question
in your heart, three times

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:15.520
Mother, am I my own master?

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:21.260
Ask with full confidence.

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.160
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:37.500
so I cannot force pure knowledge on you.
You have to ask for it.

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:44.220
So now take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:52.400
Here you have to say six times,
because this centre has got six petals,

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:56.220
Mother, please give me pure knowledge

01:53:56.480 --> 01:54:05.040
Please say this six times, Mother give me please,
pure knowledge. Say it six times.

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:20.620
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,
the Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:26.320
So now we have to nourish
all our upper centers with our self confidence

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:30.500
So now please raise your right hand

01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:40.020
into the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:48.220
Here you have to say with full confidence, with full self confidence, you have to say ten times

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:51.960
Mother, I am my own master.

01:54:52.340 --> 01:55:00.500
Please say with full confidence,
Mother, I am my own master.

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:31.120
I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, this ego, emotions
but you are the pure spirit.

01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:37.480
So now please raise your right hand on your heart, and with full confidence again you have to say

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:41.880
Mother, I am the pure spirit

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:47.220
Please say it with full confidence,
Mother, I am the pure spirit.

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:11.820
This all-pervading power

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:19.480
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.800
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:29.740
and whatever mistakes you might commit can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness

01:56:29.740 --> 01:56:31.700
So please forgive yourself

01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:38.480
and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your right hand

01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.540
as far back as possible

01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:44.820
and now turn your head to your right

01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:50.080
Please don’t feel guilty, this is a centre
very badly catching up,

01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.620
o please don’t feel guilty. Now here
with full confidence you have to say

01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:59.260
sixteen times

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:02.020
Mother, I am not guilty at all

01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:08.660
Please say it with full confidence sixteen times,
Mother, I’m not guilty at all

01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:17.780
Please say it sixteen times with full confidence,
Mother, I am not guilty at all.

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.900
I’ve told you that it is a myth that

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:39.700
you cannot forgive anyone because you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:46.300
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands

01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.760
and it’s very important to forgive at this moment

01:57:50.140 --> 01:57:59.060
because this center is very constricted and if you do not forgive then it won’t open and you lose your chance of self-realization

01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:05.900
As it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving and now you shouldn’t lose your chance of self-realization

01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:17.580
So at this point please take your right hand on top of your forehead, putting fingers on one side and
thumb on the other

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:20.780
nd put down your head as far as possible.

01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:28.160
Here you have to say again with full confidence,
not how many times but from your heart

01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:30.660
from your heart

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:35.020
Mother, I forgive everyone in general,

01:58:35.100 --> 01:58:38.300
Mother I forgive everyone in general

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:46.200
Say it from your heart not how many times

01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:51.420
From your heart you have to say it absolutely
so that this centre opens out.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:16.200
Now take back your right hand to the back side or your head

01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:20.420
Press it hard. Push back your head as far as possible.

01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:29.060
Here without feeling guilty,
without counting your mistakes

01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:35.180
just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart not how many times,

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:42.800
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.

01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:49.520
Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.

01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:55.940
Please say this, from your heart, not how many times.

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:08.660
now

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:17.060
please stretch your hand, stretch your palm, put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:20.980
hich was a soft bone in your childhood, properly

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.420
Now please remember to stretch back your fingers,
is very important.

02:00:25.420 --> 02:00:29.720
If you don’t stretch it back then
it won’t have a proper pressure.

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:31.980
Now put down your head

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:36.820
here again, I cannot force self-realization on you.

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.880
I respect your freedom

02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:47.420
So you have to ask for it. So now
moving your hand seven times, slowly,

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:53.660
you have to say seven times,
Mother, please give me my self realization

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:59.200
Please say it seven times,
Mother please give me my self realization

02:01:56.520 --> 02:02:04.460
Now please take down your hands. Open your eyes and you can put on your glasses

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.360
Now please put both the hands towards Me, like this.

02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:14.180
Now watch Me without thinking

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.920
Just watch Me without thinking

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.420
Now put the right hand towards Me
and put down your head

02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:34.560
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze or a warm breeze, like waves coming out of your head

02:02:34.620 --> 02:02:38.040
Now please put down your head and see for yourself

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:44.660
but don’t put your hand on top of your head but please keep it little away and see for yourself

02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:48.940
Now some people get it also very far,
some people get it here

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:54.240
See if there is a cool breeze like
waves coming in your head.

02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:02.900
Now could be warm also if you
have not forgiven specially

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:09.780
Little bit behind, it is not on top of your head. Keep away, away from, still away, yes so you can see it

02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.620
Now please put the left hand towards Me

02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:15.080
put the left hand towards Me like this.

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:21.380
Now please bend your head again, see with the right hand, now bend it, properly bend it and see for yourself.

02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:25.140
Keep away at least it should be three,
four inches away, so that you can see

02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:30.400
Three inches at least I think,
some people might get it even further

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:35.020
maybe two inches some people,
I don’t know, depends on.

02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:38.000
They didn’t have the right hand towards Me

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:41.880
Now if it is hot then please forgive,
please forgive everyone

02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:48.360
Now put the left hand like this again last time,
with the right hand towards Me

02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:11.060
Now you have to just put all your hands up there and look at the sky and ask a question three times

02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:13.180
anyone of these questions;

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:17.700
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.540
Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God’s love?

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:27.460
Or Mother is this the Brahmachaitanya or the Paramachaitanya?

02:04:27.620 --> 02:04:31.600
Ask any one of these questions three times,
putting up your head.

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.600
Now please take down your hands. Please.

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:56.260
You can put your hands like this,
you will feel the cool, and very relaxed. Just feel

02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:07.060
All those who have felt cool or warm or hot breeze out of their fontanel, or on their fingers or on their hands

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:11.420
please raise both your hands,
please raise both your hands.

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:20.560
No? Just put it like that. Why it should feel.
They are seekers.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.680
Thank God, all of you must. May God bless you

02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:31.640
I bow to you all.
Your saintliness has started now, but look after it.

02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:35.320
Don’t leave it half way. It’s like sprouting of the seed.

02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:40.100
After sprouting it, it must grow into a tree. So respect it

02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:43.840
Thank God we have Brian here, and we have other people

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:49.300
and I hope they’ll be having a good center here
and they’ll be having a follow-on.

02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:55.020
Look after your growth. Next year I’ll be coming again and I hope to meet you all.

02:05:55.420 --> 02:05:58.400
Anything you want to know you can write to me also.

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:07.560
Isn’t it not working, this side? What’s the matter with these three persons? Sure?

02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:12.360
Did you forgive?

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.120
No, no it’s not. It’s from your head it’s coming out

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:23.380
How can an air conditioner be in the stomach?

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:31.280
Then you’ll start using this, then you will know what it is.

02:06:31.460 --> 02:06:35.300
When you will start enjoying it,
then you will know what it is

02:06:35.300 --> 02:06:36.720
Now better?

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:45.340
You’ve been doing some TM or something? Is it?

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:54.040
There are two people haven’t got it so just
have a look at them and it will be alright

02:06:56.180 --> 02:07:01.980
Can I see you? Come along I would like to meet you let’s see what’s the problem, come along.

02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:08.500
I would like to meet you, yes

02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.000
I would like to meet all of you.
