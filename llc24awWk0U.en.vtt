00:00:36.971 --> 00:00:42.710
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.420
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.494
of Navaratri, and how

00:01:01.843 --> 00:01:09.751
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:15.238
It's not that only She has the powers,

00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:18.327
but you all have the powers

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.536
and you can all work it out.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:28.278
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:38.114
With us the Realization is very important,

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:45.706
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.851
Of course Kundalini is a part,

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:56.172
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:16.419
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:46.357
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

00:02:48.137 --> 00:02:50.745
which is a very important point.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:59.787
Now, all these powers are placed in that chakra.

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:04.888
So, you imagine how many of these powers must be.

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:13.933
And Her powers are expressed through

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:22.969
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:30.994
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:39.861
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:44.346
- all of them are at work all the time -

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:55.277
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:59.733
and connected all the time to the Mother

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:03.521
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.596
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:12.283
so, you can imagine it,

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.139
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:23.829
When this center becomes weak,

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:32.708
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:36.012
Ganas also are weak,

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:43.903
and all the powers that could be exercised,

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:49.122
cannot be done because of this weakness.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:56.095
It's a very subtle center

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:59.693
because it is Mother's center;

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:03.320
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

00:05:04.818 --> 00:05:07.913
It's absolutely impossible.

00:05:08.995 --> 00:05:13.108
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:15.214
then they start understanding

00:05:15.394 --> 00:05:19.770
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:29.006
In the same way, when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:34.434
like Ganas, they realize how much

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:39.440
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

00:05:39.634 --> 00:05:43.443
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.293
So, all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:52.401
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

00:05:54.092 --> 00:05:57.282
That is Her first and foremost nature

00:05:57.511 --> 00:06:00.096
- is to destroy all the negativity

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:07.897
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:15.972
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:23.498
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:29.140
then all kinds of physical problems start

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:33.460
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

00:06:36.193 --> 00:06:41.899
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

00:06:42.616 --> 00:06:45.097
But some of the diseases

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.414
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:56.954
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

00:06:57.453 --> 00:07:03.308
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:09.621
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:14.789
So the sin against the Mother when we do

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.205
- means when we become immoral.

00:07:17.454 --> 00:07:23.837
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

00:07:25.584 --> 00:07:28.575
which are not permitted by dharma.

00:07:30.014 --> 00:07:33.495
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

00:07:34.732 --> 00:07:37.329
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

00:07:37.672 --> 00:07:40.402
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:44.372
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

00:07:44.807 --> 00:07:50.126
So any such things when you try to do,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.501
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

00:07:56.632 --> 00:08:00.563
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

00:08:00.702 --> 00:08:04.989
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:08.933
- immediately the punishment comes in.

00:08:10.383 --> 00:08:15.637
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:19.764
the punishment is more delayed,

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:27.522
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.661
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:39.055
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:46.597
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:54.561
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.491
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:05.015
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.236
or is threatened, intimidated,

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:18.504
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

00:09:19.219 --> 00:09:24.020
As a result, such a person -

00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:29.355
The child is talking too much. Can you take away the child from there?

00:09:29.355 --> 00:09:33.502
Where is he? Outside?

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:38.684
Ask them to control the children.

00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:41.398
You must control. This is negative child who is talking.

00:09:44.152 --> 00:09:48.166
Who is the child? Whose child it is?

00:09:49.566 --> 00:09:50.896
Who is that?

00:09:54.863 --> 00:09:57.403
Please look after your child; it's not normal.

00:09:58.336 --> 00:10:05.277
Normally, children who are all right become very quiet during My speech.

00:10:13.725 --> 00:10:16.588
Now take him- take her out, ask her to take her out.

00:10:50.849 --> 00:10:55.586
So, this Center Heart is to be looked after.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:01.761
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.172
away from the Mother,

00:11:06.682 --> 00:11:09.754
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

00:11:10.214 --> 00:11:14.063
who gives us courage and bravery.

00:11:14.936 --> 00:11:20.206
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.644
also you can be thrown to the left side;

00:11:24.894 --> 00:11:29.219
and you can get into all kind of diseases

00:11:29.358 --> 00:11:33.790
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

00:11:35.225 --> 00:11:41.487
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:49.423
into indulgences without any dharma,

00:11:50.324 --> 00:11:58.291
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:02.298
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:05.056
at the lotus feet of the Mother.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:16.534
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:18.832
the sternum bone starts

00:12:19.111 --> 00:12:21.694
moving like a remote control and informs

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.639
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.929
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

00:12:31.187 --> 00:12:35.076
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

00:12:36.111 --> 00:12:38.979
They said, "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.100
you can behave the way you want to behave".

00:12:42.315 --> 00:12:49.596
All these different types of movements towards the left,

00:12:49.808 --> 00:12:53.128
takes you away from your Mother.

00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:58.957
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

00:12:59.494 --> 00:13:02.180
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:06.242
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.322
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:13.892
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

00:13:14.078 --> 00:13:16.074
And this fellow started bleeding.

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:18.891
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:20.628
I got such strength,

00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:23.494
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

00:13:23.655 --> 00:13:26.137
and I took the dagger from him.

00:13:26.318 --> 00:13:30.132
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:32.453
And the fellow ran away.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.076
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

00:13:37.491 --> 00:13:39.100
What I did

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:42.392
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

00:13:42.576 --> 00:13:44.205
I ran after him

00:13:44.344 --> 00:13:47.549
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow".

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:49.912
They didn't go to the police.

00:13:50.146 --> 00:13:53.102
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:56.896
the whole shirt was full of blood.

00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:00.044
He said, "Nobody would believe". Even the police was shocked.

00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:02.775
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.633
Why didn't you come to the police?"

00:14:04.796 --> 00:14:07.252
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:10.078
so we thought, better do it ourselves".

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.668
See the courage!

00:14:13.364 --> 00:14:16.372
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

00:14:16.581 --> 00:14:18.224
and he was all right.

00:14:18.562 --> 00:14:21.986
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.348
That is the sign of a person

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:29.863
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

00:14:30.512 --> 00:14:35.637
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:39.134
And, he is an Indian,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.493
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.700
I have never fought with anyone.

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:46.890
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

00:14:47.104 --> 00:14:48.464
But it happened".

00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:51.538
He says, "I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

00:14:51.737 --> 00:14:54.901
and how I did it, I just don't know".

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.327
There are many stories like

00:14:57.479 --> 00:15:00.048
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:06.312
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

00:15:11.272 --> 00:15:14.899
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.382
or of protecting themselves

00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:20.930
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.690
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.036
but it is happening, every day,

00:15:28.235 --> 00:15:31.345
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:34.402
If you believe in the Goddess,

00:15:34.815 --> 00:15:38.030
then know that She is extremely powerful;

00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:40.450
She is very intelligent;

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:43.598
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

00:15:43.764 --> 00:15:47.128
out and out, in such a way that

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:50.175
you will not know how you have been protected.

00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:53.468
But  this faith has to be developed.

00:15:53.866 --> 00:15:56.810
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:59.154
how you have been protected always;

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:01.243
how you have been helped always;

00:16:01.382 --> 00:16:03.449
how you came out of so many crises.

00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:07.647
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

00:16:07.886 --> 00:16:12.100
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.140
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

00:16:16.363 --> 00:16:20.148
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

00:16:20.328 --> 00:16:23.766
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:28.897
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

00:16:29.234 --> 00:16:32.030
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:35.849
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

00:16:36.013 --> 00:16:41.537
that one should not go about like a zombie,

00:16:41.774 --> 00:16:43.454
it doesn't mean that;

00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:46.596
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

00:16:46.815 --> 00:16:49.128
But if you have to do something,

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:51.825
do it with clear-cut ideas,

00:16:52.089 --> 00:16:55.672
and also without any fear.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:00.910
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:05.245
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

00:17:05.443 --> 00:17:09.887
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

00:17:10.616 --> 00:17:12.359
He is fearless.

00:17:13.213 --> 00:17:16.113
Again I say, 'fearless' doesn't mean that

00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:19.606
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

00:17:19.758 --> 00:17:22.198
It means that you are fearless:

00:17:22.396 --> 00:17:25.411
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.677
I mean, this story I told you,

00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:30.247
because this was not a protection

00:17:30.389 --> 00:17:32.297
which was from within, like

00:17:32.665 --> 00:17:34.538
Goddess protecting them,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.777
but actually protected himself.

00:17:37.943 --> 00:17:40.907
So the power had started working through him.

00:17:41.548 --> 00:17:44.830
You should allow your mind, your body

00:17:45.704 --> 00:17:47.384
to project these powers.

00:17:48.108 --> 00:17:51.695
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.474
and the power is there;

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:59.206
but your mind which tells you, "No, no, no, this is not so".

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:02.481
There's so many stories,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.263
so many miracles people have described about this.

00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:12.144
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

00:18:12.402 --> 00:18:14.628
If you have done nothing wrong,

00:18:16.078 --> 00:18:19.271
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:23.856
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

00:18:24.585 --> 00:18:27.414
Remember this and believe in this,

00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:29.931
that, "I am always protected".

00:18:30.768 --> 00:18:33.042
This is something very difficult,

00:18:33.293 --> 00:18:36.078
because perhaps our mind gives ideas,

00:18:36.184 --> 00:18:39.133
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?

00:18:39.292 --> 00:18:40.972
This thing, that thing".

00:18:43.383 --> 00:18:47.065
So, first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:18:47.245 --> 00:18:53.514
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

00:18:54.832 --> 00:18:56.795
Supposing now, take it like this:

00:18:56.978 --> 00:18:59.217
now all Ganas are following you.

00:18:59.695 --> 00:19:06.975
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:09.033
what will others do?

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:18.706
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:23.409
This faith also must be developed.

00:19:23.688 --> 00:19:26.584
I have seen people who are sick

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.194
- so they must come and see Me,

00:19:29.408 --> 00:19:32.541
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.291
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:40.288
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

00:19:40.567 --> 00:19:43.344
cured others, just with prayer.

00:19:43.585 --> 00:19:48.762
But the faith, when it is not matured,

00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:51.533
then they think I, I should treat them.

00:19:51.712 --> 00:19:54.012
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

00:19:54.158 --> 00:19:55.838
Now I have stopped it.

00:19:56.023 --> 00:19:57.790
I used to do once upon a time.

00:19:57.929 --> 00:20:00.559
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

00:20:00.937 --> 00:20:02.993
Not only that you can

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.284
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

00:20:05.424 --> 00:20:08.153
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

00:20:08.332 --> 00:20:12.589
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:15.566
you can protect yourself; so the whole

00:20:15.804 --> 00:20:17.978
thing becomes like a ...

00:20:18.158 --> 00:20:20.957
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

00:20:22.692 --> 00:20:26.216
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:27.376
all right?

00:20:27.527 --> 00:20:31.896
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

00:20:32.088 --> 00:20:33.622
But when he grows up,

00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:36.848
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:39.347
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

00:20:39.507 --> 00:20:41.431
how many years I have been working.

00:20:41.629 --> 00:20:47.719
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:52.879
so that you can yourself do things properly.

00:20:54.785 --> 00:21:00.074
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:04.602
All Her powers She has given you - every.

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:12.036
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

00:21:13.802 --> 00:21:16.535
You have to be patient like your Mother.

00:21:17.631 --> 00:21:20.959
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

00:21:21.326 --> 00:21:24.449
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.654
I have known many people

00:21:26.873 --> 00:21:28.725
who think they are spiritually nothing

00:21:28.883 --> 00:21:30.600
and they have not achieved anything.

00:21:32.247 --> 00:21:36.116
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:39.471
that you want to escape your personality.

00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:42.535
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:47.765
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

00:21:48.005 --> 00:21:49.685
Nobody can touch you;

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.751
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.570
you can support others.

00:21:56.231 --> 00:21:58.969
Whatever are the powers

00:21:59.187 --> 00:22:02.195
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.479
all these powers are manifesting in you.

00:22:06.818 --> 00:22:10.996
But still you leave it to chance and,

00:22:11.175 --> 00:22:14.695
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:21.559
Now this is one point

00:22:21.738 --> 00:22:26.083
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

00:22:26.322 --> 00:22:31.459
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

00:22:34.674 --> 00:22:38.197
Because it is the Divine power of love,

00:22:38.337 --> 00:22:43.289
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

00:22:43.547 --> 00:22:46.098
But again, when it comes to love,

00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:48.489
they will love their child, love their wife;

00:22:48.648 --> 00:22:50.937
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:54.114
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

00:22:54.312 --> 00:22:57.399
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

00:22:57.657 --> 00:23:01.368
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

00:23:01.665 --> 00:23:03.465
But now it is like a glue.

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:07.331
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:09.691
and the family - very important.

00:23:10.663 --> 00:23:15.340
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.815
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:21.241
But, again I say, the detachment.

00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:25.145
The detachment is your power.

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:29.998
Watch everything with detachment.

00:23:30.197 --> 00:23:31.617
Now don't think that,

00:23:31.737 --> 00:23:35.248
 "Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga". No.

00:23:35.487 --> 00:23:39.307
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good". No.

00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:45.815
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

00:23:46.292 --> 00:23:50.637
how many powers you have already got.

00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:56.005
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

00:23:56.959 --> 00:24:01.085
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

00:24:01.681 --> 00:24:03.875
No fear of any kind.

00:24:04.073 --> 00:24:07.537
You can have fear if you have some,

00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:09.603
say, lot of money with you.

00:24:09.842 --> 00:24:14.066
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

00:24:14.326 --> 00:24:18.583
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

00:24:18.743 --> 00:24:21.210
afraid of big thieves coming around.

00:24:22.056 --> 00:24:25.657
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

00:24:25.955 --> 00:24:30.399
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

00:24:31.272 --> 00:24:37.136
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

00:24:38.292 --> 00:24:40.785
Who can steal your Self-realization?

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.615
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

00:24:50.329 --> 00:24:55.202
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

00:24:57.028 --> 00:25:00.817
And who can steal your love?

00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:05.948
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:10.055
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.937
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

00:25:14.896 --> 00:25:20.848
then only you feel all these things,

00:25:21.028 --> 00:25:23.161
which one feels in the darkness.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:34.284
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

00:25:34.562 --> 00:25:38.767
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

00:25:39.025 --> 00:25:40.769
watching everything.

00:25:42.059 --> 00:25:44.059
You have tremendous patience;

00:25:46.761 --> 00:25:48.388
tremendous patience.

00:25:49.081 --> 00:25:51.394
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:54.430
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.431
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

00:25:59.367 --> 00:26:06.489
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.747
that you start becoming younger and younger.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.129
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

00:26:12.308 --> 00:26:14.688
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

00:26:15.105 --> 00:26:17.607
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

00:26:17.766 --> 00:26:20.464
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

00:26:21.417 --> 00:26:26.270
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

00:26:26.473 --> 00:26:29.495
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

00:26:29.695 --> 00:26:33.855
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

00:26:38.107 --> 00:26:41.511
So then, what happens to you

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.599
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

00:26:46.451 --> 00:26:49.143
Because your Mother is there always.

00:26:49.639 --> 00:26:53.627
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:55.939
always protecting us:

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.789
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

00:26:59.988 --> 00:27:02.559
All the property She has given us; so what,

00:27:03.215 --> 00:27:05.281
what is there to be afraid of?

00:27:06.905 --> 00:27:11.706
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:13.821
but an enlightened faith.

00:27:14.805 --> 00:27:17.821
Now the difference is, in blind faith

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.060
you have faith but no powers.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.227
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:33.059
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

00:27:33.397 --> 00:27:35.412
- first in your dharma.

00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:38.588
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

00:27:40.482 --> 00:27:47.237
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.624
and it works, it clicks.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.803
Once you don't have any fear,

00:27:52.943 --> 00:27:55.609
the whole picture will be clear to you,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.123
because you become a visionary:

00:27:58.855 --> 00:28:01.322
what we call in Sanskrit 'drishtas'.

00:28:01.554 --> 00:28:05.660
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

00:28:06.129 --> 00:28:10.057
How could William Blake predict our future?

00:28:10.295 --> 00:28:11.627
How could

00:28:13.601 --> 00:28:16.067
Gyaneshwara, wrote about 'Pasayadan',

00:28:16.226 --> 00:28:18.666
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:22.032
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

00:28:22.171 --> 00:28:25.088
and do this, you are that, now you've got it".

00:28:25.225 --> 00:28:28.125
He is trying to assure people all the time.

00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:33.757
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

00:28:34.374 --> 00:28:35.974
How could it happen?

00:28:36.204 --> 00:28:39.589
It happens only when people are

00:28:39.886 --> 00:28:42.200
in enlightened faith.

00:28:46.308 --> 00:28:49.950
In enlightened faith your Mother

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:54.763
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.379
of discretion.

00:28:56.603 --> 00:28:59.537
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

00:29:00.203 --> 00:29:02.734
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

00:29:02.873 --> 00:29:07.496
and You know nobody has looked after him, this, that.

00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:10.742
He is very well educated, very moneyed person, this, that".

00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.202
I said, "All right, show Me the photograph".

00:29:13.797 --> 00:29:16.408
I saw the photograph. I said, "No

00:29:16.964 --> 00:29:19.563
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

00:29:19.762 --> 00:29:22.341
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:25.279
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

00:29:25.615 --> 00:29:28.504
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

00:29:28.722 --> 00:29:32.186
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

00:29:32.703 --> 00:29:36.166
Immediately I said, "It's wrong".

00:29:36.623 --> 00:29:40.651
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

00:29:40.889 --> 00:29:43.341
Nigerians have written letter to him,

00:29:43.492 --> 00:29:45.348
that, "You put thirty-five

00:29:47.214 --> 00:29:50.678
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

00:29:51.034 --> 00:29:55.371
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.263
and then you can have one third of that".

00:29:59.578 --> 00:30:02.209
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

00:30:02.506 --> 00:30:07.882
Keep out of it". So he said, "Why?" "It's a scam".

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:12.200
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

00:30:13.312 --> 00:30:15.078
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

00:30:15.376 --> 00:30:18.384
I said, "You can feel the vibrations, so hot!

00:30:19.403 --> 00:30:21.022
So, it is a scam".

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.768
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:30.510
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

00:30:30.689 --> 00:30:33.166
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:36.492
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it".

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.070
He thought:

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.010
"Why Mother is saying so?"

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.508
I said, "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.869
All right. We have. Don't take these things".

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.047
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

00:30:50.532 --> 00:30:53.737
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

00:30:53.957 --> 00:31:00.357
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

00:31:00.481 --> 00:31:01.857
I said, "What happened?"

00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:04.853
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there".

00:31:04.973 --> 00:31:09.456
I said, "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

00:31:09.695 --> 00:31:13.643
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

00:31:14.654 --> 00:31:16.996
that he is going to give you so much money,

00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:20.857
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad".

00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:30.897
In this way, you can gradually experience.

00:31:31.552 --> 00:31:35.733
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

00:31:36.388 --> 00:31:39.899
and have faith in that experience.

00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:45.050
What were you? What have you become now?

00:31:45.388 --> 00:31:48.524
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

00:31:48.742 --> 00:31:53.901
- of the Mother's attention on you.

00:31:55.012 --> 00:32:00.242
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

00:32:00.561 --> 00:32:02.241
you become powerful...

00:32:03.575 --> 00:32:07.128
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

00:32:09.846 --> 00:32:15.606
But if you become really a evolved, matured

00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:21.247
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

00:32:22.872 --> 00:32:25.143
There's a fisherman in India,

00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:42.972
who is

00:32:43.885 --> 00:32:47.249
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

00:32:47.786 --> 00:32:51.932
So one day, he was going on a boat

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:55.821
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:56.872 --> 00:32:59.701
And when he came out of his hut, he found

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.360
huge big clouds, black ones,

00:33:02.579 --> 00:33:05.046
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

00:33:05.773 --> 00:33:07.572
Just he stood on the shore

00:33:08.113 --> 00:33:09.910
and told Vishnumaya,

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:13.161
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

00:33:13.384 --> 00:33:15.261
I am going for the work of Mother,

00:33:15.465 --> 00:33:18.728
and dare not trouble me on the way". Just told it.

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:21.784
The people who were with him, told me that

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:24.563
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

00:33:24.762 --> 00:33:27.432
They got into the boat. They did the program,

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:32.710
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

00:33:34.001 --> 00:33:39.992
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

00:33:42.047 --> 00:33:45.213
For which you don't even have to say anything.

00:33:45.928 --> 00:33:48.528
The powers are so great that they act.

00:33:48.766 --> 00:33:52.686
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

00:33:52.865 --> 00:33:55.731
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

00:33:56.456 --> 00:34:01.158
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

00:34:01.535 --> 00:34:04.126
could have been very cold.

00:34:04.662 --> 00:34:11.658
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.082
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:20.209
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

00:34:20.448 --> 00:34:23.753
pull all these pillars down.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.575
As soon as they started saying My 'Jai', it stopped.

00:34:29.508 --> 00:34:32.041
Now, this experience should make you;

00:34:32.423 --> 00:34:34.824
there was no need for you to pull the...

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:40.955
these pillars, but you had to just sing My 'Jai', that's all.

00:34:41.192 --> 00:34:43.147
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.949
all of you that thing.

00:34:45.103 --> 00:34:47.356
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.915
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try".

00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:55.362
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

00:34:55.522 --> 00:34:58.409
These ordeals if they are not there,

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.837
these ordeals if they do not come,

00:35:03.982 --> 00:35:07.033
then you will not supersede them;

00:35:07.192 --> 00:35:09.513
and if you will not supersede them,

00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:12.206
you will not know what is your faith.

00:35:12.766 --> 00:35:16.060
A person who is standing on the shore

00:35:16.358 --> 00:35:18.520
will say, "I don't know how to swim".

00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.726
But supposing you made him jump into the water

00:35:21.887 --> 00:35:25.993
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:31.120
Because you do not know what you have become.

00:35:32.422 --> 00:35:34.756
You do not know that you can swim.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.009
You do not know that you can also save others.

00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.621
You are still busy

00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:42.327
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

00:35:43.383 --> 00:35:47.723
But if you just know what you have become,

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:56.489
then you are going to completely change.

00:35:57.284 --> 00:36:03.862
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:06.112
will cover the whole sky.

00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:10.787
But this power that is within you,

00:36:11.236 --> 00:36:12.915
will not give you ego.

00:36:13.815 --> 00:36:16.715
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

00:36:18.281 --> 00:36:21.364
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

00:36:21.504 --> 00:36:24.171
and extremely loving and compassionate.

00:36:24.352 --> 00:36:28.640
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:33.590
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

00:36:34.027 --> 00:36:38.114
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

00:36:38.293 --> 00:36:40.093
it's a psychological fact,

00:36:40.475 --> 00:36:42.769
becomes a very nice person;

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.339
it's a psychological fact.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.947
So now if you realize what you are now,

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:54.025
what you have become.

00:36:54.243 --> 00:36:57.112
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:58.898
powerful Puja in a way:

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.964
because it manifests, opens out

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.700
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

00:37:10.846 --> 00:37:15.699
and since morning I have been just

00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:20.433
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

00:37:20.592 --> 00:37:23.865
waterfall of vibrations.

00:37:24.044 --> 00:37:27.238
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

00:37:27.398 --> 00:37:31.306
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

00:37:31.485 --> 00:37:33.123
That's why I closed My eyes,

00:37:33.282 --> 00:37:35.762
because all the time there will be something else

00:37:35.921 --> 00:37:38.421
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

00:37:38.501 --> 00:37:40.101
I'll close My eyes.

00:37:40.543 --> 00:37:46.175
But now you are the light. You are the light.

00:37:47.592 --> 00:37:51.533
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:55.567
Because, it can remove the darkness.

00:37:56.295 --> 00:37:59.751
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

00:38:00.581 --> 00:38:04.707
and you live with very small, very small

00:38:05.001 --> 00:38:07.492
ideas about yourself.

00:38:08.325 --> 00:38:12.999
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:17.782
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

00:38:18.358 --> 00:38:21.091
What is your decoration is your humility,

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.848
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

00:38:26.127 --> 00:38:28.194
and the way you handle people.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.337
You will be amazed, I also tell people

00:38:31.497 --> 00:38:35.326
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

00:38:35.505 --> 00:38:38.103
no doubt; but in a way

00:38:38.385 --> 00:38:40.952
that the person understands it is for the

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.910
benevolence of that person.

00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:50.608
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

00:38:51.754 --> 00:38:57.984
everything changes; the whole face changes;

00:38:59.492 --> 00:39:01.607
the whole movement changes.

00:39:01.786 --> 00:39:03.786
The style of talking changes,

00:39:04.544 --> 00:39:09.839
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:18.829
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

00:39:21.751 --> 00:39:28.106
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

00:39:34.793 --> 00:39:38.543
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:44.308
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

00:39:44.468 --> 00:39:47.268
really from the heart they had to detach.

00:39:47.563 --> 00:39:51.452
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

00:39:51.968 --> 00:39:53.971
and live on ordinary food.

00:39:54.408 --> 00:39:57.813
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

00:39:58.566 --> 00:40:00.620
Christ suffered so much.

00:40:00.959 --> 00:40:03.935
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

00:40:04.154 --> 00:40:08.590
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

00:40:09.185 --> 00:40:11.719
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:15.545
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

00:40:16.705 --> 00:40:19.879
enjoyment, music, everything.

00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:31.252
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

00:40:31.828 --> 00:40:36.279
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:43.830
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

00:40:44.145 --> 00:40:46.062
with which he is living.

00:40:46.265 --> 00:40:48.165
All kinds of myths there are.

00:40:48.304 --> 00:40:50.248
Some people have myths, "We are very poor".

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.013
Some have myths, "We are very rich".

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:56.121
Some have this thing that, "We are very unhappy".

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.050
Some have that, "We are very happy".

00:40:59.229 --> 00:41:01.229
All kinds of myths these are.

00:41:01.907 --> 00:41:04.883
These are all myths.

00:41:05.677 --> 00:41:09.478
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:14.200
complete emptiness. That is joy.

00:41:15.312 --> 00:41:18.002
This emptiness is filled with joy.

00:41:18.439 --> 00:41:20.038
Complete emptiness.

00:41:20.284 --> 00:41:23.184
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

00:41:23.407 --> 00:41:27.213
And this emptiness from within is actually,

00:41:27.392 --> 00:41:32.531
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

00:41:32.888 --> 00:41:35.578
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

00:41:35.757 --> 00:41:37.557
what can you pour into it?

00:41:39.071 --> 00:41:40.871
What can you give into it?

00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:44.955
So if you are completely empty within,

00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:48.863
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

00:41:49.003 --> 00:41:52.203
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

00:41:53.042 --> 00:41:56.824
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

00:41:57.063 --> 00:42:00.864
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

00:42:01.063 --> 00:42:04.775
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.217
you do not look forward to it.

00:42:08.356 --> 00:42:11.188
It is there, all the time.

00:42:11.764 --> 00:42:16.625
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

00:42:17.082 --> 00:42:19.415
As you know, the Devi's things are

00:42:20.574 --> 00:42:23.430
so very deep and subtle:

00:42:24.343 --> 00:42:30.605
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

00:42:30.943 --> 00:42:34.335
Her bhaktas with love;

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.589
how She fought demons

00:42:38.165 --> 00:42:39.845
and also negativity.

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:45.219
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

00:42:45.955 --> 00:42:49.091
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

00:42:49.724 --> 00:42:52.978
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

00:42:53.116 --> 00:42:55.469
all the time attacking you.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.469
Even if you kill those demons,

00:42:59.727 --> 00:43:02.781
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:05.560
They should be actually killed when they,

00:43:05.739 --> 00:43:10.552
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

00:43:11.168 --> 00:43:14.917
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

00:43:15.096 --> 00:43:19.651
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

00:43:20.148 --> 00:43:22.996
So these negativities, which come

00:43:23.293 --> 00:43:26.725
from wrong type of following you have had,

00:43:26.884 --> 00:43:28.869
from wrong books you have been reading,

00:43:29.014 --> 00:43:30.867
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

00:43:31.012 --> 00:43:34.212
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

00:43:34.484 --> 00:43:38.087
In that case also, forgive that person.

00:43:38.385 --> 00:43:41.004
That person may improve, but you may continue

00:43:41.209 --> 00:43:45.241
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:54.945
So the quality is of compassion and love,

00:43:55.698 --> 00:43:58.231
fearlessness and courage

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.274
and the complete emptiness.

00:44:05.188 --> 00:44:09.366
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

00:44:09.664 --> 00:44:12.917
what you have to achieve, how many people

00:44:13.136 --> 00:44:14.933
you have to gather,

00:44:15.132 --> 00:44:18.802
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

00:44:18.926 --> 00:44:22.881
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.314
and you will not hanker, "Oh my God!"

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.814
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

00:44:28.965 --> 00:44:30.807
It is good for us in a way,

00:44:31.006 --> 00:44:35.038
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:42.783
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:48.158
But we must definitely take over the people

00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:51.672
who are genuinely good.

00:44:52.038 --> 00:44:54.351
One thing more I would like to tell you,

00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:58.410
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:02.140
In one shot they will go away.

00:45:02.478 --> 00:45:05.692
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.877
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

00:45:09.058 --> 00:45:14.117
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

00:45:14.315 --> 00:45:18.771
And I see, I go late always to any program,

00:45:19.228 --> 00:45:22.712
so those who are useless just disappear.

00:45:23.029 --> 00:45:26.176
And some of them disappear half-way through,

00:45:26.393 --> 00:45:28.902
because nothing goes into their head, really,

00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:32.237
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:36.635
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.837
and they get, all of them, Realization.

00:45:40.056 --> 00:45:42.211
In Sanskrit, they call it 'shayen'

00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:46.913
- means 'selection'. This is a natural selection that takes place,

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:52.607
and how people go away and how they come back

00:45:52.984 --> 00:45:56.071
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

00:45:57.877 --> 00:46:01.964
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

00:46:02.143 --> 00:46:03.642
You should not get upset.

00:46:03.782 --> 00:46:06.918
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

00:46:07.194 --> 00:46:09.071
and not so much from Switzerland,

00:46:09.191 --> 00:46:13.071
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

00:46:15.135 --> 00:46:20.869
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

00:46:21.663 --> 00:46:27.139
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:31.084
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:34.092
or from some African land, it's all right.

00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:39.185
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:44.291
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

00:46:44.462 --> 00:46:46.462
So this attachment, in a way,

00:46:46.601 --> 00:46:49.759
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

00:46:50.006 --> 00:46:51.743
because you want to have company.

00:46:51.903 --> 00:46:56.386
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

00:46:56.684 --> 00:46:59.672
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

00:46:59.871 --> 00:47:01.966
- difficult. So you want to have company.

00:47:02.095 --> 00:47:04.634
So you want to have more and more and more.

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:05.964
But doesn't matter.

00:47:06.144 --> 00:47:08.343
As many as there are sufficient,

00:47:08.624 --> 00:47:12.080
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

00:47:12.633 --> 00:47:16.096
But when we want to share our love,

00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:20.184
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

00:47:20.323 --> 00:47:22.557
but because we cannot share.

00:47:22.756 --> 00:47:26.636
That time a new personality rises,

00:47:26.994 --> 00:47:32.093
and this new personality is the one which works.

00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:35.238
I mean we are not giving you any money;

00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:37.332
there are no awards for you.

00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.407
There's no way there's much encouragement,

00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:43.684
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.390
nothing of the kind.

00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:48.466
Can you imagine in any organization

00:47:48.585 --> 00:47:51.958
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

00:47:52.137 --> 00:47:55.898
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

00:47:56.811 --> 00:47:59.390
also they give you promotions;

00:47:59.569 --> 00:48:03.212
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:06.040
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:06.657 --> 00:48:09.665
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.343
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:13.105 --> 00:48:15.638
Only thing is that you want to share.

00:48:16.846 --> 00:48:18.273
You can't help it,

00:48:18.472 --> 00:48:20.472
it's like a drunkard you see.

00:48:20.636 --> 00:48:22.243
If he has a bottle,

00:48:22.362 --> 00:48:25.626
he must have at least one person to share with him,

00:48:26.093 --> 00:48:32.997
because he thinks that it would be sinful,

00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:36.247
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:38.614
So it would be half-half divided.

00:48:48.209 --> 00:48:56.633
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

00:48:57.189 --> 00:49:01.268
It is because you are collective;

00:49:01.725 --> 00:49:04.392
you have become collective, that's why.

00:49:05.217 --> 00:49:09.225
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

00:49:09.443 --> 00:49:12.251
You become a very noble person, you see?

00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.387
Like, of course drunkards do that,

00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:18.418
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

00:49:18.597 --> 00:49:22.160
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:28.111
But you think that, "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:29.571
why not others?

00:49:30.873 --> 00:49:35.032
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.349
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

00:49:39.469 --> 00:49:44.032
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

00:49:44.667 --> 00:49:48.130
I mean, no words can describe My joy

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:52.615
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

00:49:52.834 --> 00:49:56.734
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

00:49:56.893 --> 00:50:02.786
and I was really very much amazed and touched

00:50:03.183 --> 00:50:10.020
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

00:50:11.131 --> 00:50:15.694
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:19.746
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

00:50:20.025 --> 00:50:24.491
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.261
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

00:50:29.749 --> 00:50:33.142
The 'New Age' people talk of is here, no doubt.

00:50:33.313 --> 00:50:38.047
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

00:50:38.345 --> 00:50:41.544
But what is the 'new' now is the new collectivity,

00:50:42.392 --> 00:50:46.301
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

00:50:46.479 --> 00:50:52.232
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

00:50:52.542 --> 00:50:55.351
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:58.022
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:02.010
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

00:51:02.149 --> 00:51:05.016
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:05.165 --> 00:51:10.911
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.820
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

00:51:15.078 --> 00:51:18.006
the collectivity is prospering.

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:22.471
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

00:51:22.689 --> 00:51:24.689
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.017
You want to have other people.

00:51:27.372 --> 00:51:32.741
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:38.156
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:39.765 --> 00:51:44.577
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.058
- Australia has been always a problem -

00:51:47.257 --> 00:51:49.590
they are making money out of this;

00:51:49.686 --> 00:51:51.765
so I just don't know what to say,

00:51:51.928 --> 00:51:54.589
because this is, I can't understand.

00:51:54.749 --> 00:51:58.868
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

00:51:59.007 --> 00:52:04.026
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

00:52:06.904 --> 00:52:10.784
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.513
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.840
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

00:52:19.197 --> 00:52:22.225
That's what I have to request you tonight.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:27.185
You have all the power flowing in you,

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:31.562
you have the light which is enlightened,

00:52:31.721 --> 00:52:33.903
but you must expand.

00:52:35.114 --> 00:52:37.665
Expand it more and more and more,

00:52:37.924 --> 00:52:41.078
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

00:52:41.356 --> 00:52:44.927
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

00:52:45.205 --> 00:52:48.125
and also I am the whole sky".

00:52:51.221 --> 00:52:55.904
This is what is your personality.

00:52:56.221 --> 00:52:58.700
May God bless you all.
