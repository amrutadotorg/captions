Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

2
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,099
August 16, 1998

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:13,119
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:33,149
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

5
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:49,469
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

6
00:00:49,469 --> 00:01:09,210
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

7
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:25,670
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

8
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,670
awareness.

9
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,229
It’s combined together.

10
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,650
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

11
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:51,049
If you react, then the problem starts.

12
00:01:51,049 --> 00:02:06,590
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:18,280
Otherwise there is no way to react.

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,800
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:36,900
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

16
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,670
get it?

17
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,090
How much they paid it?”

18
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,170
This is the first reaction.

19
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,880
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

20
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,300
nice carpet?

21
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,980
What was the need to put it here?”

22
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,030
It goes on like that, one after another.

23
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:11,540
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

24
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:21,390
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

25
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,250
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

26
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,330
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

27
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:41,600
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,140
For example, racialism.

29
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,120
We have racialism.

30
00:03:47,120 --> 00:04:01,410
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

31
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:08,870
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

32
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:14,190
Now why this racialism is there?

33
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,880
What is the reason?

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:32,960
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

35
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,340
is only skin-deep?

36
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:46,600
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:56,750
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

38
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,880
All these conditionings are there.

39
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,580
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

40
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,060
all of them.

41
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,570
America never was their country.

42
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,810
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

43
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,350
are governors of America.

44
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:35,030
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

45
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,220
tortured.”

46
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:45,990
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

47
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,120
Then they start killing each other.

48
00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:00,190
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

49
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:09,640
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

50
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,080
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

51
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,900
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

52
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,950
who do not belong to that country.

53
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:38,060
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

54
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:49,040
flag, and the British flag going down.

55
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:59,800
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

56
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,870
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

57
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:17,060
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

58
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:24,520
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

59
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,760
become the masters.

60
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,790
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

61
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:44,050
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

62
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,960
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

63
00:07:48,960 --> 00:08:00,930
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

64
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:34,729
you can develop a witness state.

65
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:43,490
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

66
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,870
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

67
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:55,970
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

68
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:04,029
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

69
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:11,240
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

70
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,839
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

71
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,470
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

72
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:37,149
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

73
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:47,529
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

74
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,759
happen to them.

75
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,430
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

76
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:02,720
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

77
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,829
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

78
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:20,929
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

79
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:24,540
which the white people don’t have.

80
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,600
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

81
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,119
It’s a full justice done to the color.

82
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:47,360
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

83
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,619
all of them will disappear.

84
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,029
Now what will remain?

85
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:05,819
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

86
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:11,910
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

87
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:18,190
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

88
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:30,579
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

89
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:36,829
to condemn someone for the color.

90
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,269
Same now is happening as the reaction.

91
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,100
Every action has a reaction.

92
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,569
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

93
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:57,499
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

94
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:10,829
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

95
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:15,509
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

96
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:25,519
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

97
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:34,420
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

98
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,339
cutting each other’s throats.

99
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,690
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

100
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:51,819
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

101
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,449
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

102
00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,529
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

103
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:08,019
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

104
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,499
the positive is there, it’s not.

105
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:18,189
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

106
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,319
with each other.

107
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:23,790
Now this violence is growing so much.

108
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:31,290
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

109
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:41,759
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

110
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,410
so many innocent people.

111
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,139
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

112
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:56,190
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

113
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:06,360
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

114
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,779
Now this comes through ego.

115
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:17,510
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

116
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,510
that.

117
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:26,579
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

118
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,589
person.

119
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:35,029
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

120
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:45,829
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

121
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:57,189
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

122
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:03,689
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

123
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:11,660
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

124
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,350
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

125
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:24,690
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

126
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:32,540
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

127
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,929
to be hated.

128
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:41,059
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

129
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:49,959
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

130
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,589
and is killing others.

131
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:59,929
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

132
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:08,779
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

133
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:17,699
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

134
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:23,329
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

135
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,999
You enjoy that.

136
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:30,959
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

137
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,209
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

138
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,120
or did something like that.

139
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,040
Very surprising!

140
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,790
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

141
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,970
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

142
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,420
than we have here, and is always full.

143
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,980
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

144
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,530
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

145
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:22,809
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

146
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:33,650
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

147
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,419
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

148
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:46,100
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

149
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:53,250
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

150
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,890
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

151
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:07,800
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

152
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
happen?

153
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,580
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

154
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:27,080
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

155
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
your sight.

156
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:37,990
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

157
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,990
actively.

158
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:45,710
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

159
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,710
wonderful.

160
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,809
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

161
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,500
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

162
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,000
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

163
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,430
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

164
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:19,490
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

165
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,289
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

166
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:25,960
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

167
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,190
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

168
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:34,260
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

169
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,220
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

170
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,690
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

171
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:50,230
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

172
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:58,990
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

173
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:07,130
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

174
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,090
you may join also these wrong type of people.

175
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:17,990
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

176
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:27,350
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

177
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:34,750
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

178
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:42,360
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

179
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,360
should win.”

180
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,570
He said, “All right.”

181
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:56,220
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

182
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:02,019
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

183
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:08,420
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

184
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,179
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

185
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,539
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

186
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:24,200
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

187
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,630
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

188
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:38,519
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

189
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:52,389
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

190
00:21:52,389 --> 00:22:02,269
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

191
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:06,009
become a witness.

192
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:14,549
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

193
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:19,450
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

194
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,340
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

195
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,500
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

196
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,450
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

197
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,480
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

198
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,150
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

199
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,259
You just watch and see for yourself.

200
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,740
That’s all is your right.

201
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,940
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

202
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:00,870
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

203
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,870
stop.

204
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,870
It’s not that!

205
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,649
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

206
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:14,990
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

207
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,100
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

208
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,840
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

209
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,769
to do that.

210
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:38,380
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

211
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,009
Because what can you do?

212
00:23:41,009 --> 00:23:43,649
You can’t do anything.

213
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,940
But what you can do is to watch.

214
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:57,960
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

215
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,169
of being.

216
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:11,879
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

217
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:18,240
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

218
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
them.

219
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,980
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

220
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,800
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

221
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:39,570
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

222
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:46,900
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

223
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,019
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

224
00:24:52,019 --> 00:25:00,570
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

225
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,570
car.

226
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:14,690
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

227
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,990
He was just telling, “Who is that?

228
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,100
What is that?”

229
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
- this, that.

230
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,879
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

231
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:25,879
him?”

232
00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:33,340
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

233
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,770
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

234
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,629
But this is not the only loss we have.

235
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:53,129
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

236
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:58,879
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

237
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:05,230
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

238
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,899
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

239
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:15,659
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

240
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:24,139
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

241
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:28,799
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

242
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,049
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

243
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:37,210
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

244
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:47,009
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

245
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:53,630
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

246
00:26:53,630 --> 00:27:00,679
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

247
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,460
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

248
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,210
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

249
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,570
see that these people go away from Germany.”

250
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,580
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

251
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,039
So why not kill them?”

252
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:33,200
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

253
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,669
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

254
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:44,669
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

255
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:52,110
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

256
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,279
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

257
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:01,470
of Jews?

258
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,720
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

259
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,980
But why did they indulge into such violence?

260
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,990
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

261
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:21,259
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

262
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:26,169
fall into negative collectivity.

263
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:33,269
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

264
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:40,539
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

265
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:51,129
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

266
00:28:51,129 --> 00:29:02,009
We should not react, we should not react.

267
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:11,399
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

268
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:20,269
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

269
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:25,399
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

270
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:34,669
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

271
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:40,390
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

272
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:47,789
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

273
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:56,600
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

274
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,320
been doing.

275
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:10,379
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

276
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:15,190
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

277
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,350
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

278
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:29,350
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

279
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,419
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

280
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:45,340
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

281
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:52,659
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

282
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:59,590
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

283
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:06,039
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

284
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,820
For what?

285
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,730
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

286
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:20,620
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

287
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,049
Why, why is this happening?

288
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:29,460
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

289
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,600
attention of everyone.

290
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:36,169
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

291
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:37,700
the sympathy of others.

292
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,090
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

293
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:49,889
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

294
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:56,649
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

295
00:31:56,649 --> 00:32:10,141
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

296
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:19,999
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

297
00:32:19,999 --> 00:32:21,990
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

298
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:33,370
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

299
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,220
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

300
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:44,520
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

301
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:56,369
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

302
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:05,379
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

303
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:08,880
them with another leaf.

304
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,750
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

305
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,630
They are made like that.

306
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,220
One has to accept.

307
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,259
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

308
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,450
Why do you want to look like another person?

309
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:33,290
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

310
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:39,649
life for something absolutely worthless.

311
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:43,529
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

312
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:54,919
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

313
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,640
way people are behaving.

314
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,980
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

315
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,110
our reactions have become very, very funny.

316
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:17,240
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

317
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
react?

318
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,760
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

319
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,890
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

320
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:43,320
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

321
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,030
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

322
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,429
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

323
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:59,430
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

324
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:13,520
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

325
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:24,670
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

326
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,370
position they want to have.

327
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,590
Same with the men.

328
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:38,690
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

329
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:45,190
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

330
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:53,460
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

331
00:35:53,460 --> 00:36:02,910
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

332
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,100
lot.

333
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,430
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

334
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:14,670
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

335
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,030
I know who does that.

336
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:25,660
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

337
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:31,880
introspection will start properly.

338
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:46,890
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

339
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:55,640
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

340
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:06,700
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

341
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:15,510
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

342
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:21,030
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

343
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,530
think about you.

344
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,220
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

345
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:41,750
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

346
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:51,350
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

347
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,820
not fight.

348
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:06,340
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

349
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,040
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

350
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,010
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

351
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:24,530
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

352
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,000
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

353
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,760
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

354
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,640
power will act.

355
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:52,360
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

356
00:38:52,360 --> 00:39:01,570
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

357
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:04,580
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

358
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:21,830
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

359
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:27,820
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

360
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:36,740
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

361
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,200
or anything.

362
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,780
But just you are witnessing the drama.

363
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:50,511
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

364
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:55,840
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

365
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:08,180
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

366
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,070
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

367
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:21,220
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

368
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:32,441
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

369
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:39,780
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

370
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,630
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

371
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:48,980
people.

372
00:40:48,980 --> 00:41:00,140
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

373
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:09,980
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

374
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:18,740
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

375
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,510
black clouds, thundering clouds.

376
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:29,670
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

377
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,160
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

378
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:44,980
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

379
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:54,680
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

380
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,380
Even the nature understands.

381
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:04,140
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

382
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:11,380
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

383
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,490
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

384
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,520
Actually, it’s all a myth.

385
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,900
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

386
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:31,790
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

387
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,060
will know the maya.

388
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:46,360
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

389
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:56,480
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

390
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,560
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

391
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:15,650
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

392
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:26,830
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

393
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:37,570
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

394
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:47,320
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

395
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,400
the war over evil.

396
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:58,670
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

397
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:05,030
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

398
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:11,400
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

399
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:22,870
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

400
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,870
beings.

401
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:33,270
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

402
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,320
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

403
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:42,650
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

404
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:50,240
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

405
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,680
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

406
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,610
It’s interesting, very interesting.

407
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:06,820
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

408
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,360
but He starts with the best.

409
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:20,110
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

410
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:26,760
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

411
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,750
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

412
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,940
But He is not.

413
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,140
He didn’t say that.

414
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,160
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

415
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:52,040
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

416
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,890
to the Divine Power.”

417
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:02,040
Results are from the Divine Power.

418
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:10,770
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

419
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:18,160
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

420
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,490
He didn’t say that.

421
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,180
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

422
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,240
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

423
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,330
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

424
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:45,810
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

425
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:56,980
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

426
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,300
you have done.

427
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:05,490
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

428
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:11,750
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

429
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,960
Then He has written about gnyana.

430
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,330
Gnyana means “where you know.”

431
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:24,910
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

432
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:33,400
Gnyana means to know what you are.

433
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:46,890
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

434
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:52,850
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

435
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:58,170
By reading books you become more ignorant.

436
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:06,810
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

437
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,970
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

438
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:16,930
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

439
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,380
You must know yourself.

440
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,770
It’s the second thing He has said.

441
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:24,000
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

442
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,600
Bhakti is devotion.

443
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,780
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

444
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:40,680
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

445
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,500
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

446
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,800
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

447
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:58,080
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

448
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,310
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

449
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:17,310
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

450
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:27,280
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

451
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,480
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

452
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,610
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

453
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:52,170
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

454
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,630
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

455
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:05,680
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

456
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:17,800
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

457
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,850
it, these people live in the jungles.

458
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:29,490
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

459
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:38,320
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

460
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,900
have tasted.”

461
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:48,480
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

462
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,440
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

463
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,890
to Indian culture.

464
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,300
But Shri Rama took it.

465
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,150
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

466
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:06,750
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

467
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,390
So Lakshmana got very angry.

468
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:13,820
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

469
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,010
to Shri Ram.

470
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,730
Why did you do that?”

471
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:25,250
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

472
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,600
He gave.

473
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,060
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

474
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,100
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

475
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:39,040
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

476
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,150
She said, “Why?

477
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,470
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

478
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,830
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

479
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,380
So what did He see in those fruits?

480
00:51:47,380 --> 00:52:00,550
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

481
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:06,980
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

482
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,970
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

483
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:17,350
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

484
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:26,420
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

485
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:36,130
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

486
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,761
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

487
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:41,761
food.”

488
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:44,690
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

489
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:52,100
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

490
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,690
Vidhura was a realized soul.

491
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:02,870
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

492
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,870
food.

493
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:09,930
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

494
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:18,200
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

495
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,540
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

496
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:29,940
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

497
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,660
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

498
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:42,900
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

499
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,510
should be understood and to be felt.

500
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:52,690
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

501
00:53:52,690 --> 00:54:01,340
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

502
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,340
there.

503
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:07,510
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

504
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,560
you will understand that person is spiritual.

505
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:19,600
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

506
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
but the genuine personalities that are there.

507
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,600
May God bless you all.

508
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Thank you.

509
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

510
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

511
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

512
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

513
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
how they will act and how they will work through
you.

514
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
(After the Puja):
Hello!

515
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
I would say that after this Puja I expected
all of you to keep quiet.

516
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,600
But everybody was talking, I don’t know
why, what had happened to you.

517
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
You must enjoy the silence within yourself.

518
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,600
I hope you will understand that.

519
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:32,602
Thank you.
