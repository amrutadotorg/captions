00:00.000 --> 00:02.030
Oh

00:04.900 --> 00:15.119
[Music]

00:15.690 --> 00:22.369
I bow to all the seekers of

00:31.970 --> 00:44.970
you have to know that truth is what it

00:39.090 --> 00:50.699
is we cannot conceptualize it with our

00:44.970 --> 00:54.210
human awareness we cannot order it we

00:50.699 --> 01:01.100
cannot manipulate it we cannot organize

00:54.210 --> 01:09.030
it it is what it is has been unveiled

01:01.100 --> 01:13.380
and what is the truth truth is that we

01:09.030 --> 01:17.840
are surrounded or we are penetrated or

01:13.380 --> 01:23.369
we are nourished looked after and loved

01:17.840 --> 01:31.349
by a very subtle energy which is the

01:23.369 --> 01:38.479
energy of divine love the second truth

01:31.349 --> 01:38.479
is that we are not this body this mind

01:38.990 --> 01:52.080
these conditionings this ego but we are

01:46.050 --> 01:56.130
the spirit you don't have to accept what

01:52.080 --> 02:01.410
I am saying blindly because blind

01:56.130 --> 02:04.250
well-trained leads to fanaticism but as

02:01.410 --> 02:09.300
scientists you must keep your mind open

02:04.250 --> 02:16.190
and see for yourself what I am saying if

02:09.300 --> 02:16.190
it is so honestly you must accept it

02:19.870 --> 02:36.440
we know so much through science about

02:25.659 --> 02:40.790
our civilization our advancement this is

02:36.440 --> 02:44.329
the advancement of a tree which has

02:40.790 --> 02:52.760
grown outside very much but if you do

02:44.329 --> 02:55.790
not know our roots will be destroyed so

02:52.760 --> 03:03.790
it is important to know about our roots

02:55.790 --> 03:11.750
and this is what it is that I would say

03:03.790 --> 03:15.340
are our roots as you can see there are

03:11.750 --> 03:15.340
seven centers within us

03:19.480 --> 03:35.569
and these subtle centers are placed in

03:27.920 --> 03:38.060
the spinal cord and in the brain these

03:35.569 --> 03:43.000
cater to our physical mental emotional

03:38.060 --> 03:47.269
and spiritual needs on the physical side

03:43.000 --> 03:52.909
they manifest the energy for the use of

03:47.269 --> 03:58.639
our plexuses which look after our

03:52.909 --> 04:05.480
physical problems that is on the right

03:58.639 --> 04:06.650
side this energy which is supplied by

04:05.480 --> 04:12.340
this yellow line

04:06.650 --> 04:18.199
a subtle Channel we call it as the

04:12.340 --> 04:23.479
Pingala Nadi this supplies energy for

04:18.199 --> 04:28.130
our physical and mental actions so this

04:23.479 --> 04:32.150
is the power of action within us which

04:28.130 --> 04:36.470
also caters to the Wrights sympathetic

04:32.150 --> 04:40.010
nervous system the another channel you

04:36.470 --> 04:45.470
see on the left hand side is the channel

04:40.010 --> 04:48.229
by which we desire put our energy to our

04:45.470 --> 04:54.560
desire so this is the power of desire

04:48.229 --> 04:58.940
and looks after our emotions this is the

04:54.560 --> 05:02.840
one which looks after our conditionings

04:58.940 --> 05:09.860
also at the end of these two channels

05:02.840 --> 05:13.310
they create two institutions one on the

05:09.860 --> 05:16.310
right side crosses over and the yellow

05:13.310 --> 05:19.970
balloon that you see is the ego is the

05:16.310 --> 05:23.300
balloon of ego that we have and the left

05:19.970 --> 05:29.500
hand side one that which conditions our

05:23.300 --> 05:29.500
mind is the balloon of super-ego

05:29.979 --> 05:36.370
as we start growing in age by the time

05:33.520 --> 05:45.009
we are 12 years of age these two

05:36.370 --> 05:52.270
completely meet and the soft bone in our

05:45.009 --> 05:57.099
head becomes completely calcified now

05:52.270 --> 06:02.139
there's third energy within us which is

05:57.099 --> 06:04.300
in the center and this Center central

06:02.139 --> 06:09.430
energy is the one which has made us

06:04.300 --> 06:14.650
human beings and these centers are the

06:09.430 --> 06:23.500
milestones of our evolution so now the

06:14.650 --> 06:31.479
last jumping is left out it has reached

06:23.500 --> 06:38.020
up to the limbic area now only thing is

06:31.479 --> 06:47.430
it has to break through the soft bone in

06:38.020 --> 06:52.110
the on the head and break through that

06:47.430 --> 06:52.110
which is the actualization of baptism

06:52.319 --> 07:04.779
baptism is not an artificial thing it is

06:59.080 --> 07:12.310
an actualization but the energy that

07:04.779 --> 07:16.860
does it is we call it sleeping energy in

07:12.310 --> 07:21.430
the triangular bone called as sacrum

07:16.860 --> 07:24.599
that means the Greeks knew that this is

07:21.430 --> 07:29.020
a sacred bone that we called it sacrum

07:24.599 --> 07:33.629
this energy has to rise and break

07:29.020 --> 07:37.000
through that fontanel bone area and

07:33.629 --> 07:40.419
connect us to that subtle divine power

07:37.000 --> 07:43.050
which we have never felt during human

07:40.419 --> 07:43.050
awareness

07:47.479 --> 07:57.800
thus we get connected to this divine

07:53.460 --> 08:01.440
power and we start feeling it on our

07:57.800 --> 08:05.069
fingertips is described in the Quran

08:01.440 --> 08:08.340
that at the time of resurrection your

08:05.069 --> 08:12.150
hands will speak and they will give

08:08.340 --> 08:14.909
witness against you that is you start

08:12.150 --> 08:19.319
feeling your own centers these are five

08:14.909 --> 08:20.610
six and seven centers and they indicate

08:19.319 --> 08:29.039
what's wrong with you

08:20.610 --> 08:31.139
within yourself what's the problem also

08:29.039 --> 08:34.440
you can feel the cool breeze coming out

08:31.139 --> 08:37.560
of your head cool breeze of the Holy

08:34.440 --> 08:44.490
Ghost because this sleeping power which

08:37.560 --> 08:48.660
is called as the Kundalini Kundalini is

08:44.490 --> 08:51.500
coiled it's the power of pure desire

08:48.660 --> 08:51.500
within us

08:51.970 --> 09:05.080
[Music]
