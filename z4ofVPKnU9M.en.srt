1
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,021
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

2
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and I'm happy so many have come here

3
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,320
from various places.

4
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,920
You know that by puja you,

5
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,920
you excite the Chakras within Me

6
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,080
and you get lots of vibrations,

7
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,160
and you achieve,

8
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,800
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

9
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You do achieve that, but

10
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,840
after some time they say that:

11
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,400
Mother, again we come down.

12
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
Also, they were saying that:

13
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,680
"When we go to India we are all right,

14
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,760
and when we come back, again we come down."

15
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

16
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
which is a very good thing.

17
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,880
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
is a very, very

19
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,000
positive thing because

20
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,800
that is how Ganesha is established here.

21
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,920
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

22
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,800
but collective living of spirituality.

23
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,640
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

24
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,640
And we have to know certain things about

25
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
the discipline that we have to keep,

26
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,600
is very important.

27
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
It's not just a house where are... some people

28
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,440
have gathered together to live together,

29
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
but it has to have a discipline.

30
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,080
Then only you'll be helped

31
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,600
because if you do not come

32
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,080
to the Ashram with this idea

33
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,240
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

34
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,880
it will make no difference

35
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,000
whether you stay in the house

36
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
or you go in the Ashram.

37
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,960
So there are two types of meditation,

38
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,680
two types,

39
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,680
where one is the meditation where -

40
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,880
we can call it the antarmana -

41
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,480
that we meditate inside ourselves,

42
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,240
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

43
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,880
and how we have to correct,

44
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,560
what we have to do about it.

45
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,120
And another is bahirmana,

46
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
is outside,

47
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,880
how we have to live outside.

48
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,240
You have to have a discipline,

49
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
which is not imposed on you

50
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,560
but, very happily,

51
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
which you have

52
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,840
accepted

53
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
and have imbibed.

54
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,720
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

55
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,840
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

56
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,920
to achieve any height.

57
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,360
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

58
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,880
You cannot take just easily everything.

59
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,920
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
there is no penance for you.

61
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,360
It's all blessings.

62
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,040
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

63
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,440
if you have to really get into yourself

64
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,040
in its full depth.

65
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,000
So, for the antarmana it is important

66
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,960
that you all should meditate,

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,520
morning and evening, every day.

68
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,679
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

69
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,920
but you must meditate is an important thing.

70
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,880
That is the reason I find that in the West

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,880
people go on catching,

72
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,920
again cleaning, again catching.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Every time I come... find somebody is suffering

74
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

75
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,520
or say, some sort of a baddha,

76
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,040
or sometimes it's ego or something.

77
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
It comes and goes.

78
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,440
It is not something that is detached permanently.

79
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
As we have to take our bath every day,

80
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,200
we have to wash ourselves every day,

81
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,920
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,960
So meditation is the antarmana

83
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,440
tapaha, as you can call it.

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

85
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,880
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

86
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,520
You have to just do this meditation

87
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,200
early in the morning.

88
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,200
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

89
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,680
I would say the best that is working out

90
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,960
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

91
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,760
and also England, but not to that extent.

92
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,200
I would say these two are working out the best;

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,760
and thirdly, in Rome.

94
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,920
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

95
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,000
but for them it is very important to achieve

96
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,400
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

97
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,720
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

98
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,920
Invariably, in all these ashrams

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,760
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

100
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,160
I also get up every day at four.

101
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,000
Then I may sleep later on,

102
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
but at four o'clock I am up.

103
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,440
They take their baths,

104
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
get ready for the pujas,

105
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,080
and then sit down and do about

106
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,800
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

107
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,640
and then meditate.

108
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,280
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

109
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
Then when they come home from work,

110
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,280
also they sit down together to meditate,

111
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,760
that's the collective part of it,

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

113
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,760
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

114
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,560
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

115
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
or they decide what should be done,

116
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,960
what is the best way

117
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,960
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

118
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,080
And then in the night, before sleeping,

119
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,080
invariably all of them,  all of them,

120
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,760
one and all, even children before sleeping,

121
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,320
soak their feet in the water,

122
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,960
sit for meditation, and sleep.

123
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,280
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

124
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,720
and Germans.

125
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,960
You know, Germans are like that.

126
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,680
If something gets into their heads,

127
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,880
for them that's the most important thing;

128
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,920
then they do not sort of fickle out.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There's no...

130
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,960
they don't have any compromises on those points.

131
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,680
And they make their body work hard.

132
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

133
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,520
- the penance?

134
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,960
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

135
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,000
India also, we are all like that in India

136
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,240
- everybody will get up in the morning,

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,200
and they will sit for puja,

138
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,880
or they will sit for meditation.

139
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,160
I mean, that goes without saying,

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,320
you don't have to tell them.

141
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

142
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,240
always when they get up, have their bath,

143
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,680
they always do some puja,

144
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
all of them.

145
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,880
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

146
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,360
Muslims, they'll do namaaz.

147
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,080
That's a kind of a practice,

148
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,640
and the breeding of the family.

149
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,400
Here I find that the parents

150
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,080
do not take the responsibility

151
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,480
to pass on any information to children

152
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
about disciplining themselves,

153
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,200
because children are also extremely aggressive.

154
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,160
They don't want to know about it.

155
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,880
So the parents also dare not tell them

156
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,120
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

157
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,760
it is better that you meditate."

158
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,720
They're afraid that they may lose their children

159
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,280
if they tell them like this.

160
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,000
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

161
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,000
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

162
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,720
This is the greatest crime in the West,

163
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
if you tell them that:

164
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,640
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - abbah.

165
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,560
It's like the worst punishment.

166
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,480
But once you start getting up in the morning,

167
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,920
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

168
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Then you can sleep early.

169
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,880
Getting up in the morning, really,

170
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,200
will help you for the whole day.

171
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,760
So start this kind of a practice.

172
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,760
You must meditate every day,

173
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,760
and this is the reason why I find people,

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,360
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

175
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
something gone wrong.

176
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,040
This is wrong, that is wrong;

177
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

178
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,560
Day by day, you must rise.

179
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,480
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
and this new breeding has to come within us,

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,080
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

182
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,400
And we are not here only,

183
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,760
just to have good food and to have a nice time

184
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,680
or nice meetings, but we are here

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,840
to become those unique personalities,

186
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
which are required to raise the humanity

187
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,960
to a higher state.

188
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,920
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

189
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,360
You have to look after yourself

190
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,400
and you have to tell yourself:

191
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,720
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

192
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
please now behave yourself."

193
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,840
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

194
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,560
It's not going to help you much.

195
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,000
We might increase in quantity,

196
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,800
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

197
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,000
and one attack of negativity can finish

198
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,160
such a quantity that we think is too much

199
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,520
- it has happened once.

200
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
So now, all of you must develop

201
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,240
that dedication to yourself,

202
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,000
to find out what's your problem,

203
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,720
and how you have to correct it.

204
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,880
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

205
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,080
you will have no problem of any kind.

206
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
Your thoughts will stop,

207
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,360
your problems will be solved,

208
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,000
and you'll have no catches at all,

209
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,920
because you have washed them off.

210
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,240
But if you leave them on your being,

211
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,920
then they grow, and they become big.

212
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,960
So there should be no lethargy,

213
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,720
as far as meditation is concerned,

214
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,600
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

215
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

216
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

217
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,200
and tell yourself

218
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,680
that this body has to be cleaned;

219
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,320
but more than that body,

220
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,600
this mind and intellect, both of them,

221
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,200
are to be corrected.

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,760
To be an instrument of God,

223
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,880
you have to be perfect,

224
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
perfect personality,

225
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,920
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

226
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,720
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

227
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,880
Many people say that:

228
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,680
"We are surrendered to Mother,

229
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,920
and we are surrendered to Her,

230
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,080
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

231
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,840
But what are you surrendering?

232
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,280
Is that a clean heart,

233
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,920
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

234
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
Or is that the intelligence,

235
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,120
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

236
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,960
Or else, are you coming out

237
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,840
with all your arrogance?

238
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,920
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

239
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,080
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

240
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,960
A stone cannot fetch any water.

241
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,160
Same with children.

242
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

243
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,040
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

244
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,920
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

245
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,640
It is obvious that we have never had

246
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,680
the sense of Divinity in the West.

247
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,320
Whatever we had, whatever we got

248
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,000
from the church or from any

249
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,120
synagogue or something like that,

250
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,960
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

251
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,200
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

252
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,000
finished.

253
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,920
But that has led them nowhere.

254
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,160
So we have to do something about it.

255
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,280
Problems will be solved in no time.

256
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,200
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

257
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,240
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

258
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,240
It will be solved.

259
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,080
But what cannot be solved

260
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,240
is the habits you have developed,

261
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,560
habits of lethargy.

262
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,840
I can understand in London

263
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

264
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
They have become extremely,

265
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,960
extremely hardworking,

266
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,280
active,

267
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,640
and also dedicated.

268
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,440
How they have achieved it?

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,720
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

270
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,080
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

271
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,280
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

272
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,400
You won't be able to even hear Me,

273
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
it is useless.

274
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,840
So our instrument has to be perfect

275
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,880
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

276
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,400
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

277
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,080
like, first it will affect you,

278
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,200
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

279
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

280
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,360
and gradually they'll find out

281
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
there's something wrong with you.

282
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,920
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,360
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

284
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,880
because I don't find anything great about this man.

285
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,120
He's halfway here and halfway there."

286
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,720
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

287
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,320
you'll be amazed that you can develop

288
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,760
such capacities

289
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,880
that you will be amazed at yourself.

290
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,240
Of course there are blessings, there are miracles,

291
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,560
but think of your own capacities.

292
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,280
What are your capacities?

293
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,160
How far are you able to do

294
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,200
something about curing people?

295
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
We have few people in Bombay,

296
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
and very few people in Pune also.

297
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,880
But they are available for curing.

298
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,800
Some of them are going to villages.

299
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,360
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

300
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,080
so they could take a music party to the villages

301
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,720
and sing there,

302
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,200
and achieve

303
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,440
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

304
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
But when they come back, immediately,

305
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,520
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

306
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
immediately they wash their feet

307
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
before the photograph.

308
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,160
Also to protect yourself,

309
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

310
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,880
all the time.

311
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,000
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

312
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

313
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,080
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

314
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,880
Never, never think like that.

315
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,080
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

316
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,080
you are finished.

317
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,360
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

318
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

319
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,960
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

320
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,920
It's very amazing how things work out.

321
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,080
Immediately you will know a person

322
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,880
is meditating or not, immediately.

323
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,120
It's like he is a person who

324
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,280
has given a bath to the child.

325
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,000
Though he has given a bath to the child,

326
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,440
still he has not taken a bath.

327
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,160
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

328
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
In the same way, those who have been meditating

329
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,320
every day, morning and evening,

330
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
not much time needed.

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,480
You see, we waste all our time

332
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,240
in something nonsensical.

333
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,560
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

334
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,640
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

335
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,840
then only you can handle them properly.

336
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,720
All this knowledge is for you.

337
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,880
Is absolutely free as you know,

338
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,160
and all this mastery can be yours.

339
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,000
So do not just get satisfied:

340
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,560
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

341
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,880
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

342
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

343
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,760
Come back home just the same.

344
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,240
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

345
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,640
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

346
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,440
And if you cannot develop that depth,

347
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,920
then you are still a mediocre.

348
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,360
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

349
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,640
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

350
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,240
Never.

351
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,240
Only when they had completed their oneness

352
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,520
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

353
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,880
between the oneness of God

354
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,000
and your relationship with that,

355
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
absolutely –

356
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,560
nobody would do anything before that.

357
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

358
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,000
that as soon as you get Realization,

359
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
you can start giving Realization to others.

360
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,120
Immediately.

361
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,080
Just under your hand you will see

362
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
the Kundalini will move.

363
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,280
You put your hand on somebody's head,

364
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,240
and you'll find that person gets realization.

365
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,280
It's a fact.

366
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,680
It just works that way.

367
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,720
But that means, for many:

368
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,680
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

369
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,120
After all, is all done by Mother,

370
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,520
we have just achieved something."

371
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,160
You can always understand that

372
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,880
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

373
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,480
and not a weak instrument.

374
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,720
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

375
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,840
who have gone very deep into it.

376
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,840
Invariably, whenever I asked,

377
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,000
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

378
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,640
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

379
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,000
We either wash our feet

380
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,880
and sit down before Your photograph

381
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,800
and worship Your photograph,

382
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,400
or else in the morning time also

383
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,080
we do something like that."

384
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,440
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

385
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,160
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

386
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,600
but immediately I know

387
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,040
who has been meditating every day.

388
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,320
Now, it is for us.

389
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

390
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,920
now, more than twenty years,

391
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,920
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

392
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

393
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,960
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

394
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,520
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

395
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,880
So much time we have had.

396
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,120
Of course, I would say,

397
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,040
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

398
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,240
but whatever time you got the Realization,

399
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,080
I did not judge how far you were in it.

400
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,000
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

401
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,640
They got their Realization.

402
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,720
So once they got their Realization, you see,

403
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,640
people who have really

404
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,080
felt the responsibility,

405
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,320
from the very first day they got to it,

406
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,640
from the very first day.

407
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,160
I didn't have to tell them.

408
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,418
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

409
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,600
And they have done, they have shown

410
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,720
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

411
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,080
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

412
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,880
Indian girls from there,

413
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,600
just for you to know that

414
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,840
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

415
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,640
Definitely can help you.

416
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,520
You have to have a proper type of a person,

417
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,640
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

418
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,840
that they can impart everything,

419
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,760
and they are least bothered about their ego.

420
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
There's no ego at all.

421
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,880
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

422
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,760
You are achieving it because

423
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,840
you are a seeker,

424
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,560
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

425
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,360
So it is to be understood that it's not

426
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,800
something like a advantage in money wise,

427
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
or something that I have to have a power,

428
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,000
this, that;

429
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
because if you do not meditate,

430
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,920
your attention will go to such things.

431
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,360
Immediately you'll start thinking:

432
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,760
Can I become the leader?

433
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,000
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

434
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,000
How can I insult him?

435
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

436
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
How can I work it out this way?"

437
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,480
You try to insult also.

438
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,360
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

439
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
anger,

440
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,720
because you are not yet, I should say,

441
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
that much evolve, evolved,

442
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,880
so much mature, so much wiser.

443
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,160
So now, what you have to do

444
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,160
is to... at the very

445
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,880
first shot when you get up in the morning,

446
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,000
you first say that: "Let me see,

447
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,040
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

448
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,080
After some time you will start enjoying it,

449
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,320
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

450
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,636
such tremendous experience.

451
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,680
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

452
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,000
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

453
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,880
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

454
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,080
please take away; because

455
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,640
I'm a seeker out and out,

456
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,000
I don't want all these things."

457
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,920
But if you do not meditate,

458
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,920
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

459
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,080
and you may try to become the leader,

460
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,713
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

461
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:46,360
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

462
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,720
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

463
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,320
If you write them down,

464
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,116
you will not know how to stop laughing.

465
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:01,040
So to warn yourself, I would say that

466
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,144
the only way to protect yourself is to do

467
00:30:05,224 --> 00:30:07,640
the meditation in the morning and evening,

468
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,120
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

469
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,840
Yours is a very important role

470
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,440
and a very important time,

471
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,784
extremely important.

472
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,120
You have no idea,

473
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,120
that in the history of spirituality

474
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,990
no one could do so much as you can do.

475
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,640
So, if you really

476
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,800
do the Antarmana,

477
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,520
if you really see inside yourself,

478
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,689
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

479
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:01,721
and then you find out this introspection:

480
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,697
Why am I like this?

481
00:31:03,777 --> 00:31:06,057
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

482
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,817
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

483
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:13,986
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

484
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,920
These questions when answered,

485
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,914
you will know all your worth, your value.

486
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,236
I do not know how much I should stress,

487
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:35,006
how much more is needed to stress

488
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:39,206
the importance of meditation, every day.

489
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:41,913
Like these advertisements you see,

490
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:45,006
every day they just go on bombarding

491
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,070
on your head, and:

492
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,757
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

493
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,812
It acts.

494
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,880
In the same way, you have to every day

495
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,160
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

496
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,880
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

497
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,843
Then you'll be surprised

498
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:09,213
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

499
00:32:09,293 --> 00:32:11,857
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

500
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:14,083
Don't have to do.

501
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,951
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

502
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:21,281
the other person, you both will go.

503
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:26,148
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

504
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,080
And such beautiful feelings come in,

505
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,469
such beautiful security is built up

506
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:38,570
that you are surprised:

507
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,911
"How I could be like that?

508
00:32:40,991 --> 00:32:45,356
How I could feel these securities just expressing

509
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:48,998
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

510
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:55,324
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

511
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:57,629
- simple thing, everyday life –

512
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:01,920
then before touching any, everything you are careful

513
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,800
that you don't again spoil them.

514
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:10,475
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

515
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,920
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

516
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,733
makes no difference.

517
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,160
But when it is absolutely clean, then

518
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,340
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

519
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,761
because everybody will see that.

520
00:33:26,198 --> 00:33:27,975
In the same way,

521
00:33:28,055 --> 00:33:30,602
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

522
00:33:30,682 --> 00:33:33,649
you will not know what's wrong with you.

523
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,840
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

524
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,019
with full attention

525
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:51,441
on your inner being

526
00:33:52,102 --> 00:33:54,562
projecting out,

527
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:59,002
like a witness to yourself.

528
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:03,007
Just see how you talk to others:

529
00:34:03,318 --> 00:34:05,418
"Why should I talk like that?

530
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:08,012
What is the need to talk?"

531
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,753
And then you'll start understanding

532
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,697
that behind all this

533
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:16,998
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

534
00:34:21,422 --> 00:34:24,532
and this brain has to be corrected

535
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:26,388
- Very important.

536
00:34:26,627 --> 00:34:33,096
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

537
00:34:33,176 --> 00:34:37,251
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

538
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:45,025
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

539
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:49,202
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

540
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:55,576
If it could be done,

541
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,739
you find out: "How far I have gone

542
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,866
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

543
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:11,459
How far I can go?"

544
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,252
It's really remarkable because,

545
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:19,544
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

546
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:23,878
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

547
00:35:25,071 --> 00:35:27,880
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

548
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,767
which I have not yet read.

549
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,682
They have read all kinds of things,

550
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,755
just to find out how far they are,

551
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,370
and as a result

552
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,516
they themselves went on developing

553
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:46,450
very, very deep into their beings;

554
00:35:46,586 --> 00:35:49,554
but the way, you see,

555
00:35:49,634 --> 00:35:54,140
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

556
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,810
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

557
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,627
you won't show off, you won't show off.

558
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:03,866
You'll just emit.

559
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,847
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

560
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:14,071
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

561
00:36:14,246 --> 00:36:17,840
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

562
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,573
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

563
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,920
Just walking inside the house:

564
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,923
Some cooler has come.

565
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
You just felt, you know;

566
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,721
like in the forest if you go,

567
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:37,458
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

568
00:36:37,538 --> 00:36:40,141
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

569
00:36:40,221 --> 00:36:44,698
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

570
00:36:44,778 --> 00:36:48,406
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

571
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,316
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

572
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:54,080
Look at these saints, they didn't know

573
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,080
how to raise even the Kundalini,

574
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:59,026
but they were very pure people.

575
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,920
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

576
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,880
They never gave Realization to anyone.

577
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,880
They were extremely pure people.

578
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,380
There was no impurity left in them.

579
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,745
And so, how much they could produce:

580
00:37:12,825 --> 00:37:15,745
what poetry, what work,

581
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:21,008
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

582
00:37:21,088 --> 00:37:24,691
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

583
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:28,511
such depth in whatever they did,

584
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,115
such effectiveness.

585
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:34,062
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

586
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:35,904
not to gain money,

587
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:40,429
not to gain positions,

588
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:44,602
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

589
00:37:44,682 --> 00:37:48,710
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

590
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,731
All the satisfaction,

591
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,960
everything is there.

592
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,506
It will have an effect on the children.

593
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:06,904
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

594
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,240
in every way, and the personality.

595
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:17,509
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

596
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:21,081
but collectively doing it.

597
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,541
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

598
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:30,541
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

599
00:38:30,666 --> 00:38:33,656
a collective meditation.

600
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:38,080
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

601
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,279
four o'clock, collectively.

602
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:43,080
So they know how many are there,

603
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,786
and how many are missing, this, that.

604
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,889
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

605
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:51,356
When those who have been doing meditation like that

606
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:54,894
rise so high, others start following them.

607
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,410
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

608
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,737
It's I; I have to look after myself.

609
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:06,126
It's very selfish: Swarth.

610
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:08,569
You have to know the meaning of Swa

611
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,277
- that is selfishness –

612
00:39:10,357 --> 00:39:13,880
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

613
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,880
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

614
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,920
Supposing your husband is funny:

615
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,515
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

616
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:26,070
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

617
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,000
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

618
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,080
and all those who have thought like this

619
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,134
and have acted like this,

620
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:37,040
were above everything.

621
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,251
Nothing can put them down.

622
00:39:40,382 --> 00:39:43,420
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

623
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,142
I bless you all, that you should have

624
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:50,477
this full idea about yourself,

625
00:39:50,587 --> 00:39:52,612
why you are on this earth,

626
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:56,149
and what great work you are supposed to do.

627
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:58,380
Each one of you is capable.

628
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,380
Each one of you can do it,

629
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,664
but you... I would request you

630
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:06,791
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

631
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,380
which are already there.

632
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,401
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

633
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:13,545
and once you start manifesting,

634
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:16,621
see your temperament how it is.

635
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:19,575
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

636
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:21,627
May God bless you.
