1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
There we go.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.800
Jaya Shomadaji everyone.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.200
If not everybody knows me, I'm Teresa Cody.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.160
I've been here at the Kanu Johari since March of 2005.

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.780
And it's been, as Shomadaji says, Sahaja life is been an adventure.

6
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:30.100
And I believe my adventure started in 1999, when I went with a yogi to drop her children

7
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:37.300
off one in Rome school and one in Dharamshala.

8
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180
What I remember about Rome school was quite funny.

9
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
I was sitting, came to breakfast late and there was an American yogi there and she goes,

10
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.860
ah, you can't sit there.

11
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.100
That's Guido seat.

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.460
I just laughed and said, okay, and moved.

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.740
Then I went to Dharamshala from Rome.

14
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.220
There to this day has been my best meditation ever in my Sahaja life has been up at Dharamshala.

15
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.860
And I really feel Shomadaji was just preparing me for here.

16
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.900
Because when I was there, I said, I could do this for two or three months.

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.740
And right now our terms are three months long.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.380
And how I came here was quite a story also.

19
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.780
I came, the couple that were here before couldn't stay for some reasons.

20
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.020
And I remember being really upset, disturbed, more than upset that the school wouldn't continue

21
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.740
running because my husband was already here.

22
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.660
He came in October of 2004 to be the caretaker of the land.

23
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.780
And I knew I was coming, but I had a job working on an organic farm.

24
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.260
I said, I'll come in the spring.

25
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.300
She'll be able to find help in the spring.

26
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.580
I'll wait to then.

27
00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.060
And we quit our jobs in 2004, June of 2004, went to Guru Puja and then moved to Maine.

28
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.380
So I'm in Maine.

29
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.520
My husband's in Kannada Hari and I knew I'd come to Kannada Hari and I didn't sleep well

30
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.520
that night.

31
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.340
So then I got up in the morning.

32
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.220
What's so, cause I really didn't sleep well.

33
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.260
And then when I'm upset, I like to talk to Shamaadaji out loud.

34
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.780
It was just me in Maine alone.

35
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.300
The yogi I was living with was on holiday.

36
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.300
And I just prayed, Shamaadaji, we really need the school to keep going.

37
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.140
We really need to establish the Ganesha Tatva in the Americas.

38
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.780
And please help us to continue this school to grow and be an instrument for you.

39
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.180
So then I was very nice and then I sat and had my silent meditation.

40
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.920
And after that felt so peaceful, I was just like, okay, feel peace now.

41
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.180
Getting up, finished walking into the kitchen and make my breakfast.

42
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.700
And the leader at the time, Manoj Kumar had called and he says, oh, so what are your plans?

43
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.340
I said, well, I'm going to move to Kannada Hari, but I have, we need to get a job because,

44
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.360
you know, we didn't retire.

45
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.920
We quit and we didn't have bills.

46
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.120
And so he goes, oh, yes, you're going to come to Kannada Hari.

47
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.600
He said, yeah, in the spring.

48
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.640
He goes, well, how would you like to be the head dormantji?

49
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.920
And I was just like, oh, I was like, um, um, uh, can I get back to you?

50
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.480
And then of course, I said, yes, because I just saw that as, as, as that's where Shamaadaji

51
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.080
was leading me.

52
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.360
And remember telling my kids that I was very nervous that I didn't know everything in Sahaja

53
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.460
and he's, my kids laughed at me and said, ah, but that's what a mantra books for.

54
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.120
And by Shamaadaji's blessing, um, every term and from the very beginning, she has always

55
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.280
sent yogis that have, um, helped me learn things that I didn't know.

56
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.760
And now my new, um, part of my speech when staff comes, as I say, uh, you know, we all

57
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.760
learn from each other.

58
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.320
And I know you're here to teach me a lot of things as I hope that I'm able to teach you

59
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.480
a lot of things.

60
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:23.600
And um, so the school's been running now, like I said, since September of 2004, um,

61
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.600
had over probably a hundred kids, children who've come through the Khandaja Hari school.

62
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.320
Maybe that's partly why Shamaadaji guided me here.

63
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.320
As I remember, I was in the Jersey ashram and helping prepare for her breakfast while

64
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.240
she was staying in the Jersey ashram.

65
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.200
And I was very excited to help.

66
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.680
And I had made, um, cantaloupe and blueberries.

67
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.520
I love blueberries.

68
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.560
And we sent this in with other things on her train back in the kitchen came her tray and

69
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.840
it, and where the cantaloupe, where all the blueberries were still there, she had all

70
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.720
the cantaloupe and the Yogi who was the main cook at that time said, Shamaadaji said, blueberries

71
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.920
are for little girls.

72
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.560
So I was disappointed, but then again, it was prasad.

73
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.080
So it was just like, I, I just felt like it was another way of her saying, it's okay to

74
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.320
be, have that young at heart.

75
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.680
Simpa, I'm a very simple person.

76
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:33.840
What else can I tell you about Kannada Hari?

77
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:40.440
One other story that I didn't hear personally, but Yogi had told us that when they did decide

78
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.120
to put a school in her home here in Kannada Hari, Manoj called her and asked the blessing

79
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.600
to use her home.

80
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.720
And she said, yes, obviously.

81
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.720
And she said, but once you start, you can't stop.

82
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.840
And the Yogi who told me the story said she called back like two or three hours, hours

83
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:10.240
later and said this again, that once you start, you can't stop.

84
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.760
So I, how I interpret that, it's just important that we keep working on this Ganesha Chatura

85
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:26.760
of the Americas here and establish that blessing on, on this land that she's also found for

86
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:35.760
us in the early nineties and keep that going.

87
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.000
I don't know what else to say, cause it's so I've been here so long that like things

88
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
are so routine.

89
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.880
And I can tell you that it was tough closing for COVID.

90
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.160
Since then, we haven't really gotten back into full swing.

91
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.680
We used to have 15 kids were at 12.

92
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.120
Always trying to look for staff.

93
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.640
And I don't know, I think it's a really nice, different than all the other schools because

94
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640
we are so small.

95
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.660
I remember we had an auntie two terms ago and she goes, I like this family feeling.

96
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.600
And that's really what you have that you're just living with a large family and working

97
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600
it out.

98
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.220
You know, and the here you're 24 seven together.

99
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.460
It's town is least 15 minutes, 20 minutes by car.

100
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.100
So you've got to really like the nature and be able to find your inner peace and go for

101
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:40.620
walks and just enjoy where you, where, where you are is one of the, I think, one of the

102
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.680
sometimes that's what's hard for some people to come and some people just love it.

103
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:54.280
So it's nice to have these different schools where you can get different the different

104
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.860
fields of all the different schools.

105
00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:06.060
But I'd be nice to have if anybody have any questions, I'd be loved to ask, ask, answer

106
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.060
questions.

107
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.060
Yeah, go ahead.

108
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:19.940
Anybody, if anybody has any questions, anything been anything tree so that you would a class

109
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.140
as a miracle while you've been at the school?

110
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.140
Hmm.

111
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:34.620
And I can think of some for my own self.

112
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:42.220
The one that really is that I that I always have always felt guided my whole life since

113
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.740
I was little.

114
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.820
And I feel that's Shama did he still does that here?

115
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.820
Like my first term here, you know, I let the kids play outside by themselves, because that's

116
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.660
what we did with our own children.

117
00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.300
And I remember being in the kitchen, which is the front of the house, where the kids

118
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.600
should not be.

119
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
And I remember

120
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:09.240
Shama and then looking up and there's the kid two kids up front who shouldn't be up

121
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.240
front.

122
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
I don't know if that's a miracle.

123
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.680
But that many I have many stories like that were the what I've seen here for me, how well

124
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.000
the power of your attention really works.

125
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:32.780
And just with with the children with adults, if you put your attention on us in a surrendered

126
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.520
way, the things just work out.

127
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.080
I remember one lady was here and I said, I should really talk to her about that.

128
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.480
And I just put my attention on it and then let it go.

129
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.680
And then the next day, she's doing what I did that I had put my attention on for her

130
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.960
to do.

131
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.840
And I've seen that also with the kids.

132
00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:03.800
But I can't really think what I would consider a miracle off the top of my head.

133
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.800
But yeah, I think it's been a blessing to be here.

134
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.720
I've grown so much.

135
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:21.720
I really my first term, I remember wondering why I was here and what boom did I ask for

136
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.400
to be here.

137
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:30.760
And I really feel blessed to be able to grow as a yogi around children because they're

138
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.360
unconditional love.

139
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
That's it.

140
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.280
You know, I remember another time I was in my room and I was upset and I came out after

141
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.960
I and a little girl just walk up to you and said, Auntie, I love you.

142
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.480
And then when you have something like that happen, you have no problems, none at all.

143
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:56.680
And I think this is just this school in America is really important in that establishing the

144
00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.600
Ganesha Tatwa.

145
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.800
And that's what she said when she bought the land.

146
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.280
She said this land is now to help America establish the Ganesha Tatwa.

147
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:21.200
Does anyone else?

148
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:30.720
I just find it I find it so beautiful that you that you I don't know, just your sincerity

149
00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.160
and your.

150
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:40.320
The simplicity of your surrender, I feel is the miracle for me.

151
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.920
That you're just so.

152
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.480
That I think it's so normal for you to be in this beautiful atmosphere of love and and

153
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.880
in the vibrations that you don't even realize that this this just you saying I feel surrendered.

154
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.960
I just feel like it just like everything works out.

155
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.640
I find this is a miracle in and of itself to have that kind of a constant all the time

156
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.120
because most of I can speak only for myself that I get that just from time to time.

157
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.200
Oh, yes, it will.

158
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.600
Everything will be fine.

159
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.840
But you are living that all the time.

160
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.560
And it's just very nice to hear.

161
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.480
Yeah, I have been through a lot of challenges where I've doubted that sometimes.

162
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:35.640
But recently I pulled a lead card and everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of.

163
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.640
I was smart.

164
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.320
I did tell some.

165
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.480
Yeah, tell some road ashram in 1981, New Year's Eve.

166
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.840
And I've been reading that almost every day because I've been through a lot of different

167
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.960
trials and tribulations here, too.

168
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:57.560
But it really once you can get once you as you're going through it, if I have my moments

169
00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:04.280
of being detached and not being detached, but it's what I feel that yogis that have

170
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.840
come through here have helped me through this all.

171
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.680
Also, I met people.

172
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.840
You've done so much there.

173
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.720
I said, but I don't do it alone.

174
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.320
I'm going to have Shomadaji and then I have all the yogis that she sends here to help.

175
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.160
So I think that's more the most important thing.

176
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:30.760
I think having that faith, really having that faith in Shomadaji, really, it's just a huge

177
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:48.580
blessing that I've earned work through here, I fully believe also.

178
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.960
Anyone else have anything they want to ask Teresa about or any comments they want to

179
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.000
make?

180
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:07.400
Yeah, it's just I think it's that of all the I mean, there's so many projects where people

181
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.680
have their attention on their thing.

182
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.800
And that's when people say you've done it for so long.

183
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.600
I said, but this is where Shomadaji put me.

184
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.640
And we all do our part for Sahaj in our own way.

185
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:25.600
And I think that's just the blessings of the diversity of what she's brought us all.

186
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:43.360
Sorry, we can't hear that.

187
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:59.320
The sound quality is really bad.

188
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.160
And we can't hear what you're saying.

189
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.600
Do you want to type it?

190
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.920
Type it to me and then I can read it out maybe.

191
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:17.240
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

192
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:27.520
I was just letting you know that I checked you in.

193
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.520
But that's a yes.

194
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.520
Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.520
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:36.480
I'm not sure what that's happening.

197
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.480
What's happening with Anna?

198
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.960
Um, well, I have a question.

199
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.520
Yes, please.

200
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.720
Teresa, how many?

201
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.240
How many people from how many countries have come to help at the school?

202
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.720
And isn't it a miracle every time that you get enough staff?

203
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.200
I gosh, I've never counted that the adults, I can meet.

204
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.320
I mean, people from all over have been here.

205
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.320
Yes.

206
00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.920
I mean, that's the whole thing that you have to, we used to have more people in the when

207
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.320
I first came used to have to pick, actually.

208
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.120
And now it's gotten where, and this is, I think, a phenomena happening all this, not

209
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.760
just here, but other schools, too, is that it always works out in the end, always of

210
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.360
getting the staff.

211
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:36.480
But yeah, we've had people from Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Brazil, Colombia, Italy,

212
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.880
England, France.

213
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:46.200
It's a little easier now in the beginning, it was getting from people from Brazil and

214
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.000
Colombia before it was very difficult.

215
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.320
They wouldn't even make it here before.

216
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.320
So, yeah.

217
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.320
What is that because of visa difficulties or?

218
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.200
Yeah, back in the day, it was very anybody from Colombia, when Mary Laura was still around,

219
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.920
she said, forget it, they'll never get visa don't even try.

220
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:17.880
Now it's India, actually, you can't get somebody just asked how many, what is the age of the

221
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.120
kids here?

222
00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:28.160
They're pre-K, kindergarten, and first, so it's four, five, and six.

223
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.320
And when I was first here, we were kept going up in grades because kids didn't want to stop

224
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.320
coming.

225
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.240
But then we had a huge wait list.

226
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.280
So then we cut back the grade to first grade, because it's a nice transition if we just

227
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.080
had a boy here come last term, and now he's just going to Dharamshala from here.

228
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.760
Yeah, it's the same ages as Ramaushram used to be, isn't it?

229
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.840
I believe so, yes.

230
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840
And Boratine also.

231
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.840
Yes.

232
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.400
I don't know what was the other part of the question?

233
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.920
I didn't read it all.

234
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.280
Yeah, any plans to make more grades later?

235
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.240
But I think you've answered that.

236
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.920
Yeah, yeah, that's.

237
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.680
Yes, we've been trying to expand for a very long time.

238
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.680
It's a Maya, it's a big Maya.

239
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.000
But yes, we were hoping to go up.

240
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I think it was Robert Hunter, he said that it would be good if you went up to fifth grade,

241
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.440
because then that it would complement Kibela.

242
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:40.400
And then it would also, if people wanted to go to Davie School now, because Davie School

243
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.600
starts at sixth grade.

244
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.640
I saw she wrote, what's stopping the expansion?

245
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.040
That's a good question.

246
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.040
I don't know.

247
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.560
I really don't know.

248
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.480
Different are the hard part for us is we change our V&D every two years.

249
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:08.280
So it's when you get new people in, then you have to start sometimes fresh again.

250
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.240
So you change your what?

251
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.400
We call our council the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

252
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:25.100
And it changes every two years, half go out and a new half come in.

253
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.400
So when you do that, then you get new people in and then the people have been there for

254
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400
a while.

255
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.080
And then they'll say we want to review it again.

256
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.120
And then by the time they review it, it takes, you know, we're all volunteers, takes a while

257
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.240
for them to get it on, get going.

258
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:52.960
And then I think it's been, yeah.

259
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
So I don't know.

260
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.960
I mean, people could say it's not the collective will, but I think it's just maybe our maturity,

261
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.160
the maturity of our collective.

262
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.800
That would be great if we can give Bandhan's something needs to work out because I feel

263
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:15.160
this it's getting not just in America, I don't know what how it is in other countries, but

264
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:24.520
the Ganesha, Tod one, all this LGBTQ stuff is just it's tough stuff to watch.

265
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.200
Oh, yeah.

266
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.360
Especially in the Janaki, you know, Janaki shut day.

267
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:37.880
She's a first grade teacher and she's, you know, had to see it out there in her classroom

268
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.880
too.

269
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.480
Sorry, Teresa, what what age is first grade?

270
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480
Sticks usually.

271
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.480
Oh, really?

272
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.480
Yeah.

273
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.640
Because you go to kindergarten when you're five.

274
00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.680
And yeah, sixth grade is Yeah.

275
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.040
Well, and she's in a very lives in a very liberal state.

276
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.360
I'll ask that too.

277
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.400
So it's the parents.

278
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
Yeah.

279
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:09.720
It's different in different and she lives in a city area also.

280
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.560
But many years ago, she said, like had to be 10 years ago.

281
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.640
And this happened long ago.

282
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.320
And even you're not allowed to even hug the kids.

283
00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.400
You can't call them a boy or girl.

284
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.440
You have to call them them.

285
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.800
So yeah, it's started a while ago.

286
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.040
It's just progressively gotten worse, or more acceptable by people in which then influences

287
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.400
goes into the public schools.

288
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.640
Yeah, there's a strong need for Ganesha tat for that.

289
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.640
Yeah.

290
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:46.280
So one question here is, do you have to be assessed by the local authority?

291
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:52.400
Um, no, in a sense that, uh, because we're established.

292
00:21:52.400 --> 00:22:02.000
Already, we don't have a lot of Yeah, no, we don't.

293
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.640
I mean, they all know we're here.

294
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.800
Especially, it's a very small town, very small town.

295
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.480
They know we run a school, we do get what we call the Department of Health.

296
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.960
They're the ones who inspect our kitchen, and make sure that we're doing everything

297
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.480
sanitizing and preparing food properly and all that.

298
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.800
But they do come every term they come and inspect us.

299
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.640
But that's the only like authority type thing.

300
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:37.360
We do have to do like water samples, but we have informed the local school district.

301
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.360
We're here.

302
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:45.080
We've told the local fire department, which is volunteers, we're here, but that's pretty

303
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.280
on authority level that we have to do.

304
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:58.200
Teresa, do you still need volunteers for this coming session?

305
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.400
No, right now we're pretty good.

306
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:13.360
We possibly may need one more, but right now we're ready to go.

307
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.160
We start March, the kids come back on March 23rd.

308
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.480
We'll run to June 8th.

309
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:31.160
I think we cut it by one week, so we didn't get too close to Adi Shaktipuja.

310
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.400
I'm just sitting enjoying the vibrations after having given that band room.

311
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.400
They're really cool.

312
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400
Yeah.

313
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.240
There's been a lot of work going on now.

314
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:58.600
I mean, there's all, I'm trying to be detached, but it is our desire to have it here on the

315
00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600
land.

316
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.440
But some people have other ideas of possibly buying a building somewhere else.

317
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.760
Let's see what gets worked out.

318
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.560
And I'm going to be 62 this year.

319
00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:20.440
So I've told the, we have a school board also, and I've told them, listen, I would

320
00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.120
like to be Auntie Carolyn.

321
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.480
Auntie Carolyn came here for many years and was like the grandma and helped out.

322
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.080
And I'd like to pass off the responsibility now.

323
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:37.320
Let's see how Shimon-Oji works that out.

324
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:44.080
I think like Mary Kuhn always says up in Davis School, it's nice to have that change

325
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.920
because you don't know what will bring, you know, the next person will bring into.

326
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.600
And I remember telling Florina Wallenberger when I came because I thought this was going

327
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.120
to be a temporary position.

328
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.400
It wasn't anything I applied for.

329
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.160
I mean, I applied sort of, I guess, to Shimon-Oji.

330
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.400
But I was told Florina when I came because she was on the board at that time.

331
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.680
And she said, I said, well, as soon as you find somebody that's more suitable or more

332
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.480
qualified, just let me know.

333
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.480
I'll step aside.

334
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480
It's no problem.

335
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.120
So but here I am 19 years later.

336
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:31.400
So I guess that person hasn't gone forward yet.

337
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:40.560
Like I said, I feel it's I've learned so much in my being here and growing and just being

338
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560
me.

339
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560
It's been nice.

340
00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:56.320
I've met a lot of beautiful people coming through here.

341
00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:04.160
What's the proportion of Indian children to white Americans?

342
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:12.360
It's pretty high, more Indian, but it's I consider them American too, because they've

343
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.480
been born here.

344
00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:23.320
But yeah, that's our it's more definitely more Indian kids than white kids, if that's

345
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.220
what you want to say.

346
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.940
And then the second half of the question is, are children of new yogis coming to the school

347
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.860
as well?

348
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.700
Not yet.

349
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.580
We have an auntie who's coming from Vancouver.

350
00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:41.340
Her name is Emily.

351
00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.700
She's only been in Sahaj for like five years.

352
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.420
And this is her third time coming to help us be an auntie.

353
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.920
And she has a daughter that's three and a half.

354
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.840
So maybe she would be one of the first ones.

355
00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.120
But I think, yeah, I don't know.

356
00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:06.400
I don't think we've had a and maybe I don't know, Joe would know if we have more younger

357
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.440
new people coming.

358
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.400
I think it's more.

359
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.920
Adults with their kids are grown or older, too old for Kanu Johari.

360
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:25.200
And you haven't quite been there yet long enough yet to get the children of children

361
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.680
that have been through the school.

362
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.640
No, we did have it's the second one.

363
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640
It was really fun.

364
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.400
Last term, we had a young girl who was here.

365
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.400
She's 19.

366
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.480
She was a student.

367
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:45.880
And just by coincidence, her dorm auntie was also an auntie last term.

368
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.280
So that was fun to see.

369
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.520
It was interesting to have the student and her dorm auntie both here.

370
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.480
But now her students taking care of kids also.

371
00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.800
Her first welcome was after the parents left, one of the girls.

372
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.880
Felt got sick and threw up and and Lalita goes, oh, my gosh, is this what I'm going

373
00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.440
to be doing and catching it in her hands?

374
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.560
So I said, no, it'll turn around.

375
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.800
Trust me, it was a good opening for her, I guess.

376
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:31.880
But she has such fond memories of here when she was here as a little as a student, too.

377
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:35.120
And there's another message, just big thanks for all the years and all the love that you've

378
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.320
given to our kids there.

379
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.320
Thank you.

380
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:46.440
It's been my again, like I said, my blessing and my it's one thing that I usually do before

381
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:53.200
even we start looking for staff and I ask I ask him one of my meditations to Shomadaji

382
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.200
if she still wants me to be here.

383
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.640
And so far, I keep getting yes.

384
00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:05.280
So when I get the no, then I'll that'll be my time.

385
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:11.320
But it's my true desire if it's meant the Shomadaji's will, if we do get somebody else

386
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:17.600
that I'd like to at least teach somewhat that I know because a lot of it is a living

387
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.740
experience and you're going to have to live and learn on your own.

388
00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:29.160
Like I did that some of the simple stuff of mostly helping her with a person with like

389
00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:36.080
when kids get sick, how do you what do you do and how to help?

390
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:44.640
Yeah, just navigate certain things that I've learned.

391
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.120
I would feel really privileged if I was able to do that.

392
00:29:51.120 --> 00:30:04.480
Okay, I think if there's no more questions, I'm going to stop the recording.
