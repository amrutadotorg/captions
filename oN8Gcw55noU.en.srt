1
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:21,077
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

2
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:28,695
that the last work of the Divine,

3
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,771
of opening the last centre

4
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:43,917
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

5
00:04:00,815 --> 00:04:11,611
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

6
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:32,690
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

7
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:51,387
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

8
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:56,843
how things are worked in the heavens.

9
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:14,730
It is your fortune and God’s love

10
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:20,345
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

11
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,837
Without this happening, there could not
have been

12
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:45,144
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

13
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,842
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

14
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:05,640
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

15
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:25,694
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

16
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:41,552
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

17
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:53,930
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

18
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:15,190
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

19
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:25,798
and, with the permutations and combinations

20
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:36,624
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

21
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:46,038
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

22
00:07:47,604 --> 00:07:56,936
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

23
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:13,046
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

24
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,546
and the whole thing came on this Earth

25
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:29,438
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

26
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:43,412
with such a tremendous force,

27
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:53,158
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

28
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:05,368
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

29
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:16,299
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

30
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:43,504
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

31
00:09:51,203 --> 00:10:01,827
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

32
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:13,063
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

33
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:20,160
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

34
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:25,442
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

35
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:41,392
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

36
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:56,152
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

37
00:10:56,353 --> 00:11:00,879
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

38
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:18,087
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

39
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,755
on their golden seats,

40
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:38,507
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

41
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:46,333
like a big dome,

42
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:52,981
and opened it,

43
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:57,613
and then this torrential rain

44
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:04,145
completely drenched me

45
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:15,586
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

46
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:31,259
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

47
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,462
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

48
00:12:50,954 --> 00:13:00,014
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

49
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:13,161
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

50
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:22,520
and I became absolutely silent.

51
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:38,006
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

52
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:53,116
But I saw all stones.

53
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:07,165
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

54
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,763
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

55
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:24,696
appearing like inflated flames.

56
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:38,410
It is a thing which is seen by many people

57
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:50,280
but to see it pour that torrential rain

58
00:14:54,584 --> 00:15:00,295
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

59
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:09,899
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

60
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:20,230
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

61
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:31,576
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

62
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:41,037
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

63
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:52,048
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

64
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:58,867
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

65
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:02,584
you cannot see its beauty;

66
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:12,119
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

67
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,472
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

68
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:33,923
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

69
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:41,548
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

70
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:55,559
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

71
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,905
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

72
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:28,725
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

73
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:47,968
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

74
00:17:55,207 --> 00:18:03,399
and you are drawn out to people

75
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:12,326
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

76
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:28,293
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

77
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:43,085
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

78
00:18:48,960 --> 00:19:00,591
And even if you desire to ope
 the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

79
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:14,904
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

80
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:19,932
has to be through human beings.

81
00:19:31,068 --> 00:19:33,823
The power could be with you,

82
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:39,589
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

83
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:53,527
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

84
00:19:57,982 --> 00:20:01,104
How to get them?

85
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:06,674
How to work it out?

86
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:13,792
So I started looking out for people,

87
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:23,366
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

88
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:31,492
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

89
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:40,042
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

90
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:46,859
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

91
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:58,765
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

92
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:08,764
And her brain would be covered with clouds

93
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:14,230
and darkness.

94
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:20,704
Again and again I had to enlighten it

95
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:26,776
but she did not get her Realisation.

96
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:35,666
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

97
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,938
This capacity I had from childhood.

98
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:50,595
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

99
00:21:54,437 --> 00:21:59,221
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

100
00:22:03,953 --> 00:22:09,072
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

101
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:13,690
because I was not living in the forest,

102
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:22,546
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

103
00:22:29,563 --> 00:22:35,219
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

104
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:42,871
and I had to do this work among them.

105
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,270
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

106
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,719
and the false [one] in which they live?

107
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:13,393
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

108
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:20,307
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

109
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:29,038
and it worked in her.

110
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:37,389
That was not the happiest day,

111
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:45,941
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

112
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:55,886
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

113
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,034
We had a programme in Bordi

114
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:12,443
in ’70,

115
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:19,895
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

116
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:32,361
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

117
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:40,857
and they started talking of favouritism.

118
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,015
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

119
00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:01,879
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

120
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:10,377
I was in a great fury.

121
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:17,132
I had never gone into such a fury before

122
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:22,679
and I lashed out at them.

123
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:32,307
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

124
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:41,222
That was the greatest moment.

125
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:47,482
Then many got, one by one.

126
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:55,821
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

127
00:25:56,022 --> 00:26:00,578
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

128
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:12,295
So the mass evolution started.

129
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:21,350
Sahasrara is your awareness.

130
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:25,928
When it is enlightened

131
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:34,659
you get into the technique of the Divine.

132
00:26:35,852 --> 00:26:39,286
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

133
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:43,617
and the technique that you follow.

134
00:26:50,054 --> 00:26:59,402
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

135
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:16,137
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

136
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:27,737
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

137
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:35,625
When your Sahasrara opens out

138
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:44,985
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

139
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:56,829
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

140
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:11,512
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

141
00:28:16,322 --> 00:28:24,520
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

142
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:35,143
and your nadis get enlightened;

143
00:28:39,748 --> 00:28:42,437
not all of them,

144
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,209
quite a lot of them;

145
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,881
not all the length,

146
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,950
but quite the peripheries.

147
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,282
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

148
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:07,327
So many things happen

149
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:14,351
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

150
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:24,179
With the light you see their relative
positions.

151
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:34,971
I mean you do not see, but it work
 in your conscious mind.

152
00:29:40,806 --> 00:29:46,426
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

153
00:29:55,585 --> 00:30:03,821
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

154
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:13,515
It becomes one with your attention.

155
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:18,632
Wherever your attention goes

156
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:23,771
you act in a collective way.

157
00:30:25,248 --> 00:30:31,335
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

158
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:39,312
The attention itself is effective.

159
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,728
Your attention is very important,

160
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:52,584
your desires are even more important.

161
00:30:55,903 --> 00:31:04,049
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

162
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:12,648
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

163
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:20,608
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

164
00:31:28,164 --> 00:31:32,112
The priorities change very fast.

165
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:40,074
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

166
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:46,049
may not find that happening

167
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,912
but those who are over mentally developed,

168
00:31:55,621 --> 00:32:01,840
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

169
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:08,070
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

170
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:12,929
They want to see that it is logical.

171
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:25,075
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

172
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:33,926
We have some people like that among us.

173
00:32:35,983 --> 00:32:40,050
They just became and they never questioned.

174
00:32:43,552 --> 00:32:46,518
They just settled down.

175
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:53,105
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

176
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:57,546
above all they are spiritual.

177
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:02,393
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

178
00:33:02,594 --> 00:33:06,634
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

179
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:15,233
First of all you have to put down your ego

180
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:20,192
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

181
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:27,749
Also the super-ego must be reduced

182
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,812
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

183
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:44,601
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

184
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:52,678
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

185
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:06,487
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

186
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:20,136
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

187
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:29,027
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

188
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:33,905
it closes back.

189
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:37,614
That’s like a poison.

190
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,913
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

191
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:52,147
If you go about with the poison

192
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:58,598
then it again closes.

193
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:09,111
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

194
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:14,720
and all other problems of the ego,

195
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:20,485
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

196
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:27,210
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

197
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:33,329
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

198
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:38,937
and wrong books,

199
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:42,267
from wrong parents maybe,

200
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:45,731
from a wrong country,

201
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:52,276
from a wrong livelihood

202
00:35:53,389 --> 00:36:00,513
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

203
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:11,445
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

204
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:18,211
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

205
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:25,756
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

206
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:37,395
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

207
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,351
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

208
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:50,640
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

209
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:54,867
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

210
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:07,501
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

211
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:17,893
We have to have more and more channels

212
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:25,010
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

213
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:36,963
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

214
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:50,433
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

215
00:37:55,736 --> 00:38:00,150
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

216
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:08,874
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

217
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:20,306
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

218
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:31,636
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

219
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:39,471
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

220
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:55,498
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

221
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:59,835
that he should not have bad company,

222
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:09,074
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

223
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,774
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

224
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:22,547
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

225
00:39:31,073 --> 00:39:37,142
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

226
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:46,487
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

227
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:08,065
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

228
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:20,520
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

229
00:40:22,634 --> 00:40:27,741
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

230
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:36,147
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

231
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:44,044
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

232
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:54,223
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

233
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,508
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

234
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:10,514
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

235
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:22,346
so all other things must drop out.

236
00:41:26,523 --> 00:41:31,547
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

237
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:39,115
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

238
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:45,803
that you can really correct yourself

239
00:41:52,494 --> 00:42:01,342
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

240
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:13,326
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

241
00:42:16,678 --> 00:42:22,469
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

242
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:30,105
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

243
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:37,035
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

244
00:42:37,236 --> 00:42:42,967
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

245
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:55,133
For that tolerance is needed,

246
00:42:57,413 --> 00:43:00,511
wisdom is needed,

247
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:05,714
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

248
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:13,484
which you are,

249
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:20,334
and you should talk like a prophet.

250
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,819
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

251
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:40,561
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

252
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:47,752
This is not insincere or acting

253
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:53,574
because now you are awakened.

254
00:43:55,274 --> 00:44:02,909
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

255
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:31,171
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

256
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:48,849
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

257
00:44:54,216 --> 00:45:00,797
one has to watch one’s own growth.

258
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:08,810
Never justify your wrongdoings.

259
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:20,289
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

260
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:28,059
We have no time to think about oneself.

261
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,164
You have to think of others

262
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:40,011
because others are also in your brain;

263
00:45:42,425 --> 00:45:46,375
and when you start thinking of others,

264
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:52,532
talking to them about their resurrection,

265
00:45:55,375 --> 00:46:05,251
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

266
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:15,802
The sensitivity will also increase,

267
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:19,688
the depth will also come in.

268
00:46:20,865 --> 00:46:26,901
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

269
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:38,763
So you have to come out of your shells

270
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:45,931
and spread your wings.

271
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:52,025
All small things of mind

272
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,286
must be given up.

273
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:09,312
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

274
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:19,830
which has to give support,

275
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,548
guidance, help

276
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:29,601
and awakening to thousands.

277
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:37,603
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

278
00:47:40,756 --> 00:47:47,084
establishes a new dynamism

279
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:51,771
in this country,

280
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:55,409
I am sure

281
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,245
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

282
00:48:09,302 --> 00:48:14,146
It will resound into their brains,

283
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:22,625
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

284
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,065
and they will start thinking afresh.

285
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:42,859
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

286
00:48:46,853 --> 00:48:55,464
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

287
00:49:00,879 --> 00:49:04,300
They’ll come to right conclusions.

288
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:11,521
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

289
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:22,915
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

290
00:49:24,814 --> 00:49:29,565
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

291
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,421
The way you treat your Spirit

292
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:41,236
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

293
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:56,618
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

294
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:06,256
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

295
00:50:11,393 --> 00:50:17,925
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

296
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:28,491
And then you can become a subtle being.

297
00:50:30,048 --> 00:50:34,459
Through your conscious effort,

298
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:40,817
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

299
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,852
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

300
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:58,206
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

301
00:51:04,097 --> 00:51:06,623
When you start developing higher and
higher,

302
00:51:06,824 --> 00:51:12,969
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

303
00:51:20,072 --> 00:51:23,442
You may not have any interest in many
things

304
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:31,162
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

305
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:42,907
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

306
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:58,437
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

307
00:52:04,907 --> 00:52:11,317
So you become the master of your brain

308
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:17,615
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

309
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:25,556
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

310
00:52:25,757 --> 00:52:31,473
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

311
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:40,927
And the light of that expands

312
00:52:41,985 --> 00:52:47,115
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

313
00:52:50,332 --> 00:52:54,467
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

314
00:52:54,668 --> 00:52:58,836
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

315
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:05,239
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

316
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:26,222
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

317
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:35,600
their obstinacy

318
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:39,984
and childish pranks.

319
00:53:42,643 --> 00:53:45,887
Let the man rise

320
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:53,563
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

321
00:53:56,834 --> 00:54:05,079
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

322
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:26,630
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

323
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:33,411
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

324
00:54:43,068 --> 00:54:47,046
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

325
00:54:47,247 --> 00:54:52,144
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

326
00:55:02,604 --> 00:55:06,614
That is what is your job,

327
00:55:08,631 --> 00:55:14,255
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

328
00:55:18,534 --> 00:55:26,848
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

329
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:35,764
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

330
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:53,681
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

331
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:59,594
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

332
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:07,099
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

333
00:56:19,537 --> 00:56:23,329
neglected by all the deities,

334
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:30,359
because human beings really went very
wrong.

335
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:43,867
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

336
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,010
because this is the attention,

337
00:56:54,012 --> 00:57:02,511
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

338
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:21,589
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

339
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:31,964
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

340
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,461
and  towards the eternal life.

341
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:42,888
Is [a] very important country,

342
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:49,395
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

343
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:59,707
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

344
00:58:04,558 --> 00:58:08,813
They have to change their methods

345
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:11,672
and styles.

346
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:16,375
They should be very mild, gentle

347
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,920
and healthy people

348
00:58:23,176 --> 00:58:28,531
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

349
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:34,633
so that when others see them

350
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:39,542
[they] find that superiority in them.

351
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:47,830
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

352
00:58:48,031 --> 00:58:51,023
I am very happy about you.

353
00:58:56,707 --> 00:59:00,096
May God bless you all.

354
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:05,314
Now I bless all the other centres,

355
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:10,664
who have prayed and are praying;

356
00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:16,375
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

357
00:59:17,504 --> 00:59:20,506
an enlightened one,

358
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:25,704
that will separate them from their small
shells.

359
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:31,932
Let them expand so much,

360
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:38,899
that they become one with the whole.

361
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,234
May God bless you all.

362
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:52,219
May God bless you.

363
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,645
Good (…)
