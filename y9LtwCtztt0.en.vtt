WEBVTT

00:06.060 --> 00:17.652
Today, we are going to do Puja to Shiva,
Shri Shiva.

00:19.141 --> 00:30.748
As you know Shri Shiva is the reflection
of Sadashiva within us.

00:31.041 --> 00:35.418
I have already told about the reflection.

00:35.619 --> 00:40.990
Sadashiva is the God Almighty,

00:43.585 --> 00:50.619
the One who sees the play of Adi Shakti.

00:51.500 --> 00:56.816
But He is the Father

00:59.466 --> 01:07.620
who is watching each one of His Creation
or Her Creation.

01:09.113 --> 01:21.507
His support to Adi Shakti is entirely,
fully strengthening.

01:22.912 --> 01:32.178
Thereâ€™s no doubt in His mind about
the capability of the Adi Shakti.

01:32.837 --> 01:41.395
But when He finds that, in the play
of Adi Shakti,

01:43.211 --> 01:52.623
the people of the world as such, try
to disturb Her,

01:52.824 --> 02:01.628
or spoil Her work then He gets
into His wrathful mood

02:01.829 --> 02:11.982
and He destroys all such people and maybe
He destroys the whole world.

02:16.693 --> 02:20.157
On one side He is wrathful no doubt,

02:20.358 --> 02:27.673
on the other side He's the ocean
of compassion and joy.

02:28.658 --> 02:33.734
That's why when He's reflected within us

02:34.529 --> 02:41.126
we get our Self-realization. We get
the light of our spirit

02:41.327 --> 02:48.687
and we get into the ocean of joy.

02:48.972 --> 02:54.281
Also He is the ocean of knowledge,

02:54.482 --> 03:02.422
So, those who get self-realized get
the knowledge of the Divine,

03:03.081 --> 03:13.663
which is very subtle, permeating into every
atom and molecule,

03:14.314 --> 03:20.903
the power of this knowledge is there.

03:21.874 --> 03:26.915
Now we should know what is this
Realization we have got.

03:27.116 --> 03:30.697
What does that mean and what is
the culminating point.

03:31.840 --> 03:37.066
Now the first step is to become
thoughtlessly aware,

03:37.267 --> 03:43.047
where you cross your mind. You go above
your mind.

03:43.248 --> 03:49.106
Mind cannot affect you. This is the first
stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

03:49.307 --> 03:55.718
Second one is where, you see, start seeing
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

03:55.919 --> 04:00.990
of this all-pervading Power and you start
becoming aware

04:01.191 --> 04:08.945
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji
says.

04:09.146 --> 04:14.161
That there is this power, which works out
many things.

04:14.362 --> 04:18.020
It works miraculously so many things
for you.

04:18.221 --> 04:25.535
It gives you blessings, it guides you,
it helps you, in so many ways it helps you.

04:25.736 --> 04:32.355
It gives you good health, good wealth and
also a very good society

04:32.556 --> 04:36.836
of very beautiful people in the collective.

04:37.037 --> 04:40.556
All that you can see clearly is happening
here.

04:41.049 --> 04:46.937
Now this main question today, which
I'm going to tell you about

04:47.132 --> 04:52.933
that what is God's realization. First is
the Self-realization

04:53.134 --> 04:57.982
and there are many ambitious people who
want to become God's-realized.

04:58.183 --> 05:03.755
First and foremost thing we should know
that human beings cannot become God.

05:03.956 --> 05:06.760
It's not the becoming of it.

05:06.961 --> 05:13.250
You have not become also in a way spirit
because the spirit is emitting through you,

05:13.451 --> 05:18.138
using you, giving you, looking after you.

05:20.641 --> 05:24.809
If you become the spirit there won't be
any body left, nothing will be left.

05:25.010 --> 05:29.809
So with this body intact, your spirit
is acting through this body,

05:30.010 --> 05:33.545
is giving you all the light.

05:33.956 --> 05:39.757
But one cannot become God Almighty; this
one has to understand very clearly.

05:39.958 --> 05:45.319
But what is God's realization is to know
about God.

05:46.874 --> 05:56.210
You see, to know about God means to know
how His powers are working.

05:58.265 --> 06:05.511
How He controls by becoming part and parcel
of God Almighty.

06:05.712 --> 06:14.004
Like My finger doesn't know about My brain,
but it acts according to My brain.

06:14.205 --> 06:17.655
The finger cannot become the brain,

06:17.856 --> 06:23.136
but it has to act absolutely according
to My brain

06:23.337 --> 06:27.558
because it is so connected, it is so one.

06:27.759 --> 06:34.121
Here when you have the God's realization
then you know about the brain,

06:34.322 --> 06:41.947
you know about God, you know about His
powers, you know everything about Him.

06:42.148 --> 06:48.684
As far as I'm concerned it's a difficult
task for you, because I'm a Mahamaya.

06:48.885 --> 06:52.594
It's very difficult for you to know each
and everything about Me.

06:52.795 --> 06:57.836
I'm quite a elusive person as you know that
well,

06:58.037 --> 07:06.038
and whatever I do or whatever I achieve,
it is just for you to see and understand

07:06.239 --> 07:11.800
that after all this is Adi Shakti and She
can do all these things.

07:12.001 --> 07:16.538
You can also do all the things but you
cannot become Me.

07:16.739 --> 07:25.900
But you have to know, to know through
love, through devotion, through prayers

07:26.101 --> 07:31.821
to know the God's Powers is the way you are
God-realized.

07:32.022 --> 07:37.029
Then you can control the nature, you can
control everything,

07:37.230 --> 07:41.532
if you have that knowledge within you
about God.

07:41.733 --> 07:47.734
For that a complete humility is needed that
you cannot become God,

07:47.935 --> 07:51.779
cannot become God Almighty. You cannot
become the deities

07:51.980 --> 07:58.376
but definitely you can become God-realized.
Means God acts through you,

07:58.577 --> 08:04.834
uses you as His power, as His channel and
that you know, that you know

08:05.035 --> 08:09.070
what He's doing to you, what He's telling,
what His vision is

08:09.271 --> 08:13.947
and what is the information. The connection
is like that.

08:14.148 --> 08:18.758
Many people in Sahaja Yoga have been
benefited, I know.

08:18.959 --> 08:23.132
But they don't know how they have been
benefited. What has worked it out?

08:23.333 --> 08:27.991
How it has worked it out. What connection
of theirs has helped them?

08:28.192 --> 08:35.319
Once you do that, you know that, clearly
how things are working out,

08:35.520 --> 08:42.046
with what power you have achieved it, then
it's a God's realization.

08:42.247 --> 08:47.308
Such people become extremely powerful
in the sense

08:47.509 --> 08:52.504
that they can control so many things.

08:54.948 --> 08:58.004
There have been many saints of that kind

08:58.205 --> 09:04.451
but sometimes they fell from even that and
they developed their ego.

09:04.652 --> 09:07.919
They didn't have their own humility that
they should have,

09:08.120 --> 09:13.452
that devotion, that dedication, that
surrendering.

09:13.874 --> 09:19.673
They fell down and you see them, I've seen
some of them that they become

09:19.890 --> 09:25.378
quite proud of their achievements and they
don't want to give it to anyone.

09:25.459 --> 09:28.034
They think they have achieved it with great difficulties

09:28.227 --> 09:35.016
and why should they give it to others. Such
people are not going to rise very higher.

09:35.217 --> 09:40.360
But you people who have got your realization
and who are humble,

09:40.561 --> 09:49.204
who know that out of humility only you are
going to achieve your surrendering.

09:49.405 --> 09:54.536
Islam means surrender. Mohammed Sahib has
talked about Islam,

09:54.737 --> 10:00.303
meaning, "you surrender." If you cannot
surrender you can never know God.

10:00.504 --> 10:04.105
Is clearly said that, "Unless and until you
know yourself

10:04.306 --> 10:07.523
you will not know about God."

10:07.724 --> 10:14.013
So as Sahajis you have to know all
the little, little things,

10:14.214 --> 10:18.643
all the big things, and all the great
visions,

10:18.844 --> 10:26.457
that you can do it because of the grace
of God, because His blessings,

10:26.658 --> 10:33.916
because of His love for you, that you have
entered into the Kingdom of God.

10:34.117 --> 10:40.104
I may say you have entered, I may say you
have achieved that state,

10:40.305 --> 10:46.906
I may say that. But still you are not
there.

10:47.107 --> 10:52.086
It's like if I tell somebody, "Now you are
in Australia."

10:52.287 --> 10:55.546
He's not in Australia, but I can say you
are in Australia.

10:55.747 --> 10:58.310
So he believes, "I am in Australia", that's
not the way.

10:58.511 --> 11:03.434
You have to be in Australia, then you have
to know about Australia.

11:03.635 --> 11:08.551
You have to know what sort of climate
it is, what sort of things it is.

11:09.032 --> 11:14.267
One flight is up to the thoughtless
awareness.

11:14.468 --> 11:19.667
The second one is up to the doubtless
awareness

11:19.868 --> 11:23.949
and the third one is to God's realization.

11:24.150 --> 11:29.449
I've seen people who are very close to Me
also don't understand.

11:29.650 --> 11:33.864
They behave in such a manner as if now
they've become gods.

11:34.065 --> 11:40.880
So egoistical they are that I am amazed at
them. Then they have to leave Sahaja Yoga.

11:41.058 --> 11:48.553
So you see, even if I praise you too much,
if I say anything too much,

11:48.754 --> 11:53.585
you shouldn't get pampered. It's a testing
ground.

11:53.786 --> 11:59.331
Or otherwise also if I tell you that,

11:59.532 --> 12:04.857
"This is not good, you should improve
on this", you shouldn't mind,

12:05.058 --> 12:11.999
because I have to do it, that's My job.
And your job is to listen to Me.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.369
Because I have nothing to gain from you.
I do not ask for anything.

12:16.570 --> 12:23.326
What I want is you all should get all My
powers. You may not become what I am,

12:23.527 --> 12:28.544
agreed, but please try to get all
the powers that I have.

12:28.745 --> 12:31.604
Which is not a difficult thing.

12:31.805 --> 12:39.331
This is what is God's realization. That's
what is to know Shiva and Sadashiva.

12:39.532 --> 12:43.412
Through the Shiva you know Sadashiva.
You see the reflection

12:43.613 --> 12:50.685
and from reflection you know who is
the original.

12:50.886 --> 12:57.930
From the reflection you learn. Thus you
reach that state where you think

12:58.131 --> 13:02.643
you are now definitely settled
in the Kingdom of God

13:02.844 --> 13:09.418
and that you can see God, you can feel God,

13:09.619 --> 13:12.916
you can understand God.

13:14.528 --> 13:18.120
And you can love God.

13:18.321 --> 13:20.571
So may God bless you.
