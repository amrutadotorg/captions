00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.630
Doctor sahab gave Me a pill to sleep

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.330
and I slept off.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.510
But, you all were singing songs here,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.640
I thought some people who did not get the chance to sing,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.210
also got the chance.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.210
Everything is going on well.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.330
But, when the whole world sleeps,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.960
then a Sahaja Yogi is awake,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.200
and when the whole world awakens,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.190
then a Sahaja Yogi sleeps.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.120
It means that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.350
the things towards which Sahaja Yogis are inclined,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.450
other people are not inclined towards them.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.270
They are inclined towards other things.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.200
In some way or the other, they turn their face from the truth.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.720
It means that some are caught up with money,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.350
some are caught up with power.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.280
Human beings get caught up with one or the other hassle,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.710
and get completely lost.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.680
They get away from the truth,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.110
their attention does not go towards truth.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.970
Some will say this is the reason or that is the reason,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.390
some or other analysis they will do.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.960
However I think, it is ignorance.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.970
In ignorance, people do all kinds of things.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.940
A sort of darkness,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.310
dense darkness falls on them.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.690
For example, if this place is plunged into darkness,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.820
there might be a stampede.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.710
Some may get up and start running,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.610
then many people might get knocked down,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.300
get trampled over or get hurt,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.300
anything can happen.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.230
When we are in darkness,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.360
then we are in a state of sleep.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.820
But when you are awakened,

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.420
when your Kundalini is awakened

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.590
and when you are confronted with the truth,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.320
then no one can describe the glory of that truth.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.780
I asked somebody: "What did you get in Sahaja Yoga?".

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.400
He said, "Mother, I can’t tell you what, but I got everything".

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.450
What does "everything" mean?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.210
I will also say that today, I got everything in Sahaja.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.640
When I was a child, I used to tell My father

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.340
that it is My desire, that like the stars in the sky,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.140
many people on earth should also shine like stars,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.920
and spread the light of God.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.880
He said, "It is possible.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.520
You find a method for en-masse awakening;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.980
don’t give lectures, don’t write anything,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.220
or else another Bible or another Quran will come up,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.870
and that will become another reason to fight about.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
So, first of all, You do en-masse awakening".

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.600
And the task of en-masse awakening started,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.000
spontaneously, in a Sahaj way.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.760
But, the problems associated with it,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.720
I have to tell you today.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.600
It is a great pleasure that en-masse awakening happened

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.380
and everywhere, in every country, in such great numbers,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.890
people have taken to the truth

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.300
and are in the bliss of it,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.360
But it hurts to think,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.870
that for en-masse Realization,

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.990
we have not been selective.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.120
We opened the door for all sorts of people to enter

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.600
and they brought their dirt along with them.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.300
When even a few such people come,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.070
they cause a lot of damage.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.410
Namadeva and others great saints, who have been among us only,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.630
had said very clearly that those who are bad can never become good.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.430
Their habits can never be corrected.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.320
He said, for example, take a fly.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.650
If a fly sits on your food, it will make you sick,

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.250
and if it dies and you eat it, then you will die too.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.300
The fly cannot become good,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.780
and there are a lot of people like this fly,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.070
who are very fond of jaggery

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.910
and they keep running towards it.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.870
So, in Sahaja Yoga all such things should drop off.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.550
We cannot ascend higher, until they drop off.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.920
If something gets stuck to the wings,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.160
then even birds cannot fly.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.820
That is why this sky of bliss

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.900
which poets have called “Raganchal” - the sky of Mother’s love -

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.850
in this sky,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.330
you still cannot fly like a bird

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.900
because something is still stuck to your wings.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.960
Today is a very auspicious day,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.950
and many people think of it as a great day,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.450
and on this day,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.820
something special happened.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.980
Many people have mentioned this.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.190
But on this day,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.950
you all have to do something very special.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.130
You have decorated this place with so many balloons.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.210
One becomes happy to see them and thinks,

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.800
that even rubber has so much power

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.160
to give us joy and happiness,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.250
and that also can become a beautiful thing.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.200
We are human beings

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.630
and on top of that we are Sahaja Yogis now.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.480
We are great people.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.540
So, what should be done to raise these yogies to a certain level?

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.970
Recently, I had an experience,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.470
which I am going to tell you as a story,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.190
that had hurt Me a lot.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.720
I am telling this in Hindi

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.830
because this shortcoming exists mainly in Indians.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.190
It is not common in foreigners and foreign countries.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.210
They don't have much understanding about it.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.280
Earlier, in our country,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.460
within our whole Mother India,

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.330
many kind of nations were integrated.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.850
You know Burma, Ceylon,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.180
Pakistan,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.760
Bangladesh, etc., many nations were a part of it.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.970
This is our mother - Bharat Mata.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.630
But people divided it.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.960
Why did they do it?

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.260
The reason is that,

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.310
for example, there were some people in this country,

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.210
who thought that, "This person became our country leader.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.620
He got a great postion,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.770
so I should also do something

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.760
so that I also get that a big position.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.160
If he can become Prime Minister,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.890
then I can also become Prime Minister".

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.930
First comes jealousy.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.020
They became jealous and thought, "If we have a separate country,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.420
if we divide the country,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.130
we will get a share of it and we can rule it".

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.890
Similar situation happens in big families as well,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.140
that people want their own house and want to stay separately,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.410
with their family and children

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.920
and have no connection with others.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.670
So, division became a nature of human beings.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.200
Because of this reason, Bangladesh was formed.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.140
I was quite surprised

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.010
that people demanded for Bangladesh so strongly,

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:06.730
because some people wanted to rule a country.

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.510
Now, in the name of Islam or any other religion,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.480
with some or other excuse, the partition was done.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.550
And today Bangladesh is in such a state

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.540
that people say, "Mother, you don't go there,

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.120
or else tears will keep on rolling down your eyes.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.010
It is that bad".

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:31.930
What is the condition of Pakistan?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.830
Ceylon, which is now called Sri Lanka, what happened to it?

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:43.810
By breaking the country into pieces,

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.070
they thought that they will rule it.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.920
Most of the prime ministers of these places,

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.610
who somehow managed to create a new country,

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.300
were killed. They were murdered.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.250
So, jealousy increases jealousy.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.690
And then such groups get formed

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.520
and then they fight.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.310
Even now the idea of division prevails in our country.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:21.820
Like we have Vidarbha here, or some Jharkhand, or some Bharkahand here.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.550
What is one going to achieve by this division?

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.130
What has anyone ever achieved by partition?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:36.340
Sahaja Yoga is totally against the partition of anything.

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.450
We want to unite everyone, synthesis.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.350
Synthesis is the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.810
If you can not even imagine the idea of synthesis,

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.720
then it is better that you leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.020
Recently, a very big incident took place,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.700
when a gentleman came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.400
He used to remove bhoots from everyone.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.490
I told him, "Stop this or bhoots will catch you".

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.510
But, it became his hobby.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.090
Maybe the people used to pay him,

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.550
or appreciate him, or whatever...

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.940
So he started a group of his own.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:20.380
Few such people from Sahaja Yoga also joined him.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.290
They all formed a separate group and made a separate institution.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.330
Yes, regarding Me they had no doubts.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.050
But, regarding leaders they said, "They are useless".

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.200
They found faults with everyone, with one person or another

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.580
and said, "We are leaders of pure conduct,

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.170
and we are Mother's devotees".

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.380
Without asking Me, without My permission, without telling Me,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.730
they made their own group,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:56.030
they used My photo and what not.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.140
I had no idea what was happening,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.930
what all businesses they were doing.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.570
Pointing out leaders that,

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.140
"This leader is not good, that leader is not good"...

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.580
If somebody is bad then I will know it Myself.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.530
When you believe in Me, you should leave things to Me.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.970
Let Me decide if a leader is good or not.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:24.050
But to criticise the leader saying, "You are like this!"; "Why did you do this?",

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.920
you do not have the authority to say that.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.780
Now someone will ask, "Why are there leaders in Sahaja Yoga?".

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.180
It is because it is not possible for Me to connect with everyone,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.600
so if there is a person in between,

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:44.080
then I can connect with everyone through him.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.300
So, they got angry with the leaders,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.740
"This leader is not good. He is like this or he is not like this".

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.100
If there is something wrong with the leaders,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.090
I should correct it, not you.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.970
What you should do is to write to Me.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.460
But, if you tell such people,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.400
"If you don't like the leader, you can leave Sahaja Yoga",

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.510
then 10 more half-baked Sahaja Yogis will join them.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.630
And then they will start talking ill about that leader.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.090
In the same manner, a group was formed

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.710
and about 70-80 people joined them,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.330
whom I had never seen or heard of before,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.330
and didn't know if they are Sahaja Yogis or not.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.440
Then that person said, ”I am the incarnation of Kalki”.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.880
Alright, if you are that, so be it. I have nothing to say.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.150
But, get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.590
There is no place for you in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.400
These people believed that he was the incarnation of Kalki

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.670
and started touching his feet and all that.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.950
There have been "maharajas" who get their feet touched and grab money.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.910
All sorts of "maharajas" are there and they became one of them.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.410
They took lot of money from people.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.940
Gradually, all the faults they were pointing out in the leaders,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.100
the same faults were present in them,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.940
all these faults got nicely exposed,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.810
and everybody was surprised.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:15.370
So this sort of jealousy and ambition manifest.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.250
But, all the fools in Sahaja Yoga

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.290
got filtered out and joined that group.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.050
It is really amazing.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:24.170
Since it is the Last Judgement,

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:28.310
all such people got filtered and joined together.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.810
They comment about the character of leaders,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.580
or that they misappropriate money, they are like this, like that -

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.410
these people investigate more than CBI.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:40.650
I am amazed that they crossed all the limits.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.840
At least consult Me. At least accept the certificate I give.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.800
You say, "We believe in You",

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.270
but you don't believe in what I am doing,

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.640
Then these stupid people reached Ganapatipule,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.420
and there they started throwing stones at Me,

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.990
because when one’s mind gets corrupt, when one loses wisdom,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.070
one is not aware of what one is doing or saying -

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.810
one behaves like a person who is drunk.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.520
And there they created a scene.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.000
They even came to the program. I felt such bad vibrations from them.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.410
I thought, "Oh my God, are these people going to be in Sahaja Yoga"?

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.510
Instead of correcting their vibrations,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.730
they were correcting other people’s vibrations.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.230
So, this kind of people who are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.220
should leave Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.870
because this is not Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.930
But, if one or two of that kind come up,

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.220
many people follow him, thinking he will lead them to heaven.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.230
This is not so.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:53.260
Sahaja Yoga is a collective movement.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.400
It is a collective institution.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.820
In this, if one's eye is here, other's nose is there, hand is elsewhere -

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.110
it’s just not going to work out that way,

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.440
because the Chaitanya does not like it.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.980
Then I said, “You are rebelling!”.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.140
Then they replied, “Are You abusing us?”.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:26.140
I said, “No, I am advising you not to rebel against the Chaitanya”.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.470
This is why there was an earthquake there.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.640
Who knows what else will happen in future?

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.580
As a Mother, I told them that the Truth and God will not spare them.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.570
I am a Mother, it is different with Me,

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.300
but they (God & Truth) will not spare you, so please leave all this.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:51.030
But as the saying goes, "Old habits die hard", that's the case here.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.370
They are still doing it.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:59.000
Now, I heard in Dehradun they are doing this in full force.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.300
On one side, there are creating Jharkhand,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.890
and on the other, they are creating "bhoot-khand" (land of bhoots).

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.130
Now, if these 4-5 bad people are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.780
then there are many people who will join them,

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.150
and they will form a new group.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.640
But, I am least bothered about that group,

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.820
they can very well go and drown themselves in river Ganges,

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.860
I don't care.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.780
But, they cannot be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.800
And they can't use either My name or My photo.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.230
Today, I felt very sad when I heard,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.600
that the person whom I trust so much, who has done so much work,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.540
was being questioned, "How did you get that car?".

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.690
Oh ho! He is working and has a business.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.530
Anyhow, I should be the one to ask.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.910
And still if you have any such "special" complaint then write to Me.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.860
I didn't want to say this today, but as there is no other time,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.570
I had to say these inauspicious things on this auspicious day.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.820
If you want to do this kind of business,

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.740
then you can go out of Sahaja Yoga right now.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.450
I have no objection in that.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.850
In Sahaja Yoga, there is no compulsion on anyone.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.340
I have never even forced My family to join Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.410
although I know that there is nothing greater than this.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.420
But I have never asked them to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.880
If you want to do it, then do it, otherwise don't do,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.190
but you should not do these kinds of things.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:35.000
That means you can never be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.870
In a way, from Sahaja Yoga point of view,

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:45.280
to behave like this towards your leaders is a great sin

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.230
and to form groups on this basis is an even greater sin.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.370
If you want, you can write to Me.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.760
I will check.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.480
In fact I can immediately know through vibrations,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.480
whether you are right or they are.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.260
They write all kind of things in their letters.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.590
Even when they write, they write such nonsensical things

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.840
that I don’t pay attention to it.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.920
"This leader is like this, that one is like that".

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.600
As if you yourself are a great soul!

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.430
You should see yourself.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.050
If you yourself are not alright,

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.390
then what will happen in the future?

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.130
You have children,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.230
and besides the children,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:44.670
all the people who live around you, your neighbors, what will they think?

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.200
If your leader is "like this"

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:52.420
won't they think, "Doesn't your Mother have some sense,

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.120
that She selects these kinds of leaders?".

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.960
These kind of problems start

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.260
and then Sahaja Yoga finishes there.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.890
Till now it has not finished anywhere like this.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.430
I have always tried my best to save all those who are drowning.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.350
It's better if they are saved somehow, and have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:21.660
But I also feel that this Heaven is based on truth,

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.980
so to go to this Heaven some preparations are necessary.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:35.160
If not, then there might be a shortage of space there,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.720
so, their destiny itself may try to push these useless people out.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.800
But you should not get caught in such affairs.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.730
If you are really aware,

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.600
then be aware of yourself, not about others,

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.760
be aware of your own self and see your shortcomings.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.930
Some people have some other affairs, like money affair.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.830
Some people come to Sahaja Yoga to earn money.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.850
If you tell them

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.400
that you are not here to earn money,

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.050
it doesn't enter their brains.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.960
I will also have to tell you today, that in money matters,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.080
some people have very little sense.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.700
Christ had said,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.420
"First will be the last and last will be the first",

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.410
but it doesn't seem like that.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.820
In the beginning, Sahaja Yogis who came to Bombay,

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.370
said, "Mother, at least take thousand rupees from each one of us".

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:41.540
I said, "Children, I neither know how to count money

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.460
or how to keep it, nor I know anything about banking.

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:52.050
But, if we can form something like what we call a trust,

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.910
then I will deposit your money in that".

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.450
Not because I want to show that I am very honest, nothing like that,

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.740
I do not know how to be dishonest, so what can be done?

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.510
If I don’t know how to count money, what should I do?

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.430
I don’t even know how to write a cheque.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.720
Anyways, let it be, I am made differently.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.910
But, you people know about it, you know

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.460
that if anyone takes money in the name of religion

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.420
he will regret.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.340
The trap of money is very powerful.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.640
So, this time I thought and have told you many times,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.600
that there are women here begging on the streets,

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.350
a lot of Muslim women, who have been abandoned by their husbands,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.820
who beg on the roads with their children,

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.400
and also lot of women have come from Bihar and Rajasthan.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.780
We should do something good for them,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.950
so we formed an organisation.

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.970
For this I don’t need any money from you people.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.340
We have never asked money from anyone.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.300
It all gets arranged somehow.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.650
But, I thought that you should also get the benefit of good deeds,

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.220
so I said, "Donate 500 Rs instead of 108 Rs".

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.220
Finished! I got letters after letters -

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.660
"You increased it from 108 to 500?".

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.340
What is it if you just have to pay it once in an year?

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.170
Don't you want to do any good deeds, but only want to gain?

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.590
Then how will your Lakshmi tattwa be seen?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.960
In Lakshmi tatwa you only have to give.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.610
So much fuss was made for 500 rupees!

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.700
You give Rs.500 to a barber sometimes just for a hair cut.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.330
So much chaos was made for that 500 Rs,

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.740
then I understood that people are still half baked.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.870
This was not so in olden days,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.630
devotion and sacrifice were there.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:53.470
And they didn't even feel that they were sacrificing.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.780
They enjoied it.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:04.350
So, the thing is that our attention is still on money.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.130
"We will pay only 108 Rs, or we will not come at all".

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.340
Better don't come, get out of Sahaja Yoga permanently.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.580
That is better.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.870
Because Sahaja Yoga is not for beggars.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.720
First of all you become alright and then help the beggars.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.920
We can help beggars.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.380
For that, if little amount is being asked,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.430
then why are you getting so angry?

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.560
You know I neither touch that money, nor I know anything about it.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:41.070
But, if for a good cause, instead of Rs.108, Rs.500 is being asked,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.350
then you fight with all the leaders, fight with everyone,

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:48.250
and create problems saying,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.260
"Mother, who suggested this to you?".

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.160
The person who can suggest Me is not yet born.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.510
I act according to My own will.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.780
This is what you should understand. I may look simple from outside,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:09.620
but actually, I am very clever from inside!

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.150
So, you should not try to befool Me.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:21.080
And you people cannot even give this much for Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.700
For so many years I cured thousands of people,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:31.290
gave so much money as tips and did so much for you, you know that,

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:36.470
but even for such a small thing, people turned their back!

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.310
I felt very sad.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:45.150
Earlier also such things have happened, such a low level thinking.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.310
Now, in Bombay,

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.690
people said "Mother, do the Puja here, this time".

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.950
I said, "I had a very bad experience here last time".

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.020
When the Puja took place,

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.620
only a quarter of the people paid for the food, rest I had to pay.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.540
You did Puja to Me and I paid for your food.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.120
People of Mumbai, particularly Maharashtrians are very miserly.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.800
They will give to brahmins, they will give to Siddhi Vinayak,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.800
but here they came running for free food.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.370
A quarter of them paid for their food,

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.450
and one-third paid for the Puja -

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.840
eleven rupees, just eleven.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.410
And they came to Sahaja Yoga. Instead, they can take a bowl

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.500
and sit outside a mosque - that would be better.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.270
Allah may do something good for them.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.480
This kind of people are there in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.490
That is why I want to tell you

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:56.190
that till now I didn't need any kind of donation from you all.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.540
But, I thought, "Let Me see, let Me test you".

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.610
And that testing amazed Me.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.680
And there is no one so poor here who can't pay even Rs.500

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.030
And so it was told, that whoever can't give need not give.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:18.010
Then many people called saying, "Please cut my name, I can't pay".

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.450
"Why?", "Because my husband only earns".

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.240
"How much does he earn?", "Rs. 7000"

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.080
But, I can't pay. My husband will pay only for him.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.430
As if we should put it on sale like it is done in marketing.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.290
They want some sort of sale on it and they get excused from paying.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.070
What is there to excuse?

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.220
How much money am I going to get?

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:44.710
Will it be sufficient to run our NGO? Not at all.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.830
But, your test is done, about how much deep in water you are.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.720
So, to take the attention away from money,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.130
is very important especially for Indians if they are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:03.020
Otherwise "Jail bharo andolan" (a kind of protest) is anyways ongoing!

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.120
Why is your attention so much on money,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.850
when I have awakened your Lakshmi tattwa?.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:13.230
As much as you will give, similarly, you will receive.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.900
"To give" is so joyful that there is no limit to it.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.380
When you give Me something,

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.870
I only take it to make you feel happy. I don’t need anything.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.670
There is no place in My house to keep anything.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:35.140
I can't do anything because you give it with so much love,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.650
it makes you happy.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.660
I am tired of telling you people, "Don't give Me sarees",

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.370
"I don't need anything. I don't need any jewellery".

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.820
I even said I am going to sell all the jewellery;

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.680
everything will be done by that.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.230
They said, "Mother, whatever You do, we'll give You (gifts) anyway".

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.540
I do it for your happiness.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.990
For Me what is there give and take?

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.030
When I have not taken anything, then why should I give?

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.350
So, this is something, we Indians must learn.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.820
I have met such people that you will be surprised!

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.820
Just to get independence of our country,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.700
My father sold all the land and properties,

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.630
My mother sold all our jewellery and we all went to jail.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:33.740
They gave Me electric shocks and made Me lie on ice.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.870
Nothing happened to Me. It was a joke.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.900
But still people tolerated all kinds of things,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.070
and went to jail for 2-3 years.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.170
People are still going to jail, there is no doubt,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:50.180
but that’s because they are corrupt.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.220
They claim, "See, we also went to jail".

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.760
Those people who have misbehaved in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.100
are going to be expelled by Me for sure.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.730
And be warned:

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:15.210
if anyone dares to raise the voice against any leader,

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.440
then I will turn him out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.090
Understand this completely without a doubt,

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.040
because we do not have to divide.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.310
If you are selfish, mean and you don’t have any job,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.420
then join the police,

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.240
or become CID (Crime investigation department) or do anything.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.890
Why have you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:46.040
When you are not worthy of it, why did you come?

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:53.360
I have been too bold to talk about such things to you on such a day.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.640
When I went to sleep then only it came to Me,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.580
"What should I say today? I am 74 years old.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.740
If one is old then what should one say?".

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:12.520
So, old people have also one job: to guide their children.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.140
They have to tell them too about what life is all about,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.200
and why they have to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.450
In Sahaja Yoga you have not come to destroy yourself;

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:29.530
because the path of Sahaja Yoga is extremely narrow.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.690
If you have to come to Sahaj

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:36.910
you should know that you have to tread on this narrow path,

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:41.740
on one side of which is a mountain and on the other a abyss.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.290
So, to walk on this path if you don't have that strength,

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.490
that strength of heart, that determination,

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.390
and if you don't have that pure desire,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.650
then it won't work out and you will be stuck somewhere in between.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:07.770
On the mountains you might have seen people going up on donkeys.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.150
The donkeys were asked, "How did you become donkeys?".

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.410
They replied, "We were also like you,

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.030
but, since we were half baked God made us donkeys,

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.680
so that at least in this form we can make it to the top".

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.630
Such stories you have heard and read.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.100
Our country has abundance of them.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.150
Regarding this subject there are so many stories.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.620
Most of them were written to teach us,

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.810
to make us understand

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.910
what happens when we choose the wrong path.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.160
Several stories are there

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:56.830
and among them, those stories which teach us a lesson,

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:00.190
those are the real ones.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.020
Again and again, I am feeling

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.050
that today I should have told something nice,

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:12.640
but this topic got highlighted as a big concern on Shri Shiva Puja,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.110
that I thought now if I don't talk about it, how will it work out.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.100
And on Shri Shiva's Puja you cannot say anything

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.890
because He only knows to forgive,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.350
but that too, to some extent.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.570
But, when He gets angry,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.030
you know what He does.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.590
I fear Him the most.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.300
Because if He gets angry,

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:41.670
then He will finish you.

00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.000
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga was free for you, in a way,

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.300
because your previous births were great.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.050
You have got it because of the wealth of good deeds

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.940
accumulated in your previous lives.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:05.090
However, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga and getting everything,

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.420
if you are going to be of no use,

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.260
then better leave it,

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.550
and spare Me also.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.560
I said this today after thinking a lot about it,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.860
although I do not think much,

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.490
I am generally in Nirvichara,

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.770
but still I am worried because I consider you all My sons

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.580
and My daughters.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:37.710
So if you keep falling because of your faults,

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.270
then I cannot bear it.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.920
It hurts Me a lot.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.570
In Sahaja Yoga there is everything: bliss, peace...

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.840
All your problems disappear in a snap of the fingers.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:02.180
You know it, you have experienced it,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.770
I don’t have to tell you about it.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.380
That was for Indians not for you people.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.670
And I have to tell you thank you very much

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.320
for this celebration, for all these beautiful balloons.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:24.900
but, looking at these balloons, we have to
also see some of them who have lost their

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.810
air completely.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:36.320
This is another problem we face in the West
because to have ego itself, according to the

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.090
Western culture, is a very great achievement.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:48.690
And when we start living with our ego I know
how one looks like.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:53.760
He really looks like a stupid fellow.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:02.890
When he talks, when he describes himself,
you don't know where to look because just

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.370
feel like laughing at his stupidity.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.940
Ego is the outcome of stupidity.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:21.720
I don't know what to say; how to give a simile
to ego, because it's just bloated and makes

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:30.410
you float in the air, and when it bursts you
are down on the earth.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:35.960
But you are not down on the earth the way
Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.280
you are completely finished.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.360
All your arrogance goes to waste.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.390
You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you
have this ego in your head.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.650
I have known people who have this ego.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:58.690
They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they
want to think that they know more than anybody

00:37:58.690 --> 00:37:59.760
else.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:10.620
To know about yourself you have to go deep
down, and to go deep down you have to give

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:17.580
up all this idea which makes you float in
the air.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.390
Imagine if you have a big balloon attached
to you.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.380
How can you go deep down into the sea?

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.980
You cannot.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:41.390
That kind of a air which makes you float in
the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:49.620
what else -I mean English you will think there
are no words- stupidity means everything.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:53.320
Then you may think no end of yourself.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.810
You may think whatever you like, you can behave
the way you like and all that but what do

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.570
you achieve?

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:05.860
You achieve nothing out of it.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.070
Whatever you achieve people are jealous of
you.

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.080
They want to harm you.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.130
You have no friends.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:21.410
Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people
know who has got this problem.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:28.880
So, I've seen people when they start talking
they say, “Ah!

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.400
We know, we know him.”

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:38.840
Once I had an experience, long, long time
back in Pune where the people who were owning

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:47.850
that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's
program because She is not a Brahmin.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.210
So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll
give it in the newspaper because She is not

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:56.320
a Brahmin we cannot have a program.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:04.440
So, these people came to My program and the
owner of that was sitting on the gallery on

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440
top.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.470
He couldn't even walk.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:12.190
He was suffering from some sort of a funny
disease.

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.600
So these people suddenly start.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.600
I didn't know.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.600
They didn't tell Me anything.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.470
They didn't tell Me that these people have
protested or whatever it is.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:26.780
So they all started shaking like this, like
this, like this.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.630
I said, “What is this?”

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.930
So I said, “What is it?”

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.430
They said “Mother, stop it.

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.870
We know You are Shakti but stop it.

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.550
It's too much, too much.”

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.220
“But what did you do?”

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.240
They said, “We didn't do anything.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:51.240
We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and
a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:57.870
resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You
cannot have your program.”

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.160
I said, “Really, that's all ?”

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.690
“Yes, yes, that's all.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:05.000
But it's, you see on the other side, you see
those people?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.600
They are also shaking with Your power.”

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.650
So I asked them, “Who are you?

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.870
Are you also Brahmins ?”

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:15.120
They said, "No, no.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:19.310
We are certified mad people from Thana.”

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.160
“And how are you here?”

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.840
They said, “There was one fellow who was
mad was cured by You.”

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840
“Really?”

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.810
“So our superintendent is here.

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:33.120
He has brought us here.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:35.770
We are certified mad.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:36.770
Certified.”

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:40.210
My goodness, these people looked at Me.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.300
I said, “See now, you tally.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.300
You are shaking and they are shaking.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.520
Now you tally.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:52.350
Where are you?” There was no word. But, no word.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:53.350
And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:58.690
Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs
I told him, "You get up and come down."

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.150
He came
and since that day he has surrendered his

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:05.560
life and did a lot of work in Pune.

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:11.410
So what I'm saying that anybody who talks
like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:18.410
Yoga, this should not happen, we should not
have paid so much, or this leader is not good”;

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:27.270
should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand,
and put it before the photograph.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:32.130
If you can stop the shaking then you are all
right.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:40.650
All of you can try this.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.650
Then try on the right hand.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:42.650
Very practical.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:51.790
If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego
is shaking, and you know how to treat your

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:56.220
ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.280
He has told us how to treat it.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.030
Now these two problems are within us.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:12.340
One of them is our conditioning and another
is this ego business, and we make our mind

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:19.710
out of that and we are playing under the governance
of these two things which we have used to

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.190
make this mind.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.430
Now you have to be careful.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.570
You find out with left hand.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.570
Now let's see.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:30.050
If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:35.040
If the right hand is shaking then you are
egoistical.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.850
So now you treat it.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.100
You treat these two things.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.230
Before Me you'll get vibrations all right
because you see I am your Mother.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.390
All right.

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.320
But that doesn't mean you are all right.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.290
You try on My photograph; that's much more
sharp.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:54.330
So being Mother you know I play around.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:44:00.500
I think, I don't know what I should say, but
maybe you may not feel that way.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:06.580
But before the photograph you put on the left
hand side a newspaper or a little paper or

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.690
a thin paper.

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:10.560
On the right hand side another paper.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:14.570
One by one you try and judge yourself, what
are you?

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:22.110
After all you have not come here in Sahaja
Yoga to emancipate Me.

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:29.350
You have come here to evolve yourself and
because of that you have to face yourself

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:37.170
and see for yourself what is within you which
is very strong, which is troublesome, which

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.910
is dragging you down, which is killing.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:49.490
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:56.940
I thought that in My absence you'll be all
enjoying it all right; you do.

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:03.130
Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because
of the plane, about four hours, five hours,

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:07.200
and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early
in the morning.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.200
I said, “What's happened ?”

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.190
“The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.”

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:18.000
So what you enjoy in that is collectivity:
samhita. That collectivity you should enjoy

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.700
only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries
that you have built, and then you see the

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.700
joy.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:33.380
All the time you'll be floating in joy.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:40.300
There is a sense which people have which you
may not have before realization.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:47.880
Some of the people, I was amazed how deep
they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.880
Supposed to be very great men.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:58.440
Supposed to be people of very great principles
but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:07.490
and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this
because inside there's a big depth, so that

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:11.750
everything is absorbed without any problem.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:18.250
Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful
as to the two wheels of our mind.

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:23.710
One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.370
All kinds of conditionings are there, especially
in India.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:31.190
In the West it is all kinds of egos you know,
different, different types.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:39.690
I have seen so many types and varieties of
egos, I was surprised; to face that.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:41.390
I didn't know what to say.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:48.770
It's a very, very subtle thing which people
have carved out of their minds.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:57.640
So for you today it is to be decided that
you are only still small children, and like

00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:09.250
small children you must have a very clean
heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:16.370
that is within you; and also the beauty of
purity.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.800
Without purity you cannot enjoy anything.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:30.830
So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people
I must say the purity of these few saints,

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:37.860
who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.920
For example, yesterday they were singing about
Ali.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:47.370
I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.110
And His purity people are singing now; not
at that time.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.850
He was killed at that time, He was tortured.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.700
That always they do.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:56.180
Then we have many others.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.260
We have here Dam Dam Sahib.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.060
See what a great thing to come to.

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.580
We have here Nizamuddin Auliya.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:14.370
We have so many people in our country itself
that nobody, no other country can claim.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:19.100
They have one, say in England they have William
Blake or this and that.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.270
We had so many people.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.270
Why?

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:29.810
Not because we were very good people, but
because we were to be improved.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:32.630
Things had to be done.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.630
So they were born.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:41.890
Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you
go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:48.060
many great saints lived there.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.350
But they were all tortured, troubled, never
understood.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:49:00.460
It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid,
ignorant, blind people tortured them.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:07.920
So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to,
first of all, find out who is a saint.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.480
Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in
Hindi language, there are people who try to

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.230
trouble, trouble others.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:27.560
If you have no recognition and understanding
of what is the truth, what is love, what is

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.640
pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.560
It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:44.310
You look at a person with an obtuse angle
you don't see anything, one-sided.

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:53.910
Now, at this juncture when I am so very old
now; I have to request that you turn your

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:56.380
eyes to yourself.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.380
Introspect.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:04.670
Because among you there are some people who
will try to divert your attention, will try

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.320
to say things.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.800
Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest,
he is very immoral”; very easy to say.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.430
What are you?

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:24.410
We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga
is to be consolidated through synthesis.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.920
We are believers of synthesis.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.520
Any divisive thing that comes into your mind
you should just throw it away.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.900
This is a request on this day I make you - that
you please introspect.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:42.580
Unless and until you introspect you cannot
even respect yourself.

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.130
You cannot even love yourself.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.210
If you love yourself you will introspect and
find out what's wrong.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:58.680
Supposing I love this sari, then if I find
any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.200
or something I'll get it cleaned.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.750
I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round
saying, “Ah!

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.680
See I've got so many spots.”

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:19.980
In the same way, you should be not proud of
whatever asahaj temperaments you have within

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.050
yourself.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.330
And don't talk like that.

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.380
Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'.

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.100
He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.800
I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring
souls".

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.360
That's the only way.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:44.220
In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name
is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter,

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.920
chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about
others.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:53.510
He doesn't know what he is.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:58.130
It is much more in India, I must confess.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.220
I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:06.400
It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting
down just chit-chatting.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.860
They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:13.890
How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper
way?

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.420
I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees
I should give to you?

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.520
Tell Me.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.460
You don't know even about your vibrations.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:30.380
Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you
have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.850
But how many are really grown up into it?

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.050
You can.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:42.310
So I have to again and again tell you, to
make Me happy, you have to give up all these

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:51.180
nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand
from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:51.180 --> 00:53:03.570
Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge
by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.010
There are many who do it.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.860
I am not saying they don't do.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:12.800
But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil
all of them; like one bad apple can spoil

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.260
all the apples.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.810
So what do we do -throw away the apple out
of the basket.

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:32.020
It is important see, even I feel all this,
standing like a witness to you, silent witness.

00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:46.390
When I see big, big mountains, and I think
they are like great saints who are watching,

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:55.940
and they are trying to record what is happening
in this world because they also understand.

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:59.150
They also know.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:08.330
I have to again, and again, tell you that
today is the day to see your own self, your

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:13.510
own chakras, your own - I should say - defects.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:21.880
That will give you permanently the joy that
is promised.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:25.270
You will get thoughtless awareness.

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.660
Also you'll get doubtless awareness.

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:38.460
But never get into the trap of your conditioning
and of your ego.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:44.980
This is what I have to tell you today, on
this day where you are celebrating, that you

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.150
celebrate your own birthday.

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.010
Celebrate it.

00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:54.040
See for yourself what you have achieved and
what you are going to achieve.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.710
It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate
My birthday.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:55:03.060
I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday
than to celebrate Mine.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:05.430
So may God bless you.
