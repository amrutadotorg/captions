00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.500
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.980
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.380
sitting here with such shining faces

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.900
from all over the world,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.540
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:23.260
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.420
who are going to save this world

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.660
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.260
that are surrounding us.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.980
Is coming from all sides,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.380
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.860
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.540
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.340
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.540
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.580
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.380
As I told you the other day that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:32.220
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.020
that it could work out,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.660
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.140
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.660
but you were so sensitive

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.020
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.780
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.340
It's unbelievable.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.220
I can't believe Myself

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.260
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.380
No one can believe that there are so many

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.900
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.620
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.220
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.180
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.500
and devas, not so many.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.460
One better than the other

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.940
such beautiful heart,

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.940
such brilliant brains

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:11.780
and such active attention, is really

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.500
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.100
so many people, which I never expected.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.940
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.100
and then those who came also,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.940
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.340
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.900
One after another, so many problems came

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.220
and also there were many who were

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.780
of a very low-level seekers.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.140
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.060
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.780
the way it has happened.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.260
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.500
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.140
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.380
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.340
You are the channels

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.900
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.340
It is really remarkable the way

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.660
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.300
First of all, everybody was very much

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.140
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.460
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.820
and then Delhi people said,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.820
"This time we are going to celebrate,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.780
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.900
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.940
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.260
So many will be coming down."

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.860
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.060
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.260
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.580
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.100
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.780
the way they have done it.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.700
The best part of it,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.060
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.260
have groups and politics and all that,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.540
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.380
There is no quarrelling.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.300
There is no pulling each other's legs.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.140
Is very remarkable thing

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.260
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.380
where every day what you hear

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.700
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.540
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.420
this goodness was to be born and

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.500
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.220
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.340
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.980
and it's not easy

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:13.500
to penetrate into the so-called

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.980
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:25.100
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.180
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.980
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.620
that they have made out of their brains.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.620
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:51.020
But the way they have absorbed

00:08:51.020 --> 00:09:00.220
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.980
Nobody can comprehend even

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:19.620
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.100
on this Earth,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.060
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.860
Just after My birth they were born here

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.220
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.620
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.180
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.980
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.140
My family members,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.620
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:06.860
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.460
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.580
there is totality waiting for them?

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.700
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.020
which had no connection with reality.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.940
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.060
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.180
I remember the first incident

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:48.580
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.900
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:58.700
Immediately, all the other,

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.220
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.780
they started saying that

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.580
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.380
so Mother has given him realization."

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.420
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.340
I started shouting at them,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.340
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.220
you can never take to Divinity,"

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.980
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.500
One has to take another life,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:33.220
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.260
But after that, suddenly,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.540
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.420
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.940
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.820
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.540
Thus, we got twelve people

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:07.700
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.860
she was the fourteenth.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.740
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.620
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.220
They were all flabbergasted.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.980
They didn't know what it was.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.420
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:47.940
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:53.660
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.100
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.380
I've never told otherwise also.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.700
So then, she recited a poem

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.580
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.980
and she was just a maidservant.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.220
And in a man's voice.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.220
So everybody was shocked

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.980
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.540
And then she went away.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.820
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.980
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.140
in My house itself.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:46.660
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.540
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.900
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.540
and something will happen to us."

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.140
But after the Puja they said,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.220
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.700
They all felt the cool breeze

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.500
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.700
They started understanding that

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:18.380
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:26.580
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:34.460
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.540
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.780
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:53.700
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.540
that you found out that everywhere

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.820
people were following whatever they're following,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.660
they were not reaching any point.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.540
Like a cocoon,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.380
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.660
They got their realizations

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.940
so quickly and when they told Me

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.260
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.340
I was amazed.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.700
How this seeking was working within them

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.660
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.860
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:50.500
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.700
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.500
You are just representing your country,

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.420
but there are many more in your countries.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.140
Even in India we have many more.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.820
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.900
So, multiple of this number,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.380
I do not know how many would be there.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.900
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.780
"I don't know."

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:21.900
Say, "You don't know?"

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.660
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.140
So they can't understand. I said,

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:36.300
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.300
I don't know how to type.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.020
I don't know how to write even My check."

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.980
They can't understand

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.100
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.220
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.180
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.660
everything gets absolutely

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.380
done in the most perfect manner

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.500
like a remote control.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.580
Now this whole thing,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:21.220
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:27.020
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.700
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.860
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.780
because you all have commitment

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.420
and that commitment gives you

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.820
all these organizing capacities.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:58.900
So many things you have seen get organized

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.780
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.100
has come into Krita Yuga

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.340
where it is working it out. It's acting.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.980
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.860
For example, the police people told us

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.140
that there are Muslims living here

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.820
and you might have some danger from them.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.300
They might do some harm to you.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.460
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:36.100
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.980
I said, "They'll never harm us."

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.100
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.860
and he was a great realized soul

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:53.140
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:57.540
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.700
How can they harm us?"

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.860
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:09.260
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.660
and they were so impressed

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.780
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.460
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.620
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.060
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.860
all kinds of things.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.900
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.460
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.180
and I always have admired his poetry

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:43.620
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:47.820
and divinity.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.540
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.620
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.860
I said, "This is Ruh."

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.620
"Ah, this is Ruh."

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.620
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.140
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.620
and you may have to have ...

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.780
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.860
and we are going to take their addresses

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.300
and we are going to meet them;

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.020
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.820
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:47.980
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.420
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.580
Also contemporarily,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:15.860
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.660
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.980
to give wisdom to those people

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.780
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.260
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.660
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.020
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.500
See, on top of your head

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.140
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.100
though there is no breeze outside,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.260
the leaves are just steady,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:51.740
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.700
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.460
will cool down and will bring peace

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.220
to our politicians and to the people

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.620
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.900
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:20.380
there are so many things going on

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.340
of uncertainties,

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.820
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.980
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.980
in England there's recession,

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.140
America there is recession,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.220
Spain there is recession,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.020
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:46.060
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.140
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.340
that they see now will correct

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.540
their behavior towards materialism

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:02.220
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.140
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:13.220
this world will be so beautiful,

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:22.180
so enchanting that in the history,

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.500
people will describe

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.140
that the world itself became a lotus

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:33.500
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.260
You are the petals,

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.980
you are the corona,

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.980
you are the color,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.540
you are the beauty,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.020
you are the pollen

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.700
of that beautiful lotus

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.420
which is My vision of this world.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.260
I hope today

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:20.780
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.220
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.020
and work for yourself also.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.180
The only danger is

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:33.220
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.260
That's the only horse.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.060
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.340
you'll progress very fast,

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.540
beautifully.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:59.580
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:08.140
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:13.580
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.380
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.260
I'm working very hard,

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.620
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.620
In the same way, you also,

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.500
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.340
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.580
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.460
We'll think about it.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.300
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.980
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.460
writings,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.780
go round,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.700
talk to their colleagues,

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.660
organize meetings,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.180
seminars with your colleagues.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.460
There are architects

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.980
and other professionals

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:23.900
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.620
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.140
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.740
Is very important because

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.980
financial problems can only be

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.860
solved by the Divine Power.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.420
Nobody else can solve it.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.580
So everyone in this world,

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:53.020
whether it is law or any other field,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:58.260
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.780
and also to creative work.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.100
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.580
to your surroundings,

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:18.100
to villages, to cities,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.140
wherever it is possible,

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.540
wherever you can organize,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:27.420
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.140
As far as curing is concerned,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.500
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.300
Please use only My photograph.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.140
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.580
and less sick people.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.100
Also, people will be cured

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.860
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.460
We have also agricultural field

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.900
on which we have done something,

00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.300
but much can be done about agriculture.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.980
One should see the government and tell them

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.380
what agriculture can do.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.460
You can form a committee and go and see them

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.580
and talk to them that

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:19.500
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.140
We have to help our children.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.500
We have to look after them

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:33.700
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.900
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.340
even in India.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.140
So we have to see that our children

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.380
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.660
Is very important

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.500
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.340
So many of them are born realized,

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:00.020
so we have to discipline them properly

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:05.660
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.220
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:21.660
It is also our family life which is very important.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.700
Is shocking that

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.260
family life is nowadays becoming

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.180
a kind of a stupid thing.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.380
No one understands the importance of it.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.940
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.660
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:48.020
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:53.900
and there should be a proper rapport

00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:01.460
between husband and wife to begin with,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.100
so that there is a companionship

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.420
and the children also see that companionship

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.340
and enjoy it.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.940
In our dress, in our life,

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.820
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.300
Is very important.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.780
We should wear whatever suits us

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.540
in whatever country we are.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.580
I mean, imagine in summer climate

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:35.340
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.780
what will happen to him?

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.060
Whatever suits us,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.380
whatever fits our culture,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.940
one should try to wear decent dresses,

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.660
traditional dresses.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.460
Specially for women, it is very important

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.300
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.580
Also, another point I would like to say,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.460
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.980
at least newspapers.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.140
If your attention is on the problems

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.740
that are in this world, it's very effective

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.580
because you know your attention is active, it works.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.900
So use your attention.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.380
You see the newspapers,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.020
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.820
you can give a bandhan,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:44.180
but you must see what's happening where,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.980
is very important.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.900
Also men should not just read something sensational,

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.060
but read something that's happening

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.460
and also think, what are the solutions.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.860
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.140
in a collective way or in an individual way.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:12.940
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.020
Also one has to read good books,

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.060
good films one has to see,

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.780
and have your reflection on them.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.740
Keep your mind alert.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.980
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.460
coming out of

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.380
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.940
beautiful, very high class.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.420
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.540
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.060
from everywhere.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.460
They are trying to systematize now.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.420
And now, in this system,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.060
if you can all help spontaneously,

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:55.500
it will be a great achievement

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.020
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:03.220
all these datas and keep them with us.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.260
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.980
All have to meditate.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:13.740
Only in meditation you are in present

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.540
and you grow in your spirituality.

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:20.540
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.100
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.700
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.580
no doubt.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.660
We really grow very fast.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.460
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.620
the way he has changed.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.420
And then, once you get used to it,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:42.140
you'll never give it up.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.100
Is very simple meditation.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.860
You have foot soaking or something like that

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:49.980
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.660
that's all.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.700
Is not that you have to do

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.140
one lakh jappas or something.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.620
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.340
Is very simple.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.540
But this, you have to do for yourself,

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:09.860
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:19.100
We have lots of advantages over others.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.380
But one thing I have to tell you,

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.580
those people who are not prone to seeking,

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.140
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.140
Don't waste your energy on such people,

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.140
discussing and arguing,

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.900
because it cannot be discussed much.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.580
You just forget them and leave them alone.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.180
I'll look after them.

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:45.980
You just take to simple people, good people,

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.060
who are seeking the truth.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.620
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:56.380
who are just believing in discussion,

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.740
arguments and shabda jaal.

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.060
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:07.180
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.700
there's something special

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.740
and that they have something very unique

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:20.540
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.100
All these things, you should understand,

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.220
have come to you spontaneously from within,

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.780
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.260
Should never be shy of your virtues.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.420
And whatever people may try

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.820
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.780
if it is wrong you should never do it.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.620
Because, now, you are very powerful

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.380
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.820
and that you have to lead the people

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.500
and people don't have to lead you.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.460
Fashions don't have to lead you,

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.940
but you have to create fashions.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.660
You have to create a path for them.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.540
It's not that you have to

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.500
trod on the path that they have made.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.940
Try to understand

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.300
that your own personality

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.500
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.140
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.380
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.460
Don't get ideas from them

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.100
and don't get frightened

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.580
when they try to tell you something

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.500
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.620
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.540
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.940
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.940
that it worked out.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.300
I didn't have to,

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.500
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.140
I just started it.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.300
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.220
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.260
I started the whole thing on My own,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.100
worked it out on My own,

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:19.420
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.740
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.820
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.900
It has happened.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.860
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.660
All of you should, first of all,

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.980
see that you are not a conditioned person

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.260
and you do not have an ego

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.140
and then you should go ahead with it

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.500
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:47.260
Today's puja is very short puja.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.740
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.380
There are so many things which I cannot,

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:01.140
at this time, which is short, tell you

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.100
but if you sit down, you can easily make

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.220
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.580
So, now put your mind to it

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:16.100
in a way that you are the organizer.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.860
Then what should you do? What can you do?

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.140
What are you going to achieve?

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:24.780
Please try and it will work out.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.260
All of you can do it.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.300
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:33.340
and write it down in that: what you have done,

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.420
how many people you have given realization,

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.060
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.620
But now, if there's no diary,

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.940
Sahaja yogis can say among,

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.020
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.060
you start it today.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.420
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.340
is that they take things little lightly.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.740
Of course, that is their character.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.300
But not Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.580
Other things you can take lightly.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.340
If somebody shouts at you,

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.820
somebody gets angry with you,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.380
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.340
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.300
because you are the spirit.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.900
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:26.780
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.140
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.420
your attitude should be different.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.620
If you are relaxing on one side,

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.980
another side you have to be dynamic

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.860
and that side is where you have to put forward

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.420
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.180
when you have to talk to people,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.460
you have to organize a press conference

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.580
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.580
At whatever level you want to work it out,

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.020
please make a proper plan about it

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.140
and just do it.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.500
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:06.180
With all these ideas that I have,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.300
you have many more

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.260
and I hope by next year,

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:16.980
we'll see manifestation of those.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.140
I hope many people will write books

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.460
like U.C. Rai has written.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:27.380
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.220
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.940
Everything he has done single-handed.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.660
So beautifully he has worked it out.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:41.140
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.420
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.380
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:52.500
But it should be honest, very honest book.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.900
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.500
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.700
All those who have such ideas

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:08.300
should make an effort to create some new books,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.540
some new ideas, some new creation.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:15.580
Is very important

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.620
because in these modern times

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.900
people want to do something new,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.820
something novel.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.620
Under these circumstances,

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.420
I'm sure you all will work out.

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.500
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.620
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.460
and then these can be properly put together,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.420
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.420
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:52.700
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.340
This is a very opportune time.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:09.420
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.460
And what will be the symptom

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:36.380
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.420
Whatever people may try,

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.340
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.820
Satyame vijayate.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:56.740
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.580
For this I congratulate you again and again.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.260
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.820
May God bless you all.
