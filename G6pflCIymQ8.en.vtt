1980-0330 Public Program, Brighton (UK)_Seeking the Spirit 1 & 2

00:03.000 --> 00:08.892
�again to Brighton.

00:09.000 --> 00:28.892
I always had a feeling there are lots of great souls in this place who are sincerely seeking.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.892
And long time back I had wished that sometime I may be able to come to this place to meet them,

00:39.000 --> 00:47.892
and I am so happy to be here.

00:48.000 --> 00:59.892
We have heard and learnt and read that we are not this body,

01:00.000 --> 01:09.892
that we are not this mind, we are not this ego or superego

01:10.000 --> 01:19.892
but transcending all this is the Spirit, is the Atma, which human beings have to seek.

01:20.000 --> 01:32.892
But even when you have not read these things, some of you when you are born,

01:33.000 --> 01:41.892
you start feeling that there is something that we have to seek.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.892
You are not satisfied with what you have. You have a feeling of inadequacy,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.892
that you are not yet fulfilled, that you have not found your meaning.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.892
There is something much more one has to get.

02:04.000 --> 02:13.892
This feeling is very strong and today it is much stronger than it was ever before.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.892
What are we seeking? We do not know.

02:21.000 --> 02:28.892
Actually we have no idea what are we seeking as such, because that is an unknown thing,

02:29.000 --> 02:37.892
that is unknown to us. But we have a feeling, one definite feeling,

02:38.000 --> 02:50.892
that whatever we have is not complete, is not satisfied. It is not full with joy and bliss.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.892
We start wondering about our lives that why are we on this Earth?

02:56.000 --> 03:00.892
Why God has created us, if He exists anywhere?

03:01.000 --> 03:08.892
Or why should we have a life just like, like an animals life, like coming on this Earth,

03:09.000 --> 03:18.892
eating your food and having some children and then die.

03:19.000 --> 03:30.892
That you are aware, is itself is a big blessing.

03:31.000 --> 03:39.892
But why do you feel like that? What is the reason? Even some children feel it.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.892
Even people who are not at all introduced to any religious ideas feel it.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.892
From where does this feeling comes within us that we have to seek something much more within us,

03:53.000 --> 04:04.892
something much deeper within us. And we feel earnestly from within a revolt

04:05.000 --> 04:13.892
with whatever we have and we want to do something by which we reach that point.

04:14.000 --> 04:27.892
This feeling comes to us from our unconscious, from our mind, which is not in our consciousness.

04:28.000 --> 04:35.892
But our Spirit is conscious of us. Our unconscious is conscious of us

04:36.000 --> 04:42.892
but you are not, you are not conscious of the Spirit.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.892
For example, if you are, say, going by a train and you are watching a beautiful scene,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.892
you are conscious of the whole scene that is before you.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.892
But the scene is not conscious of you.

05:00.000 --> 05:09.892
The scene cannot see or understand or is aware that there is somebody who is conscious of our beauty.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.892
In the same way this Spirit that exists within us in our heart,

05:19.000 --> 05:28.892
is conscious of us, it is guiding us, it is making us feel that there�s something lacking in us.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.892
But we are not conscious of that, we are just conscious of the lacking.

05:35.000 --> 05:43.892
And this seeking is the most important thing for human beings.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.892
Without the seeking human beings have no meaning for their existence.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.892
Say, in the animal stage, you are seeking food.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.892
When you evolve out of such seekings, even in human stage, you are seeking, say,

06:05.000 --> 06:10.892
power through politics or through conquering other countries.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.892
You are seeking also money, possessions, material things

06:19.000 --> 06:22.892
by which you think you will feel the fulfilment.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.892
But the basics of economics is that no want is satiable in general.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.892
In the sense one want may be satiable but in general the want itself is never satiable

06:39.000 --> 06:42.892
and this want is material want.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.892
So material want is not satiable, your intellectual want is not satiable,

06:50.000 --> 07:00.892
your physical want is not satiable. Then which is the want that is satiable? � is the spiritual want.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.892
And I must say there are so many beautiful people in this world, these days.

07:06.000 --> 07:12.892
So many beautiful people those who have found out that these adventures

07:13.000 --> 07:19.892
and these enterprises have led people into terrible mess

07:20.000 --> 07:25.892
and they have even lost their human feelings.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.892
They are not even human beings if you start judging them properly.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.892
You may feel that these people are not human beings. The way they are treating each other,

07:36.000 --> 07:46.892
the way they are manifesting their own desires to gain power, money or other things.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.892
It is so ridiculous and so absurd that it doesn't behove a human being to be like that.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.892
This realization is also very clear-cut amongst so many people who are born very beautifully.

08:02.000 --> 08:10.892
Who hate aggression, who do not like all the ugliness of life

08:11.000 --> 08:15.892
and they feels there should be something that should happen to us

08:16.000 --> 08:18.892
so that we all can face that beauty.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.892
All this is already there, within us, if you read the literature,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.892
if you read these days many books and all that.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.892
I am enthralled sometimes to read that how it is ready just now. Now what is it within us?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.892
If I tell you this, you need not believe Me. No! Not at all!

08:41.000 --> 08:47.892
I do not want any blind faith because your eyes are to be open more than what they are today.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.892
So if you become blind, what is the use? You have to keep yourself open.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.892
Whatever I am saying just you have to see if it works if it is so or not.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.892
It is just a hypothesis as any scientist would put before you.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.892
But the hypothesis must be seen from a very-very open angle

09:11.000 --> 09:15.892
and the hypothesis is this that within us resides that beautiful thing

09:16.000 --> 09:23.892
which you are seeking is the Spirit in our heart. Now which is shown here in the picture.

09:24.000 --> 09:34.892
This is little bit bigger than actually what it is. You can see the whole figure itself is big.

09:35.000 --> 09:46.892
In this you see, find that in the triangular area which is the triangular bone in our body,

09:47.000 --> 09:55.892
which is called as sacrum. Now see, even the Greece, in the unconscious, they gave this bone the name of sacrum.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.892
Now in Greek language, sacrum means sacred.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.892
And when the body burns completely this bone doesn't burn.

10:06.000 --> 10:14.892
It never burns and this is the bone, sacrum bone, is the bone in which there is a Power,

10:15.000 --> 10:24.892
which is our germinating Power. Is the Power, which connects us with the Divine.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.892
This is again a hypothesis. Keep yourself open to this.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.892
Now this Power resides there and they say that it is in a sleeping state,

10:38.000 --> 10:49.892
it is not yet awakened. And all these centres that are shown 1,2,3,4,5,6 and the 7,

10:50.000 --> 10:59.892
all of them are also placed within us, in our spinal cord partly and in our brain partly.

11:00.000 --> 11:14.892
These centres manifest outside the gross plexuses which we know them, we see them,

11:15.000 --> 11:23.892
we see them working also, which are known to our senses. But the subtle centres,

11:24.000 --> 11:33.892
which are manifesting those gross plexuses, we cannot see them, we cannot feel them,

11:34.000 --> 11:38.892
neither we can see them manifesting.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.892
These centres are within us, these subtle centres.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.892
The evolution within us has placed it there. It exists, they are there.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.892
Now when will you see them manifesting?

11:56.000 --> 12:01.892
There is a time when you can, with your own eyes, see them manifesting.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.892
If you see them manifesting then you have to believe that there is such an such Power existing,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.892
something existing, in the triangular bone which is a sacrum.

12:15.000 --> 12:25.892
Because what we believe into, what we see, what we feel, whichever is felt through our senses

12:26.000 --> 12:29.892
is acceptable to us. In the same way,

12:30.000 --> 12:37.892
in our seeking we should know that what we can see and feel, if that thing happens

12:38.000 --> 12:41.892
then only we can accept it as the truth otherwise we should not.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.892
Supposing I give you big idea about something, why should you believe?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.892
Because whatever happens should manifest within you.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.892
It should be expressed to you in such a manner that you should be able to feel it and understand it.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.892
It is not brain washing. Why should we accept any brain washing in a free country?

13:12.000 --> 13:25.892
And this is what if you understand that you have to be fully independent and fully free to see this manifesting.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.892
Because what you have to achieve is your full freedom.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.892
We are not free at all, at this moment because we are ignorant.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.892
Say this room is completely dark, I can�t see anything in this room.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.892
I am not free to walk. If I walk I tumble down because I cannot see things.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.892
If it is enlightened and if there is complete light,

13:52.000 --> 13:57.892
I have the full freedom to move whatever way I like.

13:58.000 --> 14:09.892
So in these seven centres, we have got the manifestation of our parasympathetic nervous system

14:10.000 --> 14:13.892
which is in the gross, doctors understand a little bit but not much,

14:14.000 --> 14:21.892
means the system by which we get our refuelling, by which we get our balancing,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.892
by which we get our coordination. For example, now as we were coming to Brighton,

14:30.000 --> 14:38.892
if our petrol was over, we had to go to someplace where we could get our fuel.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.892
But supposing there was no such place in between, we would have been stuck up.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.892
In the same way God has made those refuelling stations within us,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.892
which give us energy to replace the energy

14:55.000 --> 14:59.892
that we are using every time through our sympathetic nervous system.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.892
Now the sympathetic nervous system is working within us all the time.

15:06.000 --> 15:14.892
For example, if you want to run, you can run very fast but your heart will start breathing very fast,

15:15.000 --> 15:20.892
this is sympathetic. In emergency you use your sympathetic nervous system

15:21.000 --> 15:27.892
but automatically it goes back and it comes to a normal position, now this is para-sympathetic.

15:28.000 --> 15:33.892
You can make it work fast but you cannot make it slow.

15:34.000 --> 15:39.892
Where you fail to do anything, parasympathetic comes to your help and these are the centres,

15:40.000 --> 15:48.892
which supply the parasympathetic energy to us, when we are existing without our realization.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.892
But without our realization we just exist. At the slightest point, we get upset.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.892
We get into tensions because our energies are over. We get tired; we don't know what to do?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.892
Here there is a seeking, a tremendous seeking coming,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.892
�We must have something, we must have something� and there it is you get so tired and fagged out,

16:09.000 --> 16:12.892
you don�t know how to face it. There is such a gap.

16:13.000 --> 16:18.892
And this gap is to be covered. How do you cover this gap?

16:19.000 --> 16:25.892
Actually if you think about yourself, how did you get this nose and how did you get these eyes?

16:26.000 --> 16:33.892
You will be amazed; you just got it for nothing. You did nothing about it, you just got them.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.892
When you were born, you had them there. All stuck very nicely, breathing very nicely

16:41.000 --> 16:44.892
and talking very nicely and seeing very nicely.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.892
All those things were just there and they are your own. I mean you always say,

16:51.000 --> 16:55.892
My eyes are paining, These are your eyes. They are very, your very own;

16:56.000 --> 17:00.892
these are your own eyes. You have not paid for it.

17:01.000 --> 17:01.000
You have done nothing about them but they are your own.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.892
Now who owns those eyes, which part of you owns them, eyes?

17:10.000 --> 17:17.892
This is the point we have to find out because we have not yet found out the owner of this being,

17:18.000 --> 17:23.892
That is why we are worried. We have to find out that owner because that owner is you.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.892
That means you have not found out yourself and that is why you are worried.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.892
You are lost. You don�t know if you are this body;

17:33.000 --> 17:37.892
you don't know if you are this mind or you are this ego.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.892
You don�t know really what you are. And because you are lost like a child who gets lost,

17:43.000 --> 17:48.892
you want to know who are you and that is the finding one has to do.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.892
But for that also as you have got your self, your being free, you cannot do anything.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.892
It is absolutely free, is the grace of the nature, which has given you � your nose, eyes everything,

18:07.000 --> 18:17.892
your breathing everything because it is so important, it is so vital that nobody can pay for it.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.892
Supposing you have to pay for your breathing, what will happen?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.892
Only the rich may breathe for a while and then they will also collapse?

18:26.000 --> 18:31.892
Supposing you have to pay for your heart beating, what will happen?

18:32.000 --> 18:41.892
So you cannot pay for it, you cannot work for it. It is spontaneous,

18:42.000 --> 18:46.892
it is Sahaja. Saha, means with, ja, means born. It is born with you.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.892
The way your nose, your eyes, your lips everything is born with you,

18:53.000 --> 19:03.892
in the same way this yoga, this right � to be one with that Unconscious,

19:04.000 --> 19:09.892
that Divine Power, that All Pervading Power, is born with you. It is within you,

19:10.000 --> 19:16.892
it is in your right to get it. You have to get it, it is your own.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.892
As you have a right to have the eyes and nose and everything

19:21.000 --> 19:25.892
this is also your human right that you should get this yoga.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.892
So when it is your right you don't pay for it, you don't pay for your dome, do you?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.892
In the same way you do not pay for your Kundalini awakening.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.892
The first thing one must understand you cannot pay for it, you cannot work for it.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.892
You may destroy it; you may destroy that yoga. For example,

19:48.000 --> 19:54.892
supposing a person has led a life which is not congenial to the Kundalini awakening

19:55.000 --> 20:05.892
or may have led a life which we can say � a man who has broken his, say, spinal cord.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.892
Then it is rather difficult, it will take time.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.892
One has to put the spinal cord in proper shape and then you can give realization to such a person.

20:15.000 --> 20:23.892
But you cannot say that every person also will get his realization

20:24.000 --> 20:28.892
because there are certain things like a person from lunatic asylum comes here and he says,

20:29.000 --> 20:39.892
�Give me realization immediately�, it is not possible. Is given to people who deserve it.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.892
Now people may say that, Mother, maybe I am not deserving. It is not for you to judge.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.892
Thousands get their realization, no problem but as I said supposing Hitler comes

20:52.000 --> 20:56.892
and says, Give me realization. He stands here; whatever he may try he cannot get it.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.892
He cannot be forgiven by God. He cannot be forgiven; he has to go to hell.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.892
That is what it is meant for him. So one must understand [NOISE IN MP3]

21:19.000 --> 21:24.892
that and for that He has created this instrument, which triggers,

21:25.000 --> 21:30.892
which triggers your awareness to that point where you start understanding,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.892
where you start becoming aware of it. It�s an actualization.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.892
It is not just talking, brain washing or anything. It has to happen within you.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.892
If it does not happen, does not happen, you cannot give false certificate.

21:48.000 --> 21:55.892
It has to happen within you because it is reality and truth and you cannot play about with the truth.

21:56.000 --> 22:02.892
You cannot say, No, no, no, it is white. If it is white it is white, if it is not it is not.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.892
So, it should happen to all of you and it would happen also

22:08.000 --> 22:13.892
but truth must be accepted as it is, you cannot force on it. Like somebody came to Me

22:14.000 --> 22:17.892
and said that, Mother, I have done so much, I have read so much, I have done this,

22:18.000 --> 22:22.892
I have done that. I have been to Himalayas, I've taken bath in the Ganges,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.892
I have been, all sorts of things I have done, but he doesn't get realization.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.892
I said, Now you are not getting it�. It is like sprouting the seed.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.892
You cannot force a seed to be sprouted. It will sprout spontaneously, no doubt,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.892
but if it is capable of sprouting then only, it sprouts.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.892
But as I have told you that thousands of people have got it and you should also be.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.892
Now for this first of all you must know that I am not a guru that way,

22:49.000 --> 22:55.892
as you think of a guru, who dictates and does that because I cannot dictate.

22:56.000 --> 23:03.892
At the most, I can tell you what is the matter but I cannot dictate you.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.892
Say, for example, one light, which is not enlightened can enlighten another light

23:08.000 --> 23:13.892
but the light which is enlightened cannot dictate the another light, it cannot.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.892
It can only guide and tell that this would be better if you come this way, maybe,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.892
that I may be able to enlighten you better. If you have come the another

23:24.000 --> 23:28.892
end I cannot catch hold of your wick. So the one light can tell the another light this much.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.892
So one should not feel that there is any obligation. I mean, it is obligatory for Me

23:36.000 --> 23:42.892
to give you realization. I cannot help it because it is too much for Me, I must distribute.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.892
I mean, I should say it is the funny situation of paradox

23:48.000 --> 23:55.892
that a person who has all the Powers is like a capitalist and such a person must distribute it

23:56.000 --> 24:03.892
because he is a, he is a communist. You cannot help but to distribute it.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.892
It�s a, it�s a the thing that you only enjoy when you distribute it otherwise you cannot enjoy.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.892
Now can you think of such a situation? So I have to come to Brighton,

24:12.000 --> 24:16.892
I have to go to America. I may have to go to any village, any place, just to distribute.

24:17.000 --> 24:24.892
I have to go on distributing. This is My own life, My own nature. I have to do it.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.892
So, there is no obligation on Me, on the contrary its a obligation on you.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.892
But on the contrary it is the obligation on Me because if you do not take it

24:36.000 --> 24:40.892
I'll have to find some other people to get it. It has to go on and on and on.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.892
Perhaps I don�t know, people have lost the value of love.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.892
They don't know what love is these days, in modern times, because

24:49.000 --> 24:53.892
so many artificial things have been put in love. But actually love is something,

24:54.000 --> 24:59.892
which cannot enjoy itself unless until it gives. Then think of Divine Love,

25:00.000 --> 25:04.892
unless and until it gives you, it is not going to be satisfied.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.892
If you are seeking something for your own satisfaction you are most welcome, unless [NOISE IN MP3]

25:21.000 --> 25:23.892
you want to [NOISE IN MP3].

25:24.000 --> 25:35.892
Now in that why should anybody feel that why [NOISE IN MP3]  you?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.892
Same question could have been asked. Now God cannot ask everybody to do it.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.892
Supposing He has asked Me to do it, so what is the matter about it?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.892
I mean I willing to do it freely with all My patience, with all My love,

25:48.000 --> 26:06.892
with all My complete [NOISE IN MP3] pod or a communication

26:07.000 --> 26:10.892
or you can say, give and take business like this [NOISE IN MP3].

26:11.000 --> 26:16.892
This is just enjoyment between the two parties. It is no question of obligation,

26:17.000 --> 26:25.892
It�s no question of any ego coming in between [NOISE IN MP3] amount of happiness

26:26.000 --> 26:28.892
one can get [NOISE IN MP3] enjoys is the point.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.892
If you could have that attitude I think it would help much better.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.892
For example, we have [NOISE IN MP3] newspaper

26:41.000 --> 26:50.892
and they came and they told Me that Mother [NOISE IN MP3] so they said,

26:51.000 --> 26:54.892
There are so many gurus who have come here and have cheated us and this and that.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.892
I said, All right, they have cheated you so I am here to protect you.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.892
And they have misled us. I said, All right,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.892
I am here to accept all the things that they have done which is wrong, and to correct

27:08.000 --> 27:13.892
and to tell you what they have done. But I said, �You were also very naive to go to them.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.892
You were also very wrong to jump into that. You were really attracted by their circus.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.892
You were attracted by their artificial methods.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.892
You were attracted by their manoeuvring because they used public relations.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.892
They used all your advertising. They used all your medias to impress you

27:33.000 --> 27:36.892
and that is how you went to them. You were naive about it.

27:37.000 --> 27:45.892
You must know that if it is from God it has to be extremely simple and that you cannot pay for it.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.892
Apart from payment you cannot put in effort for it. If it is the grace, it has to come to you free

27:52.000 --> 27:55.892
because it is your right to get that grace. You are made like this.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.892
Supposing somebody who has made this instrument

27:58.000 --> 28:03.892
with all care for ages together from amoeba to this stage up to this point.

28:04.000 --> 28:16.892
Now it is the [NOISE IN MP3] to be connected to the mains.

28:05.000 --> 29:10.892
if he can get this realization, if he can get there, what is our Spirit is,

28:17.000 --> 28:23.892
It is something like that. It is God Himself wants you to have it and

28:24.000 --> 28:27.892
that�s how you are going to get it. And why you should pay for God?

28:28.000 --> 28:33.892
He doesn�t have to build houses or anything. Why should [NOISE IN MP3]?

28:34.000 --> 28:38.892
I mean this is a very, very simple question one should understand.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.892
Because of your naiveness, because of your obstinacy, you have got into a wrong track.

28:46.000 --> 29:11.000
Moreover, I would say one thing as a Mother that I have seen when people become frank [NOISE IN MP3]

29:11.000 --> 29:22.892
where it resides and which is the source of joy, knowledge and complete awareness.

29:23.000 --> 30:01.892
The awareness [NOISE IN MP3] feel them in the hand

30:02.000 --> 30:05.892
and not only that but if you try to find out about yourself,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.892
you will be able to find out which one is burning, which one is numb

30:10.000 --> 30:11.892
which one is giving cool breeze.

30:12.000 --> 30:16.892
And that is how you will be able to find out because now you are enlightened,

30:17.000 --> 30:20.892
because your Spirit is radiating through you, because it is coming through unconscious mind.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.892
You can feel it within, on you fingers, what is wrong with you, where it is wrong,

30:26.000 --> 30:29.892
what are the centres? Now I am here just to decode it.

30:30.000 --> 30:46.892
[NOISE IN MP3] of the present [NOISE IN MP3] future

30:47.000 --> 30:52.892
or you think of the past in between is the present where this Kundalini takes you

30:53.000 --> 31:03.892
and connects you with the [MP3 ENDS ABRUPTLY]

31:05.000 --> 31:09.892
Like you can give realization to others, you can give them realization.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.892
Not only that but you can also cure other people.

31:16.000 --> 31:22.892
You can cure other people, you can give these vibrations, these radiations to flowers,

31:23.000 --> 31:29.892
you can give them to the Mother Earth. You can give it to the, say, you give it to the wheat field.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.892
The wheat yield would be at least twice what it is.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.892
The taste of the wheat would be different; it would be such a different thing.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.892
It is being now experimented in India very much, in a Agricultural University called

31:45.000 --> 31:50.892
as Rahuri University and they have were amazed, how even cows � Indian cows,

31:51.000 --> 31:58.892
started giving milk double the amount they were giving and better milk and a tastier.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.892
So, for the first time, we have been taking from this nature such a lot,

32:05.000 --> 32:10.892
we have been using such a lot from the nature, and we start giving back to the nature.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.892
First time, a human being becomes capable of giving to the nature.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.892
It is a fantastic thing once it happens it is so tremendous.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.892
You can see, that supposing you have a very beautiful television

32:26.000 --> 32:32.892
and it is brought to your house and see it has a remote control and suddenly you find,

32:33.000 --> 32:38.892
you open it and you are amazed that how many [NOISE IN MP3] and have started working

32:39.000 --> 32:41.892
and with this remote control you are changing all the stations

32:42.000 --> 32:45.892
and you are getting all beautiful pictures one after another, so clear cut,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.892
as if it is happening before you.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.892
In the same way, when your machinery starts working, you are amazed at your own beauty,

32:55.000 --> 32:59.892
at your own glory, at your own strength and power.

33:00.000 --> 33:06.892
With this realization, of course, as I told you, all the problems physical, mental, emotional

33:07.000 --> 33:13.892
have to go out, no doubt about it. But the greatest thing that you achieve is your fulfilment.

33:14.000 --> 33:33.892
All [NOISE IN MP3] one can see the change in another person so clearly.

33:34.000 --> 33:40.892
I had a disciple who�s written a book on Me. When he came from America I was, I mean,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.892
I was thinking he is just going to land up in a lunatic asylum because he was so overread

33:45.000 --> 33:48.892
and was such a [NITWIT or NIT FIT?], I mean he could not concentrate on Me.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.892
And when he came to[NOISE IN MP3] what I�m going to do with this [MESS or MAN].

33:53.000 --> 33:59.892
But he got his realization, he got his realization [NOISE IN MP3].

34:00.000 --> 34:04.892
Respectable boy because now he is with the Foreign Service and all that.

34:05.000 --> 34:18.892
Apart from that his sister said, �Who has touched you? What a miracle! I can�t believe. [NOISE IN MP3]

34:19.000 --> 34:27.892
Now the problem is these people who get realization [NOISE IN MP3].

34:28.000 --> 34:51.892
The reason is, the Kundalini just rises because She has been waiting and waiting and waiting. [NOISE IN MP3]

34:52.000 --> 34:58.892
All this happen to these people who were seeking but some of them did lose it.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.892
Today only we had somebody and he told Me, �Mother, I have lost my vibrations.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.892
Now he has been to some wrong type of a person.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.892
So all these mistakes that we have committed as well as our health is concerned,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.892
our habits are concerned, are inside us. They are also there.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.892
Now somebody has lost his father, say, very suddenly. He has a shock

35:20.000 --> 35:25.892
and that shock is within you. It is absorbed but the system has not absorbed it,

35:26.000 --> 35:29.892
is the centre that has absorbed it and you, that insecurity within you

35:30.000 --> 35:33.892
of losing your father or mother or somebody dear one is within you.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.892
You have felt it too much but you have not been able to express it or to say about it and that-

35:39.000 --> 35:44.892
that wound still within you. So this Kundalini comes back from there

35:45.000 --> 35:48.892
and tries to supply those parts of wounds because She is your Mother

35:49.000 --> 35:54.892
and you are the only child She has. She has been having for all these years,

35:55.000 --> 36:01.892
She is your Mother and the Mother who loves you. So she goes back to all these places,

36:02.000 --> 36:08.892
to all these ditches, to all those wounds and looks after them, nourishes them, puts them right.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.892
So some of the people though they lose the vibrations, again come back.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.892
So, you don't have to worry. One thing you don�t have to worry after that

36:16.000 --> 36:18.892
once you have touched your realization, it is there.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.892
Today, we had another gentleman who got his realization in Bombay and I met him here.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.892
He said, Mother, I don�t know, what to do? I went to some another man I got stuck up.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.892
This happened, that happened. Have I lost my realization?� I said, No, you haven�t.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.892
Put your hands towards Me.� And he started getting the vibrations again. But I said,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.892
Whatever mistakes you have done, have to be corrected.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.892
And they, you start correcting it yourself. I don't have to tell you

36:44.000 --> 36:48.892
because you get separated from yourself. You start seeing within yourself

36:49.000 --> 36:53.892
like the same Gregoire, who was, who written this book came and told Me,

36:54.000 --> 36:58.892
Mother, I think, I can see my colossal ego. Now tell me was I Napoleon in my last life?

36:59.000 --> 37:01.892
If I was, don�t tell me, I will jump in the sea.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.892
I said, �You were not, what makes you think that way?

37:04.000 --> 37:09.892
He said, �Because I can also draw very well and I am very egoistical.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.892
I have not seen anybody so full of ego, as I am. I see it like a colossal balloon in my head.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.892
But now he is all right.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.892
Like that you start seeing those things and you start feeling them

37:22.000 --> 37:24.892
and you know how to get rid of them. It is simpler,

37:25.000 --> 37:30.892
if supposing there is a spot on My body or spot on My sari I cannot see,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.892
but if I take it out I can see it and then I do not feel identified with it.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.892
I would like to wash it. In the same way, you get separated from yourself,

37:39.000 --> 37:42.892
you start seeing yourself and you correct yourself automatically.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.892
There is a method about it, there �s a technique, is very simple and you have to be simple people,

37:49.000 --> 37:54.892
to get to Sahajayoga. Sahajayoga is not meant for any extremist type of people,

37:55.000 --> 38:02.892
those who are very-very rich people or who are riding a very high horse

38:03.000 --> 38:21.892
or also not meant for people who are just a very [NOISE IN MP3] four years

38:22.000 --> 38:26.892
and then once they were established now it �s becoming very easy.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.892
In your Brighton only, I don't know, I have not yet counted

38:30.000 --> 38:33.892
but there are quite a number of people who have got realization.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.892
Now I have come all the way and I want that you also get your realization

38:39.000 --> 38:43.892
and then give others also this realization because when you will have this light,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.892
when you start enjoying it, you would like to give it to others.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.892
Now you cannot judge this through your thinking or through your rationality

38:52.000 --> 38:56.892
but you can go to a point and see for yourself that if I am talking of something

38:57.000 --> 39:00.892
that is beyond any limitations of the unlimited

39:01.000 --> 39:04.892
then with this limited rationality you cannot reach there.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.892
Like a spacecraft has to enter into the space

39:09.000 --> 39:12.892
you have to enter into the realm of thoughtless awareness

39:13.000 --> 39:20.892
where you become one with the present [NOISE IN MP3]

39:21.000 --> 39:24.892
Such a beautiful world of beautiful people. Moreover,

39:25.000 --> 39:32.892
I think it is more the responsibility of you young people who are tomorrow citizens,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.892
who are going to tomorrow people of affairs,

39:37.000 --> 39:40.892
those who are going to become the Prime Ministers and the Ministers

39:41.000 --> 39:45.892
and everything of this country and every country. It is the responsibility of you,

39:46.000 --> 39:56.892
to seek it and find it and become that and understand that God is a great being

39:57.000 --> 40:02.892
and we are all part and parcel of that being. You have to just get connected with Him

40:03.000 --> 40:07.892
and know that we also become that great, a drop falling into the ocean,

40:08.000 --> 40:12.892
that�s what it has to happen to you. And then you will know

40:13.000 --> 40:16.892
that you become one with the desires of that ocean

40:17.000 --> 40:23.892
and just dance with the ways of that great ocean of love and compassion.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.892
May God bless you.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.892
I do not want to talk too much and tomorrow I think,

40:30.000 --> 40:31.892
I'll be able to do some more justice

40:32.000 --> 40:34.892
because tomorrow morning-evening I would like to meet you.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.892
I hope it is arranged by these people where I can talk to you personally,

40:39.000 --> 40:40.892
also your personal problems and all that

40:41.000 --> 40:44.892
and tomorrow evening I will give you more elaborately all about these chakras

40:45.000 --> 40:49.892
and everything I will tell you. Nothing is going to be kept secret from you,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.892
but to bear truth you have to come up a little

40:52.000 --> 40:55.892
that also very-very sometimes difficult for people to bear truth.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.892
They could not bear the truth that Christ was the Son of God so they crucified Him.

41:01.000 --> 41:08.892
Imagine what [NOISE IN MP3] hundred times He was but they could not bear the truth.

41:09.000 --> 41:14.892
That is what is the weakness of human beings is that they cannot bear the truth.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.892
But that is why you should not go to [FALSE GURUS or FALSEHOOD?], doesn�t matter,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.892
gradually you will grow your strength and you will be able to bear the truth.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.892
Not only that but a day will come when you will be torchbearers of truth.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.892
It is you people who are going to change this Universe into a beautiful heaven.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.892
It is your own ambition in life. Many of you have this ambition

41:39.000 --> 41:43.892
but for that one should know that you have to come up to that.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.892
You have to get enlightenment fully and understand your Self,

41:49.000 --> 41:52.892
understand your powers, understand what you are capable of and what you have to do.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.892
Everything must be exposed to you.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.892
Unless and until you are enlightened I cannot tell you much more about it.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.892
So, I hope today it will work out and you will get your enlightenment

42:04.000 --> 42:07.892
and then tomorrow we will talk about it more and you settle down with it,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.892
with all the seriousness. This is the greatest thing that you have to achieve

42:11.000 --> 42:15.892
but you have to have that seriousness. Frivolous people are useless for Sahajayoga.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.892
People who are egoistical are also difficult.

42:19.000 --> 42:24.892
So try to understand, it is neither the ego, nor the fear, is going to give you.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.892
It is just standing where you are, you are going to get it because you have the right.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.892
Only have the dignity to receive it. That�s all and you�ll get it.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.892
May God bless you.
