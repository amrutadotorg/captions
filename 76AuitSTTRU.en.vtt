00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.541
And I already spoke on Kundalini yesterday
for two hours.

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:17.680
Those who want to hear My speech can arrange
it with Mr.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:25.460
Rai and can come sometime and listen to it.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:48.359
But today, after telling you about the three
powers which govern our autonomous nervous

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:58.319
system and
the seven centers which look after all our

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:12.920
autonomous behavior, which are the milestones
of our evolutionary different stages…

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:37.210
The centers carry the symbols of deities who
are responsible for our evolution, who have

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.890
helped us to evolve by leading us, by giving
us a leadership.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.909
The whole action has been sahaj.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:58.259
As I have told you yesterday, ‘sahaja’:
‘saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’ means

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.240
‘born’, born with you.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:12.210
In a seed, the complete map of the tree and
all the trees that are coming in future is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.740
microscopically placed.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:29.410
In the same way, in our being, the complete
map was placed.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:43.361
We have crossed quite a long distance to be
human beings from the state of amoeba or even

00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.740
earlier.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:03:10.770
Today I’m going to tell you about what lies
around the normal human consciousness.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.460
We have to understand man in his complete
totality.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:26.930
It is very necessary to know all that is unknown,
because whatever that is unknown is not Divine.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:37.610
We should not mistake everything that is unknown
as a Divine force.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:51.720
And to understand the complete totality of
man you have to open your mind, listen to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.870
Me like a scientist would listen or understand
a hypothesis, and later on if you are realized

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.120
– if you are; that is a very big “if”
with some people, with some people it is not

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:20.900
– you all can testify, you can find out,
but as a scientist you must have an open mind.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:30.150
If you are a fanatic, even if you are science-obsessed
person, you cannot understand.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.540
Science does not know anything of love, it
does not know anything of religion, it does

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.910
not know anything of incarnations.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:51.940
But it can be proved today that there exists
a Force which is the synthesis of all the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.470
forces that are working.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:05.650
And there exists the all-pervading power of
Divine love.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.770
But for that, you have to be a subtler personality.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.830
With this gross human attention, you cannot
realize it.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.160
You have to be a subtler being and to be that
subtle being you are already blessed with

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.470
a mechanism that works out this happening
spontaneously.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.100
It is sahaja, spontaneous, effortless.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.730
Somebody has to trigger it.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:50.920
Yesterday I have told, quite elaborately,
all the chakras and their names and their

00:05:50.920 --> 00:06:00.280
deities and all the three forces, but today
I’m going to tell you what lies beyond these

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.690
lines, beyond the human awareness.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:15.710
Is a subject of psychology, you can say, though
psychology is such a child’s science and

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.020
the knowledge is so limited because they are
probing from outside.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.570
It’s an objective knowledge in the sense
that you come from outside and see things.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.139
You grope at something and say, “This is
this.

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.190
” Then you grope at another thing and say,
“This is this.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:39.210
” You have heard the story of six blind
men trying to understand an elephant.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:49.630
As I told you yesterday that there can be
a method by which you can put the light on

00:06:49.630 --> 00:07:01.640
and one can see clearly the complete, the
total picture of man.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:13.450
In this picture I’ve not been able to show
that part but in the human mind, as you all

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.880
know, there are different stratas of consciousness.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:29.370
Now you are listening to Me, paying attention
to Me, your Chitta is towards Me.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.310
This attention is the conscious mind.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.460
You know that you are conscious of what I’m
speaking.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.390
Moment to moment you are listening to Me.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:49.060
This present moment now, at this moment, this
moment as it is, it’s slipping, is becoming

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.360
the past and the future is coming in you.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.850
Every moment is disappearing and a new moment
is coming.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.970
You cannot stop the present, you cannot stop
your attention at present.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:11.460
Now, to be at this moment, you cannot be,
that’s the difficulty.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:21.300
You either think of the past or of the future,
but you cannot think of the present, of this

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.270
moment.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:33.979
So, we have our past and our future, in a
simple work.

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:37.550
The past, they call it as subconscious mind.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.529
Subconscious mind, they call it as psyche
sometimes.

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:47.959
I don’t know what do they mean by psyche,
they are so confused, but we have a subconscious

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:56.559
strata, in which we store all that we collect,
experiences, conditionings, everything.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:06.670
This work is done by the left-hand side channel,
known as Ida Nadi, which is worked by the

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.680
power of Mahakali.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:15.809
Now this word should not shock all the English
knowing scientists.

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:26.740
This Mahakali power works with storing of
all the experiences, all the thoughts that

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:42.920
are coming to you from the present into the
past, is done by Mahakali power.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:56.610
Thinking of the future, planning of the future,
organizing the future is done by the right-hand

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:04.929
side power of Mahasaraswati which acts through
the Pingala channel.

00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:19.560
In the gross form they are expressed left
and right sympathetic nervous systems.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.170
But for a doctor, both the systems act simultaneously.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:30.420
They are so interconnected that it is very
difficult for them to verify two different

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:37.540
functions which are allotted to them because
the ways and methods are so gross.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:57.820
The left side attends to our emotional being,
the lower left side to our physical.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.610
We can say psychosomatic side.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:21.250
The right side, the lower to our physical
being and the upper right side to our thinking.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:52.850
The center channel of Sushumna is a completely
independent system which works out our sustenance.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:12:04.180
In the beginning, when a person wants to drink,
he wants, all the parasympathetic activities

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:15.649
are performed through the subtle action of
this channel known as Sushumna and the power

00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:20.059
that acts is known as Mahalakshmi.

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:29.730
This power evolves us, it gives us Dharma,
is a sustenance.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:37.139
The complete periodic table, if you have studied
chemistry, is amazingly organized.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:50.949
The carbon is placed as a tetravalent element,
with four hands just like a Ganesha.

00:12:50.949 --> 00:13:01.699
I do not want to go into the details of the
periodic table but it is so well organized

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:13.430
that every atom of every element has to have
the last circle with eight protons.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:26.239
If there are less or if there are more than
four, they either become the negative or the

00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:27.679
positive element.

00:13:27.679 --> 00:13:31.860
What a tremendous planning it is.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:39.189
And when we say there is no God, we must understand
such a tremendous planning could not have

00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:43.189
been achieved by just chance.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:48.999
It doesn’t work out by that law of chance.

00:13:48.999 --> 00:14:03.170
All right forget about God, because suddenly
if you talk of God the scientists get a shock.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:12.269
But He exists and these are His three powers
which perform these three actions in our being.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:24.290
By the first we build up our past, by the
second we build up our future and by the center,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:30.740
the Sushumna Nadi we exist in the conscious
mind.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:46.220
The problem of future and past is created
for human beings by a special method, as I

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:58.739
told you yesterday, that this brain assumes
a shape of a prism and that when these powers

00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:10.129
enter into the brain on both the sides they
lose part of it.

00:15:10.129 --> 00:15:17.899
The one that enters from the right-hand side
passes to the left-hand, losing something

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:19.699
on the left-hand side.

00:15:19.699 --> 00:15:35.240
This one is the Mahakali power which loses
outside, this one is the reaction to the past.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:42.869
You see someone, I see this gentleman, suddenly
I remember of My past experiences with him.

00:15:42.869 --> 00:15:46.199
The whole past of him comes to Me through
that part.

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:56.019
And as a reaction I develop a superego, a
conditioning in My brain, which I have shown

00:15:56.019 --> 00:16:00.439
on the other side like a balloon.

00:16:00.439 --> 00:16:06.339
I’ll give you a simple example to understand
the superego and the ego, how it develops

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:08.329
in a little child.

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:17.480
A child is nursed by the mother and he’s
in complete joy, one with the mother, enjoying

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.730
fully.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:25.429
Suddenly the mother removes the child from
one side to another side, he doesn’t like

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:26.429
it.

00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:33.970
The child doesn’t like and he puts down
his foot there.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:40.170
That is the development of ego.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.269
He asserts himself.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:55.609
Ego develops gradually on the left side in
the brain but comes forward.

00:16:55.609 --> 00:17:09.289
When the child is then corrected by mother,
she says, “Don’t do, don’t do like this”,

00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:11.860
he is conditioned.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.240
By that, he accepts it, and the superego as
a reaction develops on the right-hand side

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.120
of the brain from this side and covers it
gradually, at the age of about twelve years

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:28.039
because language is another way by which they
are strengthened.

00:17:28.039 --> 00:17:39.519
And here, when they meet completely, a man
is made into an egg, an articulation takes

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:44.019
place, everyone develops a separate personality.

00:17:44.019 --> 00:17:51.970
He is Mr So-and-So, he is Mr So-and-So, he
is Mr So-and-So and the misidentification

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:52.970
starts.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:18:01.630
There are many misidentifications we suffer
from, we call them ‘mythia’, we know they

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.289
are myth, our name.

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:12.940
I’ve known people, somebody’s name was
Dharamdhar and he was the greatest adharmi

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:13.940
ever born.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.880
There are so many misidentifications.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.600
We are attached to our name.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.840
If somebody says that, “You Mr So-and-So,
you are a very bad man”, one feels very

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.919
hurt and bad, you see, your anger comes up,
“What do you say?

00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:36.289
This was ‘my’ name.

00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:37.610
”
We are attached to so many misidentifications

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.610
all our lives.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:46.140
The myths starts collecting and we become
covered with so much of that misidentification.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.919
Our ego and superego completely overlap all
our wisdom.

00:18:51.919 --> 00:19:05.399
So the ego is created as a byproduct I can
say, or you can say by the over activity of

00:19:05.399 --> 00:19:09.220
the right hand side channel.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:18.490
The fumes of that activity, like in a factory
you see, are collected in the ego.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.820
And the activity of the left hand side collects
the superego.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.830
And that’s how you have ego and superego
developed in your brain.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.460
So that is how the human being is.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:45.559
He has got his Mahakali power which is looking
after his subconscious activity, his MahaSaraswati

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:57.320
power which is looking after the supraconscious
activity, and his MahaLakshmi power which

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.700
is looking after the conscious activity.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:15.110
Now, there are regions which lie beyond this,
about which we are not aware.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:21.399
On the left hand side, beyond the Mahakali
region, lies the collective subconscious mind.

00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:39.909
The collective subconscious mind where all
that is dead is collected, that is the collective

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:42.190
subconscious.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:50.080
Beyond the MahaSaraswati channel, beyond this
region, lies the collective supraconscious

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.080
mind.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.870
We are part of that also though we are not
conscious of it.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:03.659
We are not conscious of it so we can call
it as still unconscious to us.

00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:33.669
Now, beyond the central path of Sushumna,
beyond the conscious mind, lies the collective

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:35.049
consciousness.

00:21:35.049 --> 00:21:51.250
That is the all-pervading consciousness which
we know as Sat Chit Anand.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:57.590
It is all-pervading.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:15.009
Below the Mooladhara Chakra, which I have
shown you there down below, lies the most

00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:16.830
fearful area of hell.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.039
It exists.

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:24.860
It is there.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.539
We maybe not believe in it but it is there
and it can be proved.

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:56.409
In the collective subconscious, as I have
told you, when we die we get into it.

00:22:56.409 --> 00:23:01.159
Normally, not abnormally but normally.

00:23:01.159 --> 00:23:14.669
Those people who have been extremely unhappy
in life, who have been tortured and suppressed,

00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:21.919
who are being made very miserable and have
a malice burning in their hearts, when they

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:28.320
die they still have the vindictiveness and
they want to make everyone else a miserable

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320
personality.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.500
They can’t see happiness around.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:44.460
Such people, even if when they die they linger
along in this area, which is not gone into

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:50.250
the collective subconscious.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:24:08.200
The collective subconscious receives a normal
personality who has just accepted death as

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.159
a transition.

00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:17.720
Actually, when we die we really do not die.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:35.330
Only part of us, the earth element drops down,
and part of the water element also.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:45.070
But the rest of the elements that form this
body: the different koshas* plus the Kundalini

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:54.309
that goes out and the Atma that rises, all
that put together as soul you can call it,

00:24:54.309 --> 00:25:01.639
all that goes into the collective subconscious
and starts going smaller and smaller, into

00:25:01.639 --> 00:25:13.200
the area of that collective subconscious,
where it is to be placed for getting smaller

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.460
and smaller.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:34.549
But the people who die, as I told you, as
the great sufferers with great desires and

00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:50.580
lust, very depraved and debased people, who
indulge in alcoholism and drugs and sex, who

00:25:50.580 --> 00:26:00.870
make their life miserable, who are violent
to themselves and not to others, who are not

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:14.410
aggressive but are aggressed, who commit suicide,
they do not go to the appointed place, they

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:30.629
stick on around and some of them are really
busybodies.

00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:34.880
They try to torture other souls.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:49.549
All the mental cases that you find in this
world, suffer from the obsession or the possession

00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:50.549
by these entities.

00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:54.440
We call them as bhoot and pishacha.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.799
You may not believe it because people don’t
believe in bhoots.

00:26:56.799 --> 00:27:12.570
You believe it or not but they exist.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:28.559
These people are not ambitious people but
they are sly, they are mysterious but they

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:29.559
are afraid.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:37.149
So they try to find out this type of people,
they enter into the psyche of such people

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:39.789
and they make them even worse.

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:52.389
They make their lives miserable and they make
such a person absolutely abnormal.

00:27:52.389 --> 00:28:03.929
When the psychology starts treating such abnormal
people they perhaps do not know what they

00:28:03.929 --> 00:28:06.509
are up to.

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:16.659
The psychologists, when they get in contact
with such abnormal people, they themselves

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:18.710
are influenced or contaminated.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:27.539
They catch from these depraved and debased,
lusty, sexy people, and they themselves become

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.749
so abnormal.

00:28:28.749 --> 00:28:36.360
Because they seldom have any relationship
with normal people then they start putting

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:46.190
up theories absolutely abnormal: an abnormal
personality is made as a normal personality

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.749
and is made to be accepted by everyone.

00:28:48.749 --> 00:28:57.419
So they start with the theory that you should
not suppress your desires, you should become

00:28:57.419 --> 00:29:03.450
very expressive and absolutely liberated as
far as these desires are concerned.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.450
All right, go ahead.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:14.730
But they are not aware of the other side of
the human beings that those who do like this

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:22.870
can get into the other trap and can become
egoistical.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:29.320
It starts as a trip of their ego, then they
become so egoistical that they forget what

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.399
is saint, what is God, what is holiness.

00:29:35.399 --> 00:29:43.110
That is what has happened in the Western countries.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.559
Perhaps maybe the war.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:52.850
In the war so many people were killed like
that, they must have possessed these people.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:57.519
And such patients must have gone to these
psychologists and these psychologists must

00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:09.679
have come out with these unique ideas of psyche
being conditioned if you tell them about religion.

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:10.679
Psyche is conditioned, no doubt.

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:17.620
If you all the time tell the child, “Don’t
do this, don’t do that”, the child gets

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.840
conditioned, no doubt.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.010
If you discipline a person too much, he might
get conditioned, no doubt.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:34.570
But if you are a model yourself, if the father
and mother both are the models of goodness

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:40.299
then the child accepts it without being conditioned.

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:46.480
This is the central path of evolution.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:54.669
That’s why I say that the family is the
most important unit of every nation.

00:30:54.669 --> 00:31:08.889
All efforts must be done to retain the holiness,
the respect and the greatness of marriage

00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:09.889
institution.

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:16.159
That’s why all the incarnations have been
married people.

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:21.720
And even the Gurus, like Guru Nanak and all
these people, have been married and have been

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:29.600
leading a normal married life.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.429
You go to the West and you are surprised at
the tomfoolery and the stupidity to which

00:31:34.429 --> 00:31:37.890
they are taking.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:43.950
You cannot believe how foolish they have become.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.700
We don’t have to learn anything from them
in this respect.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.450
They have broken their families; they have
divorced their wives.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.480
All right.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.639
Now women have divorced their husbands.

00:31:57.639 --> 00:32:04.070
Ten men divorcing ten women, marrying each
other all the time, ending up in a enatala

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.210
[endlessness] and the children have taken
to drugs.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.679
What a nice society.

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:16.039
The husband comes home the wife has disappeared,
taking a divorce saying, “I didn’t like

00:32:16.039 --> 00:32:18.980
my husband, there was no compatibility.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:27.879
” And the psychologists are very nicely
helping them to build up a society of chaos

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:36.369
and the religion has been thrown to waste
because they think it conditions people.

00:32:36.369 --> 00:32:45.369
It will if it is a false religion, if it is
a suppression,

00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:53.350
For example Christianity never preached such
things that these people are following.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.790
Christ never talked of sanyasa of any kind.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.230
He Himself was a great celibate born personality.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.950
He was an incarnation.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:06.860
But his Mother was married and He attended
marriages.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:16.570
But the Roman Catholics started a suppressed
type of institution where they preached complete

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.570
celibacy.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:24.059
Martin Luther came in, he said, “No, this
is wrong, it should be spontaneous.

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:25.620
” He was correct.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:35.529
At that point he was correct but he went wrong
that he did not recognize Mother of Christ.

00:33:35.529 --> 00:33:40.080
That was the greatest mistake because from
where do you get the sense of celibacy, from

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.830
where do you get the sense of holiness, in
what relationship?

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:49.710
In the Mother and the Son.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:58.460
That’s how Christianity has gone to the
dogs, in that country.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:04.440
As I told you yesterday, they are making a
picture of sex of Jesus Christ.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.210
Can you imagine such a picture?

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:13.810
Can you tolerate in this country?

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:24.020
So we have people who are teaching us who
are actually possessed.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:32.710
Most of the psychologists are possessed and
they deal only with abnormal people and they

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:37.950
cannot normalize these ideas for the normal
people.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:44.750
But by doing that they have created abnormal
personalities and you can find all kinds of

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.470
absurd things in that country.

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.780
That a ninety year old woman having a love
affair with a nineteen year old boy.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:58.810
Can you think of such a thing in this country?

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.810
Is a common thing there.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.130
There is a law in England, imagine and England
is such a traditional place that a father

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:11.440
cannot have bad relations with the daughter
and that the mother cannot have with the son.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.440
A law.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.440
We don’t need a law like that.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.150
I mean we cannot have a law that you cannot
eat the filth.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.540
You do not make law like that.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540
I mean, human beings know that.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.540
But they have a law.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:30.520
Now, the trouble is they are asking, imagine,
thanks to the psychologists, they are asking

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.650
that this law should be taken away so that
they should be made free to do what they like

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.650
in this respect.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:36.650
What do you say to this?

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.720
You can’t believe it but it is so.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:54.252
There was a minister here, Mr Vidya Rao, he
went to America and he gave Me a terrible

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:55.490
experience when I was going to America.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:59.450
He said, “Don’t go there, they will never
understand you, Mother.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.070
Please don’t go.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.190
” I said, “What happened?”

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.230
He said, “I went down to see my daughter.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:10.680
She was away, living away from the main city,
so I said, ‘I’ll stay over here with her.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.400
’ So the landlady said, ‘No you can’t
do that with your father.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.400
’ She said, ‘What’?’

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.400
‘No no, he can’t stay.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.400
Any other man can stay but not your father.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.420
’ She said, ‘You can’t sleep with her.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.510
’ She gave her a big slap.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.380
But this man said such filth.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.350
Where they think doing so wee.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.870
” He cannot understand these things just
now.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.750
They also never understood this thanks to
these psychologists who never accepted…

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.901
Thank God we do not know so much of English
to read that psychology of theirs.

00:36:38.901 --> 00:36:44.060
The way they are ruining these innocent people
by their preachings!

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.310
They are worse than all the horrible preachers
ever known.

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:59.590
With a very little knowledge of this Kundalini
on the left hand side, they have ruined such

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.410
a great place, such great people.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:06.560
So many saints are born in that America and
England.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:14.490
Oh I weep to see all that.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:26.030
They are all ruined by these people, by telling
them these stories which they call as freedom

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.800
and disciplining their thoughts was conditioning.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:36.660
But disciplining through a model they could
not understand.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:47.860
Now, I will tell you how in our country also
people have used these entities.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.620
We had the greatest saints and the greatest
incarnations in this country, no doubt, I

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.790
agree, but we have the greatest thugs also.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:38:02.190
The two extremes.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:06.630
On the other side also we have the supraconscious
people die.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:19.080
I’ll put them together and tell you all
the various types of things they do.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.210
The people who are great planners and great
sort of thinking all the time, “What am

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:25.310
I going to do this, what am I going to do
that” and they cannot fulfill their desires

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:32.210
and they are sort of absolutely identified
with their desires and very egoistical.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:36.400
They are power drunk about women also.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.230
They want to have many women around, women
want to have many men around.

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.610
All kinds of things you see, all these complicated
types.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:50.250
They are not satisfied with one wife or one
husband these sort of people, all abnormal.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:57.370
And also those who think that, like Napolean
you see, these kind of egoistical people who

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:08.190
think no end of themselves and try to identify
themselves with their false ambitions, like

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:09.440
Hitler.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.420
When they die, they go to the other side,
on the right hand side, the supraconscious.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:21.870
They are very dynamic people and they are
the people who are very aggressive.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:31.160
They can also possess you.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:38.420
And you do not know how you get possessed
by them for there are two types of people:

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:45.080
one the depraved and another the aggressive.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:56.760
So the Thugs, who are always waiting for an
opportunity to learn, use these entities for

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.720
their own purpose.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:05.210
You want Me to tell how they do it, that would
be bit too much.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.980
They have a way, they work in the smashana
[cemeteries] known as a Bhoot Vidya, Smashana

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.810
Vidya, Preta Vidya, I know everything, but
you need not know.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:19.930
They capture those entities and control them
by controlling some of their parts of their

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:23.740
bodies, especially the skull and all that.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.410
We had one Ananda Mardini you know that, and
more will be coming forward.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:32.020
You’ll see them one after, they’ll be
exposed gradually.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:45.141
So these people capture the entities in their
power, some the supraconscious and some the

00:40:45.141 --> 00:40:57.790
subconscious, and they try to capture the
people through them.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.590
We have had, say, Ravanna.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:10.560
Ravanna had a capacity to hypnotize.

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:21.890
All hypnosis, all what you call this ESP,
all these extra things are done by these entities

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:28.040
who can be bhoots, can be depraved, can be
very bad.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:35.540
In London there is an organization known as
Late Doctor Lang’s International Curative

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540
Center.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.540
‘Late’, he is dead.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.580
So the Curative Center is what?

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:49.770
This Doctor Lang, when he died, he had discovered
something which he wanted that he should implement

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.980
immediately.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:53.130
I mean, this is written in their pamphlet,
imagine.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.940
It is open, they are not making a sort of
a ‘thugee’.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.280
They do not call it ‘God’ and all that,
thank God.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.480
Others call it ‘God’, but they openly
say, “No it is not, it is a spirit.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.780
”
So the spirit of Dr Lang entered into the

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.740
body of one soldier fighting in Vietnam.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:15.650
This they have written already on their pamphlet,
it’s not My own.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:23.240
And that spirit told this man that, “You
go and tell my son that I am so-and-so and

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.430
that you open the clinic, the surgery.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:35.570
” So the man possessed with this spirit
went down and told the son and he was taken

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:42.990
aback but he gave him such secret information
that the son had to accept this information

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:49.540
and they opened the Late Doctor Lang’s Curative
International Center.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.890
So the thing started working.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:43:01.670
Many doctors who died with this kind of delirium
also started working through that organization.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:05.840
So now they would say that, “If you are
suffering from some disease you let us know,

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.600
we’ll give you the time; that time will
work it out.

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.360
” Exactly on that date, that time the man
would start shivering, “Ho, ho, ho, that’s

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.940
a bhoot I am.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.000
” Something entering into their body and
the person would get rid of his troubles.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.070
But after five, six years that man would rattle
like a junkie car.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:31.180
And now he is completely finished.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:41.630
I have had many patients from so-called Dr
Lang’s horrible institution and it’s very

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:48.060
difficult to cure them because they are such
horrible depraved souls that they do not want

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:54.540
to leave the body of these people.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:58.290
You can use these spirits for many tricks.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:02.840
It’s a very common thing.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:08.670
In our group there was a lady who was a disciple
of some sort of a man like this, who used

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.320
to carry a snake around and all that.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:18.930
She came to Me, I gave her the realization
quite all right, but she was like this, not

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:19.930
all right.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.660
So I told her, “You have to give up this
horrible Guru of yours and your ambition to

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:28.990
be one of those so-called people with power.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:31.330
If you accept it, then only this realization
will stay, otherwise it will disappear.

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:32.350
”
She would not listen to Me.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:39.670
By going to America I told her, “Madam,
be careful.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.520
You’ll get those powers but you should not
accept them.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:46.751
” She said, “No, I will never accept,
I do not want these dead powers, I do not

00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:49.839
want this, I want the Supreme, I want the
Parama.

00:44:49.839 --> 00:44:52.300
” I said, “All right, we’ll see.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.580
”
But she started getting some kumkum out of

00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:01.240
her hand and some rice out of her hand that
made her think it’s a good idea.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:07.470
She’s started her center now, giving away
things.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:11.510
She starting showing all sorts of magical
things.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.480
It ended up by giving the number of the horse
that is going to come.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:24.230
She used to have a big stick in her hand,
she used to beat people when they came to

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.230
her.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:27.930
She became a satanic personality, horrible
face.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:34.560
Such horrible face she had, I mean, I could
not recognize her when I came back.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:41.240
When they told Me that this lady is doing
all these miracles I was most embarrassed,

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.640
I didn’t know what to do.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:48.690
And she had put up My photograph just there
and I had disappeared from the photograph

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.400
long time back.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:55.570
When I came back you know, she called Me in
her house, she brought thousands of people.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:59.530
For such a people there are thousands because
you can tell horses number naturally, you

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.530
see.

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.300
Here I have less but that lady had thousands.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.220
And she washed My feet and did all that.

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.390
I was so embarrassed, I could see in her house
all those entities moving very nicely, jeering

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:16.730
at Me how they have captured the woman.

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:25.970
So I told her, when she came to Me, that these
are not your powers.

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.200
And she got the shock of her life.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.730
I said, “Now you say what you know before
Me, Mataji.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.790
” So she started telling another person,
“You have a house like this, you have like

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:35.790
that.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.040
” He said, “No, no, nothing of the kind,
it’s all wrong.

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.270
” So she told it to somebody else who was
sitting there that, “In your office there

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:43.920
is a man of this name.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.430
” He said, “Nothing of the kind, it’s
all wrong.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:46.430
”
So she just fell at My feet, said “Mother,

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.430
have you taken away all my powers?”

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.440
I told her, “Oh, My child, these were never
your powers.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:58.990
I would have put you on My head, I would have
loved you, kissed you, but these are not your

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:05.500
powers, these are the powers of somebody else
and they have disappeared like that.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.610
”
She got even worse and she said, “Mother,

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.470
please get rid of them.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:16.980
” But then, when she went back home, all
her thousands of disciples waiting there to

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.980
know all these things.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.540
Now what a temptation.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:30.700
She went on and on and now she is in the lunatic
asylum.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.410
And all her disciples will be filling up that
Thana I see.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.300
Thana hospital is very bad.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.280
Some of the ones who were affected by her
came to Me, I didn’t know what to do with

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.280
them.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:50.920
Such a headache for Me.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.230
You can work them out in so many ways.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:59.410
Not only by this, but there are so many ways
by which you can use these entities.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:06.180
But for a normal person who is sitting down
there, suddenly I get a snake in My hand,

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.760
“Oh, Mataji is the most powerful person
here.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.530
” With My own eyes I have seen.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:18.100
I met an ambassador somewhere outside, he
was wearing a nickel thing in his neck and

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.550
he was singing the praise of the man who has
given them.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.360
I said, “What for a nickel?

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.860
At least you should have had a diamond.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.870
After all you are an ambassador.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:33.040
” He got a little, you know, hurting there.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.900
I said, “You are the cream of the nation,
like a fool you are running after these nickel

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.900
things?

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.900
Did you go to asking for these things?”

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.860
He said, “No, I went for Supreme.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.330
” Then I said, “Then why don’t you throw
it on his face?”

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.310
There’s another one who came to Me.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:49.480
They had got a diamond ring.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.450
Rich man, very, very rich and I said, “How
many diamond rings you have got?

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:55.450
Only the rich; “Huh.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:57.990
” “Otherwise why don’t they solve our
economic problems?

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:01.670
Easy thing, bring diamonds, solve the problems.

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.990
”
Now the scientists, if they want to know how

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:13.010
I can tell them there are bhoots, they are
not going to believe Me.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:15.090
So they bring out.

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:20.540
This gentleman came to Me with a diamond ring,
“Oh this is a diamond ring I have got”.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.550
I said, “Very nice, now what do you want
from Me?

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:25.830
I haven’t got diamonds.

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:30.590
” He said, “No Mother, I just ask You
for the Supreme.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:36.740
” “But why did you take the ring?

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:44.140
You can purchase the ring in the market.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.340
How many do you have?”

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.980
He says, “I have many.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.015
” “Can you purchase God in the market?”

00:49:50.015 --> 00:49:58.268
He’s a smuggler, he’s everything and the
Guruji has no objections, Guruji himself drinks

00:49:58.268 --> 00:49:59.268
whisky.

00:49:59.268 --> 00:50:02.860
And the gentleman, he’s a great worshiper
of the Guruji, he also drinks whisky.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:09.030
Guruji does not mind, as long as he passes
on two or three bottles of foreign whiskey

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:10.030
to him.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:15.200
And then he comes to Mataji.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.480
So Mataji asks, “Now why Me sir?

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.570
What am I to do about it?”

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.890
He said, “Mataji I have a problem.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:26.660
” I said, “What’s the problem?”

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:31.450
“I am losing lots of diamonds.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.450
” “Oh.

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.450
What about your wife?”

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:38.720
“Oh she’s completely dedicated to him,
and she goes and stays there for months together.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.920
She’s not bothered about the husband, about
the children, about anything.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.660
Oh, she has dedicated herself to the Guruji!”

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:52.310
So the wife was brought to Me.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.170
The lady is completely possessed.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:59.640
“Oh God,” I said, “Now what am I to
do with this woman?

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.440
What question am I to ask her?”

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.990
Then I took out her bhoot, did lots of things,
took out.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.830
She’s a lady doctor.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:13.530
I asked her, “If you are a lady doctor,
what have you been up to?”

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.400
She said, “I don’t know.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:21.270
Somebody inside me tells me these are all
stones, give these to Guruji.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.760
” “These are stones for you!”

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:29.780
I said, “Mad woman, if these things are
stones for you, for a married woman diamonds

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:36.140
are stones, so they should be dust for that
Guruji of yours who claims he’s a Sanyasi!

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.420
Why are you giving him these stones?

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:41.420
And did you tell your husband?”

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420
She said, “No, I never told him.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.270
He was about to report it to the police and
the Guruji would have been in difficulty.

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:46.390
”
But despite all that and the husband getting

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:56.370
heart attack thrice, they came to Me again
for the curing of the husband.

00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:00.140
Diamonds disappearing but the wife cannot
get rid of the gentleman at all.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.290
They are so possessed.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:05.430
Very difficult.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:13.960
And thousands of them will run after such
a man because it’s very easy to hypnotize.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.860
Even they can look at you and hypnotize you.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:28.750
Hypnosis is a simple mass hypnosis which they
have mastered, which they are using on people

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:34.980
and working it out this way and people are
running after them.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:39.590
And whenever you ask anyone of them they will
say, “No, we didn’t ask for diamonds.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.340
”
Why are you impressed by him?

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.290
Did he give anybody realization?

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:45.370
Anybody has got Chaitanya?

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:50.460
Does he talk of Kundalini, does he know anything
about parasympathetic nervous system?

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:57.900
He just says that, “I’m God”, fair enough.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:06.320
And we all should accept it, anybody saying
that, “I am God”?

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.790
There should be some pramas [premises?].

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.260
This is one style.

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.110
There are many like this.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.540
Surprisingly, Christ was a man who…

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:23.390
Of course Nanaka has written, I must say Nanaka
has written such a lot against them, thank

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:24.390
God.

00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:27.060
I hope the Sikh people are not running after
such people, I hope so.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.330
But Kabir has written, Tukaram has written.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:38.520
Kabir has lashed these people with threatening
and this and that, lashed them completely.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:39.842
But who reads Kabir?

00:53:39.842 --> 00:53:49.780
These pishachas [demons], these rakshasas
[evils], have been lashed by so many poets

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.320
of this country.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:57.570
They have told not to go near these people
who divert your attention from the subtle

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:01.490
to the grossest things.

00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:04.580
But nobody reads them.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:13.690
So they go to other styles of people.

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:22.480
Now Christ was one incarnation who has clearly
told that you have nothing to do with spirits,

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.160
with the dead.

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:29.250
But all the Christian nations are ‘religiously’
spirit worshippers.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:30.250
Religiously.

00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:39.990
In London, you go four steps and you find
one spiritualist sitting there.

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:53.350
I’m not telling you falsehood, we have some
English people, they’ll tell you, you can

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:54.350
ask them, all kinds of spiritualists.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:55:02.510
Even among Christians there are Pentecotalists
who get possessed, and they say that the holy

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:04.770
spirit has descended upon them.

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:08.380
Tantrikas started this in India about sixth
century.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:17.780
It has gone to such a foolish nonsense that
in the temples of Mahalakshmi in Bombay they

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.230
are having this kind of a nonsense going on
there.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:24.160
And when I told the trustees that, “You
stop all this otherwise I will not come to

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.210
your temple to address”, they would not.

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:28.720
They said, “How can we?

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720
That’s how we gather crowds.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.130
People, these cretin women, these working
women, they get possessed, they start doing

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:39.109
“ho, ho, ho, ho”, people come and ask
them some questions.

00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:40.790
”
That MahaLakshmi has some sense or not that

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:45.300
is she going to come to these cretin women
who are doing all kinds of things there?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.180
Some of them are prostitutes.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:52.940
Is She going to enter into the body of these
people to tell you the questions, “What

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:56.600
your father is going to get tomorrow?”

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.930
Is that the interest of God?

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:00.780
Use your brains.

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:12.350
Why God should be interested in such useless,
worthless, momentarily existing things?

00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:20.120
How can you connect it with God?

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:25.080
I cannot understand by what intellect you
connect it.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:40.950
And very great scientists, you see, are trying
to discover and investigate that is dead.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:46.001
So, we have types and types.

00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:47.430
I’ve told you in London we have many types.

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:54.670
Scientology, another thing they started in
America.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:56.740
Oh God.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:57:06.280
But what is the ulterior motive of this is?

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.470
One is power, one is money.

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:12.060
It’s all a money making proposition.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:18.720
When I say that you cannot pay anything for
your salvation, people get a shock of their

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720
lives.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:28.370
They cannot understand a Mother’s love,
they cannot, that a Mother can work like this,

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:32.800
morning till evening, just to give us salvation.

00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.780
They cannot think of a personality like that,
impossible, that she doesn’t ask for any.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.050
It’s impossible for them to believe it.

00:57:42.050 --> 00:57:51.510
In America I went there, people said that,
“Such and such person is charging 275 dollars

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:55.570
for introducing one bhoot into people.

00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:56.570
What about you?

00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:04.160
Why don’t you charge when you are giving
people the Reality?”

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:09.070
I said “How much can you give Me?

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:10.070
How much have you got?

00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:11.070
What is the value?

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:18.340
You put Me in the balance, can you sell your
Mother?”

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:25.460
I said, “You have asked Me once, never raise
such a question to insult Me.

00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:28.270
All right, you have to build a place.

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:31.780
Supposing we want to have a place for meeting
place, all right, you have to pay for this

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.780
pendal.

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:33.780
All right collect money, have a pendal.

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.810
But you cannot have realization with money.

00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:45.720
”
We have to understand one small thing, that

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.900
supposing I say, “All right come My son,
live in My house without paying any money,

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:53.710
nothing, you just live like a parasite”,
will you accept?

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.750
Anyone one of you, will you accept?

00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:05.810
And these parasites are living on your money,
other people’s money.

00:59:05.810 --> 00:59:16.830
Every cloth that they have, every morsel that
they eat, every house they have, every Mercedes

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:20.920
they ride, belongs to others.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:30.760
The society which permits such parasites will
get parasites.

00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:31.760
It is what we have deserved.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.760
Why should we pay for God?

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.760
I cannot understand.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:39.000
Already we have had many of these pundits
and these Thugs sitting in like pundas (pundits).

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:47.800
And then the archbishops of the Thugs have
come as Bhagwans and Gods with all the special

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:59.140
knowledge of how to befool, and we the simple
householders, and these the parasites who

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:06.660
call themselves as the Sadhus and the Sanyasis,
living on our earnings, why should we pay

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.660
them?

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:13.830
Why do you pay to these Sadhus and Sanyasis?

01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:24.430
Sitaji has very clearly told that, “Have
nothing to do with Kashayas, nothing to do

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:33.230
with the Bhagwans, and no Sadhu should stay
in a village for more than two days and one

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.230
night.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:42.960
” She has said, “No woman should have
a man as a Guru”, because Adi Shakti, Sita

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:51.410
Herself, was deceived by this horrible Ravana,
who is born today, who is a Bhagwan.

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:52.600
You see, you don’t know him.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.000
You will know him by his tricks, by the methods,
the way he threatened Sitaji that, “If you

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.300
do not accept my proposals I’m going to
make your Indian women naked” and he’s

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.300
doing it.

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.660
And we are seeing with our open eyes that
photos are blown up and sold in America and

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660
the fellow is a multi-millionaire.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:10.670
And I don’t know what the income tax he
is giving.

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:12.460
It’s a fact.

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:19.020
We are very passive people, I must say, in
this respect.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.960
Why can’t we find it out?

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.840
Is it our culture?

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:36.540
This can be done also, nice cabaret show arranged
free of cost and people enjoy, you see.

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:45.560
They talk very much because, after all, you
see, in the name of religion and God you want

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.410
to bring prostitution?

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:53.990
You want to kill the Dharma?

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.190
You want to make everybody a Satan?

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:03.520
No use killing these horrid people, they have
been killed many a times and are again back

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:10.040
here.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:21.830
I can only appeal to your senses and to your
divinity that try to understand and rise.

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:29.630
Then, we see the other side.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:33.980
You see there are many styles which I cannot
go into details and nothing so important.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:37.910
Better to talk of God than to talk of these
horrid people.

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:42.260
On the other side of the human beings lies
the supra-conscious, what they call ‘supra-mental’

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:46.920
and all these names are given.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:55.280
On the right-hand side there the people who
are extra dynamic exist.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.450
They are also used by some people.

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:08.470
For example, it’s better to give them, these
entities, some names of God.

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:16.750
For example they’ll give a name, say, of
Rama.

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.212
We say, “Oh, we must take the name of Rama.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:22.750
” They are taking name, “Rama, Rama, Rama,
Rama, Rama.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.349
”
Now we must understand.

01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:27.370
What is our right to call Rama?

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.670
Is He our servant?

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.530
That we go, “Oh Rama, come here!

01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:36.560
Look after my father’s health, give me food,
supply these, do this.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.510
” Is He your servant?

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.920
Is Shri Rama the incarnation of God?

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.550
You want to call Him just like this?

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:50.710
What is your right calling, “Rama, Rama,
Rama”?

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:59.390
Because the great saints have said, “Sumi
Rana Karo”, so we are doing Sumi Rana.

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:02.750
Is it Sumi Rana?

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:08.310
Do you have that heart to do Sumi Rana?
