WEBVTT

08:39.917 --> 08:44.542
Tonight, we are going

08:45.458 --> 08:50.041
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

08:56.917 --> 09:02.000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

09:02.208 --> 09:06.000
prosperity and also of health

09:13.250 --> 09:16.333
Actually your country is already blessed,

09:19.625 --> 09:22.083
because you have so many things here.

09:25.458 --> 09:32.458
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

09:37.959 --> 09:41.333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

09:47.208 --> 09:51.083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

09:55.375 --> 09:59.959
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

10:06.166 --> 10:07.917
Also you have diamonds.

10:11.709 --> 10:16.959
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.250
Also gold you have.

10:28.709 --> 10:33.792
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

10:38.125 --> 10:43.291
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

10:45.999 --> 10:48.125
to get to you people.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.500
I’m sure it will work out.

11:05.667 --> 11:09.041
But in Sahaja Yoga,

11:09.999 --> 11:14.417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

11:15.083 --> 11:19.875
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.834
If you don’t have satisfaction

11:28.999 --> 11:32.166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.750
One becomes very greedy.

11:44.792 --> 11:50.291
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

11:54.583 --> 11:58.917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

12:04.250 --> 12:08.583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

12:13.125 --> 12:14.709
who are very greedy.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

12:20.250 --> 12:25.166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

12:32.166 --> 12:37.125
First people try to seek food,

12:40.625 --> 12:41.667
in the Nabhi Chakra

12:43.792 --> 12:46.709
– then they eat – that is Swaha

12:50.208 --> 12:53.667
– then it is being retained in the body.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

13:00.667 --> 13:02.792
he gets sick, he has problems.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.291
But he goes to the second stage

13:11.500 --> 13:14.709
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

13:21.291 --> 13:24.999
because he eats thinking that it is,

13:25.250 --> 13:28.625
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

13:33.250 --> 13:38.999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.333
In a very simple manner he eats.

13:50.917 --> 13:54.417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

13:54.625 --> 13:57.792
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

14:05.375 --> 14:09.291
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

14:17.333 --> 14:23.834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.625
It is alcohol.

14:32.458 --> 14:37.583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

14:37.917 --> 14:40.166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

14:47.083 --> 14:50.500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.583
They give up drinking,

14:55.875 --> 15:01.542
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.041
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.291
We should have Lakshmi

15:14.542 --> 15:18.834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

15:28.709 --> 15:33.291
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

15:38.625 --> 15:43.125
That symbolizes that a person who has money

15:43.667 --> 15:51.417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

15:51.625 --> 15:55.792
– pink color is for love and invitation.

16:04.291 --> 16:08.625
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

16:08.959 --> 16:12.959
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

16:17.166 --> 16:21.333
The beetle comes to the lotus

16:21.667 --> 16:23.709
to collect some honey

16:23.999 --> 16:30.166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

16:46.667 --> 16:53.333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

16:59.083 --> 17:02.250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

17:02.500 --> 17:06.542
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

17:06.875 --> 17:13.333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

17:24.208 --> 17:29.041
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

17:34.750 --> 17:36.375
till the morning.

17:37.834 --> 17:40.792
Then when the beetle has rested well,

17:40.999 --> 17:45.208
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.417
We can state poetically

17:55.667 --> 18:01.333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

18:01.709 --> 18:05.709
because it is seeking the honey.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.375
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

18:22.917 --> 18:27.875
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

18:28.250 --> 18:33.792
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

18:42.333 --> 18:47.166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

18:51.999 --> 18:56.959
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

19:01.917 --> 19:05.291
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.500
as in the West I have seen,

19:07.792 --> 19:12.041
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

19:19.709 --> 19:23.417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

19:26.333 --> 19:28.250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

19:31.458 --> 19:35.999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

19:36.208 --> 19:40.250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

19:46.500 --> 19:50.291
this hand suggests that a person who has money

19:50.542 --> 19:53.999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.083
If they do not share,

20:03.333 --> 20:06.375
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

20:11.417 --> 20:14.291
when giving to others is so joyful.

20:18.959 --> 20:20.875
Another hand is like this -

20:23.625 --> 20:28.375
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

20:28.583 --> 20:32.667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

20:32.917 --> 20:37.709
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.083
Anything happens in your family,

20:51.417 --> 20:57.041
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

20:57.291 --> 21:00.333
you must stand by that person.

21:10.417 --> 21:13.834
Some people try to help their relations

21:13.999 --> 21:18.542
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.583
But by cheating, what you are doing

21:27.834 --> 21:30.250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

21:30.458 --> 21:32.250
you are not really helping.

21:38.250 --> 21:41.625
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

21:41.875 --> 21:43.959
specially his moral character.

21:50.750 --> 21:55.959
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

22:02.834 --> 22:06.999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

22:07.417 --> 22:09.875
there are horrible films coming

22:10.125 --> 22:15.458
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

22:26.083 --> 22:31.125
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

22:35.375 --> 22:37.125
women and men.

22:38.959 --> 22:44.417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

22:50.291 --> 22:53.333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

22:56.917 --> 22:59.333
and you will have problems with money.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.750
So the wealth that you have

23:04.999 --> 23:08.166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

23:08.375 --> 23:11.125
in your behavior, in your living.

23:19.083 --> 23:24.709
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

23:30.542 --> 23:35.166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.875
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

23:41.041 --> 23:44.667
because it floats over the water.

23:51.333 --> 23:55.917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

23:56.083 --> 24:00.083
but of a very mirthful...

24:06.166 --> 24:09.875
and She doesn’t show off

24:10.291 --> 24:14.041
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

24:21.083 --> 24:24.959
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

24:25.166 --> 24:28.999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

24:36.166 --> 24:39.999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

24:43.834 --> 24:50.083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.750
But there should be detachment.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

25:02.999 --> 25:05.208
and still He was so detached,

25:05.417 --> 25:10.375
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

25:18.208 --> 25:21.709
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

25:21.959 --> 25:25.083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

25:31.959 --> 25:35.375
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

25:39.999 --> 25:47.999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

25:52.917 --> 25:54.667
He was living in the palace

25:56.375 --> 25:59.750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

25:59.959 --> 26:02.959
who were throwing pearls on him.

26:09.041 --> 26:12.208
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

26:16.999 --> 26:19.583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

26:19.792 --> 26:22.709
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

26:29.250 --> 26:32.208
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

26:32.458 --> 26:34.917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

26:40.917 --> 26:43.500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

26:46.583 --> 26:48.999
such a person cannot get Realization."

26:52.792 --> 26:58.959
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

27:03.333 --> 27:07.375
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

27:07.625 --> 27:10.750
and He was enjoying the bath.

27:17.834 --> 27:23.041
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.625
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

27:32.166 --> 27:33.375
He didn’t bother.

27:35.542 --> 27:42.291
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.750
Then he says that, somebody said

27:49.959 --> 27:52.250
that now the fire is coming here.

27:55.999 --> 27:58.250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

28:01.291 --> 28:02.959
But Nachiketa ran out

28:03.125 --> 28:05.875
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

28:14.250 --> 28:16.750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

28:20.083 --> 28:25.750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

28:30.583 --> 28:32.166
This is how you are tested,

28:35.208 --> 28:38.542
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

28:42.250 --> 28:43.917
She’s the one who is testing.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.250
All the greedy people,

28:49.458 --> 28:52.917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

28:53.125 --> 28:57.375
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.291
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

29:08.542 --> 29:10.291
they are all the time worried.

29:15.417 --> 29:20.166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

29:24.041 --> 29:27.750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

29:31.542 --> 29:36.709
Because is said also in the economics,

29:36.999 --> 29:40.917
that wants are not satiable in general.

29:46.999 --> 29:49.875
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.625
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

30:00.500 --> 30:02.667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

30:05.999 --> 30:07.583
you never enjoy the carpet,

30:09.250 --> 30:10.834
for which you have worked so hard.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.417
Then you have a house,

30:14.625 --> 30:17.083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

30:21.125 --> 30:25.500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

30:31.125 --> 30:34.917
This is how it goes on

30:37.417 --> 30:40.458
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

30:44.542 --> 30:48.458
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

30:52.041 --> 30:53.750
There is no peace in your heart

30:55.667 --> 30:58.375
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

30:58.625 --> 31:01.667
you will feel extremely satisfied

31:01.959 --> 31:04.500
with everything that is materialistic.

31:10.667 --> 31:13.291
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

31:17.291 --> 31:22.500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

31:26.667 --> 31:29.291
that you start seeking.

31:31.750 --> 31:37.542
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

31:37.875 --> 31:39.999
because you get your Self-realization.

31:46.875 --> 31:53.417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

31:58.709 --> 32:01.750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

32:05.041 --> 32:10.041
and we should express our love by giving something,

32:10.250 --> 32:13.041
whatever it is, to the needy person.

32:21.250 --> 32:23.250
I have seen Myself,

32:23.583 --> 32:26.792
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

32:31.917 --> 32:35.125
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

32:38.917 --> 32:43.834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

32:44.041 --> 32:46.333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

32:52.750 --> 32:56.291
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

32:56.583 --> 32:58.999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

33:05.458 --> 33:08.500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

33:12.166 --> 33:15.542
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

33:15.792 --> 33:22.959
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

33:23.125 --> 33:28.875
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.166
She told Shri Ram that,

33:40.375 --> 33:46.542
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

33:46.834 --> 33:53.417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

33:53.709 --> 33:59.667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

34:18.125 --> 34:23.250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

34:23.500 --> 34:27.834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

34:34.041 --> 34:35.583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

34:35.834 --> 34:40.917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

34:49.041 --> 34:52.291
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

34:56.999 --> 35:02.542
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

35:08.542 --> 35:10.083
So His wife Sita said,

35:10.333 --> 35:14.750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

35:22.417 --> 35:24.875
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

35:25.041 --> 35:28.959
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

35:36.333 --> 35:38.625
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

35:38.917 --> 35:40.125
He asked His sister-in-law,

35:40.333 --> 35:43.333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

35:53.709 --> 35:56.542
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

35:56.792 --> 35:59.083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

36:06.458 --> 36:09.959
What was in that ber was nothing

36:10.250 --> 36:15.291
but giving sense of this old lady.

36:22.083 --> 36:25.083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

36:25.291 --> 36:28.417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

36:37.417 --> 36:43.375
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.834
The other day we had brought some presents,

36:54.041 --> 36:58.458
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

37:06.834 --> 37:10.083
That is how we all have to live,

37:17.333 --> 37:21.291
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

37:27.542 --> 37:31.458
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.417
Think what others like.

37:39.166 --> 37:44.417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

37:49.291 --> 37:52.417
They know what you like to eat.

37:55.583 --> 37:57.375
So if you go to their house,

37:57.625 --> 38:01.250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

38:08.208 --> 38:11.375
And they will make what I would like

38:11.667 --> 38:16.208
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

38:23.583 --> 38:25.999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

38:28.750 --> 38:32.583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

38:37.417 --> 38:41.417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

38:41.625 --> 38:43.250
when you share it with others.

38:51.041 --> 38:56.208
My father was a great Realized soul,

38:59.792 --> 39:04.250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

39:08.542 --> 39:12.375
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

39:17.959 --> 39:21.500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

39:21.709 --> 39:24.208
what about records – he can’t buy –

39:30.999 --> 39:32.917
how will he play?

39:35.667 --> 39:39.999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

39:40.333 --> 39:43.999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

39:44.250 --> 39:46.291
please come and take away the records also.”

39:57.583 --> 39:59.750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

40:02.959 --> 40:05.208
The one who is satisfied

40:05.417 --> 40:08.709
and is happiest when he can give something.

40:15.750 --> 40:19.999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

40:24.625 --> 40:27.834
So we have to learn to share,

40:31.709 --> 40:35.917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

40:36.291 --> 40:37.875
that is Self-realization.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.250
What more can you give?

40:48.458 --> 40:51.625
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

40:51.875 --> 40:53.875
how happy you feel.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

41:02.792 --> 41:04.834
is in giving Realizations to others.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.041
I have seen people, their faces change

41:12.291 --> 41:17.250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

41:26.333 --> 41:31.417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

41:31.792 --> 41:36.375
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

41:45.625 --> 41:48.250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

41:48.500 --> 41:51.583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

41:59.083 --> 42:03.166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

42:03.458 --> 42:05.458
you will not be happy.

42:12.125 --> 42:13.458
I heard the other day,

42:13.667 --> 42:17.542
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

42:23.125 --> 42:26.083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

42:29.875 --> 42:32.500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

42:32.709 --> 42:34.834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.542
I told her, “You change your attitude,

42:45.917 --> 42:49.333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

42:54.166 --> 42:56.208
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.834
Because you have become such a dry person,

43:00.999 --> 43:02.959
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

43:07.999 --> 43:10.999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

43:16.500 --> 43:18.999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

43:19.208 --> 43:24.166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

43:24.500 --> 43:26.792
of supporting, of sharing.

43:35.917 --> 43:39.041
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

43:39.250 --> 43:42.999
who will try to have their own party.

43:49.834 --> 43:52.542
They are very power-oriented.

43:55.041 --> 43:57.125
They will have an exclusive party.

44:00.667 --> 44:04.500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

44:09.417 --> 44:11.458
Everything should be collective.

44:13.417 --> 44:14.959
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

44:15.125 --> 44:17.208
you should know is a possessed person,

44:21.667 --> 44:24.999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

44:29.333 --> 44:33.208
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

44:33.417 --> 44:36.999
and we have to live like one family,

44:43.999 --> 44:47.083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

44:51.208 --> 44:59.083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

44:59.875 --> 45:03.291
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

45:11.208 --> 45:13.999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

45:17.959 --> 45:22.125
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

45:25.750 --> 45:27.291
There are nine Lakshmis,

45:29.458 --> 45:30.999
but next time I’ll tell you.

45:33.999 --> 45:37.250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

45:40.500 --> 45:46.999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

45:47.208 --> 45:51.417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

45:59.375 --> 46:01.291
But I would request you

46:01.500 --> 46:05.375
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

46:05.667 --> 46:08.834
that very few people have got in this world.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.417
Nourish it with your love.

46:21.458 --> 46:27.375
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

46:32.458 --> 46:34.542
If there is any problem, anything

46:34.750 --> 46:37.375
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

46:44.875 --> 46:48.417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

46:53.125 --> 46:56.542
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

46:59.999 --> 47:03.709
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

47:06.375 --> 47:10.792
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

47:10.999 --> 47:14.417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

47:28.999 --> 47:31.083
You got powers,

47:40.333 --> 47:44.375
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

47:49.083 --> 47:50.542
we have to save the world.

47:53.041 --> 47:54.500
So, May God Bless you all.
