00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:44.542
Tonight, we are going

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:50.041
to worship the Lakshmi Principle within us.

00:08:56.917 --> 00:09:02.000
Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth,

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:06.000
prosperity and also of health

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.333
Actually your country is already blessed,

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:22.083
because you have so many things here.

00:09:25.458 --> 00:09:32.458
Firstly, this country has got such a lot of petrol

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.333
and if discoveries are made there’s much more.

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:51.083
Then secondly, you have got beautiful timber.

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:59.959
Then thirdly you’ve got lot of steel, very lot of steel, very good steel.

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:07.917
Also you have diamonds.

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:16.959
So many things you have, apart from that you have so much of heart.

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:24.250
Also gold you have.

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:33.792
So all these things are in abundance in this country.

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:43.291
Only thing is you don’t yet have somebody who will manage

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:48.125
to get to you people.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.500
I’m sure it will work out.

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:09.041
But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:14.417
we have to know that this Principle of Lakshmi,

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:19.875
gives us a great sense of satisfaction.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.834
If you don’t have satisfaction

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:32.166
then any amount of Lakshmi cannot help you.

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.750
One becomes very greedy.

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:50.291
You have something but you want to have more and more and more;

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:58.917
and for that one adopts all kinds of methods and measures.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.583
Thus you also have, a very bad Mafia system here,

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.709
who are very greedy.

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:19.999
For Sahaja Yogis, one has to realize

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.166
that he does not have to achieve anything – he’s already achieved.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:37.125
First people try to seek food,

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:41.667
in the Nabhi Chakra

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:46.709
– then they eat – that is Swaha

00:12:50.208 --> 00:12:53.667
– then it is being retained in the body.

00:12:56.583 --> 00:13:00.333
Now supposing somebody becomes very greedy of food,

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.792
he gets sick, he has problems.

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.291
But he goes to the second stage

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.709
where he sustains it and called as Swadha,

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.999
because he eats thinking that it is,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.625
as a human being, his duty to eat, that’s all.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:38.999
Not for taste, not for greed, not for showing off.

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.333
In a very simple manner he eats.

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:54.417
Like in the west I have seen people are very particular about

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.792
where you put the spoon and where you put that.

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:09.291
They spend thousands to buy those cutleries.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:23.834
Now the thing that is the worst for the Lakshmi Principle is drinking.

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:30.625
It is alcohol.

00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:37.583
They say in India, that a bottle comes from one side

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:40.166
and the Lakshmi runs away from another door.

00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:50.500
So Sahaja Yogis don’t need to drink.

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:55.583
They give up drinking,

00:14:55.875 --> 00:15:01.542
and thus Lakshmi Principle can be established much more easily.

00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:10.041
Now why should we have Lakshmi?

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:14.291
We should have Lakshmi

00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:18.834
because in the symbol of Lakshmi you can see the reason.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:28.333
First of all the Lakshmi has got

00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:33.291
two beautiful pink colored lotuses in Her hand.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:43.125
That symbolizes that a person who has money

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:51.417
should have a very comfortable house, which is very inviting

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:55.792
– pink color is for love and invitation.

00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:08.625
Now the beetle comes to the lotus

00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:12.959
and it has got all kinds of thorns on its body.

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:21.333
The beetle comes to the lotus

00:16:21.667 --> 00:16:23.709
to collect some honey

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:30.166
but it has got thorns on its body but the lotus accepts.

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:53.333
It invites, you see the lotus is very happy to have this beetle in it.

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:02.250
Now the beetle is seeking the honey

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.542
and it gets tired and sleeps inside the lotus

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:13.333
– so the lotus gives a beautiful corona – the bed for it to sleep

00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:29.041
and all the fragrance of the lotus, for that beetle,

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.375
till the morning.

00:17:37.834 --> 00:17:40.792
Then when the beetle has rested well,

00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:45.208
he gets his honey and then he flies out.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.417
We can state poetically

00:17:55.667 --> 00:18:01.333
that the beetle is respected by the lotus

00:18:01.709 --> 00:18:05.709
because it is seeking the honey.

00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:16.375
Even if it has got thorns, doesn’t matter.

00:18:22.917 --> 00:18:27.875
Thus you people who have been seeking the truth,

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:33.792
have received it on your Sahasrara, which is just like a lotus.

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:47.166
Whatever you have done, whatever was the past is not important,

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:56.959
you get your dignity because you are seeking the truth.

00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:05.291
Also when people get saturated with Lakshmi,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.500
as in the West I have seen,

00:19:07.792 --> 00:19:12.041
they take to seeking – they get fed up,

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:23.417
because material things is not Lakshmi,

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.250
because it doesn’t give any satisfaction.

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:35.999
So the other thing that Lakshmi has in Her hand

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:40.250
- what happens that She puts one hand like this -

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.291
this hand suggests that a person who has money

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:53.999
has to give and share – not to take it for oneself.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:03.083
If they do not share,

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:06.375
then they cannot enjoy the Principle of Lakshmi

00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:14.291
when giving to others is so joyful.

00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:20.875
Another hand is like this -

00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:28.375
this hand of the Goddess, suggests that those who are

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:32.667
under your care, your relations, your friends,

00:20:32.917 --> 00:20:37.709
all those people, must be given complete protection by you.

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:51.083
Anything happens in your family,

00:20:51.417 --> 00:20:57.041
anything happens to your relations or to your friends,

00:20:57.291 --> 00:21:00.333
you must stand by that person.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:13.834
Some people try to help their relations

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:18.542
by say – many politicians do that way - by cheating.

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:27.583
But by cheating, what you are doing

00:21:27.834 --> 00:21:30.250
is you are spoiling the life of that relation,

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.250
you are not really helping.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:41.625
So he’ll be losing his name, his dignity, everything -

00:21:41.875 --> 00:21:43.959
specially his moral character.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:55.959
So with the Lakshmi, you must have your morality intact.

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:06.999
In a country, like now, say America and all such people,

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:09.875
there are horrible films coming

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:15.458
and people are taking to the science, we call it, alakshmi.

00:22:26.083 --> 00:22:31.125
A person who has Lakshmi should dress up in a decent manner -

00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:37.125
women and men.

00:22:38.959 --> 00:22:44.417
I find on the street women walking with very short clothes.

00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:53.333
With that, what will happen your Nabhi chakra will be caught,

00:22:56.917 --> 00:22:59.333
and you will have problems with money.

00:23:02.583 --> 00:23:04.750
So the wealth that you have

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:08.166
should be seen in your temperament, in your nature,

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:11.125
in your behavior, in your living.

00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:24.709
Moreover the person who has Lakshmi has to be a very humble man.

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:35.166
For example, Shri Lakshmi is standing on a lotus.

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:40.875
Lotus is the lightest flower you could think

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:44.667
because it floats over the water.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:55.917
So Her temperament should be not of a very serious type

00:23:56.083 --> 00:24:00.083
but of a very mirthful...

00:24:06.166 --> 00:24:09.875
and She doesn’t show off

00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:14.041
because it’s such a simple thing, like a lotus, to stand on that.

00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:24.959
So for people who have money, or who have wealth

00:24:25.166 --> 00:24:28.999
should not try to show off by very big cars and this and that.

00:24:36.166 --> 00:24:39.999
That of course does not mean that you should become sanyasis.

00:24:43.834 --> 00:24:50.083
On the contrary, you should be very well dignified personalities.

00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:57.750
But there should be detachment.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.750
As you saw Raja Janaka, He was a king

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:05.208
and still He was so detached,

00:25:05.417 --> 00:25:10.375
that all the Saints used to go and touch the feet of Raja Janaka.

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:21.709
So there was this fellow called Nachiketa, he asked his master

00:25:21.959 --> 00:25:25.083
“Why do you touch His feet? - He is a king”.

00:25:31.959 --> 00:25:35.375
So the master said “All right – you go and meet Him now”.

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:47.999
So what he saw was that Janaka had all the luxuries of life.

00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:54.667
He was living in the palace

00:25:56.375 --> 00:25:59.750
and in the procession there were thousands and thousands of people

00:25:59.959 --> 00:26:02.959
who were throwing pearls on him.

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:12.208
So Nachiketa thought he should get one pearl at least.

00:26:16.999 --> 00:26:19.583
Next day, he went to Raja Janaka

00:26:19.792 --> 00:26:22.709
and asked Him, “Give me Self-realization.”

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.208
So Raja Janaka said, “I can give you all My kingdom

00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:34.917
but not Self-realization, very difficult,

00:26:40.917 --> 00:26:43.500
because you are possessed by the idea of money,

00:26:46.583 --> 00:26:48.999
such a person cannot get Realization."

00:26:52.792 --> 00:26:58.959
He said, “All right, I will live here till I get Realization.

00:27:03.333 --> 00:27:07.375
Next day Raja Janaka took him for a bath in the river

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:10.750
and He was enjoying the bath.

00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:23.041
And people came and told Him that there is a fire in His palace.

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.625
But Raja Janaka was meditating,

00:27:32.166 --> 00:27:33.375
He didn’t bother.

00:27:35.542 --> 00:27:42.291
Then they said that the people who are in the palace have run away.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.750
Then he says that, somebody said

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:52.250
that now the fire is coming here.

00:27:55.999 --> 00:27:58.250
Still Raja Janaka was meditating.

00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.959
But Nachiketa ran out

00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:05.875
because his clothes were outside, so ran out to save his….

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.750
And still Raja Janaka was not bothered.

00:28:20.083 --> 00:28:25.750
So when He came out He told him, "Nachiketa, this is all Mahamaya."

00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:32.166
This is how you are tested,

00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:38.542
if you are money-oriented you cannot get Self-realization.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.917
She’s the one who is testing.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.250
All the greedy people,

00:28:49.458 --> 00:28:52.917
all the people, for money’s sake, do all kinds of thing,

00:28:53.125 --> 00:28:57.375
as you have here, Mafias, - will be all punished.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.291
In any case they are not happy people, satisfied people,

00:29:08.542 --> 00:29:10.291
they are all the time worried.

00:29:15.417 --> 00:29:20.166
So first thing you must have is satisfaction.

00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:27.750
This is a very important thing in modern times to understand.

00:29:31.542 --> 00:29:36.709
Because is said also in the economics,

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:40.917
that wants are not satiable in general.

00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:49.875
You want today a carpet – all right, have it.

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:55.625
You work very hard, save money to buy a carpet,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.667
then you have the carpet, you want to have a house –

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:07.583
you never enjoy the carpet,

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.834
for which you have worked so hard.

00:30:13.125 --> 00:30:14.417
Then you have a house,

00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:17.083
so when you get the house, you want to have a car –

00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:25.500
then from car, you want, I think, helicopter, maybe an aeroplane.

00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:34.917
This is how it goes on

00:30:37.417 --> 00:30:40.458
and you work so hard and have no satisfaction.

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:48.458
Because of this, in these modern times, people are extremely restless.

00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:53.750
There is no peace in your heart

00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:58.375
but if you have this Lakshmi Principle in you,

00:30:58.625 --> 00:31:01.667
you will feel extremely satisfied

00:31:01.959 --> 00:31:04.500
with everything that is materialistic.

00:31:10.667 --> 00:31:13.291
If you have, well and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:22.500
But after that, this Mahalakshmi Principle is awakened within you,

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:29.291
that you start seeking.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:37.542
And then that is also, later on as you have seen, is granted,

00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:39.999
because you get your Self-realization.

00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:53.417
So nothing to copy these horrible materialistic people,

00:31:58.709 --> 00:32:01.750
but we have to be satisfied with what we have

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:10.041
and we should express our love by giving something,

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.041
whatever it is, to the needy person.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.250
I have seen Myself,

00:32:23.583 --> 00:32:26.792
I find it very difficult to buy anything for Myself.

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:35.125
If it is expensive, I think I should not buy it.

00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:43.834
So once I went to a shop, I wanted to buy a particular sari,

00:32:44.041 --> 00:32:46.333
but I thought it was too expensive – I didn’t buy it.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.291
But one Sahaja Yogi was with Me – he went and bought it

00:32:56.583 --> 00:32:58.999
and gave it to Me on My birthday

00:33:05.458 --> 00:33:08.500
and I just started crying, you know, it’s too much.

00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:15.542
We have stories like this in our Ramayana also,

00:33:15.792 --> 00:33:22.959
where Shri Rama ate the sour ber.

00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:28.875
We call it ber, I don't know - you too call it ber - must be a story like that.

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:40.166
She told Shri Ram that,

00:33:40.375 --> 00:33:46.542
- she was an old woman from a down-trodden society -

00:33:46.834 --> 00:33:53.417
that “I have eaten every, I have touched every ber with my teeth,

00:33:53.709 --> 00:33:59.667
you see, and I have found out that none of them are sour.”

00:34:18.125 --> 00:34:23.250
In India, nobody eats anything which is touched by mouth,

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.834
on any food, is regarded utishta,  is something wrong.

00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:35.583
But Shri Rama immediately took,

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:40.917
He said, “Oh, how sweet of you to have done this tasting for Me.”

00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:52.291
But His brother was very angry, he didn’t like it, Lakshmana.

00:34:56.999 --> 00:35:02.542
Shri Rama ate, He said, “I have never eaten such beautiful bers.”

00:35:08.542 --> 00:35:10.083
So His wife Sita said,

00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:14.750
“Give Me also, little bit, I am your half thing you should give me.”

00:35:22.417 --> 00:35:24.875
So when Shri Rama gave Her, She ate and She said,

00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:28.959
“Oh my goodness what a beautiful fruit this one is.”

00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:38.625
So Lakshmana said, “Why not give Me?”

00:35:38.917 --> 00:35:40.125
He asked His sister-in-law,

00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:43.333
“Give me also”, She said “No, because you were so angry.”

00:35:53.709 --> 00:35:56.542
But She gave it to Lakshmana, and Lakshmana said,

00:35:56.792 --> 00:35:59.083
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.”

00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:09.959
What was in that ber was nothing

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:15.291
but giving sense of this old lady.

00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:25.083
She didn’t have anything to give – she was a poor lady –

00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:28.417
so she did all this just to give to Shri Rama.

00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:43.375
So the sharing of your things is an extremely joy-giving thing.

00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:53.834
The other day we had brought some presents,

00:36:54.041 --> 00:36:58.458
I mean nothing so great, but you all so enjoyed it, and I too enjoyed it.

00:37:06.834 --> 00:37:10.083
That is how we all have to live,

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:21.291
that is how all of us have to live together - sharing things.

00:37:27.542 --> 00:37:31.458
Don’t think about yourself, think of others.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:36.417
Think what others like.

00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:44.417
In India, the Gruha Lakshmis are that way very good.

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:52.417
They know what you like to eat.

00:37:55.583 --> 00:37:57.375
So if you go to their house,

00:37:57.625 --> 00:38:01.250
immediately they will ask, "Please come for dinner."

00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:11.375
And they will make what I would like

00:38:11.667 --> 00:38:16.208
and I would love to eat. They’ll go out of the way to make that.

00:38:23.583 --> 00:38:25.999
But not only for Me, for anyone.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.583
It’s such a joy-giving thing to cook for others.

00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:41.417
So the principle of Lakshmi is only enjoyed

00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:43.250
when you share it with others.

00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:56.208
My father was a great Realized soul,

00:38:59.792 --> 00:39:04.250
and he never used to close the doors or windows in the night.

00:39:08.542 --> 00:39:12.375
And one day a thief came and took away the gramophone that he had.

00:39:17.959 --> 00:39:21.500
So he felt very sad that he has taken away the gramophone now,

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:24.208
what about records – he can’t buy –

00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:32.917
how will he play?

00:39:35.667 --> 00:39:39.999
So My mother joked that, better give it in the newspaper that,

00:39:40.333 --> 00:39:43.999
“to the thief who has taken away our gramophone,

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.291
please come and take away the records also.”

00:39:57.583 --> 00:39:59.750
This is a sign of Lakshmi Principle.

00:40:02.959 --> 00:40:05.208
The one who is satisfied

00:40:05.417 --> 00:40:08.709
and is happiest when he can give something.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.999
If you give with one hand you’ll get from ten hands.

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:27.834
So we have to learn to share,

00:40:31.709 --> 00:40:35.917
as it is you are giving the highest thing to others -

00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:37.875
that is Self-realization.

00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:46.250
What more can you give?

00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:51.625
You must have seen when you give Self-realization,

00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:53.875
how happy you feel.

00:40:59.875 --> 00:41:02.583
The greatest happiness and the greatest joy

00:41:02.792 --> 00:41:04.834
is in giving Realizations to others.

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.041
I have seen people, their faces change

00:41:12.291 --> 00:41:17.250
and people who give Realization, their faces also get full of light.

00:41:26.333 --> 00:41:31.417
We are a new society, we are people of new age,

00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:36.375
where we have got our satisfaction in higher things.

00:41:45.625 --> 00:41:48.250
There are many Sahaja Yogis who have been working,

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.583
giving Realization, but there are many who do not.

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:03.166
Unless and until you share your joy with others,

00:42:03.458 --> 00:42:05.458
you will not be happy.

00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:13.458
I heard the other day,

00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:17.542
one lady told Me that her father, mother are against Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:23.125 --> 00:42:26.083
I said, “What is your relationship?”

00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:32.500
She said, “I don’t talk to them, I don’t like them,

00:42:32.709 --> 00:42:34.834
the way they are against Sahaja Yoga”.

00:42:40.792 --> 00:42:42.542
I told her, “You change your attitude,

00:42:45.917 --> 00:42:49.333
take some flowers for them, some present for them,

00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:56.208
talk to them in a very sweet manner.

00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:00.834
Because you have become such a dry person,

00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:02.959
that’s why they don’t like Sahaja Yoga."

00:43:07.999 --> 00:43:10.999
And it worked, it worked, the parents are now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.999
So the attitude of a Sahaja Yogi

00:43:19.208 --> 00:43:24.166
towards a non-Sahaja Yogi should be of helping,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.792
of supporting, of sharing.

00:43:35.917 --> 00:43:39.041
But I must warn you there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.999
who will try to have their own party.

00:43:49.834 --> 00:43:52.542
They are very power-oriented.

00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:57.125
They will have an exclusive party.

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:04.500
It is a dangerous sign – it’s a cancer.

00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:11.458
Everything should be collective.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:14.959
Anybody who does that kind of thing,

00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:17.208
you should know is a possessed person,

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.999
and you will be harmed if you follow such a person.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:33.208
We are all collective, we have to know everything among each other

00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:36.999
and we have to live like one family,

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:47.083
not only in Russia but all over the world.

00:44:51.208 --> 00:44:59.083
Once you develop that kind of a love for everyone,

00:44:59.875 --> 00:45:03.291
then you will be surprised you have become a great personality.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.999
That means a drop becomes the ocean.

00:45:17.959 --> 00:45:22.125
I can go on saying about Lakshmi Principle for hours together.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.291
There are nine Lakshmis,

00:45:29.458 --> 00:45:30.999
but next time I’ll tell you.

00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:37.250
One of them is Gruha Lakshmi, is the housewife,

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:46.999
and another is the Raja Lakshmi, which is the power of a king

00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:51.417
or of a person who is administrator or who is a bureaucrat.

00:45:59.375 --> 00:46:01.291
But I would request you

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.375
to understand that you have got the greatest treasure

00:46:05.667 --> 00:46:08.834
that very few people have got in this world.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:18.417
Nourish it with your love.

00:46:21.458 --> 00:46:27.375
Nourish it with your compassion and peaceful existence.

00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:34.542
If there is any problem, anything

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.375
– suddenly, you must become peaceful within.

00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:48.417
Then immediately you’ll find solution will come before you.

00:46:53.125 --> 00:46:56.542
This is the subtle of Lakshmi Principle.

00:46:59.999 --> 00:47:03.709
I hope all of you will develop it and enjoy it.

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:10.792
Before I come next year, I will see that you all have,

00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:14.417
each person, has given Realization at least to hundred people.

00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:31.083
You got powers,

00:47:40.333 --> 00:47:44.375
you’ve got powers, you have knowledge, don’t waste it,

00:47:49.083 --> 00:47:50.542
we have to save the world.

00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:54.500
So, May God Bless you all.
