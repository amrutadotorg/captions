1
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:36,215
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

2
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,819
when your attention is here and there

3
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:41,163
it is nothing but your ego that is trying to overpower you.

4
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:48,853
So like that, try to permeate into each other and see the beauty.

5
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:52,502
And you'll enjoy yourself the best because that is the biggest thing.

6
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:56,263
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

7
00:00:56,263 --> 00:01:00,112
Because this ego you know makes you like a nutshell

8
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:04,655
and you just cannot have a rapport with that beauty of permeation

9
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:08,397
and just see how the notes move into each other.

10
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:25,248
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

11
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,606
If there is no love there's no creativity.

12
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:33,514
It's even in the deeper sense, you see.

13
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,698
People who have created

14
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:40,832
all the scientific things are also out of love for the masses,

15
00:01:41,173 --> 00:01:42,657
not for themselves.

16
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:45,266
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

17
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,804
If they make something for themselves

18
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:50,286
it has to become for universal use,

19
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:52,266
otherwise it has no meaning.

20
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:55,668
Even if you say atom bomb and all these things that are created

21
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:56,731
from science,

22
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,367
they are also very protective.

23
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:03,454
If they had not created those, people would not have taken out their minds

24
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,577
from war. Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

25
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,794
Of course, they are having cold wars,

26
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:13,145
but that also will gradually stop, when they will be fed up.

27
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:17,478
So, all the activity on the right hand side, of Saraswati,

28
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,465
basically has to end up in love.

29
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,192
Starts with love and ends up in love.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,628
Whichever does not end up in love

31
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:29,948
coils up and finishes off. It just disappears.

32
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:35,033
So you can see that even matter, which is not used for love,

33
00:02:35,033 --> 00:02:39,498
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

34
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:42,477
Otherwise all such matter that we create

35
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,480
which has angularity,

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,014
which is not fitting into the mass media

37
00:02:49,014 --> 00:02:51,474
which is not appealing to the masses,

38
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:55,334
of course, it takes time, you have seen that it takes time

39
00:02:55,536 --> 00:03:01,854
but it does have that tendency always to disappear in the thin air

40
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:05,660
as soon as you find it does not appeal to the masses.

41
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,294
Now this love of, that we talk of,

42
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:11,663
this great love of God we talk of,

43
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:15,377
we know it for definite through vibrations.

44
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:17,347
People do not have vibrations,

45
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:22,921
but still they can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious way.

46
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:26,489
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

47
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,606
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

48
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:34,457
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained by time,

49
00:03:34,457 --> 00:03:37,038
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

50
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:38,706
There must have been monuments

51
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:41,448
and horrible statues and horrible things

52
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,417
that have been created long time back.

53
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,939
But they were all destroyed by nature,

54
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,840
and they could not stand the impact of the Kala

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,628
that is the destructive power of time.

56
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,373
So, all that is sustaining, all that is nurturing,

57
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:06,847
all that is ennobling, comes from this sense of love,

58
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:11,424
which is within us very much developed, but within others also,

59
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,725
who are not yet realized.

60
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:16,831
Ultimately the whole world has to realize that

61
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:19,684
one has to go to that ultimate love of God,

62
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:22,370
otherwise it has no meaning.

63
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:30,686
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

64
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:35,691
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling all that.

65
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:41,015
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

66
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:45,222
And that's what one has to understand

67
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:50,204
that this pure intelligence, is not to be soiled by our thinking.

68
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:53,523
Our thinking can make us so bumptious,

69
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:58,905
so ego-oriented, so impure,

70
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:07,439
that, we can really eat the poison and say 'what is wrong with it'?

71
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,730
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

72
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,713
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us Subuddhi, wisdom.

73
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:18,064
And that is why to worship Saraswati, to worship Surya;

74
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:21,589
we must have that clear vision as to what we have to be.

75
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:25,210
What we are doing. What filth we are living in.

76
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,395
What our mind is getting into.

77
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,715
After all we are here for emancipation

78
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:31,916
and not for just for pampering our ego

79
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,916
and living with our filth that is with us.

80
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,205
So this light has come within us

81
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,294
and we should try to rise above

82
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:46,736
our own mental filth, which is being created around us.

83
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,269
Apart from that,

84
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:55,427
you have to go higher and understand that there is,

85
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,301
within us,

86
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,578
a thing called ego.

87
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:04,351
And this ego is false, absolutely false. You do not do anything.

88
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:07,067
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

89
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,908
when your attention is here and

90
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:12,900
there it is nothing but your ego that is trying to overpower you.

91
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,364
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood

92
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:22,047
because there is only one ego and that is of God Almighty,

93
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:24,211
Mahatahamkara.

94
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:30,122
There is no really any ego that exists. It is myth.

95
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,797
It is a very big myth,

96
00:06:31,797 --> 00:06:34,604
because if you start thinking you are doing everything

97
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,416
you are doing this, you are doing that

98
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,300
which you are not doing;

99
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,090
then this nonsensical ego comes in and you start working it out,

100
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,083
it can project in every direction.

101
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,112
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

102
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:55,256
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill others, becomes cruel.

103
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:59,281
When it moves [to the] right side, it becomes supraconscious.

104
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:02,392
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,

105
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:04,574
which are foolish, which are stupid.

106
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:09,725
When it moves left side then it starts talking

107
00:07:09,725 --> 00:07:16,242
I mean, seeing things - yourself as a big man, as a big Christ

108
00:07:16,242 --> 00:07:20,530
or as a big Devi or something like Adi Gurus

109
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,480
and 'I am a very great personality' that is left sided.

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,116
When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous one.

111
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:31,593
When people become gurus, which are ruining other people.

112
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,715
When their ego moves backwards then they become gurus,

113
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,370
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

114
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,227
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

115
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:44,356
which is described as absolute Naraka.

116
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:48,007
That's how, is the movement of ego on all the sides.

117
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:53,789
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

118
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:57,723
that is, to talk about themselves, is the worst of all.

119
00:07:57,723 --> 00:08:00,907
Whatever type of ego you may have,

120
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:03,736
if you start boasting about it and talking about it,

121
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:07,941
then it encircles, thickens the walls of ego so much,

122
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:11,772
that it is impossible to penetrate into that.

123
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,884
Because such a person is completely satisfied with himself

124
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:17,274
and he believes that he is so.

125
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:20,501
And once he starts believing into a nonsense like that,

126
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:25,026
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility to penetrate.

127
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:31,842
So, when you boast about these things or you talk big, be careful.

128
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:36,413
You see, you know what I am, but how many times do I say 'I am that'?

129
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:40,752
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations for you.

130
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,906
But how many times do I say so?

131
00:08:42,906 --> 00:08:47,103
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

132
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,222
But I don't say that. If I say it loudly,

133
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:53,526
I don't know what may happen. The whole thing might be blasted with that.

134
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:58,255
So, one has to understand that Mahatahamkara is the one that acts,

135
00:08:58,255 --> 00:09:01,701
that works, that creates. Sometimes I shout at you.

136
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:04,680
Immediately all the bhoots run away. Just once I shout.

137
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,506
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were coughing, they all ran away.

138
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,883
Yesterday just I started.

139
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,719
So you should understand that now you are a realized souls,

140
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,124
you can also do the same.

141
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,292
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

142
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,925
Now will you please stop boasting,

143
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,848
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

144
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:25,695
will you stop showing off! Then it will stop.

145
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:34,187
Now this thickening takes place by people who really are active.

146
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:36,543
Who want to do something about it, not that they are not active.

147
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:39,859
They want to do it. But they know only one way,

148
00:09:39,859 --> 00:09:41,172
is to act talkative.

149
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:43,702
They don't understand that there are inner ways

150
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:49,019
by which you control it much more.

151
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,552
Because they don't want to take to that, they take to this talking.

152
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:56,455
And once they take to talking and they talk about it,

153
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:59,512
the whole power goes.

154
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,900
But if they do not talk about it and keep it within themselves.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,406
It's alright, you can tell Me about your experiences or anything,

156
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,714
but if you start telling others, and talking about it too much,

157
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:15,506
then the powers that you have got will all be disappearing gradually.

158
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:19,855
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

159
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,902
So one should not too much talk

160
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:25,449
that 'I have this power, I have this power' or 'I see this'

161
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:28,098
or 'I do this,' which is a very wrong thing.

162
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,215
I warn you, don't try to show off.

163
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,981
Yes, you can talk about My powers. It is all right.

164
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:37,174
But don't try to talk about your powers.

165
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:40,371
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody

166
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:43,230
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

167
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,220
then you should say that 'we', not 'I'.

168
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,792
'We' have, some of us have felt this power within us.

169
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,834
'We have seen people'. It may be you only,

170
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,489
but you need not say, 'I' have.

171
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,325
What you have to say is 'We'. Then you become the Mahatahamkara.

172
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,683
When you say 'We', Yes some of us', 'we do'.

173
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:07,444
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it, I saw to it,

174
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:10,622
that he should not have many 'I's', but he should have 'We'.

175
00:11:10,622 --> 00:11:13,445
'We think', 'we do', 'we'.

176
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:16,938
Means, the whole collective being, the whole collective organism,

177
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:20,078
living organism of Sahaja Yogis.

178
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,523
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

179
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:25,774
that means, you put yourself down, but put all others above you.

180
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:28,530
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some people have this.'

181
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,592
Thats the way one should do it.

182
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:33,279
Because if you have to overpower your ego,

183
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,114
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

184
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,861
That's how you will make it perfectly all right.

185
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:43,850
Let it spread. 'We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all'.

186
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,848
But that pride is not there. I've seen that pride is not there.

187
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:48,396
Still it is very individualistic.

188
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:52,204
If you start thinking, 'we Sahaja Yogi',

189
00:11:52,204 --> 00:11:55,075
then what happens, that you become one personality,

190
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,715
one organization.

191
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,706
But the person will look down upon other people.

192
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:03,041
He will see that this person is low, that person is higher,

193
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,022
that person is there.

194
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:09,796
But he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis, how beautiful we are.

195
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,309
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga,

196
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,272
how beautiful we are.

197
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:20,377
So always think in the words of 'we',

198
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:25,117
so your ego will become much less, much less, much less.

199
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:29,050
And the same ego, which looked so funny and absurd,

200
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,010
will form tomorrow, the Ekadesha.

201
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:40,697
Today's individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

202
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:44,457
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

203
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,573
So that is how we have to take a mood

204
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:56,629
by which we should think of one personality, all of us together,

205
00:12:56,629 --> 00:13:00,513
all of us together. And anybody who tries to be something

206
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,763
separate or different, he will drop out.

207
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:06,963
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be, it will drop out.

208
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,923
So you just don't worry yourself,

209
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:11,253
anybody who tries to be singled out or anything.

210
00:13:11,253 --> 00:13:14,899
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture the whole,

211
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:20,311
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole. But not to, in anyway,

212
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:23,636
put anyone down. Always.

213
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,240
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

214
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,783
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

215
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:34,684
And the one who has developed this permeating spirit,

216
00:13:34,684 --> 00:13:37,940
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

217
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,341
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have nothing to say.

218
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:45,151
But this permeating personality, which moves from places to places,

219
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,598
whether, you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

220
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:49,763
Whether I meet you or not, makes no difference,

221
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:54,080
but I am permeating through all of you, by little, little things, also,

222
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,753
I am there with you.

223
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:59,664
So like that, try to permeate into each other and see the beauty.

224
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:01,536
And you'll enjoy yourself the best because

225
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:04,142
that is the biggest thing.

226
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:07,076
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

227
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:10,756
Because this ego you know makes you like a nutshell

228
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:15,392
and you just cannot have a rapport with that beauty of permeation

229
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:19,340
and just see how the notes move into each other.

230
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,959
It will be a great idea today,

231
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,814
it's great thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

232
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:28,839
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

233
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,239
And one day I had written in childhood, a poem, I remember.

234
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,205
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know where it is now –

235
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:42,055
but which said that I want to be like a dust particle

236
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,800
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

237
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,840
Can go, sit on the head of a king,

238
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,979
or can go and fall at the feet of someone.

239
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:55,784
And it can go and sit on a little flower,

240
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,314
and it can go and sit everywhere.

241
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,308
But I want to be a particle of dust

242
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:07,813
that is fragrant, that is nourishing, that is enlightening.

243
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:10,453
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

244
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,904
I must have been about seven years of age, I remember

245
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:17,455
'To be a dust particle', I remember that very clearly,

246
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:20,978
long time back, that I should be a dust particle.

247
00:15:20,978 --> 00:15:25,207
So that I'll permeate into people.

248
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:29,047
Which is a very big thing - to become a dust particle of that kind.

249
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:33,807
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes (inaudible)

250
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:39,593
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.

251
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,781
It's such a great thing to be like that.

252
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:46,079
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

253
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,562
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming a dust particle

254
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:53,555
and today just while talking to you, I remembered

255
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:57,952
that I wanted to be that, and that is what this place is.

256
00:15:57,952 --> 00:16:01,136
And Raulbai is like that. She's a very simple woman,

257
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:06,408
very simple woman, and she lives like a very simple person

258
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,110
but she has a sense of permeation.

259
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,422
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday who came.

260
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:15,161
I am sure that they will take up, Sahaja Yoga, very well.

261
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:20,516
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia now,

262
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:22,979
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

263
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:26,117
I hope you have met all of them. Make friends with all of them.

264
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,804
Try to know them who they are.

265
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:31,026
They may not know English - so get somebody to translate.

266
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,584
Talk to them and be nice to them, be friendly with them.

267
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:37,068
I wanted you to meet them for permeation.

268
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:40,015
You should know who are the people here, who are in Nasik.

269
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,506
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis, you see,

270
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,587
who are in that particular place,

271
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,609
and when we go back we have only one or two addresses.

272
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:50,750
It is not a good idea. Try to see how many people there are.

273
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,195
Ask questions about them, and all that.

274
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,399
This permeation is only possible

275
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,685
when your ego starts permeating all around,

276
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:04,169
and this is the way to overcome the problems of the right side

277
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,600
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

278
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,378
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand

279
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:12,605
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

280
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,493
which She plays like music,

281
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,300
and the music penetrates into the heart.

282
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,889
You don't know how it goes into you and how it works out.

283
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:24,448
And that’s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi should permeate

284
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:27,100
like music into other people.

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,319
She has so many qualities, as I told you, which cannot be described

286
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:35,825
in one lecture. But one of the greatest qualities of Hers is

287
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:40,195
that She ends up into subtler things.

288
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:45,589
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance,

289
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:49,507
music will end up into melodies.

290
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:53,194
Like that, whatever She creates ends up into something greater.

291
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:57,121
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up into aesthetics.

292
00:17:57,121 --> 00:18:00,864
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

293
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:04,425
Like that everything. Now you will say what is water.

294
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:07,494
Water becomes the river Ganges.

295
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,509
These are the subtler things.

296
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,614
So the matter gets into subtler thing

297
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:16,047
because it has to permeate, it has to permeate.

298
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:21,799
So everything whatever it is. And the best of all is the air.

299
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,810
That air becomes the vibrations.

300
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:32,766
So you can see how, whatever has come out from this matter,

301
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:38,275
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

302
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:41,976
Of course, the left and right side both work it out

303
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,673
because the love

304
00:18:43,673 --> 00:18:46,808
has to work on this and when love acts on matter

305
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:49,094
it becomes that.

306
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,564
And that is how one has to look at your own lives,

307
00:18:53,564 --> 00:19:00,371
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

308
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,098
May God bless you!
