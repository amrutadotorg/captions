00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.760
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.300
You are all here to seek the truth.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.800
One has to realize that truth is what it is.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.240
We have to know the truth; Truth does not have to know us.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.560
And the truth lies within us, within our being and the instrument

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.560
of knowing the truth is what he has described it to you today.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.620
Now if you have got your eyes, you can see clearly

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.340
that this is a white color. You don't have to pay to your eyes for that -

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.080
that's a truth. You all see the same thing.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.560
If you are passing through a dirty lane, it's obnoxious

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.800
and you know it's a dirty lane you're passing through.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500
But a dog does not know the truth, a horse does not know.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.920
They can all pass through that without feeling anything about it.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.480
So you are at a higher level than all the animals put together,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.720
all the living things that you see, you are at a higher place.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.940
So, what is the purpose

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.740
of our being human-beings.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.120
The only purpose is to know the truth.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.400
Many people say that truth is love and love is truth.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.920
People don't understand. At human level it's a very illusive,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.040
deceiving sentence. Maybe, love may not be the truth, truth may not be love.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.700
But when they say truth is love, they mean to say

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.760
that the All- Pervading power of God'e love

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.600
which is in a subtle form,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.480
which runs all our living processes

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.580
is the truth.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.540
All of them, all the great Scriptures have described

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.660
that All-Pervading power of God exists.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:54.600
You have never felt it so, you should keep your minds open about it.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.080
Not to close your minds - it's unscientific, I think, to close your minds.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.120
And if there is something existing like that, why should we not know it?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.100
It is our birthright to know about that truth which pervades

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.380
all over.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.160
Scientifically it is said that we have evolved from amoeba stage.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.260
Why have we evolved from amoeba stage to human stage and have we reached our last stage?

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.060
Have we reached our Absolute stage? Are we at an Absolute point?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.500
We are not. The proof is we are in a chaos.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.980
We do not know what is right, what is wrong. We cannot say this is right and this is wrong.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.060
All of us do not say the same thing.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.500
Then that's not the truth because we have not reached the stage where

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.600
we feel the truth, all of us the same.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.420
But our idea about truth is very different.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.080
I've already told you, it's not an idea; Truth is what it is -

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.140
is the existence of Truth.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.000
So some people think that truth is in belonging to certain faiths

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.260
or believing into certain groups or into some fanaticism

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.400
or could be some sort of a false guru who does not know the truth itself.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:23.860
But one should know one thing for definite that if we have to evolve, it has to be done through some living process.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.320
And the living process cannot be explained but can be experienced.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.260
Now in the human body anything foreign that goes in is thrown out.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.660
But when a lady conceives

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:55.320
that foreign body is nourished, nurtured and thrown out at a right point.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.920
Nobody can explain how it happens.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.700
It can be explained what is the mechanism that works it out.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.400
In the same way one can explain the mechanism that works out your re-birth

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.120
where you know the truth and the truth dawns upon you

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:32.920
that you are the Spirit, you are the reflector of God.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.360
This is the truth you have to know.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.360
For that, there is a mechanism placed within us beautifully.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:55.060
Of course, doctors may not know about it for the time being - they know little bit.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.240
Then the Parasympathetic Nervous System they call it, about which they don't know much.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:09.120
Now within us lies, as you see, the three channels -

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.840
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center of the Autonomous Nervous System.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:22.640
And these three channels represent on the left side

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.100
the emotional side, the desire side and the right channel

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.880
is for the actions of these emotions and desires

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:44.100
and the central path is for coordinating and co-operating.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.560
All the problems that human-beings have

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.200
are caused by their imbalances - very simple thing it is.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.180
If you go to the roots of everything, this is the knowledge of the roots, of our roots.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.760
They're very simple problems because

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.720
When you have imbalances, when you go too much to the left

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.920
or too much to the right, you create imbalances.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.060
and these imbalances cause

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.860
physical, mental, emotional, spiritual problems.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:45.880
Of course there could be also Psychosomatic both combined - like emotional combined with physical also.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:54.100
But it's a simple thing is that you go into an extreme

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:04.220
in anything. The human nature is such that we must go to the extremes.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:11.080
Like one gentleman used to smoke a lot and I started coughing.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.980
It was a no smoking zone. I requested the gentleman, "Sir, if you don't mind

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:24.720
I've to give a speech in the evening, can you stop smoking?" He said, "No, I can't."

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.040
I kept quiet. So he has a double problem.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:39.820
First is the problem that he cannot get over his habit - that is his left side

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.320
and the another problem is the right side that he cannot get over his ego.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.720
Such combinations could be there.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:58.140
But basically the problem is that you cannot remain in the center, in the balance.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.200
Sometimes you go to one extreme, from there you go to another extreme.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.740
Like some people who're extremely dominating, very arrogant,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:19.380
hot-tempered, suddenly become very sullen,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.640
quiet, depressed.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:31.120
Half of the life they impress other and half of the life they get depressions.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.420
Such personalities we have all around us and within us.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:48.200
Now how to keep in the center, is the problem nowadays because there are so many

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:55.180
alterations to our attention all the time, you have to alter it.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.520
Today you have to, say T.V., then there's a politics going on, then this is going on, that is going on -

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.780
our mind is all the time changing from one to another, skipping from one to another.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.360
We are living in a very hectic type of world

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.260
where our attention is not at all steady in the center - it cannot remain.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.120
At this juncture, thank God, the modern sahaja yoga was born - I was found out.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.500
Formerly, one or two persons used to get realization -

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:44.640
very few people used to get realization, at the beginning of the tree of life, I should say.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:55.120
But I thought, in those days of complete chaos

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.900
and such a lot of pressures on people -

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.460
they have no time to go to Himalayas and work it out.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:15.240
You have to have something very instant. But there was a problem with it.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:23.260
Supposing you try to enlighten people and they just get a wee bit,

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.340
then what happens.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.020
Formerly they used to cleanse the body, everything

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:38.440
for years together and ultimately give the realization to one person - good for nothing.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:47.200
Nobody understood any Incarnations, [UNCLEAR] prophets or saints because they talked of some another world.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.920
That's why they crucified Christ or gave poison to Mohammad Sahab - did all kinds of things all over the world.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:06.140
With sahaja yoga this mechanism is activated

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:11.560
where you have got this Kundalini, the power,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.360
that manifests your Self-realization.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.640
She's a power, I call it She because it's the Mother's power -

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:29.020
it is your Mother, She gives you birth so She's your Mother and She's your individual Mother.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.780
She takes all problems upon Herself. Every time I've been giving lectures, people ask,

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.140
"But we have read in such and such book that Kundalini rising gives troubles." I just don't know.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.200
Either they're negative people who are trying to keep you away from reality

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.120
or maybe, they don't know what Kundalini is.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.920
She is your Mother, waiting all these days, within yourself - this power -

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.660
in 31/2 coils because it's some mathematics about it.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:15.580
And She is activated then she rises just like a primule in a seed.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:23.600
As soon as you put the seed in the Mother Earth and nourish it with little water,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:32.280
in the same way, with little love, the Divine love, She's activated and She starts rising.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:42.400
With your naked eyes, in some people who have obstructions, in the lower chakras you can see clearly

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:50.500
the pulsation at the triangular bone. With your naked eyes you can see it clearly.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.060
Imagine a bone pulsating like a heart

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.480
and you can see the rising and you can see it's obstruction where it stops

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.240
Supposing you are a liver patient, it will go to your liver first.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.240
informing that first liver should be corrected.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.980
Or maybe if you are a great seeker, then She shoots off, comes out, out of your

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:28.440
fontanel bone area but again She descends back to the problems where

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.860
She has to attend - is a very practical thing to understand.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.720
Sahaja yoga, you cannot pay for it - is nonsense. How can you pay for anything that is living?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.820
When you pay for God or somebody says, "I'm God or this and that," you pay money. I've been telling you,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:57.640
I've been here four times before, every year I was telling you,"You can't pay for God, God doesn't understand money, this is your headache,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.720
why do you want to pay for anything that is living process?"

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:10.380
But nobody liked Me at that time, to such an extent that in England they told Me

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.360
that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything without money.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.760
I was surprised, who has made this brain God has made or somebody else.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.440
You cannot pay for it, that is the first criteria.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.840
It's your own right to have it, it's sahaja, born with you.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:43.180
And when She rises, She pierces through all these six chakras - the one chakra is below Her, which guards

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.500
the movement of the Kundalini completely and rises through six chakras

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.020
and pierces through the sixth chakra, giving you a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:03.080
Now no one knows who is the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the power of God,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:11.160
is the desire of God and She is reflected

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.980
as Kundalini in the triangular bone.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:28.080
That desire is the pure desire within us. All our desires are impure because they never give us satisfaction.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.540
Economic says that in general wants are not satiable.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.740
So now, we have got

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:52.460
the knowledge about the mechanism but it must work.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.720
For example, in this hall you see beautiful lights are there and you must have put just one switch and everything must have

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:07.040
manifested but there's a mechanism behind it, a history behind it.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:15.740
All these centers are the mile stones of our evolution. The last one is this,

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.680
is the limbic area which is called as Sahastrara.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:32.820
If you cut the brain horizontally, you can see as if you have cut a lotus

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.140
and the inner part is a vacuum which is the limbic area.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:50.300
So this Kundalini enters into the limbic area, opens from both the sides this

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:58.420
calyx or the outside of this lotus and pierces through that.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:04.300
Now what is the calyx that we have formed, are two uh..

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.480
balloon like growths within us - one is the ego.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:18.560
When we work, when we do anything, you always think we have done it.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.900
Now just see what we have done, is dead to dead.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:30.180
For example, from some tree they must have made this platform - which was a dead tree, made another dead thing.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:40.800
From something dead they have made the chairs. Now if you're sitting on the chairs, you can't sit on the ground - the chair sits on our head.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.560
Wherever you move you have to take the chair with you, otherwise you can't sit.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.320
So this matter is trying to overpower us.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.320
That's all. This is the ego that builds within us.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:04.580
We have done nothing but just change forms from dead to dead.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.560
Here I'm talking about transforming

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.880
uh.. human-being into a new human-being, into a human-being where there is spiritual light.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:26.960
In Sanskrit language, a person who is a realized soul as called as 'dwijah' - means born twice

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.340
and also a bird is called as a 'dwijah' meaning the bird

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.520
also comes as an egg and then becomes the bird.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:46.320
In the same way we get a transformation and that transformation

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:53.960
brings us to a position where we are in Absolute status,

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:02.720
in Absolute condition. When the Kundalini passes through Agnya chakra - here, this one, the center of Christ

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:10.740
- She pushes down both these ego and superego, which you see the two balloon like structures.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:19.840
As a result of that we get a soft bone opened up again, as you had in your childhood

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:28.340
and you feel thoughtless, there's no thought. If you want to think, you can think

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:35.120
but no body is going on inside all the time - you feel the peace within yourself.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:42.100
And when She pierces through completely then you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:48.360
and also if your this center is all right, you can feel the cool breeze around.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:59.760
As a result of that the centers which are like this, we can say, the centers

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:05.840
which have moved because of our left and right movement on the sides and have broken

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:14.240
the connection with the whole, again go back to their original positions and they get nourished

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.860
and the energy that was exhausted in them starts flowing.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:25.680
That's how our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being is corrected.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.440
Most of the diseases can be cured with this Kundalini awakening but I'm not curing you,

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:44.680
you are curing yourself. Only thing is your medicine lies within you which has to rise and give you this. This is all yours

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.720
for which why should you pay anyone, why should you feel obliged - I'm just a catalyst.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:03.500
If this happens to you, is a very great thing because then your hands will speak -

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:09.260
as Mohammad sahab has said that, "At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:16.840
Hands start speaking means what, that on your finger-tips you can feel the seven centers

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:22.560
and you can see in another person what's wrong with the other person, what's wrong with your self.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:31.160
Now only if you know what is the decoding is and how to cure a particular center

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.880
finished - don't have to do anything else but this much.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:46.320
Of course in some people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, specially spiritually are sick,

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.760
it takes little time to settle down.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:58.000
Though you might get your realization today but the Kundalini has to be brought back and to be settled there.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:06.920
Like, like a little sapling you have to look after it in the beginning and then you absolutely become the master.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.640
I've seen people who had their realization as late as

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:20.380
'84 or '85, are today great masters of sahaja yoga.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.580
It's very surprising. Now these masters of sahaja yoga don't stand on their heads,

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:39.300
don't do abnormal things, they don't have to do much jogging or anything - your body comes to that position what you need.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:48.480
For example, somebody needs more water so it's all right, somebody doesn't need  more water, it's all right but certain,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:55.580
certain kind of uh.. exercises which are needed to improve the condition

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.820
of the particular chakras can be done.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:07.280
But the main thing is to keep the Kundalini here so that the Spirit which is in your heart -

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.580
has a seat here - is all the time kept enlightened.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:20.400
That's the main job. Now the biggest problem I face today is this,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:28.760
that in India people are quite capable to know who is a real master who is not.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:34.740
Thank God we are not so rich to throw our money for realization.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:44.100
So, we don't have these false gurus there. They all come to Australia or to America - wherever there is money they're coming down.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:54.420
But the main problem - I don't mind there are lots of thugs in this world, you see, smugglers are there, it's all right

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:03.360
and there are many people who are cheated, it's all right - but the main thing is they attack the Kundalini,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:12.720
they attack the central path. I've known many people getting cancer

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:18.140
because they have been to some gurus because it is a psychosomatic thing, even AIDS

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.500
uh..could be due to certain things

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:28.500
I had cured one fellow who was doing TM, I'd cured him completely.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:35.720
Doctors said that he's completely cured of AIDS but again he started uh..going to some TM fellow, again he got it

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.920
and he died - it was in Australia. Then I gave it up because you get frustrated with such people.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.380
When I told him not to go to that person, particular person, then again he went down to that person

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:57.280
because these people are using all these false gurus, are using some sort of spirits

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:05.280
to keep you bound to them so that all that you have your money, your properties, everything they get.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.040
Their main purpose, the honesty of purpose is that they want money - that's all.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.900
Money they can have but money they can't have unless they mesmerize you

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.000
or involve you into something nonsensical.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.600
I've seen people getting into trouble, very much, if they have had wrong gurus

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:38.640
and I'm surprised. These gurus have given them nothing, they have taken all their money,

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:45.760
they have taken all their wisdom, they have lost their jobs but still they are sticking on  to them like leeches.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:57.700
In London we have people from TM itself, I would say - there are people in London who are recluses, absolutely.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.440
They're suffering from some sort of a secret disease they can't explain. Some of the politicians are suffering

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:12.720
but still they going on and on and on and I've been telling openly about it, nobody listens to Me.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.020
It happened when I told them in '83 or '84

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.320
that this disease is going to come to America - they didn't listen to Me.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.440
I told on the television from Santiago, from Los Angeles, from San Francisco, from New York

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.240
but nobody bothered about it and today when I go there they all say, "Mother, we are in it."

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.600
And you get disgusted with them because they are so much now weak that they cannot get over

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.480
all those attachments they have had.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:56.100
It's the attack of the negative.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:04.580
Tremendous negativity is working out that you don't get your realization,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.860
that you don't achieve your highest.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:18.560
So much of negativity everywhere I find and I just don't know how I am going to help all of you.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:26.420
First of all you must understand that all these wrong things have rendered nothing to you and nothing to anybody else.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:35.300
So many cases of cancer have been cured by sahaja yoga - we're making now a big file out of it.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.100
Recently, the Delhi University has given us a

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.480
PhD. for doctors for research in sahaja yoga, even Cambridge may do it.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:55.140
There are so many doctors busy to find out how sahaja yoga has cured

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.500
so many types of cancers,  livers, diabetes.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.800
Already papers have been published about how the physical health

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.100
of the people has improved by doing sahaja yoga.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:20.360
Blood pressures, tensions all these things managed.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.840
These sahaja yogies don't lead an abnormal life. They wear normal dresses, they live like normal, decent,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:37.100
of course decent people, not like cutting this part of the hair, that part of the hair, then putting tar on your head.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.180
The other day I said, "We are not hippopotamus to do all these things, you see."

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:49.080
All sorts of abnormal things they give up. They become sensible, serene, good citizens.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.540
They have good wives. We had 71 marriages this year.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:02.300
and you'll be happy to know that all of them are very successful and they have very great children born to them.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.140
Children won't be born to people who are all the time fighting among themselves, wasting their life.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:17.120
Only bad people will be born to them who can bear all that but good children are born to sahaja yogies.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:24.400
I'm so happy to see, in Melbourne, we had a very good report from the government

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.460
for our schools that whatever they proclaim, that they are.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:35.220
How many schools can do that, though it's rather difficult here to run private schools.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.740
In all fields sahaja yoga is showing good results because once a person is transformed

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:50.540
most of your problems will drop out - you are such a satisfied person you will not be a dishonest politician,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:59.880
you'll not be a dishonest preacher, you'll not be a bad father, bad mother

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:06.500
and not arrogant children. A beautiful society is established now -

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.000
in Sydney we lots of people, in Melbourne also.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:21.620
Only thing is you have to come in the center and to come in the center you have to have your Kundalini awakened, free of cost.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:30.120
It sounds fantastic, it sounds out of the blue normally

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:38.560
but it's nothing so fantastic. Say for example, now you have got a T.V. here but in Indian villages they have not seen the T.V.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:44.920
Now if you take the T.V. there and say, "You can see everything whatever is happening in the whole world."

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:52.880
They will say, "Ah! What are you telling us stories, how can it be?" Then you put it to the mains and it works.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:34:01.020
In the same way you are made beautifully within yourselves. Human-beings are the greatest computers,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:07.740
the greatest knowledgeable things - the whole knowledge rests within them.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:15.960
All that is within has come out and has become the so-called knowledge but they become the knowers.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:25.280
And when it happens, suddenly you find dynamic things happening.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:31.560
We had a boy in Portugal who was doing little pottery work.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:37.840
He came to sahaja yoga, today he is a very big potter earning lots of money.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:46.420
We had some people who used to just paint ordinarily - they have become very great painters and earning quite a lot, in your country.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.720
You just become dynamic and things work out in every way possible.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:00.700
In this short time, whatever is possible for the introduction I have told you but tomorrow in details I'll tell you

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:06.420
all that can work out with sahaja yoga. May God bless you all!

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:17.300
Today being the first day, I: would like to give some time for questioning.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.020
But ask sensible questions, I'm not seeking votes nor I'm going for an election.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.640
Here I am to give you what you have, so don't ask questions which are aggressive.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.820
Or if you belong to some group - like the other day we had somebody from 'Born Again' or something -

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:47.920
they're already having trouble and he came to hit Me and all that; So that sort of a thing is not needed.

- Somebody has to come [UNCLEAR]
 - [UNCLEAR]

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:21.000
- No question?
 - Yes, one question Mother. Are you a guru or do you have a guru?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.740
No, I had no guru and I'm a Mother, I'm not a guru.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:34.000
See guru is, of course in a way Mother is a guru all the time - she's a teacher all the time - no?

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:40.880
But there's a big difference between a real guru and a mother. See, real guru in India

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.480
will give you a real hard time - never go near them.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:59.740
One fellow who came all the way from Himalayas, he told Me, "My guru has come here and he wants to come and meet You."

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.240
They also regard Me as their Mother and they also respect Me.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.040
So I said, "All right, I'll go and see him now." So went there.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:19.800
So on the way he said, "Today, my guru hanged me uh.. by a rope

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.560
upside down in a well and kept me hanging there for six hours

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.120
and he used to dip me every time, every hour and

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:38.520
then he brought me up and said, 'Now you go and call Mataji.'" I said, "What's that, it's terrible! I mean, why is he so cruel?"

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:45.460
So I asked his guru, I said, "What do you mean by treating him like this, you have no business? Why do you treat him, he's a seeker?"

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.800
He said, "Do you know he was smoking?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:55.820
Smoking he's doing at this time, what will happen to him, why should I give him realization?"

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:04.080
So I said, "What's the problem with his realization?" So he went inside. The guru just got angry, went inside.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:12.340
I said, "What's the matter with you?" He said, "My Agnya chakra is catching and my guru says that, "Nobody opened mu Agnya chakra for ten years

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:20.000
and I'm not going to open your Agnya chakra." I said, "Why? Just come here." One minute I opened his Agnya chakra - he got his realization.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:28.820
So he came out, the guru. He said, "That's Mother! That's not a guru, that's a Mother. She can do it, not me. Who opened my Agnya chakra?"

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.300
Like that, you see - they're terrible, they take you to task.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:40.940
So don't go near a real guru - they will not take any money or anything but take you to task.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:48.900
It's better take your sahaja yoga and become yourself a guru of your own. And no use asking questions about Me. It doesn't,

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:57.940
doesn't help much - better know yourself. I'm here for you to know yourself. You know yourself, then you'll know Me better, isn't it?

How do you stop being sad about things - sometimes it is very hard

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:20.160
- Sometimes..
 - It's very hard to be stop, to stop being sad.
  - Sad?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.260
Because you are very left sided, that's why you are sad.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:31.200
If I bring you in the center, you'll be joy and a source of joy too.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:42.600
Something gone wrong with the machine, you see. Supposing something goes wrong with this machine, it will make funny noises.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.060
Supposing I'm an expert mechanic, I can correct it then it's flowing all right.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:04.600
- Mother, I want to ask a question.
 - Please get up, please and we can't hear you, sir.

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:12.200
- Yes please, sir.

- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]
 - Hmm?

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.900
- Right. You have talked to us about the curing of diseases
 - Hmm

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:40.660
Uh..You have not mentioned so much about the prevention of diseases or the causes of them.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:48.380
You see, you don't get diseases at all after realization so there's no need to work out much of prevention.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.060
After realization you don't pay any bills to the doctor.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.760
So the preventions are not needed but in certain things, like say, supposing somebody's a liver patient -

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:07.940
now in sahaja yoga we have two types of livers. Say we have one liver which is a lethargic liver and another one which is a

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.020
active liver, supposing somebody has. Then we tell them

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:19.440
as to the change of diet for sometime, for both the things - different diets they have, just the opposite.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:26.000
And once they come to normal conditions then they have to give up their dieting - then they are all right.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:31.860
So the prevention is not much needed because you become such a different person

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.580
that you're not tempted to do something that is not good, normally and

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.620
I don't think sahaja yogies normally get sick except for some adamant one. The other one we had one here

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.760
in Adelaide. I think he was a boy, a very nasty type of a boy

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:58.060
and he was keeping three dogs and he put his tongue into their mouths, just like a very horrid, satanic type, you see.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:06.240
He would not listen to us, he was just trying to trouble us and then he got some troubles because he used to jump with them and do all kinds of things.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.540
And then he got some sort of a trouble - we can't help it because he never listened to us and he troubled us a lot.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:22.680
So precautions are, like say, some ladies say are very dominating

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:29.580
to their husbands, say, or a husband is very dominating to the wife - that also causes problems.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:37.860
But gradually they become very sensible and understand their role as husband and wife.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:45.180
So the problem disappears - can be very serious problems. If the husband is very dominating or say,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:52.860
he's a flirtish type of a man or he goes about with other women or he keeps the woman in a very umm.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:43:01.060
say, in a suspense all the time or in jealousies and things like that,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:08.680
then she can develop a cancer of the breast. For that we cannot cure the husband

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:16.960
because if the husband is not in sahaja yoga what to do. So we make the woman so strong - she, she doesn't feel anything about it, she doesn't bother herself.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:24.520
Like that. You become, you see, you, you do not have reactionary nature - you become yourself something

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:31.200
You're not, no more a reactionary. So there is not too much prevention needed because you're so strong,

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:37.860
you don't need much prevention but if it is needed, we tell them. For example, now,

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:46.800
somebody's smoking too much in the room, smoking room or something, there of course we feel that we should at least cover our

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.520
face with something to get the smoke in because they become sensitive also to all these things.

00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:00.360
But not too much of preventions because you become very different. Your temptations

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:06.320
are different and you just don't worry about all these things which ruin you.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:12.900
Now you jump, say, two belts are going, I always feel like that - one going towards destruction, one towards construction.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.560
You jump from this to the construction side so gradually you move towards construction.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:31.480
- Yes please, yes.
 - [INAUDIBLE] and secondly

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:38.720
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Two questions - how should we meditate

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.280
and second question, is the Grace of God needed for realization?

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.260
- Is the Grace of God
 - needed for realization
  - Of course!

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.940
Without God how can you work out? It's all His work.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.600
And, but you see, if you take the name of God, half people will run away.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:10.100
People don't like that name these days - it's very bad. The One who is our Creator, the One who loves us so much -

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:17.620
you don't know Him that's why. When you know Him, you'll know how far away we are away from Him.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:25.060
That's why I take the name of Divine or Divinity because caution. As he said we should take precautions

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:33.400
that's why I take precaution not to say. And how to meditate, that I'll tell you little later, all right - that's very good question.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.600
Is God and God, nothing else.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:58.140
- Yes please. Will you get up please?
 - [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:06.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:12.940
I'll explain. If you're too far to the left or to the right

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:17.700
how can you bring yourself to the center without any help?

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:24.340
We, that is the thing you have to learn a little bit, that's all. That's something you have to learn and that I'll tell you

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.960
how to do it, all right. Now what else?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.680
- [UNCLEAR]

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:45.520
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:52.980
I'm sorry sir [UNCLEAR]. Uh..Could you please repeat it again - that the young people and TM

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.240
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.360
- [UNCLEAR] I was talking about TM and [UNCLEAR] 
 - Ah.. money, sorry

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.760
- but I was wondering if the technique [UNCLEAR]

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.500
- Ah.. You talked about TM
 - Yes, yes
  - they are taking away the money

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.860
- Annh..
 - Is the technique bad or what is [UNCLEAR]

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:22.640
Technique is bad and money is bad and I'm warning you against it, again and again - be careful about it.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:31.200
You'll end up as recluses, you'll be end up with, with some epilepsy, you'll end up with some troubles - I'm warning you before all of you.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.680
And if they want they can prosecute Me for that - I can prove it.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:49.380
- Yes
 - [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.400
- What?
 - You have said that we are the Spirit
  - hmm.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:59.320
- Is this the re-incarnated Spirit?
 - No, no, no. You see, when I say you are the Spirit,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:06.620
the Spirit is the One that resides in your heart which is the reflection of God Almighty - all right?

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:14.400
Now, that is the One who witnesses us, sees us - He's not in our attention, is not in our attention.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:23.140
But when we become the Spirit, He comes in our attention

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:31.000
and then what happens, that our attention gets enlightened in the sense that sitting here you can

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.900
feel about anyone, what's wrong with this. Like the gentleman asked about TM

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.160
Now, he doesn't know whether it is good or bad

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:49.560
but if he gets realized immediately he will know how horrible it is because he'll start getting blisters on his fingers.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:10.660
[UNCLEAR]

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:16.880
[UNCLEAR]

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:23.760
Do the herbicides and pesticides and other such chemicals, do they destroy our body?

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.960
- Which, which?
 - The herbicides, the pesticides that are used in growing of food

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.560
Yes they, you see, but so, that is true, they do. Now say,

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:42.740
for example, I would say the way we use these uh.. medicines and

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.540
pesticides and all those things, they definitely are very strong - no doubt about it

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:56.060
but once you are a realized soul, you can fight them - not so difficult. I would say now, hybrid food itself, you see,

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:03.720
is a very, I don't think is a very good thing to have. Now how we get rid of these pesticides

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:09.020
and these things is very simple in India. We have experimented with us, with it

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:15.280
and what we have found out very nicely is this, that the

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:26.040
when you use your vibrations or you use the vibrated water then

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:33.460
if you use it on the non-hybrid seeds, which, which cannot germinate much, then what happens

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:40.440
that, that those things which are non-hybrid

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.780
produce better results than the hybrid.

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:51.680
Now, if you are a realized soul, all right, you use vibrated water or if you go round your

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.960
uh.. fields, you don't need pesticides - pests will go away.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:08.060
They just disappear because they understand vibrations. Animals understands vibrations much more than human-beings.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:14.140
Pests, everything that you use for, they just disappear - they don't want to be there.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:23.520
So don't use them and then there is no problem of this remains but many people have to get it.

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:30.820
But otherwise also when you are sort of a realized soul, then you're quite strong enough to bear lots of things.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:37.480
You don't get sick very easily unless and until you do something deliberately.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:47.740
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:56.140
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:04.020
- What she's saying?
 - That the food we eat in any case, what we buy that has been poisoned with all these

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.700
- things today.
 - Achcha
  - So does it damage us even if we're realized?

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:16.820
No, then it does not. If you're realized, then it does not. But so much attention is paid to food in these countries, everybody. I don't think it's

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.700
so much of a problem that people are talking about.

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:28.200
But once you're realized, you're not damaged by anything, anything - it's all these things are very ordinary.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:35.600
There are greater things to fight in this world. Yes, yes madam.

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:43.240
Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:52.520
- How do we become realized? Is it just..
 - Haan, that's the thing, that's the thing I'm going to do now. That's good question, that's the thing.

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:03.120
-Yes madam.
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - Karma?

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:09.120
- Does sahaja yoga affect karma?
 - It just sucks your karmas.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:16.160
Karmas are all sucked in. See, what are your karmas come into your pouch of your ego

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:23.420
and once the Kundalini rises, She sucks in. Now what is karmas left now because Christ is here, say.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:30.760
I say Christ is here - you take it as a hypothesis. You need not accept Me but is a fact which you can find out later on.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:35.700
Now the Christ is here. We say Christ died for our sins, don't we say?

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:44.920
He died for our sins. If you awaken Christ within your Agnya Chakra, He sucks in all your sins - that's what He does.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.180
But it's an absurd ideas we have about Christianity also that we must

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:58.160
suffer, our body must suffer. Why, He has suffered for us, are you going to suffer more than Him?

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:04.380
How much He has suffered!

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:11.460
So all the karmas and all that are sucked in -  there are no, you go into akarmas.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:18.500
You're no more there to be the karmas - you're the Spirit now.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:23.980
All right?

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:38.360
- Tumko sunai de raha hai? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. I can't hear a word. [UNCLEAR] A little loudly, sir.

   - Kya bol raha hai? In short batao.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:27.020
- [INAUDIBLE]
  - No, I think you are finally discommitted to
   - Kya bol raha hai?

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:35.280
- He's saying that You talked about evolution
  - Haan
   - and yet about the model

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:42.560
what it is just now - do you need to change your system to fit into that aspect of evolution? That's what I could make out.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:48.640
It's rather a confused question, sir. Will you, if you sit down, I'll explain to you.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:05.660
We have evolved up to human level or say human awareness, right? Our nerves have got a certain

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:11.400
dimension of awareness now but we have not reached

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:21.300
our destination. And the destination is that we have to become the Spirit.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:25.820
This is the last breakthrough that has to take place.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.440
And the whole system works it out.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:38.480
As I explained to you in an egg,

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:47.560
the whole egg system works it out and a bird comes out of it.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.980
In the same way this transformation takes place within us.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:02.920
But you don't feel any working - it's such a slick system; You don't feel anything about it. It's a very beautiful system.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:09.180
You just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:16.180
It's a beautiful system, beautifully made. Even there, Hume has made a mistake, I think,

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:22.300
that he didn't understand that Subconscious and Collective Subconscious all these lie on the left-hand side

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:28.120
and the Supraconscious and the Collective  Supraconscious lie on the right hand side and there's a path in between.

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:34.500
He just completely mixed up that point otherwise he was quite there.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.500
Yes, is there any question?

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:49.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:54.300

00:57:55.680 --> 00:58:02.720
- If a person had a choice 
 - Haan
  - of taking a path which they believe is beneficial to them

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:06.900
but they think that that could hurt people who love them

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:13.740
Oh, they should take it. You see you must know one thing, we cannot force it on you at all, never.

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:22.840
It has to be asked for. It's a, you see one thing, you cannot force this. God is not going to fall at your feet - no, no.

00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.060
It's your gain, if you want to have, have it otherwise nothing.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:34.720
Nobody is going to force you, nothing. You have to have complete freedom because if you have to rise to the

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:43.440
entire field of freedom, then you must have your freedom - that's why God gave freedom to human-beings.

[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:07.020

[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR] what happens to [UNCLEAR]

[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.040
- How do the gurus, false gurus
 - Hnnh
 - uh..manage  to control people

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.800
because if their own chakras are spoilt, how do they still have the power to do so?

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:48.920
You see they don't, you cannot control people through your chakras, you can never control - actually you never try to control anyone.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.960
You enjoy the freedom of another person so if their chakras are spoilt,

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:04.820
what they do is to,  first of all entice people with big, big advertisements

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.940
and wrong ideas, talking bombastically about things

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:19.520
and also they have another way of mesmerism - they mesmerize people. There're lots of things they do with the dead.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.340
Also they practice all kinds of hypnotism

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.600
uh.. which I have noticed, people are so much enticed, they cannot get over it.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.140
And they try all kinds of dirty tricks.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.940
Many things they do and, I think, they hit upon the weaknesses of people also.

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.160
Like a guru who is a real guru, will never meet you in privacy

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.960
but this false one meet you in the privacy and sort of they'll ask you questions in such a manner

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.720
that you might give away some of your secrets or something. They also blackmail you.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:05.520
There don't know how they work it out but definitely, they definitely mesmerize you.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:11.440
Also they spoil your chakras uh.. by turning them the other way round.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:19.760
Now this chakra, if somebody turns it the other way round, we can see some sort of a light or a spark coming out of it

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.700
and you can get completely uh...

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:32.620
uh.. enticed by that, completely - you can become a slave of that person, if this chakra is handled the other way round.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:42.820
So, they also know so many ways; This is called as 'Kali Vidya' in India - that they try all these tricks.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:54.980
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Is that sort of a thing happening in Australia?

01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:01.720
Yes, I think many people are enticed, have been enticed. Now they have got out of it but still

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:09.860
because, you see, this is money orientation - they want to make money out of you so they'll tell you some sort of a mantra, imagine?

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:16.620
Uh.. some people had a mantra called as 'Inga', some had as a 'Thinga'.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:23.340
Now 'Inga' means the tail of a, tail, in, in ordinary language, not in Sanskrit -

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:28.560
Inga means the tail of a scorpion - imagine, what a mantra!

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:36.120
Or 'Thinga' means when you show like this to somebody to put him down - Thinga.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:41.520
And they were told never to tell anybody, this is very secret, this is coming from Himalayas, somebody's

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.720
- all sorts of things, you know, and poor naive people from Australia don't know anything about it.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:54.320
If they tell to Indian, he will laugh and laugh and laugh and jump with laughing - they have be-fooled people like this.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:04.000
And they make a big ritual about it that you go with this thing, that thing, put so much money here, there and then you get this thing.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.580
Seven doors you have to cross to meet the guru, make a big ado out of him

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:15.880
and you're enamored. They'll keep Rolls Royces.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:24.520
I went to Boston and when I wanted to go to their television, they asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces you have?" I said, "I have none."

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:32.360
They said, "We are not interested, if you have no Rolls Royces, we are not interested." Just imagine!

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:39.920
It plays, you see, you get the gurus the kind you like, the way you want - isn't it? I should say like that.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:46.320
You should ask for real gurus, real masters, the ones who will make you meet God.

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:50.360
Nanak Sahab has said, "Guru wahi jo Sahib milihe."

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.000
The guru is the one who makes you meet the God Almighty - Sahib.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:06.320
Everybody has said this but the trouble is we do not want to take to somebody who is simple.

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.860
This modern types, you see, having horns

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:22.520
and all kinds of horrible things - that attracts people.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.700
What am I to do? I mean, I just don't know how this psychology has come.

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.320
Are you sad still?

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:45.880
- [UNCLEAR] not now.
 - Now, that's better. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:54.080
[UNCLEAR] inside them then there should be no evil.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:06:02.440
- There's no?
 - If everybody has [UNCLEAR] inside them there should be no evil.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.320
Yes, the evil has to run away.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:10.660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Then we shouldn't worry about them.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.580
[LAUGHTER] Some will remain evil, so it's all right.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:22.940
There isn't, you see, there isn't place in the Kingdom of God for everyone, I must say - evil will not go there.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.980
You see, it's all full now - the seats - you should say.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.560
Let them go to Hell, do what they like but they will be very few.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:41.700
I see there are so many seekers, such beautiful souls in this world, though misguided but there are good people, very many.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:48.520
So many good people could never have existed on this earth, I think -

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:55.200
but they're misguided, that's all. Yes please.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:03.220
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it, can you stand up?
  - [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.900
- What did he say?
 - What is your opinion about the Hare Krishna's?

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:13.860
Aha, you should find out now what they are up to. You see, this is not the way to go to God.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:19.180
Like mad saying something, 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.' In our country everybody says that.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:23.800
Even the sweeper, when he sweeps, he goes on saying, 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna.'

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:28.480
That's not the way you go to God - it's making fun of God.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:39.960
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - I'm sorry, the last part could you say it again, please.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:44.260
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Kya keh rahe hain?
  - Mujhe bhi nahin sunai de raha.
  - Ain?

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.600
- Can't hear it. I'm sorry.
  - Loudly, please.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.600
Can anyone become Self-realized [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:58.440
Can anyone become Self-realized and is there anything that can block it from happening?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.240
Yes it can, yes can be but you don't worry.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:12.060
It can block some people, it does. It's all right but ultimately they'll get it.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:18.100
If not today tomorrow, if not tomorrow day after - they'll get it. So far we have not met anyone

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.320
who hasn't got it, who has been persistent on it, who's felt it.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:29.220
In the beginning people used to take too much time to feel it but nowadays I find most of them feel it very fast.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.800
Yes please, one more question.

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.180
Two more, all right, now two more and no more.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it?

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:49.100
Mother, [UNCLEAR]

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.040
- [UNCLEAR]
 - What's he saying?

01:08:53.280 --> 01:09:00.280
You said that you can cure physical problems with sahaja yoga, [UNCLEAR] not just then a physical problem?

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:06.520
Yes, so what? No, no, you see, it, physical also gets cured.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.680
You see that's a part of one of the chakras. You see, chakras have got all these things one after another,

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:20.060
so after enlightenment also physical also get's cured. I didn't say only physical - did I? All right?

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.180
Now, you have asked questions. Should we have those last two, is it all right? All right.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.940
You'll be very much satisfied after some time, I tell you. Now, let's have

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.260
Who are the two ladies who..? Haan.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:46.760
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.280
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Kya keh rahe hain?
  - [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:02.240
- What she's saying?
 - Why are there so many different rites and ceremonies and not just a simple approach

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:10.620
- to God and realization. Is it right?
 - Yes, it is, it is madam. It is very simple. You're just facing Me, you'll get your realization.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:18.440
But if you want to know the mechanism, then you have to know it that way. You see, mechanism is complicated.

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:27.140
If you don't want to know the mechanism, there is no need. But you want to know the mechanism always, then you have to know all those things - isn't it?

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.760
Any mechanism is complicated. It's not that complicated also, even children know.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.080
If you don't want to use the mechanism, then it's all right.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.340
But if you want to be the engineer, then you want to know.

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:51.280
But first you get your realization as I told you just now. There's a history behind it, I already told you that there is

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:57.140
a thing behind it. A mechanism is there. It's not as simple as that, this can be more complicated than that,

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:04.420
can be deeper than that but depends on how far you want to go. If you just want to have your Self-realization, it's all right,

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:11.800
but if you want to give realization to others, you have to know all those things - isn't it? Otherwise how will you work it out.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.600
All right, what else?

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:23.000
[INAUDIBLE]

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.740
- Is there something else?
 - Fate.
 - Faith?

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.740
- Fate, yes.
 - Fate. Is there something as fate and can we overcome it with realization?

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.520
- Faith?
 - Fate.
 - Of course, of course.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:41.100
- Fate.
 - Of course.

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:50.300
All these things are below the Spirit.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.320
You rise, transcend everything. You transcend everything -

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.400
that's the mastery I'm talking about.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:12.940
- Now
 - [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:16.740
- I think that was asked earlier
 - What she's saying?
- about karma.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.980
I've told you already. You people have read a lot, I think.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:30.580
We have karmas - that's a , that's the thing written before Christ. After Christ whose karmas are left - He's taken away all our karmas.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.940
Already He's said it, He has died for us - isn't it?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:42.800
This was said before, I mean, karma theory was when Krishna was there thousands of years back.

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:49.200
Now Christ has come. See every tree has different different flowers at different times.

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:56.180
So according to timing now, Christ has come, He's talked about, He's taken away the karmas.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:13:03.940
Now at this time you have to get your Kundalini awakening - Krishna didn't talk about it, that doesn't mean Kundalini was not there.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:18.240
- Well now, let's have the last.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:25.960
[INAUDIBLE]

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:33.940
- Yes.
 - How much truth is there in the Bible today as when it was first written

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.700
Oh My! It's quite a lot.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:47.500
You see, despite all the things they tried to hide and despite there was all kinds of

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.680
disturbances in the Bible, I must say, there's quite a lot.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:59.940
It's quite a lot but we have to be realized to understand Christ, to understand what He said.

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:08.840
First of all realization must take place otherwise you can't understand - quite a lot - Bible.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:16.100
Because they didn't know where the truth was hiding so they couldn't remove it, luckily.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.520
Yes madam.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:35.000
[UNCLEAR] Bible [UNCLEAR]

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.480
[UNCLEAR]

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.260
[UNCLEAR]

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:50.840
Umm, it is said that there was a secret baptismal right

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.640
given by Christ which is been edited out of the Bible

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.260
- do You equate this with Self-realization and the awakening of Kundalini?
 - Of course.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:07.400
Of course. Christ must have talked about Kundalini. Today only I was saying, He must have

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:15.080
but you see, He was given only three and a half years to talk to people. What can you do in three and a half years - you know it's nothing.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:21.900
Such a short time? You have no idea that in England I was for four years struggling with seven sahaja yogies.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.720
It's not easy in those days

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:38.140
And then His disciples also get very much upset because He was crucified so everybody started asking,

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:43.600
"How was it, if He was God's Son, how was He crucified?" That was His job, He had to do that.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:52.380
He had to pass through this, through His crucifixion. All is explained in sahaja yoga -

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:57.800
Christ's life, Mohammad's life, Rama's life, Krishna's life - everything is

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:02.600
absolutely explained and you can see for yourself that They are all one.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.080
Christ Himself has said, "Those who are not against are with Me." Who are those?

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:17.020
But we are not allowed to see anything else, just like uh.. horses we have

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:24.980
blinkers - we can't see anything else. If you want to know about Christ, better read Devi Mahaatma - is all described much better.

01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.000
That's why Christianity can be very fanatical, I can tell you,

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.300
because you see, the blinkers are here - you can't see anything.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.620
You can't read Gita, you can't read anything, you see, going anywhere else

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:49.300
means you are a non-Christian - such a organized thing.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:53.520
But open your eyes and see for yourself.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:04.920
Such a great personality like Christ - you see, Onkara Himself incarnated as Christ.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:14.100
They have made such a mess out of it, I tell you. Who can believe in Christ when they say what Christianity is?

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:22.600
Such a mess! Same about, I would say, Hinduism, same about Islam, every religion is the same style.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.160
It's same style, there's nothing to choose.

01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:34.640
All have gone wrong.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:46.640
In the name of God wars, in the name of God money,

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:54.180
in the name of God enjoying women, lust and greed

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:59.420
while Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.660
because He rules the eyes.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:14.680
You'll understand what Christ is once you're realized.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:26.680
Yes, now still [UNCLEAR]

01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:34.580
[UNCLEAR]

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:41.040
Is there such a  thing as people not being ready for Self-realization, in this lifetime?

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:49.280
I don't think, I don't say that. I think all of them are there for realization.

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:56.800
Everybody can get realization but if you're identified with nonsense

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.440
If you put your foot in the crocodile's mouth

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:07.620
and one foot on the boat, what are we to do?

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:18.380
There's a blossom time, is a special Resurrection time - this is the time of judgment, has to happen.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:27.440
Everybody must get their chance. God is justice, He's fair.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:42.220
Now, still going on, all right. Ask one question, now let it be the last - all right?

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:49.940
[UNCLEAR - BECAUSE?]There are so many who are anxious to get realization, madam. Now come along. What's your question, special one?

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.980
[INAUDIBLE]

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:59.160
- [UNCLEAR] kya?
 - I'm sorry, if you could just

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:06.960
- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR] immortality.
 - Will You tell us about immortality?

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:13.740
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Through Self-realization will we know the immortal?

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.400
- What we know?
 - The immortal.
 - Of course.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Of course
  - Will we know

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:27.400
The Immortal, that's the Spirit. That's what I'm saying - that's the Spirit.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.460
All right, so let's have it now. All the questions are over.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:49.780
Now, first of all we have to understand little cooperation is needed

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:56.440
raising the Kundalini. If you could just take out the shoes -

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.660
this Mother Earth helps Me a lot and will help you a lot - just take out your shoes - simple thing.

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:09.060
Taking out shoe is not difficult - is it? All right.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:16.680
And if you can put your feet on the Mother Earth. Now those who don't want to do, should go out; Should not disturb us.

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:23.220
I'll be thankful - those who don't want to do it should go away. It is absolutely your freedom

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:30.340
and it hardly takes about five to ten minutes - much less than your questioning.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.620
All right.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:45.700
Now both the feet on the ground separately because these are two powers, as I told you, the left and the right.

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:56.040
This should not be mixed up. Now left hand is towards Me because this is the desire you have

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:05.280
that you want to have your realization. You can keep it comfortably on your lap, if you want to - be comfortable.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:10.320
You need not put your neck very tight or very low - just in the center.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:16.800
With the right hand I will tell you how you will raise your own Kundalini - very simple.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.380
First of all, I'll tell you and then you'll have to close your eyes and do it. First of all you'll have to put it on your heart

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:31.860
just like this. Now in the heart resides - all of you should do it on the heart. On the heart resides

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.860
the Spirit - all right? Please do it , sir, please.You don't want to do it?

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.940
What's the matter? [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] He's got it already, I think. [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:49.540
He's in thoughtless awareness. Now put it, your right hand, on the heart.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:55.060
And here heart, in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:04.900
Below that is the center here, is of principle of mastery

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.780
or guidance or guru or ten commandments - on the left-hand side.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:25.180
Now below that is another center, down here, below on the left-hand side. Everything works on the left-hand side

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:37.440
below in the lower part of the abdomen. On the left-hand side is the center through which all the Divine laws work.

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:47.040
So, then again we go up on the upper part of the stomach on the left-hand side.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:54.960
Then we go to the heart again. Now here we go

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:06.700
in the corner between the neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right -

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:14.180
is very simple, like that. But don't take your hand from the back - just from here, from the front. Hold it tight.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:23.260
This is the main center that catches because you feel guilty for nothing at all. That's a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:31.160
Now don't feel guilty. You have come at the door

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.560
of God's Kingdom so be pleasantly placed towards yourself and forgive yourself.

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.360
Don't feel guilty at all, be happy. Now,

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:51.200
put your hand on top of your head in such a manner, I [UNCLEAR- MEAN?} on, on your forehead

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:59.720
and press it on both the sides in such a manner as you press it when you have headaches. Press it slowly.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:06.140
Then take this hand on the back side of your head and put the

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:13.540
load of your head on that hand, like this,

01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:21.040
slowly. Now bring this hand and stretch it nicely.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:30.280
The center of this palm you put it on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:38.200
Now, move it seven times - the scalp - keeping the fingers out.

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.920
Move it seven times putting the left hand towards Me -

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.120
slowly, seven times. Now.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.160
Now first of all, you're not to feel guilty.

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:07.560
You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself in a very happy mood.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.740
You shouldn't say, "I've done this wrong, that wrong," nothing of the kind.

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:20.520
Now, close your eyes. Even you can take out your spectacles if you want

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:25.560
because sometimes the eyesight gets better. So, close your eyes

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.680
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:39.060
In the heart resides the Spirit so ask Me a fundamental question -

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.440
you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever way you like.

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.500
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question in your heart three times,

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:55.100
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:26:56.140 --> 01:27:03.580
Please put both your hands, feet together. You don't want to do it, madam?

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:25.600
Ask this question. Now, bring that hand on the left-hand side

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.180
of the upper part of the abdomen of the stomach, press it and here

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:37.280
you have to ask another question because if you are the Spirit, you are your master also.

01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:41.840
Ask Me a question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.860
Three times please.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:07.880
Now, take down this hand, down below.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.120
Again on the left-hand side in the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.660
Now this is the center of pure knowledge or the laws

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:30.400
that are Divine. So you press it hard and please

01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:36.800
say six times because there are six petals to this center.

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:43.300
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?"

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:48.760
I cannot force so you have to ask for it. So ask for it,

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:56.580
"Mother, please may I have the pure knowledge of the truth?"

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.520
Six times, ask from your heart.

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:20.120
Now, take this hand upwards,

01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:26.280
press it on the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:32.260
and here ask for ten, ten times, ten times

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:42.000
or here you can say, here you have to help the Kundalini. You have to help the Kundalini,

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:49.340
to co-ordinate with Her because She has started moving now. As soon as you asked

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:57.160
for pure knowledge, She started moving. So here you put your hand and press it hard and ask

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.940
or you can say it just to support the Kundalini,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:09.340
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:17.100
"Mother, I am my own master," say it ten times please.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:30.760
Now, ten times.

01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:42.300
With full confidence, without any guilt, without anything, "I am my own master," you have to support the Kundalini.

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:48.840
Now.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:13.640
Now raise your hand to your heart. Here again to support your Kundalini to rise,

01:31:13.980 --> 01:31:19.080
to co-operate with  Her, with full confidence you have to see the greatest truth

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:23.320
lies within you that, "Mother,

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.200
I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the spirit."

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:36.080
Please say it twelve times. "I am the Spirit," please say it ten times, with full confidence.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:12.800
You have to know that God almighty is the ocean

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:18.820
of love and Grace but above all

01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:26.480
He is the ocean of forgiveness, He is the ocean of forgiveness

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:33.900
and He forgives whatever we do. After all human-beings have to commit mistakes - there's nothing wrong in it.

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:43.500
No need to be angry with yourself at all. Please raise your right hand

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:53.600
on your shoulder in the corner between the neck and the shoulder.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:03.980
And here press it hard and you say with full confidence sixteen times,

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:11.020
"Mother, I'm not guilty." Please say it sixteen times, turn your head to the right.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:16.920
Please turn your head to the right and say,"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:35.040
Please say, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all," sixteen times.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.900
Now,

01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:00.600
please put your right hand

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:09.800
on your forehead across, press it on both the sides.

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:19.220
Here, from your heart you have to say, how many times is not the point,

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:26.960
from your heart you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone

01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:33.340
Now many people think that's very difficult to forgive

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:38.380
but actually, we do not do anything whether you forgive or we do not forgive.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.420
But if we do not forgive, then we play into wrong hands

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:46.800
so say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:02.660
Now, take this hand on the back side, put your head

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:11.900
on it and turn it upward - let it rest on the hand.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:18.420
Here for your own satisfaction, you may say, "Oh Divine,

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:25.560
please forgive me if any mistakes I have made." This is only for your own satisfaction I'm saying.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.640
Now don't count your mistakes, please don't count your mistakes.

01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:36.660
You have to be very loving and sweet towards yourself.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:54.720
Now, stretch your hand, please, fully.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:02.240
Put your center of your palm, please, on

01:36:02.500 --> 01:36:08.980
the fontanel bone area and press it very hard and move it, very slowly, seven times.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:16.380
Here again you have to ask for your realization, so say, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:23.340
Say seven times - I can't force it on you, I'm sorry - seven times.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.560
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:34.800

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:38.860

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:02.340
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:10.120
Now, take down your hand, please. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:17.220
Now, put your left hand on top of your head and right hand towards Me.

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.960
Left hand on top of your head, left hand. Right hand towards Me.

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.300
Now see, if there's a cool breeze coming. Now move up and down and see for yourself.

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.300
All right?

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:43.140
Feeling it? Little, some people get it that point, some get it very high.

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:52.300
Little bit higher. Don't doubt yourself, please don't doubt yourself.

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:59.440
Now, put the left hand towards Me and see with the right hand.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.520
Some might be getting hot, doesn't matter. Hot will become cool very soon.

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:13.540
You can bend your head and see for yourself, it'll be better and easier.

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.340
Now, put the right hand again towards Me and with the left hand

01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:53.760
All right? Now, put both the hands towards the sky

01:38:55.480 --> 01:39:02.340
and ask a question three times, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost that is the Kundalini?"

01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:10.140
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:18.780
"Is this the love of God that is All-Pervading Power?" You ask any one of these, three times.

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.080
All right, now we can keep it down.

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.260
Now, let us see how many of you have got it on top of your head

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:44.560
and also in other, also in your hands. Please put both your hands.

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.180
I want to see how many have got it on top of your head or in your hands.

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:59.620
Both the hands, please. Don't be doubtful. If it is there, put your hands up. Not today, tomorrow they'll - it's quite a lot.

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:07.280
Quite a lot of people. You got it now - good. So, no questions tomorrow. Ha

01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:14.840
Good. May God bless you! Quite a lot of people have got it, some people haven't got it I must say.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:23.700
Ah! Sydney was better in a way. But I think we spent too much time in questioning that's how people [UNCLEAR] loose their

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:31.080
uh.. attention a little bit - doesn't matter. If it has not worked out it will work out tomorrow in any case.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:38.860
And I'll be here again to meet you and to greet you and I'll explain to you all the rest of things.

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:45.600
Those who haven't got it, if you're anxious or to get it, I think, you could,

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:53.460
they can come down here and can work it on certain people - a big row of people didn't get here in the center.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:41:00.960
If you can see, some of you people, uh.. those, these two persons should get it - I don't know why they didn't - you didn't feel it?

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:06.860
Sure? I think you did feel, madam. You felt it? You felt it?

01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:14.860
Good. You can feel each other, you can feel each other's head, yes. What about you - no? What about you - you got it? Got it.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:22.340
Most of them have but in the third row or fourth row there are people. Who have not felt it, please?

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:28.280
Ah, do you mind uh.. seeing them or what should we do?

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:35.020
You also will be having a workshop later on.

01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:43.340
Just see, your neighbors, you see from your neighbors, should see. This gentleman - can you see on his head, he hasn't got it?

01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:48.360
You put your hands. You said you didn't get it. Just see this gentleman why he hasn't got it?

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:53.560
Hello, some sahaja yogi should see some of these people.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:42:01.580
Third person, that fourth person. No, she never tried. She was just sitting there tight.

01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:10.180
Maybe in the hands but

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:19.060
He's got it - you've got it?

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:25.800
Now he's felt it, now he's felt it. You see, it's one of the sahaja yogies puts the hand also, they'll feel it.

01:42:26.100 --> 01:42:29.320
Those who haven't put in the first row, raise your hands, please?

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:35.160
Ah, just see this gentleman, just one minute they can work it out, ah..

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:41.500
Also you can watch Me without thinking, you see. Just see, just watch Me without thinking.

01:42:48.380 --> 01:42:53.520
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Really?

01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:00.860
Raise it, raise it. Today I've worked very hard, I think, she, they should.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:15.240
Now you felt it, all right. Now, can we have some more sahaja yogies to work out here? Just see.

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:25.540
You didn't feel that, none of you - did you feel?

01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:34.640
What of the boy who was feeling sad? Just see, did he feel, did he feel the cool breeze?

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:43.040
The second number there with the yellow, this thing. He's felt it. Now, you've got it.

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:49.400
Now you have to give joy to everyone - all right? He's got it, good.

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:56.480
This lady is here, just see. Take one or two persons who haven't felt it and who are desire. No?

01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:35.700
Hmm, better. He's got it, has he?

01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:43.760
- Got it.Is he feeling it?
 - [UNCLEAR]
 - His falls down?

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.220
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Ask him for his guru or someone must be there. He had some guru?

01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:59.920
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Now he's feeling it.

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:08.760
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] With the slightest here and there it just loops down in a funny way.

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:16.980
Where are the sahaj yogies gone? Come along. Just see this lady is here, she wants to have her realization. Didn't feel it?

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.700
- You did not feel?

 - All right

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:23.980
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Yes.

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:32.260
Now you must inform your friends and bring them along tomorrow.

01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:43.240
Hmm, better.

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:56.120
I think in the second row, [UNCLEAR] in the third row. What about the gentleman who asked about precautions. Did you feel the cool breeze?

01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:00.920
The gentleman in the fourth row.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:09.020
Aey Rustom, fourth row mein dekho na, woh jo precautions ki baat kari.

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:16.280
Na idhar, idhar aao.

01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:32.920
Haan, all right. Fourth

01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:40.580
Ek, do, teen, char - fourth one in that row, yes first row -

Haan, he's the gentleman. Did he feel the cool breeze?

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.320
That's it. Give him realization, I knew, give him realization.

01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:29.700
Haan, heart - right heart, right heart.

01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.460
Give him a bandhan on right heart.

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:40.660
Haan, now, see there.

01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:10.920
Are you feeling relaxed? Can't think, just try to think.

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.460
Tumhare bas.. ho jayega, I'll manage.

01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:51.680

 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - Very much, right heart.

01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.300
Right side, yes. Do right to the left.

Yes. Can you help Me with the shoes.. little bit. I don't know why it's can't reach that - thank you.

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:12.640
See this one also if you can - thank you. Done a good job, I think.

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:17.900
- It's worked out well.
 - It's difficult to get in the seats  because they're
 - Unnh?
  - so close.

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.820
- It's difficult to get in between the seats, the way
- Yes
 - they're designed they're too close.

01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:31.120
Let it be. This lady didn't do anything -

01:49:31.660 --> 01:49:36.300
just sitting tight. Should have got your realization -  what a chance!

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.720
She's come all the way. You - I'm saying about this second one - yes.

01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:51.940
Didn't do anything, should have - just five minutes. Heaven on Earth.

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:03.540
What about you? Come along, come along. Come along.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:12.460
You want to say something - come here. No you. Saying something to Me?

01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:16.460
No, it's all right.

01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:27.540
I'd like to meet them if they want. Come along! Haan.

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:35.220

01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:44.100
- Would you like them to come to the front?
 -  I could go and just wish them and [UNCLEAR]

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.320
You guys [UNCLEAR] to meet Shri Mataji, come to the front.

Work very hard? Ah, that's why. They'll tell you all about it. It's all right.

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:53.560
Better? It's too much working hard, that's all.

01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:11.460
All of you have to now learn all about. Now you have to become masters, Australian born [UNCLEAR]

Talk to yourself, tomorrow do come, bring all your friends, inform them, telephone them. Let them come and have it because I'm here

Hindustani to sab aage se hoke chale jaate ho

And get some more people now. This is the thing. You invite for dinners and this and that. Better invite them for this.

01:56:54.040 --> 01:57:00.340
All right? That's the greatest thing to be given. How are you, all right?

01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:04.640
[UNCLEAR] keep your eyes. They look like black like Mine.

01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:28.200
- Yes
 - As it is isn't it better now?
 - Yes
 - Don't see any disease there, nothing is shaking.

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:36.180
- Oh! I, will the workshop be on Thursday, will it?
 - Thursday. But now Parkinson disease you must, you're not shaking at all.

01:57:55.740 --> 01:58:02.480
Does not want to accept that. You're accepting but she was frightened.

No, no, no, forget all that. [UNCLEAR] sahaja yoga, why should you [INAUDIBLE].

02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:58.500
You just say that, "Mother, I am my own master - ten times." Forget all these things. Just see

02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:03.380
how much you're perspiring. If that book was good you would not perspire before Me.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:09.440
Haan say, "Mother, I am my own master."

02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:15.940

02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:49.460
Why do they want to come? If they're realized souls, be satisfied. If they're realized souls, what work are they doing?

02:06:50.240 --> 02:06:55.500
[UNCLEAR] must have your own money

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:18.900
Forgive, forgive everyone.

No, nothing worked out. [UNCLEAR] Just see. You're doubting Me?

02:08:45.940 --> 02:08:50.960
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Annh?
 - Yes, haan bol raha hai.

02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:05.760
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Despite doubting it has worked, you see. You must have been a seeker in your last life.

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:16.080
- Are you a seeker this life also?
 - Yes [UNCLEAR]

Annh? Just know it.

02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:41.240
Not from the head. Vishudhdhi is

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:53.980
Not yet. It is on the head. You can't feel it because, you see, your Vishudhdhi, this is purely blocked

02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:58.780
with lot of [INAUDIBLE]. Once it is

02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:30.440
No, no, no. No need to [INAUDIBLE] No, no, no, go and eat everything

02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:37.740
[UNCLEAR] No, no, no. No use. No need to do all that.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.500
- Hello Dadi!
 - Hello!

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:50.040
Vishudhdhi is very bad. Somebody has to settle his Vishudhdhi. You come along tomorrow, all right? You'll get it.

02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:57.500
should set. You're Australia, Australian out and out.

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:05.460
- My parents are Dutch.
- Your parents are Dutch? All right. Come along. Makes no difference.

02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:24.380
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Haan, it's better.
 - Feels nothing [INAUDIBLE]

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:29.780
- What is happened to her hands?
 - [INAUDIBLE]
 - In the hands what's happened?

02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:38.340
Dying? Left.

02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:49.160
- The disease of the nerves.
 - I know, I know.
 - The nervous system

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:52.600
- Where's he [UNCLEAR], where's he

02:11:52.840 --> 02:12:00.140
No, no, no, there's nothing like that,
 you see, [INAUDIBLE] Raise his Kundalini, he's quite all right.

02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:07.740
- You take off your shoes.[UNCLEAR]

02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:20.840
[HAAN]

02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:34.160
Ask him to ask the question of the Holy Ghost.

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:43.280
- Ask the question, "Is She the Holy Ghost?"
 - Again [UNCLEAR - TIGHTER?]
 - Are you the Holy Ghost?Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost?

02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:51.540
- Again, "Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"
 - Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost?

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:59.680
All right, the cool breeze coming? Feeling the cool breeze? Tie it up on the head, tie it up.

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:04.320
They're not shaking anymore.

02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:14.760
- Annh? All right?
 - So, he feels the cool.
 - All right. You say, "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - You are the Holy Ghost.

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:20.780
- "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - Again.
 -  "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."

02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:26.400
- Again.
 - Mother, You are the Holy Ghost.
 - Again.
 - Mother, You are the Holy Ghost.

02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:34.160
So, you got it - your realization, sir. You're all right, nothing wrong with you. So, your hands are all right.

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:43.000
- All right. Now.
 - Should practice sahaja now. You find that it will
 - You must practice sahaja but he's all right, he's all right

02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:51.060
- [UNCLEAR] spinal. Kundalini [UNCLEAR] that's all. Doctors give big, big names. Hands are [UNCLEAR]

02:13:51.300 --> 02:13:58.880
- Mother

02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:18.340
- Take out this, all right? Come.

02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:30.880
- What's your relationship with him, is it good?
 - [UNCLEAR - DIFFERENT LANGUAGE?]

02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:37.880
- What's it? Is it the best relationship?
 - Probably not.
 - No.
 - No, not calling it best.

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:44.320
- [UNCLEAR]
 - How's your father?
 - [UNCLEAR] had a problem.
 - [UNCLEAR]

02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:49.820
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Annh? When he gets angry with you? 
 - Oh, he gets, he smacks me
- Annh?

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:56.960
- Correction, correction yes. No, not [UNCLEAR]
- Beg your pardon.
- Just no more.

02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:05.560
- [UNCLEAR - CORRECTION?]
 - Come this side, come this side. I'd come on this one.

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:12.500
- Come this side. Sit on this
 - I'm not patient.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:23.540
- Put your hands up and [UNCLEAR]
 - You must forgive. You're angry with your father sometimes?

02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:27.540
- Yes.
 - Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR - AM I BEATING?]

02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.880
- Just tell Me,
 - Very difficult.
 - I can beat him, all right? [LAUGHTER]

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:39.160
- He's very strong.
 - Tell Me what's the matter, what does he do? Hmm.

02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.600
- He gets angry with you very much?
 - Sometimes.
 - Annh?

02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:51.620
- [UNCLEAR] My patience is short. 
 - Yes
 - My patience is short [UNCLEAR] more trouble

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:59.060
He says his patience, short of patience that's why this problem. He says he very short on patience.

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:03.260
- Did you get your realization? Did you feel the cool breeze?
 - On my hand - yes.

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:09.020
- Haan, yes. On your head?
 - No, I've never have been  [UNCLEAR]

02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:13.740
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Just see on his head.
 - [UNCLEAR] A couple of years
 - Annh?

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:18.460
- No, just couple of months. Maybe [UNCLEAR]

02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:24.660
You must forgive your father, annh. Father's have right to get angry with [UNCLEAR - THEIR CHILDREN?], all right?

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:27.960
Haan. Now, you forgive your father.

02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:37.500
- Now, breathe, breathe in..
 - Vishudhdhi [UNCLEAR] each other too

02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.920
- Leave it.
 -  Slow down, just slow down for some, then you
 - Again breathe in

02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:48.040
-  have a chance to get together.
 - Yes.
 - [UNCLEAR] If you're busy all the time
 - [UNCLEAR] on each other's ego

02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:53.660
- Again breathe in
 - [UNCLEAR] center heart and that's because [UNCLEAR] clean

02:16:53.880 --> 02:17:01.240
- Did you hear - breathing? Did you not?
 - Yes

02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:08.240
Really? He's all right. And what you do - you take some ice

02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:17.120
in the daytime and put it on his liver, here. All right? He's all right. He's all right now, feel the cool breeze?

02:17:18.420 --> 02:17:23.620
On your heads - yes?

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:32.220
- All right. You're feeling
 - Hot
 - Annh, hot - liver.  You see, it's liver. This liver gives the heat and that's why they get this.

02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:40.220
But you see the liver also gets heated up because of anger and the anger that's suppressed. So what happens, with the father, anger is suppressed

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:48.740
and then the liver becomes heated up so put some ice there. Let him also put some ice - you'll have more patience - on the liver, there - here.

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:54.220
Put your hand there, just put that hand there. Now put it.

02:17:55.480 --> 02:18:02.940
You're better now - breathing is good? Your breathing is good now? Breathe, let's see.

02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:10.880
- All right?
 - Yes.
 - Breathing all right, normal? Still asthma, asthma you feel?

02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:19.080
- Rustom ko bulao. Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR] He's okay [UNCLEAR]
  - Then put ice here, that's all - on his liver.

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:26.800
- Now you're all right? How do you feel, are you feeling all right?
 - Yes.
 - Annh?
 - Yes

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:31.120
- Breathing is all right?
 - Yes
 - Good.

02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:38.620
- Better now, are you? Better forgive. What about his mother?

02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:54.280
Forgive, forgive everyone, forgive, forgive. See in here,

02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:01.420
the Western countries we try to regularize children too much in childhood, too much. Don't do this, don't spoil the carpet, don't spoil that

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:08.560
- carpet is more important than the child. Then they become what - hippies. They become hippies then.

02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:16.680
- They revolt
 - They revolt against the [UNCLEAR]
 - Yes
 - because we don't do that to our children in India.

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:22.100
- No, we allow them to play, after all they're children.
 - That's right
 - He's very calm

02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:29.060
- You're better?
- Hmm
 - Better? Breathing is better now? How is your breathing? Breathing is all right now

02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:36.320
- Breathing is all right, are you breathing all right - annh?
 - Yes

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:43.360
- Can you hear Me?
- Yes.
 - Can you hear clearly? Whatever I am saying do you hear Me?
 - Yes.

02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:48.360
- Do you hear Me clearly?
 - Somewhat.
- Somewhat.

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.700
- His hearing also is little affected.

02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:15.260
- Better now? Are you hearing Me better?
 - Yes.
 - All right

02:20:20.140 --> 02:20:25.900
[SHRI MATAJI CLEARING THE LITTLE BOY]

02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:32.460
- Now, can you hear better?
 - Yes
 - Annh, really?

02:20:32.740 --> 02:20:36.980
- You see, something. He couldn't hear properly
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Now just..

02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:41.920
- Better now. How do you feel now?
 - Good
 - Calm

02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:48.580
- Yes.
 - It's calm?
 - [PEOPLE TALKING TOGETHER]

02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:54.980
He's all right now. All right? You may smile now. What happened, who boxed you here?

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:59.720
Somebody else, some boy? Who made the black eye?

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.820
- [UNCLEAR]
 -Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR]
 - Some friend? All right, doesn't matter.

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:13.400
- Is he a realized soul?
 - Yes
 - He's born realized. He's a born realized you must respect him.

02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:16.860
He's a very sensible [UNCLEAR]

02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:22.100
You shouldn't loose temper with him. You see, they don't like it because they are to be respected - they're realized souls.

02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:28.960
[UNCLEAR] [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:34.360
- You're all right.
 - Yes.
 - Fine? You must laugh.

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:41.340
- Thank You, Mother.
- May God bless you!

02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:49.220
He's all right. Give him something, some ice here sometimes in the day time, in the day time about in the.

02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:55.960
Not too much heat in the house also. All this catch is there. All this liver and all. Now he's all right.

02:21:56.160 --> 02:22:01.120
- Are you all right?
 - Yes.
 - Now if he does anything to you, tell Me - all right?

02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:09.720
- You tell Me on the photograph, all right?
 - Yes
 - God bless you! He's all right.

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:16.240
No, you're very strict. I think, people are very strict with their children in the West.

02:22:16.540 --> 02:22:21.680
Should not be strict with your children - worried about the carpet, worried about these nonsensical things,

02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:28.960
these plastics and this and that not about the children and then we talk to them so

02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:34.860
uh.. so much, you see, disciplining them so much that ultimately they become hippies.

02:22:35.600 --> 02:22:42.700
- All right, one question, when You are [UNCLEAR] is Your hand burning?

02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:48.340
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
- Actually, She never burns.
 - [UNCLEAR]

02:22:48.580 --> 02:22:52.720
- I wonder whether You would be feeling a lot of heat.
- No, no, no, no

02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:59.740
They were all quite hot, I must say, it was a little bit burning. Yes you all feel guilty for nothing at all

02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:05.100
all the time. This is a fashion, "I'm guilty." For what? Are you going to jail or what.

02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:11.180
Then why to say, "I'm guilty." Everybody says, "I'm guilty." That's why it burns, you know.

02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:17.660
Then I'm was trying to take out this idea from your heads. You're not guilty at all. Your brother is all right.

02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:21.500
Just imagine, what a disease! You're feeling all right?

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:25.160
- Yes.
 - Comfortable, good. Look at him!

02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:32.940
He had  a nerve disease and legs and feet were all disappearing. All right, again let us see him tomorrow, hmm.

02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:40.060
- We go now?
 - Yes, Mother.

02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:58.420
- [UNCLEAR]
 - [INAUDIBLE] I'll try it.
 - Thank You.

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:07.340
[INAUDIBLE]

02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:17.940
- Where is she?
 - She's on her way. She's in Melbourne. [UNCLEAR]

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:21.460
- You [UNCLEAR - THINK?] for tomorrow at 3:00
 - Thank You.

02:24:23.720 --> 02:24:27.080
I'll teach you how to cure.
