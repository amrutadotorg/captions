00:00:02.632 --> 00:00:09.928
I am happy that you all have adjusted
yourselves in this small space.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.631
When there is love and understanding,

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:19.114
little space can occupy many hearts.

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:26.280
But when there is no large heart

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:33.230
then whatever one may get is just never
sufficient.

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:42.218
Today, we are going to worship Shiva
Tattwa within us, principle of Shiva.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.210
For all Sahaja Yogis it’s very important,

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.970
because Shiva is the ultimate we have
to achieve.

00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:57.789
Shiva is represented in our Spirit,

00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:07.058
so to become Shiva is the ultimate aim
of everything else.

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:15.181
The rest of it is all created, like Vishnu
Tattwa

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:23.245
and Brahmadeva, just to create human
beings,

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:32.711
to evolve them and then ultimately lead
them to Shiva.

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:36.091
That’s the ultimate.

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:47.865
But human beings get so involved into
the Brahmadeva’s Tattwas

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.966
that even to get into Vishnu Tattwa is
difficult.

00:01:54.104 --> 00:01:59.544
They get involved into the five elements
which have created us.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:03.309
That is the outermost being within us.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.217
All the chakras have the outermost, we
can say the, just the vessel,

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:20.123
but the desire to be the Spirit

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:27.548
is of primal importance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:35.219
So we have to see inward towards ourselves
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:40.460
“Do we have that desire entirely,

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:46.422
or we have still many desires hanging
around?”

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:54.221
You see, the greatest problem is
of the Nabhi chakra,

00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:58.377
whether it is in the East or the West.

00:02:58.578 --> 00:03:07.434
Some people still have hankering for
the baser search of food,

00:03:07.635 --> 00:03:16.468
which is very surprising, even in Sahaja
Yoga, of Nabhi chakra.

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:23.744
Then, still some people have sense
of possessions and money quite a lot.

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:25.580
And subtler and subtler they grow,

00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:30.936
still the detachment doesn’t develop
within them.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:38.234
It becomes subtler.

00:03:39.405 --> 00:03:45.630
As you grow subtler, the attachment becomes
subtler and difficult to get out.

00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:49.375
Specially people who come up as leaders
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:55.715
or closer to Sahaja Yoga, are always
under attack.

00:03:55.916 --> 00:04:03.524
They are attacked maybe by their husbands,
wives, brothers, sisters,

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.949
sons, children, something like that.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.880
And that makes it worse

00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:20.916
because all such leaders who are attacked

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:28.624
try to displease all the deities by small
things here and there.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.946
The whole behaviour has to be understood

00:04:35.147 --> 00:04:41.239
that you have become a subtler person
and you are rising higher,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.442
so naturally the negative forces are going
to attack you.

00:04:46.643 --> 00:04:52.600
Always the front line is under attack, not
the back line.

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:58.288
So those who are in the front are always
under attack

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:03.166
and they have to be very careful as to how
they are behaving.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:09.189
For if there is a sly person, he will
become sly, but subtler sly.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.299
He will not just become the other way
round, his slyness will become subtler.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.352
If he is a miserly fellow, then he will
become miserly in a subtler way.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:23.737
Or say, if he is an ego-oriented fellow,

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:27.200
then he becomes ego-oriented in a subtler
way.

00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:36.726
But to get rid of these things within you,
you have to go to the other side of it.

00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.768
Say if you are miserly, you become
absolutely generous;

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.565
give up everything that you have.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:49.376
Don’t be calculated, don’t talk of money,
don’t worry about money.

00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:56.572
If you are extravagant, indulgent too much,
you should go the other way round.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:02.730
Unless and until you become juxtaposition,
you cannot get rid of these things.

00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.686
Like if you are hot-tempered man, very
hot-tempered, then become so mild

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:10.667
that even if somebody beats you,
it’s all right.

00:06:10.868 --> 00:06:12.686
Whatever one says it’s all right.

00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:18.590
That’s how you get rid of your habits which
become subtler and subtler.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.110
There’s another way of dealing with it:
being alert.

00:06:28.664 --> 00:06:30.864
When you are alert, you start seeing
yourself

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:34.407
as a separate person with the habits that
it has,

00:06:34.608 --> 00:06:36.641
and then you start understanding why you
are behaving,

00:06:36.842 --> 00:06:40.349
“Oh, I understand, I knew you before,
ten years back,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.203
before my realisation. I know Mr.,
you are like this.”

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:53.188
And then take the juxtaposition against
that personality and just shoot it off.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.962
Like a person who is a negative, left-sided
person,

00:06:57.163 --> 00:07:00.371
whatever you may do for that person,
he will become subtler and subtler.

00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:05.643
Suddenly, if it’s a girl, she will start
just crying for nothing at all

00:07:05.844 --> 00:07:10.027
and feeling miserable. If it’s a boy, if he
thinks about, analyses

00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:17.404
he will become analyser of Sahaja Yoga
also, in a subtler way.

00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:20.019
Then what they should do is to stand before
the photograph

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.944
and see the reflection, “That’s the other
one who died.”

00:07:25.145 --> 00:07:33.820
And just try to make fun of that or shout
at it, depends on.

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:39.681
If it is an aggressive stuff, it’s better
to make fun, because it’s stupid.

00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:44.171
And if it is that one that takes
aggression, then shout at it,

00:07:44.372 --> 00:07:48.174
“What do you mean, by taking aggression
like this?”

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:53.807
All these things, you see, are keeping you
away from reality.

00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:59.734
Your being has to be cleansed. With your
help only I can do it.

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.976
Many people say, “Mother, You are
all-powerful.”

00:08:02.177 --> 00:08:05.566
All right, I am and I can do everything.

00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:09.640
But only thing I cannot surpass your
freedom.

00:08:09.841 --> 00:08:16.227
That’s a fact, I cannot cross over your
freedom.

00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:23.250
And when I cannot cross your freedom,
you have to cross that.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.992
If in your own freedom, you come inside,

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:29.977
then I will bestow upon you all
the blessings.

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:35.947
But if you want to stand outside, I am not
the one to put you in with a pistol.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:39.568
No, that’s not the way it will work out.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.176
This is one hurdle that Sahaja Yogis must
know

00:08:43.377 --> 00:08:49.239
that at every moment you are free,
and freer, and freest.

00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:52.971
The more free you become, the worse
is your situation,

00:08:53.172 --> 00:08:56.056
as far as the facing of the negativity is
concerned.

00:08:56.257 --> 00:09:00.290
Say if there are four persons are around
you,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.054
they will be first attacked.

00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:09.051
Naturally, you can understand the front
line is always under attack,

00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:11.157
not the back side.

00:09:11.358 --> 00:09:13.946
Though according to the law, it should be
the back side

00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:18.220
because all these horrible, negative forces
should come from the back.

00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.305
But they are very clever, they know
that the back

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:25.028
sometimes drop out by themselves,
so no need to go that side.

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:27.969
They try the front line.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.600
And those who think they are in charge
and responsible

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.470
have to be very careful as to how they
behave,

00:09:36.671 --> 00:09:39.973
how they are responsible, how they work
it out,

00:09:40.174 --> 00:09:43.238
if they are keeping their old habits
at a subtler level

00:09:43.439 --> 00:09:47.259
or they are just fighting it out. It’s very
important.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.764
And this is how intelligently you can
manage yourselves, very well.

00:09:52.965 --> 00:09:58.328
Then once you become detached,

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:03.188
you know, from all these things -
only at mental level.

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:06.160
The spiritual level I’ll look after. But
at mental level,

00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:12.429
you must come to logical conclusion that,
“I have to fight this nonsensical stuff.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:18.579
I have to be alert about this nonsense that
exists within me.”

00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:30.702
Shiva Tattwa is innocent, absolutely
innocent it is.

00:10:30.903 --> 00:10:35.111
It is very powerful and extremely innocent.

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:40.052
And the secret to achieve it is only just
to please, just to please Him.

00:10:40.253 --> 00:10:44.518
If you please Shiva, then you may be
a rakshasa or anything,

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:48.284
He grants all kinds of boons.

00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:57.173
But to a rakshasa He can only grant
the boon of longevity, of long life.

00:10:57.374 --> 00:11:04.970
But to a saint, He’ll grant the Sat-Chit-
Ananda state.

00:11:06.537 --> 00:11:12.739
So even if He grants anything to
a rakshasa,

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.606
one should not ask questions about it.

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:17.585
He can give him longevity, what does it
matter?

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:23.551
Even if you live for thousands of years
and earn nothing out of it;

00:11:23.752 --> 00:11:25.411
you never get your realisation.

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:32.807
So to a saint, He gives that eternal
longevity

00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:36.440
which comes through Spirit.

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:44.762
This is the blessing of Shiva Tattwa.
While Vishnu Tattwa,

00:11:44.963 --> 00:12:00.053
He gives ascent to a saint and light
of wisdom

00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:07.525
to see and understand everything
in collective consciousness,

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:16.265
and to a rakshasa He gives death, He kills.

00:12:16.466 --> 00:12:25.751
So for people who are not so deep,

00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:33.627
it seems that why should Shiva give any
blessings of longevity to a rakshasa.

00:12:33.897 --> 00:12:42.342
These are the characters of these different
deities.

00:12:42.543 --> 00:12:49.238
Now for example, if a rakshasa wants
to live long,

00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:57.230
he goes to Shiva, pleases Him by praising
Him,

00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:03.529
singing songs to Him, by asking His
blessings, by doing the tapas for Him,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:09.957
talking about Shiva’s innocence, he gets
longevity.

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:17.092
Sometimes, these rakshasas are better
on the earth than in the subconscious.

00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:19.356
They can be horrid.

00:13:19.557 --> 00:13:24.449
They can gather some more bhoots to torture
human beings.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:29.450
So it’s better to keep them in the eyes
of Vishnu.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:37.989
He manages them better here than to send
them into the subconscious.

00:13:38.957 --> 00:13:43.475
But Shiva’s style is very different from
that of Vishnu’s style.

00:13:43.676 --> 00:13:45.871
You have to have all kinds of styles
because you know

00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:50.024
there are so many permutations and
combinations in human beings.

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:52.470
If you have one style, what will you do
with the other style

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.798
of human beings, you see?

00:13:54.999 --> 00:14:02.823
So the style of Vishnu is that if you are
trying to be funny,

00:14:03.024 --> 00:14:09.563
He plays tricks and puts you right.

00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:12.629
Say, a Sahaja Yogi – He (Vishnu) is not
interested if you [see],

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.311
so much in other people, but in Sahaja
Yogis.

00:14:16.512 --> 00:14:22.184
If Sahaja Yogi tries to be funny; say he
wants to drink wine,

00:14:22.385 --> 00:14:25.815
“All right”, He says, “Drink wine.”

00:14:26.016 --> 00:14:29.931
He drinks the wine, and then he gets sick
somewhere,

00:14:30.132 --> 00:14:33.690
his car falls off, or he is insulted
somewhere.

00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:35.969
Something happens to him, he is punished
so badly

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:41.762
that he says, “Oh God, what have I done?”
That’s Vishnu tattwa.

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:44.121
But Shiva is the other way round. If you
see Shiva’s style is this,

00:14:44.322 --> 00:14:49.215
If you see Shiva's style

00:14:49.416 --> 00:14:55.497
that if you drink, He just disappears
from your heart;

00:14:55.698 --> 00:14:59.224
you have a heart attack and you die.

00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:06.502
He also kills. One kills directly – in
a positive way, He definitely kills;

00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:10.100
the another one by recession. If Shiva
disappears,

00:15:10.301 --> 00:15:13.286
how can you exist? That’s one way.

00:15:13.487 --> 00:15:17.871
Second way is that those who are born
with Shiva tattwa,

00:15:18.072 --> 00:15:24.092
like our Sainath was, Shirdi Sainath,
or people like that -

00:15:24.293 --> 00:15:27.849
even the Devi sometimes can do that –

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.725
they drink away all the wines of the world,

00:15:30.926 --> 00:15:34.887
all the poisons of the world, like Shiva
did.

00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:41.825
So when Sainath found that so many people
were smoking this tobacco,

00:15:42.026 --> 00:15:44.915
he smoked all the tobacco of the world,

00:15:45.116 --> 00:15:49.523
tried to smoke everything in Maharashtra
so that nobody should get it.

00:15:49.724 --> 00:15:54.896
That’s the style of Shiva to take all
the poison into Himself,

00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:59.437
and to absorb all the poison within
Himself.

00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:02.386
He can deal with the most difficult things.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:09.916
So the one dealing comes through the brain,
because Virata is in our brain,

00:16:10.117 --> 00:16:14.360
acts through the brain. So He plays tricks
on you.

00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:18.920
And that appeals to us because we can
see that He’s killed someone.

00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:23.654
So we think, “Very nice Mother, You have
punished that person, it’s good.”

00:16:23.855 --> 00:16:31.108
But Shiva Tattwa gives you the problems
which normally you cannot see

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:37.685
but works out in a short time like that,
like heart troubles;

00:16:37.886 --> 00:16:44.786
or a person who has a very poor Shiva
Tattwa

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:50.650
can have all the incurable diseases
of the world.

00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:58.588
There nobody is killed, but it’s every
minute the person is suffering.

00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:02.641
That is the way Shiva corrects.

00:17:02.842 --> 00:17:10.245
In us, when Shiva Tattwa is awakened,
our priorities change absolutely.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:17.195
I see now that those who have come,
say, to India from the West,

00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:19.735
have changed quite a lot in their
priorities,

00:17:19.936 --> 00:17:25.920
but still there is not so much change
as it should be.

00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.193
They are, of course, thousand times better

00:17:28.394 --> 00:17:31.981
than their fellow beings who are not
realised souls.

00:17:32.182 --> 00:17:38.550
But still, attachment to things, attachment
to money is quite a lot.

00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.967
This detachment must work out.

00:17:42.168 --> 00:17:48.730
See, things are not correct in people
and the alertness is not there.

00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:52.379
To give a very, very gross example of this,
I’ll tell you

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:58.234
that, a gentleman, say, came and he was
told that,

00:17:58.435 --> 00:18:02.132
“You have to give, say, eleven rupees
for puja.”

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:06.716
He said, “On principle we are not supposed
to give.”

00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:10.683
So I mean, you are only paying, even
on principle,

00:18:10.884 --> 00:18:16.409
you are only paying for your food and
lodging, not for puja.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.452
The other side of it, they will not even
see that,

00:18:19.653 --> 00:18:23.810
“Mother is spending so much for us extra
for which we are not paying anything.”

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.413
It’s not all found.

00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:33.131
Like the other day, I said that people are
now asking me to pay for this,

00:18:33.332 --> 00:18:37.036
then tomorrow they will say, “Pay for
our house rents.”

00:18:37.237 --> 00:18:40.490
It was so. It was such a condition, once
upon a time in London,

00:18:40.691 --> 00:18:44.088
when I started the ashram, that they asked
for all the utensils in the ashram,

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.553
I paid for the rent, paid for everything.
And ultimately, they said,

00:18:47.754 --> 00:18:51.040
“We don’t have an ironing board, please
send us.”

00:18:51.249 --> 00:18:55.103
From that, it’s not so bad now, I mean,
of course.

00:18:57.947 --> 00:19:01.290
But still, if they have to pay 5 rupees
for taxi,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.486
they will think that, “Oh, we have to pay
for taxi, Mother is supposed to pay.”

00:19:04.687 --> 00:19:09.813
But if I pay 7000-8000 rupees for you to go
to Haridwar, that’s all right.

00:19:10.014 --> 00:19:15.330
that’s good, that nobody wants to find out
how Mother is paying for us.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.709
It’s surprising and this disturbs me
very much

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:28.861
that what is your attitude towards
this now.

00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:34.490
The pleasing should be done with full
heart.

00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:38.845
Say if you have to buy any presents
for your friends, or anything,

00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:43.644
you don’t mind spending money for that;
but for puja you have objections.

00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:47.108
For your laundry you used to pay always,
I mean,

00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:50.357
I have seen the laundry bill, I was amazed
how much money was spent.

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:56.519
But 21 rupees, the principle was involved.
Imagine.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:01.530
Look at it. If you look at it, you will be
shocked at yourself.

00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:07.113
But that shows despite all this, you have
got your realisation.

00:20:07.314 --> 00:20:08.966
See the generosity.

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:15.566
It’s very, very, you see, it’s very,
very gross. It’s very gross.

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:22.669
So the detachment from this gross life
must go away.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.422
But an ordinary villager understands better

00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:27.983
because he is innocent. He is innocent.

00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:31.722
Because you are not innocent, that’s why
you see everything from your mind.

00:20:31.923 --> 00:20:34.523
You think with it, “How much we paid,

00:20:34.724 --> 00:20:38.527
how much this is, this is that, this,
that.”

00:20:38.728 --> 00:20:43.771
But an innocent villager, even if he has
four annas,

00:20:43.972 --> 00:20:48.934
he would like to do something, “Mother,
that’s all I have.”

00:20:49.135 --> 00:20:52.544
We have a parable in the Bible.

00:20:54.054 --> 00:20:55.629
And this is what it is. One should see

00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:01.569
our detachment starts at a very baser
level of money.

00:21:04.225 --> 00:21:09.919
You need not have any friends. What is
the need to give to any friends?

00:21:12.948 --> 00:21:16.290
What are these friends for?

00:21:16.505 --> 00:21:20.564
Except for Shiva Tattwa, what other friend
you need?

00:21:20.773 --> 00:21:25.722
Think of it, without God, what is your
life?

00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:30.887
So the detachment must start.
The priorities must change,

00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:35.874
and you must know that God is the One
who is your Friend,

00:21:36.075 --> 00:21:39.973
who is your Father, who is your Mother,
who is to be worshipped.

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:45.249
There is nothing else. Tana, mana, dhana –
everything is for God.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.594
Of course, I don’t want anything from you,
you know that.

00:21:48.795 --> 00:21:55.665
But that should be the attitude
of a person.

00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:04.746
So the first – this attitude comes
in a person.

00:22:04.947 --> 00:22:08.282
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga, you have a great
advantage

00:22:08.483 --> 00:22:10.927
that those who have developed this
attitude,

00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:14.167
have been helped so much materially

00:22:14.368 --> 00:22:19.675
that you find the proof of it, immediately.

00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:24.648
The proof is there and those who do not
take to this kind of a thing, suffer.

00:22:24.849 --> 00:22:27.907
So the proof is there.

00:22:29.194 --> 00:22:39.695
I must give you an example of a goldsmith.

00:22:39.896 --> 00:22:43.398
I had given him something to be made
for the puja.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:46.195
A lot of gold was given, everything,

00:22:46.396 --> 00:22:52.759
and still, stupidly, he tried to make money
out of that.

00:22:53.076 --> 00:22:56.401
And he got cancer and he died.

00:22:56.602 --> 00:23:00.713
I didn’t do anything, but I knew he had
made money.

00:23:00.936 --> 00:23:04.031
I knew that all; I know lots of things.

00:23:04.232 --> 00:23:09.964
I didn’t say anything to him, nothing,
never, never even mentioned.

00:23:10.165 --> 00:23:13.765
He got cancer and he died; he is no more

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.176
because Shiva Tattva disappeared.
This was for a puja,

00:23:22.377 --> 00:23:28.610
the money of the saints, something was
to be made

00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:32.258
and he should not have done it. The proof
is just there.

00:23:32.459 --> 00:23:34.762
Now, those who knew him got a fright
of their lives,

00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:40.435
“Oh God, now no more of this from us
at least.”

00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:48.952
But those who have been surrendered
about their money part also –

00:23:49.153 --> 00:23:53.361
not that I take anything from you, nor
do I want anything from you –

00:23:53.562 --> 00:23:56.779
but still, the attitude I am saying is
different.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.002
Tthey have gone up, they have made money,
they are very rich,

00:24:00.203 --> 00:24:02.141
they are very well to do, they are
all right,

00:24:02.342 --> 00:24:06.470
they get so much blessings, everything.

00:24:07.645 --> 00:24:11.131
This is the first Nabhi chakra’s
detachment.

00:24:11.332 --> 00:24:15.772
We should start by putting Shiva on top.

00:24:18.102 --> 00:24:22.986
Every attachment can be attacked with
Shiva Tattwa,

00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:28.880
because Shiva Tattwa is brilliant like
a diamond, brilliant.

00:24:29.081 --> 00:24:33.012
Every facet can be cleansed out, very
simply

00:24:33.213 --> 00:24:37.548
through our Kundalini awakening and
through our alertness.

00:24:37.749 --> 00:24:43.943
And one after that you can see there are
other attachments we have.

00:24:44.144 --> 00:24:49.879
This is friendship, sympathies,
friendships.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.092
Sympathies always go to a person who
is in need or something like that.

00:24:56.293 --> 00:25:00.866
You have known sympathies have tortured
so many people.

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:04.792
The other way also could be that you hate
someone too much,

00:25:04.993 --> 00:25:08.898
you love someone too much, some sort
of a thing like that.

00:25:09.099 --> 00:25:14.776
So detachment comes that you do not hate,
nor you love anyone.

00:25:14.985 --> 00:25:18.103
You leave it to God to decide.

00:25:23.195 --> 00:25:25.607
That’s a kind of a detachment that
you leave it to God.

00:25:25.808 --> 00:25:29.578
“God, please” – that is His exploit.
“I am not going to judge.

00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:33.250
Only thing I judge them on Kundalini,
I awaken their Kundalini.

00:25:33.451 --> 00:25:36.110
If it works out, well and good, if it
doesn’t work out, well and good.”

00:25:36.311 --> 00:25:42.322
So you have detached yourself from
the responsibility of judging others.

00:25:42.523 --> 00:25:46.501
Only your judgment is on Kundalini,
if it works out, all right.

00:25:46.702 --> 00:25:52.188
But you are just like a barometer that’s
all, or like a machine that cures.

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:56.161
You are not involved into it. So this
involvement into personal lives

00:25:56.362 --> 00:25:59.594
and personal relationships like mother,
sister, brother,

00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:03.079
every sort of a nonsense, must be taken
out.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.191
Now say, if your mother is not all right,

00:26:08.512 --> 00:26:12.983
you must just get after her and see
that she is put right.

00:26:13.184 --> 00:26:15.842
That’s very important; mother has
to be all right.

00:26:16.043 --> 00:26:18.269
If she’s not all right, you tell her,
“I’m not going to eat

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.106
food from your hand, finished. You get
your vibrations all right.”

00:26:23.383 --> 00:26:26.984
You tell her that, “You better take
to realisation,

00:26:27.185 --> 00:26:30.130
otherwise I will not have anything to do
with you.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.472
I’ll just come, see you, talk to you,
go away.”

00:26:33.673 --> 00:26:37.619
Show that detachment to her. Be strong.
You must cure your mother.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:44.092
Very important, because mother is a part
of Sahaja Yoga, it’s very important.

00:26:44.293 --> 00:26:48.593
But many people I have seen just do not
know how to resist.

00:26:48.794 --> 00:26:52.184
You must protest, go on protesting
one after another

00:26:52.385 --> 00:26:57.283
because that’s the greatest thing you are
doing for your mother.

00:26:57.484 --> 00:26:59.468
What else can you give it to her?

00:26:59.669 --> 00:27:03.250
Anything you give, the whole world,
has no meaning,

00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:12.834
except correcting your mother for the
better life, an eternal life, life of God.

00:27:17.442 --> 00:27:21.127
Then your wife – the wife is a very
dangerous situation.

00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:26.567
If the wife is negative, she will go on
putting into your head things,

00:27:26.768 --> 00:27:30.675
which will work out at a odd time, and you
will be amazed

00:27:30.876 --> 00:27:34.244
how you slipped out these things and how
you said these things,

00:27:34.445 --> 00:27:38.008
why should you have done it, why did
you do this.

00:27:38.209 --> 00:27:40.980
But the wife is to be told that, “You have
to behave yourself,

00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:45.970
you have to get all right, nothing doing,
and there is no compromise.

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:48.089
You be in another room, I will be
in another room.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.409
You should get well. I am not going
to have…”

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.487
Because that is even much more dangerous,
because you know

00:27:54.688 --> 00:27:57.966
if the woman is catching,

00:27:58.167 --> 00:28:04.650
then there are very serious diseases who
develop with the Mooladhara problem.

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:08.519
So you have to be strict with your wife.
You should make her,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.996
you should say, “I’ll not eat any food
with your hands.

00:28:11.197 --> 00:28:14.398
I’ll have nothing to do, I’ll not talk
to you,

00:28:14.599 --> 00:28:17.272
I’ll just come and sleep in another room
and go out.

00:28:17.473 --> 00:28:20.898
You better not touch my clothes.

00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:25.917
If you don’t listen to me then I have
nothing to do with you.

00:28:26.118 --> 00:28:29.348
You better… I’m your husband,

00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:31.541
and whatever dharma I follow, you
have to follow,

00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:34.935
if you don’t want to listen to me, then
I have nothing to do with you.”

00:28:35.136 --> 00:28:37.930
The wife can also do the same thing
with the husband.

00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:41.568
Gradually showing indifference in a way
that he understands

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:44.731
that it doesn’t bring love.

00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:48.744
That’s how women corrected men
long time back.

00:28:48.945 --> 00:28:53.450
Nowadays, of course women, if you give
them something, they are get pleased.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.578
Even if there is a keep, as long as they
are giving diamonds to the wife,

00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:02.702
she is quite pleased with the keep.
Still in India it’s not accepted.

00:29:02.903 --> 00:29:05.038
But I have seen in the West nobody minds.

00:29:05.239 --> 00:29:07.358
If the husband has ten keeps, doesn’t
matter,

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:12.284
as long as he is giving you the money,
all right, nobody minds it.

00:29:12.485 --> 00:29:15.312
That’s very funny.

00:29:16.473 --> 00:29:22.127
So wife’s relation, mother’s relations,
husband’s relations,

00:29:22.328 --> 00:29:27.457
close relations must be corrected. And
children must be guarded.

00:29:27.658 --> 00:29:31.486
You shouldn’t allow your children to go
away to the wrong things.

00:29:31.687 --> 00:29:34.010
If they are doing wrong things, they are
not coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.327
you are duty bound;

00:29:35.528 --> 00:29:38.193
you should say, “I’m not going to pay you
any money, nothing doing.

00:29:38.394 --> 00:29:43.523
I’ll not see your faces, if you do not take
to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:29:43.724 --> 00:29:49.277
What else are you going to give to your
children, but God?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:58.602
You can do it. You all can do it.

00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:06.133
But one should know I need not do it.

00:30:06.334 --> 00:30:10.853
So many people say that, “Mother, Your
husband is not so much a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:30:11.054 --> 00:30:13.984
That’s all right. I know where to bring
him in;

00:30:14.185 --> 00:30:16.399
I know when to bring my children in;

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.037
because if they were in, everybody would
have said,

00:30:19.238 --> 00:30:24.329
“They have floated a family enterprise.”

00:30:30.783 --> 00:30:36.652
As long as they are out of it, it’s a very
good idea, specially in India.

00:30:37.343 --> 00:30:41.503
So best thing is if they oppose me, I keep
all of them out; my brothers…

00:30:41.704 --> 00:30:45.676
Imagine, my own brothers, my own –

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:49.982
I mean, they all have tremendous respect
for me, no doubt.

00:30:50.183 --> 00:30:53.724
Even my brother said that, “Thank God,
You are staying in my room now,

00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:58.539
so the vibrations will be very good for me.
And what do You think of my vibrations?”

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.662
Everything he says, but he is not
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:04.133
I have given realisation to all of them,
everything is there,

00:31:04.334 --> 00:31:06.508
but they are not Sahaja Yogis – a part
of this.

00:31:06.709 --> 00:31:10.203
Otherwise they will be in charge of money,
you see.

00:31:10.404 --> 00:31:12.182
“What money you get? Now, come along,

00:31:12.383 --> 00:31:16.868
this is the money we have”, all
the problems.

00:31:17.069 --> 00:31:19.601
With all these relations around, you don’t
know.

00:31:19.802 --> 00:31:21.746
Somebody will go and say, “Shri Mataji
said so.”

00:31:21.947 --> 00:31:25.930
“Oh, that’s the daughter of Mataji has
said” – so that becomes rule.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:31.359
I don’t want all these pressures on my
head.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.459
That’s the best way; I wish our politicians
understand that:

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:42.039
never have your relations around. That’s
the best way to administer.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.835
If you have your relations around, then you
will never do right things.

00:31:47.036 --> 00:31:52.898
Or even if you do right things, your
relations will spoil it.

00:31:53.099 --> 00:31:56.211
So all those who are Sahaja Yogis must know

00:31:56.412 --> 00:32:00.023
that you should not try to help your
relations

00:32:00.224 --> 00:32:05.008
in a way that they take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:32:05.262 --> 00:32:08.144
Like, if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:13.330
you bring your mother and make her sit
in front of me.

00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:22.263
First correct her vibrations. Put her right
and then bring her.

00:32:23.234 --> 00:32:25.508
“Correct my father, correct my mother…”,

00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:29.603
is not Mother’s responsibility, it’s your
own.

00:32:29.804 --> 00:32:33.091
When they are all right, then as you bring
flowers to me,

00:32:33.292 --> 00:32:40.345
bring your relations as a very good present
from your family.

00:32:40.546 --> 00:32:46.097
That’s a much better thing than to be like
this that I have to clear.

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:50.570
If one is a Sahaja Yogi, all his three
generations up and down,

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:54.742
this side and that side I have to cure;
that is done.

00:32:54.943 --> 00:32:59.438
Like Malhotra made me do.

00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:04.538
So one should detach from these family ties

00:33:04.739 --> 00:33:09.796
and these emotional imbalances we have,
emotional problems we have

00:33:09.997 --> 00:33:17.551
by understanding that the only thing that
these people should have is Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:18.639 --> 00:33:21.245
And some people should not be in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:33:21.446 --> 00:33:28.090
Like as I said my own husband, and my
daughter and my relations, I keep them out.

00:33:29.064 --> 00:33:32.329
All such people if there are any, you
should not also have them

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:38.154
anywhere near Sahaja Yoga. You should be
discrete to find out.

00:33:39.403 --> 00:33:43.474
Although, all these, my relations are very
dharmic people, extremely dharmic,

00:33:43.699 --> 00:33:47.325
very good, very self-respecting, all
qualities they have got –

00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:53.265
everything, readymade, but they are not
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.156
So none of you can say, “Somebody said so,
so one said so.”

00:33:58.357 --> 00:34:02.490
It has to be: “Mother has to say.”

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.798
This detachment has to come. It takes time,
especially with Indians.

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:12.775
All the time they are worried about their
children, or a mother or a father.

00:34:12.976 --> 00:34:15.330
Go on and on and on and on and on,

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:22.721
see, years together, “my son, my daughter,
my son, my father” – all the time.

00:34:22.922 --> 00:34:28.546
Now by God’s grace so many have got rid
of all their responsibilities somehow,

00:34:28.747 --> 00:34:30.756
through Sahaja Yoga, or whatever it is.

00:34:30.957 --> 00:34:33.352
So they are now settled down onto
themselves,

00:34:33.553 --> 00:34:36.031
because you are your own responsibility.

00:34:36.232 --> 00:34:40.479
So this detachment must be brought, those
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:47.010
that we are here to get Sahaja Yoga
blessings. We are going to be blessings.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.589
With that pride if you’ll be in the family,

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.310
“All right, if you want to have Sahaja
Yoga, you have it”,

00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:55.242
but not to force them on Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:55.443 --> 00:34:57.279
But you can force Sahaja Yoga on them;

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.834
the stage has come that you have to talk
about Sahaja Yoga to them.

00:35:00.035 --> 00:35:02.329
In the beginning I used to say, “Don’t talk
to them.”

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.320
But those who are useless, if they are not
to be brought in Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:05.521 --> 00:35:08.142
tell them, “You are not good for Sahaja
Yoga, better not ask me.”

00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:12.465
Then they will come. Some people you should
show complete indifference,

00:35:12.666 --> 00:35:15.016
“You are incapable, you are no good, you
are too materialistic.”

00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:19.554
Then that person will say, “I will prove
that I am.”

00:35:27.906 --> 00:35:31.906
All these detachments take place

00:35:32.107 --> 00:35:37.330
and then the detachments are at Nabhi
chakras,

00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:41.132
you rise up to your emotional side at
the Heart chakra.

00:35:41.333 --> 00:35:48.577
And then you have to have the detachment
even of a kind of a collectivity,

00:35:48.778 --> 00:35:52.580
that we think it’s collectivity.

00:35:52.781 --> 00:35:59.555
I call the fraternity of the bhoots, not
collectivity.

00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:06.176
Always all the useless Sahaja Yogis will
form a group;

00:36:06.557 --> 00:36:17.645
and they’ll have a very strong objection
to everything that is sensible,

00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:20.371
and they will have suggestions for
everything.

00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:27.086
There has to be no suggestions at all.

00:36:27.287 --> 00:36:32.576
There are no alternatives because Shiva
is absolute.

00:36:32.777 --> 00:36:38.994
Once one said is said. You just do it and
see – that’s the best.

00:36:39.195 --> 00:36:45.551
Alternatives will be second best or third
best or maybe useless.

00:36:45.924 --> 00:36:50.250
But there is no alternative for Shiva
Tattwa.

00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:58.473
I’ll give an example, I told Delhi people
that, “You organise, say,

00:36:58.674 --> 00:37:02.779
programme for seven days outside,
with other people.”

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.419
It was sensible because I knew it was
to rain. And it has to rain also.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.803
Rain can be stopped, but it was to rain
for all the other villagers, you see.

00:37:11.004 --> 00:37:14.807
We cannot stop them for only Sahaja Yogis,
can we?

00:37:15.008 --> 00:37:16.738
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are important,
so I said,

00:37:16.939 --> 00:37:19.591
“Let them be with other Sahaja Yogis.”

00:37:19.792 --> 00:37:22.298
Now they started an alternative, only
thinking that

00:37:22.498 --> 00:37:25.278
you see, they won’t be comfortable and…

00:37:25.479 --> 00:37:28.909
I mean it was good, but on a other level,

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.928
that they will not be comfortable with
Sahaja Yogis, another level.

00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:35.505
But there has to be understanding if Mother
has said it,

00:37:35.706 --> 00:37:37.625
it must be done, whatever it is.

00:37:37.826 --> 00:37:41.208
Even if She says, “You kill somebody”,
you have to kill.

00:37:41.409 --> 00:37:48.034
Keep it like that, to that extent. Keep
to the maximum.

00:37:48.235 --> 00:37:53.445
Even if She says, “You have to die now”,
you should die.

00:37:53.961 --> 00:38:02.182
If She says, “All right, you tell lies”,
“All right, I’ll tell lies.”

00:38:02.383 --> 00:38:05.838
Like Radhaji, She said, “What is my punyas,
what is my papas?

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:10.873
I am in His heart. What can I do?”
Whatever He does, She just does.

00:38:11.074 --> 00:38:13.877
That is Shiva Tattwa.

00:38:14.078 --> 00:38:19.528
When it is awakened, you see, it at least
recognises this Shiva in me.

00:38:19.729 --> 00:38:24.045
And it sees that this is Shiva Tattwa.

00:38:24.246 --> 00:38:26.819
It understands because at Shiva Tattwa

00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:32.480
you don’t commit any sins, you are sinless.

00:38:32.796 --> 00:38:38.117
When you are the Spirit, you are sinless;
there is no sin in you.

00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:42.106
If, supposing according to human
understanding,

00:38:42.307 --> 00:38:44.958
if Shiva leaves a person dies, then
it’s sinful.

00:38:45.159 --> 00:38:47.737
Why to leave anybody? It’s sinful,
isn’t it?

00:38:47.938 --> 00:38:51.075
For all common purposes, common
understanding, we’ll think

00:38:51.276 --> 00:38:57.003
that it is sinful for Shiva to leave
the person and make the person die.

00:38:57.204 --> 00:39:00.911
For example, a lady dies, her children
are left behind,

00:39:01.112 --> 00:39:05.782
then one can blame Shiva for that, that,
“See now, You went away, and these children

00:39:05.983 --> 00:39:11.231
are now without a mother or without
a father”, something like that.

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:16.237
Because Shiva is sinless; whatever He does
is sinless.

00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:20.846
So whatever you do is sinless. The idea
of sin is finished

00:39:21.047 --> 00:39:28.377
because who commits sin is your ego.
Ego commits sin.

00:39:28.578 --> 00:39:31.660
But if you have no ego, there’s no sin,

00:39:31.861 --> 00:39:37.503
because you are not doing anything,
you stand in akarma.

00:39:37.704 --> 00:39:40.851
Say the sun is shining, is shining sharp,

00:39:41.052 --> 00:39:45.426
and somebody wants to stand in the sun,
then he gets burns.

00:39:45.627 --> 00:39:50.471
It’s not the fault of the sun, the sun
is shining,

00:39:50.672 --> 00:39:54.626
that’s the job of sun.

00:39:54.827 --> 00:39:58.537
Whatever is the job of the Shiva, He is
doing it. He is not sinful.

00:39:58.738 --> 00:40:02.993
It’s our mental attitude makes us think,
“This is sin”, “this is not sin”.

00:40:03.194 --> 00:40:06.966
But when we have ego, we are committing
sins.

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:12.606
If you ask a tiger, “You are committing
a sin because you are eating a cow.”

00:40:12.807 --> 00:40:18.716
He will say, “I never knew what a sin was.
I don’t know what sin is.”

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:23.483
It’s a story when some missionaries were
going away from a village, you see.

00:40:23.684 --> 00:40:27.392
So the villagers, poor, innocent you know,
they just got up to thank them.

00:40:27.593 --> 00:40:30.991
They said, “Thank God, when you came here,
you told us there is sin.

00:40:31.192 --> 00:40:34.544
We didn’t know what sin was.”

00:40:35.354 --> 00:40:40.039
For innocent people, they don’t know what
is sin.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.988
Because Spirit is innocent, it has no sin.

00:40:43.189 --> 00:40:48.248
It obeys the other source of innocence.

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:51.633
So there is no sin for a person who is
the Spirit.

00:40:51.834 --> 00:40:54.904
For Shiva there is no sin, whether He wants
to give

00:40:55.105 --> 00:40:59.995
His blessings to a rakshasa or to a saint.

00:41:00.196 --> 00:41:05.582
There is no sin for Him, because He
is Bholenath.

00:41:05.783 --> 00:41:09.165
He is beyond, He is beyond sin.

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:12.938
Whatever He does, He is beyond sin,

00:41:13.139 --> 00:41:17.133
because ego cannot envelope Him.
There is no ego.

00:41:17.334 --> 00:41:21.687
Because we have ego, we commit sins.

00:41:23.016 --> 00:41:28.168
Once ego is finished, we are no more there,
so who commits sins?

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:31.774
When we are not there, who is committing
the sin?

00:41:31.975 --> 00:41:37.090
Shiva can’t commit sins, so we are
the Shiva, so we cannot commit sins.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.530
So all these ideas of giving alternatives

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:43.868
at the mental level, is also wrong.

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:48.419
I give any – anything I say, immediately
there will be ten suggestions.

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:51.375
I try all these tricks with you,

00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:55.883
because you are used to conferences,
you see.

00:41:59.094 --> 00:42:04.517
So I said, “All right, Subramanian, what
do you have to say about it?”

00:42:06.473 --> 00:42:10.601
Because after all, lord Subramanian
is there, must ask him.

00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:18.607
Then I ask Venugopalan, then I’ll ask
Gavin, Warren, all these people,

00:42:18.808 --> 00:42:24.372
“Now, what do you have to say?” And
then they give their suggestions.

00:42:24.573 --> 00:42:36.553
But if you see, in the conference of all
the divine Deities,

00:42:36.775 --> 00:42:42.222
there is no suggestion, no suggestion,
no alternative.

00:42:42.423 --> 00:42:45.901
No alternatives to your Mother’s ideas,
nothing.

00:42:46.102 --> 00:42:48.801
Absolute, it’s absolute.

00:42:49.017 --> 00:42:54.020
Nobody gives any suggestions to me,
never.

00:42:55.897 --> 00:42:58.671
No question.

00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:04.182
They won’t listen to you, they won’t listen
to anyone.

00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:10.271
There’s no question. Such harmony;
complete obedience.

00:43:12.249 --> 00:43:16.713
And not only they are fixed with their
qualities.

00:43:16.914 --> 00:43:21.184
If they are told that, “You have to do it”,
they’ll do it.

00:43:23.152 --> 00:43:28.278
This is the difference. Then try.

00:43:28.495 --> 00:43:31.721
Sometimes it appears, you see –
if I say, “All right,

00:43:31.922 --> 00:43:36.566
go this way and you will find the place”,
but you won’t find.

00:43:36.767 --> 00:43:39.090
So you will say, “See, Mother, You said
to go this way,

00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.843
that’s why we went this way and we didn’t
find the church.”

00:43:42.044 --> 00:43:45.594
Now there it is not that I’m saying that
you will find the church,

00:43:45.795 --> 00:43:51.082
it is I am trying to see what you think.

00:43:51.283 --> 00:43:55.956
I am telling you my own tricks, all right,
so be careful.

00:43:56.759 --> 00:44:01.539
I’ll tell you although, “Go this way. Now,
you didn’t find the church, I’m sorry.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.434
I should not have told you. Or you should
have gone that (way).”

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:07.330
But that’s not true. I must tell you,
that’s not true.

00:44:07.531 --> 00:44:11.811
What I am trying to see, what you are
saying about this.

00:44:12.012 --> 00:44:16.092
Now if you are clever, you would say,
“I went there,

00:44:16.293 --> 00:44:20.408
I didn’t see the place, but I saw something
else, Mother.

00:44:20.609 --> 00:44:23.588
That’s the reason You sent me there. Now
I know why You sent me there.”

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:28.163
That’s it. Then I know that he is Sahaja
Yogi.

00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.802
But if you say, “Oh, I went there because
I thought I will find this thing,

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:37.385
but, it was not there, and You sent me,
You sent me”, finished.

00:44:37.586 --> 00:44:41.906
If you say that, “You said so and it
happened.”

00:44:42.107 --> 00:44:47.245
Oh, I did say, no doubt, but what I said
was just to play a trick on you,

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:51.956
because one of the natures of your Mother
is Mahamaya. So be careful.

00:44:52.157 --> 00:44:56.306
How you react is very important for me
to see how far you have gone.

00:44:56.507 --> 00:45:00.450
This is one of the ways you are judged.

00:45:02.407 --> 00:45:05.597
But for a villager, it’s a different thing
if you see.

00:45:05.798 --> 00:45:12.025
If I tell him, “Now if you want me to go
to that village,

00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:19.286
see, take the cart, or take the bullock
cart this way”, he’ll take it.

00:45:19.487 --> 00:45:23.942
But there will be a ditch, so I’ll get hit.

00:45:24.143 --> 00:45:31.407
So he will say, “Mother, I’m sorry, you
got hit. But I could have avoided it.”

00:45:31.608 --> 00:45:34.263
You see, so he takes the responsibility
upon himself.

00:45:34.464 --> 00:45:36.957
He takes everything upon himself.
“Because you asked me,

00:45:37.158 --> 00:45:43.226
so I had to go that way, but I could have
avoided it if I was careful.”

00:45:44.207 --> 00:45:46.682
So this is the difference you know, not
to put responsibility.

00:45:46.883 --> 00:45:50.240
It’s a common human nature is to put
responsibility on somebody else.

00:45:50.441 --> 00:45:52.750
Best is to put on Mother.

00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:59.490
But in that you lose all your punyas.

00:46:00.922 --> 00:46:05.114
So, “The responsibility is mine. I must
have done some mistake.

00:46:05.315 --> 00:46:08.197
I must have done some mistake somewhere

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:13.472
or else maybe that Mother wants me to learn
something in this.”

00:46:13.673 --> 00:46:17.253
Every time you do something, I tell you
something,

00:46:17.454 --> 00:46:21.020
it’s just for you to learn something.
I don’t have to learn anything.

00:46:21.221 --> 00:46:26.238
Do you think that way, that I have to learn
something now anymore? Not anymore.

00:46:26.439 --> 00:46:30.210
So you have to learn something. And that
is what if you understand,

00:46:30.411 --> 00:46:34.924
then a kind of a detachment will build
in you and a surrender.

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:39.152
You will be amazed that you will be
so much relieved

00:46:39.353 --> 00:46:45.300
of nonsensical headaches that you have
and the burdens you carry.

00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:52.075
If you understand that, “The whole joke,
the whole work,

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:57.545
the whole drama is done by Mother and
I am just playing into it.”

00:46:57.773 --> 00:47:04.923
It’s so simple. That is to be felt, to be
understood.

00:47:05.673 --> 00:47:08.069
And the enjoyment lies in that,

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:12.161
not in judging or finding alternatives.

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:17.674
You try it. Those who have tried it have
enjoyed it very much and so many things.

00:47:17.875 --> 00:47:21.098
Every minute, I'll give you an example
of that.

00:47:21.299 --> 00:47:24.896
I’ll give you an example of Gregoire last
time I went to his house.

00:47:25.097 --> 00:47:27.669
He tortured my life for his wife.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.466
“When will she have her delivery?
How will she have,

00:47:30.667 --> 00:47:34.280
who is going to stay with her?” Morning
till evening, he had one talk.

00:47:34.481 --> 00:47:36.743
“All right”, I said, “something will be
done.

00:47:36.944 --> 00:47:39.745
You can have this lady to stay...”
“But then how will I go to India?”

00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:42.875
I mean, “I” was so important.

00:47:43.076 --> 00:47:45.286
Then he didn’t realise that time, you see.

00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:48.729
He thought it was so important to do
that way.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.045
Ultimately quite before going, I told him,

00:47:51.246 --> 00:47:54.738
“Gregoire, you troubled me too much this
time, but it’s all right.”

00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:57.057
So he said, “I’m sorry.”

00:47:57.258 --> 00:48:02.290
Then he telephoned me one day saying,
“Mother, my wife is in for abortion.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.361
She has gone to the hospital, there is
no chance.” I said, “Forget it.

00:48:06.562 --> 00:48:08.983
You go back to the hospital, she will be
all right.”

00:48:09.184 --> 00:48:12.130
So he went to the hospital, they said,
“A miracle.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:17.627
She’s perfectly all right, there’s no
problem. She’s all right.”

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.154
So it came into his head, as he told me,

00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:23.466
“Oh, Mother is looking after it, why should
I worry?

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:26.509
Why should I have worried Her?”
This is first thing.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:34.323
Then, the child was born earlier than time
and he came to India.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.506
So also I convince you that what I say,
what I do,

00:48:39.707 --> 00:48:42.852
you know that, that I look after you.

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:47.762
But when you take up responsibility upon
yourself and start thinking about it,

00:48:47.963 --> 00:48:53.807
then I cannot help. So just know that,
leave it to God.

00:48:54.008 --> 00:48:56.828
It’s all for your good, for your ‘hita’.

00:48:57.029 --> 00:48:59.353
Everything is for your ‘hita’, whatever
it is.

00:48:59.554 --> 00:49:03.843
Sometimes I have to shout at you, sometimes
I have to correct you,

00:49:04.044 --> 00:49:06.609
sometimes I have to tell you that,
“Don’t come here.”

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.859
Some people who touch me, you see, can
give me horrible sensations.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.576
Then I say, “You just don’t come here.
You don’t stand before me,

00:49:13.777 --> 00:49:16.149
you get out from here.” That helps them.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:18.493
But if they stand there, the bhoots will
never leave

00:49:18.694 --> 00:49:22.435
because the bhoots want to trouble me.

00:49:24.066 --> 00:49:27.106
So this point if you understand, you will
get completely detached

00:49:27.307 --> 00:49:30.999
and we’ll know that for our good, for our
betterment

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.052
we must keep Mother pleased and these
things if we do, by displeasing Her,

00:49:36.253 --> 00:49:38.975
we are going to be finished.

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:43.957
Now to understand this, what you need –
not age, not position,

00:49:44.158 --> 00:49:52.640
not your qualifications, nothing – you need
a wise mind, deep personality.

00:49:52.841 --> 00:49:56.501
I’ve seen very young people are so sensible
though their parents are stupid,

00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:59.330
absolutely stupid people.

00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:02.659
So you just need a wise, deep personality
to do it

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.899
and that you should try to develop.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:11.049
That comes only sticking onto Shiva tattwa,
which is a solid thing,

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:16.014
which is Shiva, Achala which doesn’t
move, absolute.

00:50:16.215 --> 00:50:18.850
It is not relative, it’s not relative
at all,

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:24.094
it’s not related to anything, absolute.
That gives you the depth,

00:50:24.295 --> 00:50:30.172
that depth which is required to settle
down, to go deep into you.

00:50:30.373 --> 00:50:34.796
Shiva is your guru. Guru is the one that
gives you the gravity

00:50:34.997 --> 00:50:39.556
to go straight down deep into it.

00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:43.250
[Aside: Marathi]

00:50:52.533 --> 00:50:57.199
That is very important. And all this I hope

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:05.156
with the puja today we’ll try to settle you

00:51:05.357 --> 00:51:09.810
into that great principle of Shiva.

00:51:10.011 --> 00:51:14.807
Let your attention, every particle of your
attention be filled,

00:51:15.008 --> 00:51:29.113
sparkled and rejoice by that blessing
of Shiva Tattva.

00:51:29.849 --> 00:51:32.733
I bless you all. May God bless you.
