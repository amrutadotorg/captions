00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:19.860
First, I will talk in Hindi

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.250
and then in Marathi language.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:33.870
All of you should try to learn Hindi as it is our national language.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:48.933
The name of Pune is famous in the Vedas, Puranas and many other such places.

00:12:48.933 --> 00:12:52.169
It is called as Punyapatnam.

00:12:52.169 --> 00:13:00.882
The river which flows in this place is called as Mula river.

00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:13.806
It has been flowing here for thousands of years and is making this place full of punyas.

00:13:13.806 --> 00:13:22.469
We do not have a complete knowledge about punyas.

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:34.092
Many people feel that if we give something to the poor, distribute some things,

00:13:34.092 --> 00:13:42.638
tell the truth or have certain desires then we get punyas.

00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:48.655
Maybe this collection of punyas takes place

00:13:48.655 --> 00:13:54.237
but it is like filling up a lake drop by drop.

00:13:54.237 --> 00:14:09.738
The meaning of punyas that is known is doing the work by which God is satisfied and becomes happy.

00:14:09.738 --> 00:14:13.046
We should do such works.

00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:18.907
A person who does this kind of work is really Punyavaan (one who has punyas)

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:27.726
because when he pleases God, then God’s blessings fall upon him and he gets punyas.

00:14:27.726 --> 00:14:32.269
The powers of God which flow into such a person

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:39.329
create something like a new consciousness

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:47.018
or a new personality or a new status in him.

00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:55.700
This new status is such that when this person goes to any house,

00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:06.352
any country, any place, there the blessings of God start raining down.

00:15:06.352 --> 00:15:12.785
It is as if he has an umbrella and those who come under it are blessed by God.

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:21.229
Wherever such a person lives, if there is an imminent problem in that place then it gets solved.

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:29.769
If such people move about in cities or forests

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:33.592
then any accidents that would have taken place don’t do so.

00:15:33.592 --> 00:15:41.047
So, those who have taken birth in Pune are special people with lot of punyas

00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:48.070
and now they have to earn more benefits through these punyas.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:53.970
But when a person with punyas is born in Punya nagari,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.795
he starts comparing himself with others.

00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:04.706
He says that as I have done so many punyas I am born here

00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:12.023
but those people over here who have riches and money over here are different.

00:16:12.023 --> 00:16:22.485
They don’t know God, they don’t believe in God yet they are so rich and happy.

00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:27.830
So why am I unhappy if I have done punyas?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.170
Such thoughts come into his mind.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:40.527
Once these thoughts come into his mind either he says,’ So I have not understood this thing, but no problem’

00:16:40.527 --> 00:16:46.980
and continues with his dharma or he changes himself.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:58.086
He changes himself by saying that making money and having material possessions is the greatest thing

00:16:58.086 --> 00:17:03.072
So he starts running in this new race.

00:17:03.072 --> 00:17:08.130
At this point, all his punyas get destroyed.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:19.268
It is very surprising to see that a person with punyas gets a desire for money.

00:17:19.268 --> 00:17:20.831
Anything can happen in Kaliyuga.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:27.457
It is surprising to see that in Kaliyuga, even if a Realized Soul is born then

00:17:27.457 --> 00:17:33.580
he can drink alcohol, take drugs or take to violence.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:41.447
It is astonishing that a Realised Soul who is full of punyas can do such things.

00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:47.879
This is a kind of a pull of Kaliyuga, its effect and its environment.

00:17:47.879 --> 00:17:57.514
Once a punyavaan person’s sees something, then his attention goes to that thing

00:17:57.514 --> 00:18:00.783
and develops a weakness for it.

00:18:00.783 --> 00:18:09.543
This is a great tyranny of the Kaliyuga upon us.

00:18:09.543 --> 00:18:14.731
But there is a bright side to it also.

00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:24.684
If you ask that what was the need for this tyranny of Kaliyuga to come upon this earth?

00:18:24.684 --> 00:18:32.287
If Kaliyuga has come then it too must have a reason.

00:18:32.287 --> 00:18:35.907
On this matter there is something written in Damayanti Akhyaan.

00:18:35.907 --> 00:18:42.180
Once Kali came into the hands of Nala, Damayanti’s husband.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:52.999
Nala said,’ You separated me from my wife and caused me great pain so I am going to kill you now!’

00:18:52.999 --> 00:19:01.370
Kali said,’ It is alright if you kill me but I too have some importance.’

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.898
Nala asked, ‘What importance can you have?

00:19:03.898 --> 00:19:10.565
You put everyone into illusions and people take to the wrong path because of you.’

00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:14.031
Kali replied, ‘There is a great importance.

00:19:14.031 --> 00:19:20.670
When such a time comes then it will be an Agni Pariksha for man.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.315
Only then he will know who is true and who is false.

00:19:25.315 --> 00:19:31.671
This is the only way to judge how much punyas a person has.

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:37.475
A person cannot be judged until he goes through this Agni Pariksha.’

00:19:37.475 --> 00:19:44.986
It is also written in the Bible, that the person born in the Kaliyuga,

00:19:44.986 --> 00:19:47.133
his Last Judgement will take place.

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:52.149
It will be seen how much punyas and apunyas he has.

00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:57.900
So, the importance of the Kali Yuga is that our Agni Pariksha takes place in this time.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.291
Apart from this Agni Pariksha, there is also a great blessing in this time.

00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:15.420
{Shree Mataji speaking in marathi .not to take photographs during speech}

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:26.871
Apart from this Agni Pariksha, there is also a great blessing in this time.

00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:37.452
Nala was told that when this time comes, thousands of people will get their Realization,

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:52.500
they will be emancipated, they will transform.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:59.809
Kali said,’ Those who are seeking God now in the hills and valleys, will ultimately find Him in Kaliyuga.’ This is the blessing.

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:05.679
In the middle of this time, we have come to this Punyapatnam

00:21:05.679 --> 00:21:10.916
where a person can understand the effect of punyas.

00:21:10.916 --> 00:21:17.686
But you may feel that here too the same Kaliyuga is present as everywhere else.

00:21:17.686 --> 00:21:30.671
It should be agreed upon that it is useless to talk about those things which are hidden and which are not seen.

00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:37.378
But now your awareness has opened up and when you use that awareness to know about things,

00:21:37.378 --> 00:21:46.439
then you will be surprised that in this Pune there have been works of such a depth

00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:50.975
as many saints have done penance and meditation over here.

00:21:50.975 --> 00:21:58.301
A great man like Tukaram came and lived near Pune.

00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:06.471
So this place attracts those people who seek punyas

00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:08.302
and who want to immerse themselves in punyas.

00:22:08.302 --> 00:22:12.775
It is not for those people who are seeking money or other material wealth.

00:22:12.775 --> 00:22:33.780
That is because when we collect money, power or fame, we are collecting it for ourselves.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.293
But punyas have an effect on others.

00:22:36.293 --> 00:22:49.420
For example if you have a lamp, you can polish it, make it out of gold or silver or anything else,

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:57.642
but all that is useless if there is no flame in it.

00:22:57.642 --> 00:23:01.551
Only when the flame is lit, the lamp is useful.

00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:09.465
In the same way, man is useless, whatever he is, until the light of the Spirit is present in him.

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:13.884
When the flame is lit in him, he becomes a punyavaan atma

00:23:13.884 --> 00:23:18.118
and the light emanating from him can enlighten thousands of lamps in the world.

00:23:18.118 --> 00:23:25.217
That’s why, the call for this puja in this punya nagari today is a very great thing.

00:23:25.217 --> 00:23:33.232
When the Shakti is distributed through punyas, then punyas get multiplied by thousands and become extremely powerful.

00:23:33.232 --> 00:23:39.442
Punyas have many powers but if the Shakti Herself is distributed through punyas then what a great thing it is!

00:23:39.442 --> 00:23:47.595
Until now people have seen that those who are full of punyas, are troubled by others,

00:23:47.595 --> 00:23:55.889
they don’t have any wealth, they don’t have any form of protection,

00:23:55.889 --> 00:23:58.967
they are always oppressed by others,

00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:04.971
any person can take them away, any person can fool him.

00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:14.340
But when the Shakti is distributed through punyas, then a tremendous energy flows from these punyas

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:18.340
that none can dare to touch a punyavaan person.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.170
If someone touches then he will know that there is some tremendous thing.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:30.914
In the same way, if a person feels that he can snatch money, cheat or trouble such a punyavaan person then he can’t do so.

00:24:30.914 --> 00:24:37.239
This is a very great blessing of Kaliyuga that this light can come

00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:43.336
and as soon as this light comes then no one can even touch you with the wrong intentions, no one can trouble you,

00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:50.407
no one can kill you, no one can snatch anything from you.

00:24:50.407 --> 00:24:52.662
You are completely protected.

00:24:52.662 --> 00:25:03.523
You will see that you will become so powerful that you can end any form of terror or problems just by standing up to it.

00:25:03.523 --> 00:25:12.248
So, the vehicle of today is the distribution of Shakti in punyas and this is what has to be achieved in today’s puja.

00:25:12.248 --> 00:25:18.316
Now everyone would have understood what I have told in Hindi.

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:25.700
Who didn’t understand?

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:38.500
Among languages, Marathi is quite good because it does not have…. (speech unclear).

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.971
Especially, I can explain Sahaja Yoga properly only in Marathi language.

00:25:41.971 --> 00:25:50.965
I told all those things in Hindi because, you will be surprised to know,

00:25:50.965 --> 00:25:53.432
Hindi people know quite less about our culture.

00:25:53.432 --> 00:25:55.383
It is not there in their language itself.

00:25:55.383 --> 00:25:57.921
They don’t know anything;

00:25:57.921 --> 00:25:59.484
they don’t know what punyas are.

00:25:59.484 --> 00:26:03.864
So, I talked a little in Hindi as you all know a lot about this.

00:26:03.864 --> 00:26:12.580
proverb in marathi ...

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:25.952
One thing I must say that the great teachings of the saints that we have got over here, is a very great blessing.

00:26:25.952 --> 00:26:30.719
Due to this blessing, we know what culture is,

00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:33.505
we know the meaning of punyas,

00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:39.980
we know what is good and what is bad, we know.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.112
We understand but do not recognize.

00:26:42.112 --> 00:26:46.558
Everyone understands that this is good and that is bad.

00:26:46.558 --> 00:26:49.454
We have done many punyas because of this.

00:26:49.454 --> 00:26:54.780
That’s why from those punyas, this punya nagari was born.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:04.883
But when we see others we feel that we Pune people are not as rich as the Mumbai people.

00:27:04.883 --> 00:27:11.236
Then we feel that Delhi people are richer than Mumbai people.

00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:24.061
As Delhi is the capital, we see that the people are more respectable. But all this is on the outside.

00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:30.325
We feel that they are very great people in comparison to us.

00:27:30.325 --> 00:27:33.480
But you are Punyavaan.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.876
However, I have seen many people in Pune who don’t believe in God.

00:27:38.876 --> 00:27:44.016
I have seen great intellectuals and vidvaans who don’t believe in God.

00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:52.795
These people have become so sophisticated and their minds are so spoilt that they say God does not exist.

00:27:52.795 --> 00:27:58.824
But if you have not seen God, you have not known Him, then how can you say so confidently that there is no God?

00:27:58.824 --> 00:28:00.920
First try to see.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:06.660
What are you going to lose? Nothing.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:13.043
So many people have talked about Him before you, were they all foolish and you are the only clever one?

00:28:13.043 --> 00:28:15.153
Without knowing Him, how can you conclude that He is not there?

00:28:15.153 --> 00:28:20.710
It is alright if someone says, ‘If you can prove that God exists then I am ready to believe in Him.’

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:29.674
But if someone says, ‘I don’t believe in God at all!’ then it is very difficult to make him understand.

00:28:29.674 --> 00:28:33.951
Many people of this sort are present in this Pune city.

00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:42.293
Nowhere else there are so many people who deny God so openly.

00:28:42.293 --> 00:28:48.054
You have so many Ganpatis, so many Marutis (Hanuman) but these people are the Maha-Marutis sitting on top!

00:28:48.054 --> 00:28:50.441
Oversmart people!

00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:57.075
These people feel that whatever they say is correct and that they are extremely clever people.

00:28:57.075 --> 00:29:01.973
They think that they know all the Shaastras and they conclude that all of it is false and meaningless.

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:18.873
So, where this punyas are spread like the fragrance of a lotus, there this ugliness has taken root.

00:29:18.873 --> 00:29:24.044
Due to this, people’s minds are full of illusions (Bhranti) in Pune.

00:29:24.044 --> 00:29:32.482
The people who don’t understand whether Dharma exists or not, God exists or not call themselves great leaders over here.

00:29:32.482 --> 00:29:36.653
They eat money all the same and do all the wrong things.

00:29:36.653 --> 00:29:41.276
But they have an excuse. They say that if we don’t have faith in God and in dharma,

00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:42.960
why should we take to righteousness?

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.549
We have become ‘modern.’

00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:48.938
Such people are seen more in Pune than in Mumbai.

00:29:48.938 --> 00:30:08.660
There are many people here who make fun of God, who deny God’s existence and who ridicule the people who believe in God.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:16.597
Now, a boat drowns if there is just one hole but if there are so many holes like this then what will happen to Pune?

00:30:16.597 --> 00:30:22.747
Some of the holes are caused by people who have a beggarly attitude.

00:30:22.747 --> 00:30:27.737
This beggarly attitude is seen in Sahaja Yoga also. Sometimes people are afraid of it.

00:30:27.737 --> 00:30:32.063
If Pune people have to be called then they say, ‘ Mataji, many people of this type will come, you see to it.’

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:34.763
They are afraid of this beggarly nature.

00:30:34.763 --> 00:30:38.121
I have experienced only this attitude.

00:30:38.121 --> 00:30:44.416
When we come here then people enjoy eating for free saying ‘Mother is doing everything, She is giving the money, why should we?’

00:30:44.416 --> 00:30:49.030
This attitude shows that the heart is not rich.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:31:02.119
The reason for this is that those who teach about punyas, who ask us to do punyas, who give big lectures are themselves after money.

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:08.026
So the rest of the people feel that this person is sitting here to teach me ‘BrahmAgnyaan’ but himself is beggarly by nature.

00:31:08.026 --> 00:31:12.605
So, all the citizens bear the results of both these things.

00:31:12.605 --> 00:31:17.383
The first is that those people who talk about Dharma are eating your money.

00:31:17.383 --> 00:31:26.672
They ask, ‘What do you want? A boy? Alright, pay me 100 rupees.

00:31:26.672 --> 00:31:29.736
But if you give 50 rupees, then you will get a girl child!’

00:31:29.736 --> 00:31:35.238
Then the ‘customer’ gives 108 rupees saying that he wants a boy.

00:31:35.238 --> 00:31:38.540
Why does he want a boy?

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.852
That’s because tomorrow he will earn money.

00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:43.521
Nobody sees the contribution of the daughter-in-law.

00:31:43.521 --> 00:31:48.465
They want a son just to get more money.

00:31:48.465 --> 00:31:53.292
Actually, the poverty increases because of that and people become poor by nature.

00:31:53.292 --> 00:32:00.622
Even then, now there are thousands of temples, and in every temple you have to give money to God?

00:32:00.622 --> 00:32:02.573
But does God understand money?

00:32:02.573 --> 00:32:09.100
Has He even seen money?

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:14.057
The priests say, ‘give four rupees to this God’, ‘give one rupee to that God.’

00:32:14.057 --> 00:32:21.336
‘If you want to do Puja, then you bring a big coconut out of which we will give you this small piece and the rest goes into our stomach!’

00:32:21.336 --> 00:32:34.059
By seeing these two sides, the faith in man’s mind, which should have depth, purity and trust,

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:39.395
only has the feeling that ‘Oh now I have done this thing in the temple and that is enough. There’s nothing more to it.’

00:32:39.395 --> 00:32:44.816
So because of this nature and this desire for money, man feels that it is alright to get money in any possible manner.

00:32:44.816 --> 00:32:51.417
Nobody thinks of self-respect.

00:32:51.417 --> 00:32:55.400
They think ‘what do we get out of self-respect? Why should we take to it?’

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:06.593
So because of this strange situation,

00:33:06.593 --> 00:33:19.431
we see from the nature of the people that in such a place full of punyas, we cannot see the saints.

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:21.467
We cannot see the qualities of a saint.

00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:24.189
We cannot see a person living like a saint.

00:33:24.189 --> 00:33:26.065
A saint has so much respect!

00:33:26.065 --> 00:33:32.637
Even to invite a saint to your house needs your penance of lives together.

00:33:32.637 --> 00:33:36.680
Otherwise, he won’t even come to your door.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.658
But this is for a true saint and not for the false ones.

00:33:39.658 --> 00:33:48.820
In order for him to come to your door, you should have some punyas.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:53.756
But the so-called saints who are roaming in the streets nowadays do not have the sainthood.

00:33:53.756 --> 00:34:01.590
This Punya Nagari is not called so because of its temples but because of its people.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:08.060
How many people have the qualities of a saint here?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:21.860
So the punyas come here based on the qualities and character of the people living here.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:27.050
So, if we earn the punyas of self-respect

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:32.995
and self-realization

00:34:32.995 --> 00:34:44.317
and if we grow in it then there is no difficulty over here.

00:34:44.317 --> 00:34:55.780
The land in Pune is very fertile and there is no land like it in the entire universe.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:00.228
But if there is land then plastic trees won’t come up.

00:35:00.228 --> 00:35:04.433
What is the use of planting plastic seeds?

00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:07.232
It is a very fertile land.

00:35:07.232 --> 00:35:10.511
Also, the heads of people are very fertile!

00:35:10.511 --> 00:35:14.019
It is so fertile that you don’t know what has gone out of it and you have to be told about it.

00:35:14.019 --> 00:35:17.186
People say, ‘don’t believe in God’, ‘who is God?’ etc.

00:35:17.186 --> 00:35:25.647
All such extremely nonsensical things have come up over here.

00:35:25.647 --> 00:35:28.840
Some people make fun of God as if they are very great.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:33.340
They don’t have any respect for Him.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:40.252
The second kind of people is of those who have earned so much money in the name of dharma

00:35:40.252 --> 00:35:44.525
and who have misled so many people.

00:35:44.525 --> 00:35:49.081
I have seen many varieties of people over here.

00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:56.020
The first time I came to Pune, there were many people and this woman was also there.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.746
A bhoot came into her and immediately she started shouting.

00:35:58.746 --> 00:36:01.105
Immediately, all the women ran to apply kumkum on her.

00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:06.389
It was the first time I saw ladies running to put kumkum on a woman in whom a bhoot had come.

00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:08.555
They then started falling at her feet.

00:36:08.555 --> 00:36:11.916
Luckily, the lights went out at that time

00:36:11.916 --> 00:36:13.753
and I came out from the back door.

00:36:13.753 --> 00:36:15.144
What could I have explained to them?

00:36:15.144 --> 00:36:19.930
So this is a greater stupidity than the other kinds.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:28.420
People see that something has come into her body and assume that it is the Devi.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.562
Let me ask you, is it so easy for the Devi to come into anyone’s body? It is extremely difficult.

00:36:31.562 --> 00:36:34.361
Is there any kind of body that can bear the Devi?

00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:44.674
They say that the Devi has come in her body and later if you see then this ‘devi’ is washing utensils, washing clothes and stealing money!

00:36:44.674 --> 00:36:47.444
How can Devi come into the body of such a person?

00:36:47.444 --> 00:36:53.480
You can call this ignorance or innocence but I would call this extreme stupidity.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:37:04.187
Due to this, the people are not only misled but they are under an illusion.

00:37:04.187 --> 00:37:15.331
There are many people here in whose body the Devi comes and they faint when they come in front of Me.

00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:18.128
It had become difficult to conduct programs.

00:37:18.128 --> 00:37:21.049
I said,’ How did so many bhoots come into this Punya Nagari?’

00:37:21.049 --> 00:37:28.160
so an so fellow ..and then what did that fellow do ..?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.338
No, just gave me embers

00:37:29.338 --> 00:37:33.220
What you did, I ate it

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:40.706
That is, the chance of what is called women's behavior and Brahmin behavior has been drowned in Pune.

00:37:40.706 --> 00:37:44.395
Then you made this decision about religion

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:48.660
And do not talk about the god.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:54.817
Because being very wise about the things of God, one cannot say that God does not exist

00:37:54.817 --> 00:37:56.370
science is everything.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:03.482
Now Nardikar is from Pune

00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:13.330
He said that there is intelligence in the relationship that Shrushti works with

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:20.300
He told the first thing  that he has a head.He is a scientist

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.069
When he is from Pune, thats why this thing came to his head.

00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:27.219
But how far will the scientist go?

00:38:27.219 --> 00:38:36.948
If you want to save a tree from the outside, if you water it, will the water go inside?

00:38:36.948 --> 00:38:41.300
If water is given to a flower, will it go inside? will not go

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.298
You should water it at the root.

00:38:44.298 --> 00:38:49.863
And you have to get down to add water to its term

00:38:49.863 --> 00:38:52.585
And for that you have to go subtle too.

00:38:52.585 --> 00:38:57.395
Anything you do without that subtlety is out there.

00:38:57.395 --> 00:38:59.037
everything will be for outside.

00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:04.143
But it is so out of place that the virtuous cannot be found.

00:39:04.143 --> 00:39:13.821
Then it happened that it should be said in some arrangement that even if the relationship is said to be the kingdom of bhoots, it can be arranged.

00:39:13.821 --> 00:39:18.980
If it is said of Satan, it can happen to arranged. It can  be easily.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:25.980
But still this land is so hard that if anyone comes it will drive them away, throws them, and crushes them.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.655
This is the characteristic of this land.

00:39:28.655 --> 00:39:43.725
But despite this, if we remember that we are born in a great land that is virtuous in the universe.

00:39:43.725 --> 00:39:49.580
Then what can be richer than this?What will be the magnitude on this?

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.370
What can be more respect than this?

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:59.464
your soil of Pune is so important, people have taken the  Pune soil, you don't know.

00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:06.311
When we built that ashram in London, they brought soil there, I asked, where did they bring this soil from? Said,we brought soil from Pune.

00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:10.134
They have such a wisdom  and there is no God here like the Most Wise.

00:40:10.134 --> 00:40:16.050
And they put that soil.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:25.887
No matter how much I explain, no matter how much I say, you will say, Mother, give me the revelation, then given the revelation.

00:40:25.887 --> 00:40:30.634
Because this is what you see in the middle of these things, because these are lies

00:40:30.634 --> 00:40:33.441
Is this outside  or its gross?

00:40:33.441 --> 00:40:35.554
Subtlety is needed to see subtlety.

00:40:35.554 --> 00:40:40.420
If you are subtle you will know what I mean.Therefore, should be subtle.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.085
That's when I said that chaitanya must flow in this holy city.

00:40:45.085 --> 00:40:52.429
Now the question of money, that thought should be left.

00:40:52.429 --> 00:40:57.700
Lakshmi coves with Shakti. Will get for sure.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:04.460
But if you say that we have come to worship for Lakshmi (money), you will not get anything.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:11.300
Lakshmi's prasad is easily available to you automatically and many have got it.

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:12.100
many have Got this.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.340
But, it should be noted that ,what we came here to get?

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:24.087
I came to take shakti, in shakti  there is shakti of all kinds.

00:41:24.087 --> 00:41:34.133
Not just lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi, Not just Sarawati,but Mahasaraswati, not just kali but Mahakali.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:36.381
You have come here to get all this.

00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:48.780
When the form of Atma manifests in these three forces, these three superpowers also awaken in you.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:54.722
Vibrations of consciousness are flowing through your hands.

00:41:54.722 --> 00:41:58.343
Just raising your hand like this  you give realisation to people.

00:41:58.343 --> 00:42:06.009
What will people say? Not possible
How can you raise your hand like this, and you give realisation , it is not possible.

00:42:06.009 --> 00:42:10.093
Then you also start to feel this disbelief.

00:42:10.093 --> 00:42:15.169
Really, we raised our hands like this, what is happening with our hands,this  is special.

00:42:15.169 --> 00:42:17.355
It means you don't value yourself yet.

00:42:17.355 --> 00:42:21.874
You don't understand what you got.

00:42:21.874 --> 00:42:23.979
How great  are you?

00:42:23.979 --> 00:42:36.768
Kundalini in your hand Just like Ganapati has this power in your hand, you have this power in your hand that just by raising your hand, the Kundalini is awakened.

00:42:36.768 --> 00:42:43.020
So who are we?This should be noted first.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:48.132
If you realize who we are and we are yogis,

00:42:48.132 --> 00:43:02.260
We have a power that people never had before. Look how many yogis are there in the world today? Have you heard of anyone awakening Kundalini somewhere?

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.380
but you do wake up the kundalini. you are giving the realisation to people.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.260
So how is it happening?

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:19.528
But if we give priority to one point that we are yogis, the rest of the points automatically fit in.

00:43:19.528 --> 00:43:23.900
But the priority is on other things.This is a hassle.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:35.971
If you leave it and prefer only one that we are yogis, we should live like a yogi and act like a saints.

00:43:35.971 --> 00:43:42.834
In such a heart, if a thought is kept, the Kundalini Shakti that is there will take you anywhere.

00:43:42.834 --> 00:43:54.686
Because you have got it easily
Other people have to work hard to get it.

00:43:54.686 --> 00:44:03.740
If a person walks on the road with special attention, one glance at him awakens his kundalini.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:12.540
This is true but as easy as it gets,It is not valued as much.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:21.980
don't know the vaue of it. You don't know the value because you get the thing without paying for it, without effort.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.419
And you don't know the value of yourself.

00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:32.598
If we know your own worth and know your own responsibility, you will realize that you are yogis.

00:44:32.598 --> 00:44:39.218
Mother has gone to spear the whole world and you are my hands.

00:44:39.218 --> 00:44:41.895
This work should be done by You.

00:44:41.895 --> 00:44:45.602
And how are you doing?

00:44:45.602 --> 00:44:52.537
So first of all we need loyalty, we need sincerity,

00:44:52.537 --> 00:44:58.296
How can a person who has no loyalty and is superstitious get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:58.296 --> 00:45:08.420
Loyalty is needed that we are yogis,with full loyalty we believe in ourselves we can do this work.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.420
There is nothing egoistic about Kundalini flowing through our hands

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.545
If you say we are Hindu,Muslims, Christians then this is a lie.

00:45:16.545 --> 00:45:20.601
It is a certificate affixed to something external.

00:45:20.601 --> 00:45:23.003
You can be anyone.

00:45:23.003 --> 00:45:28.140
But what is true is that you are a yogi and that is your true caste.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.596
This is your true religion.

00:45:30.596 --> 00:45:32.470
This is your true personality.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:42.055
And having complete faith in it, we should sincerely think that we do not want anything beyond this.

00:45:42.055 --> 00:45:46.957
We don't want anything beyond what we want to get.

00:45:46.957 --> 00:45:52.633
Then you get everything in it, you are deep in it, in its depthness, you get everything in its answer.

00:45:52.633 --> 00:45:59.685
But still, my mother is like this,my sister is like this,this happened to my son.

00:45:59.685 --> 00:46:07.551
Otherwise, if we want this property, please fix it for my brother, mother, and for my uncle.

00:46:07.551 --> 00:46:09.523
That is the question of complexity.

00:46:09.523 --> 00:46:11.326
Well the old sahaja yogis is  little better now.

00:46:11.326 --> 00:46:14.980
Then the second wave came again and they started the same way.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:22.178
My mother is not well, my father is not well, everyone has a mother and father,but that is fine in a sense.

00:46:22.178 --> 00:46:25.057
But for Sahaja Yoga sometimes creates many drawbacks.

00:46:25.057 --> 00:46:27.239
Because all goals are different.

00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:30.190
If you get well, your parents will all get well.

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:37.039
But you are not ready to heal yourself and you want Mother to heal everyone.

00:46:37.039 --> 00:46:45.750
That is, these things are so deep that we should remember that we are deep or not?

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.087
Do you have any depth or not?

00:46:48.087 --> 00:46:50.116
Otherwise we are going to perish.

00:46:50.116 --> 00:47:02.680
If you want to descend into a well, you should also know its full extent.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:06.926
If you can't reach, why go to the well, you will run out.

00:47:06.926 --> 00:47:19.542
Am I the kind of person I need to get down to that depth?

00:47:19.542 --> 00:47:22.808
Have I got it?

00:47:22.808 --> 00:47:24.853
Have I earned it?

00:47:24.853 --> 00:47:29.962
But no, heal your mother, oh, what will you gain by healing your mother?

00:47:29.962 --> 00:47:31.600
We only understand selfishness.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.120
What did you get? If your mother does well, she will be angry again as soon as she wakes up.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.967
Take a cover over your head or else do this and do that.

00:47:38.967 --> 00:47:45.260
If there is something for the women, why not treat the father?

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.835
Will hurt you again.

00:47:46.835 --> 00:47:58.390
I don't mean to give, but what I have to say is that it is very superficial and if you look at it, it becomes such a problem

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:06.483
But deep down It should be that I am my own father, I am my own mother, I am everything.

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:09.417
If everyone is in you, everyone will be fine.

00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:17.511
Everyone lives in your body. If you get well, will it get well or not?

00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:26.853
So don't lose so much by setting your mind on such a superficial things.

00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:31.656
For one, being born in the city of Pune must have earned so much of punya.

00:48:31.656 --> 00:48:39.493
After earning so much punya, you were born in this virtuous city and want to spend it now after being born here?

00:48:39.493 --> 00:48:46.024
And in the matter of this religion also the head should be kept in mind

00:48:46.024 --> 00:48:47.625
what religion do you call this?All his superficial things.

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:54.713
That religion is true in which man finds peace.

00:48:54.713 --> 00:48:57.484
That religion is true in which man finds truth.

00:48:57.484 --> 00:49:05.580
That religion is true in which man becomes a virtuous soul and spreads love everywhere.That is true religion

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.700
The rest of the religions are false and all the religions of today are better than one another.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:15.023
Even till today I have never met a Dharma Guru who is self-realized.

00:49:15.023 --> 00:49:22.020
Say we are religious gurus, why? And the Kundalini is sitting down there what kind of religious guru are you?

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:28.382
In which religion it is said that you can become guru  without self-realization?

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:32.689
Such unrighteous people today have come above religion and call themselves righteous.

00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:34.654
That righteousness is of no use.

00:49:34.654 --> 00:49:42.599
They just made a human being a cruel monstrosity.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:48.780
I can see that goodness will never come out of it.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:51.095
This is the type of religious people these days.

00:49:51.095 --> 00:49:57.821
Look here, you see the people of England drinking alcohol.

00:49:57.821 --> 00:50:02.341
why say,We drank alcohol because we wanted to go to church. what is that?

00:50:02.341 --> 00:50:09.739
Why look at others, look at your own form of Hinduism,

00:50:09.739 --> 00:50:13.925
Later, there are more Christian people who have gone out completely.

00:50:13.925 --> 00:50:19.968
Muslims, they were fighting, all over the world they are fighting.

00:50:19.968 --> 00:50:22.207
Sikh people, nonsense there too.

00:50:22.207 --> 00:50:28.900
In whose religion tell me people are perfectly fine.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.886
Why do you want to join those fools?

00:50:30.886 --> 00:50:34.504
Has anyone given peace to your heart?

00:50:34.504 --> 00:50:44.420
If this is the case in all religions, it is said that all religion is the refuge of the mother of all religions, only for this.( धर्म सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरण व्रज )

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:49.546
One should take that , which is true religion.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:58.980
Krishna was no less that he had grown now, you all know that. and what was Ram ?

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.112
All such incarnation took place.

00:51:03.112 --> 00:51:06.787
Mohammad Saheb was not less?
Nanak Saheb was not less?

00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:13.297
But their place is kept somewhere by all, all and only, I am not ready to support any religion.

00:51:13.297 --> 00:51:15.258
Everyone is watched.

00:51:15.258 --> 00:51:18.100
Everyone is a fool.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:27.048
They do foolish things in the name of God and they are going to get such share at birth, no need to go far for it.

00:51:27.048 --> 00:51:31.393
That,Jewish is another example.

00:51:31.393 --> 00:51:32.769
A Muslim is the third pattern.

00:51:32.769 --> 00:51:34.491
Christians are the fourth pattern.

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:40.544
Hindus are the second pattern, one by one, that Jains, don't ask what it is.

00:51:40.544 --> 00:51:51.770
All this religion has spread and monetized so much lies and falsehoods.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:52:04.620
And something else, now among the Muslims is that you have to pray five times, just pray.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.736
And do whatever business you want after that.

00:52:06.736 --> 00:52:13.851
They are fighting among themselves, this country is fighting with him, that country is fighting with him.Not easy to say.

00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:22.734
Mohammad Saheb has said that such a time will come and he calls it Qayama.

00:52:22.734 --> 00:52:27.515
Qayama means a time when man will be resurrected.

00:52:27.515 --> 00:52:33.820
When the time of the resurrection comes, their hands and feet will speak and testify when the time of the resurrection comes.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.972
This Sahaj Yoga has explained everything  but to all  these fools.

00:52:36.972 --> 00:52:41.300
Which Muslim will come to you? have came now a few.

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.012
This is the kind of religion we have screwed up.

00:52:45.012 --> 00:52:54.660
Go to the temple and see these days, there was a boy who used to take drugs for months. Where did you get this drugs in India?

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.916
In the temple of Mahalakshmi, there is a priest he is giving drugs to that boy.What is this?

00:52:55.916 --> 00:53:05.620
This is truth.yes , this is truth.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.750
In the temple of Mahalakshmi , just imagine.

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:12.383
Now tell where to keep this priest, where to keep?

00:53:12.383 --> 00:53:18.540
There is no place for such people in hell, something else has to be made for them

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:25.160
Sitting in Mahalakshmi's temple, smoking drugs and selling it.
No police will go to the temple of Mahalakshmi, he knows that.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:30.548
If he goes, then they will say against him that you have come to our temple.

00:53:30.548 --> 00:53:34.009
But by sitting in the temple, taking drugs is all right for them.

00:53:34.009 --> 00:53:39.580
Many people said that God is not the source of all such devoutness

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.460
There is no religion for anyone because of  unreligiousmess of others.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:48.230
If anyone earns money in the name of God, then there is no God?

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:55.255
So,you, sahaja yogis  have to get down very deep in your ascent.

00:53:55.255 --> 00:54:01.698
Your life should be such that people should say that this is the true religion among the true religious.

00:54:01.698 --> 00:54:06.532
We have understood Dharma in this sahaja yoga.

00:54:06.532 --> 00:54:10.683
In Sahaja Yoga we understood what religion is?

00:54:10.683 --> 00:54:17.980
Self realisation is an event that has happened in us, there is nothing false,

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:23.707
But even for to say that, you have to go deep in your ascent.

00:54:23.707 --> 00:54:26.587
You must deepen.

00:54:26.587 --> 00:54:37.756
If you don't bring that depth, then people will say in front of people, let it be, we have seen how your Sahaj Yogis are.

00:54:37.756 --> 00:54:50.784
So everyone should aim at those key points, don't show off at all.

00:54:50.784 --> 00:54:53.738
I understand everyone.

00:54:53.738 --> 00:54:58.195
Puja should be attended by pure hearted people. If not, don't sit.

00:54:58.195 --> 00:54:59.705
Sit with a pure heart.

00:54:59.705 --> 00:55:03.132
what is the use of working so hard?

00:55:03.132 --> 00:55:06.118
If you have a clouded heart, what will be my reflection in it?

00:55:06.118 --> 00:55:09.589
Cleanse your heart.

00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:16.100
Just purify the heart and sit in love and get it.

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.820
You are here to get what you want.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:22.420
Remember that you have not come here to waste your time anywhere

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:31.202
You have come here to awaken the true religion among us and to advance the truth among us.

00:55:31.202 --> 00:55:37.614
Today's worship of Shakti is special because what we call Shakti at this time is Gauri Swaroop.

00:55:37.614 --> 00:55:44.660
Gauri is literally Kundalini in virginity.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:51.180
You have worshiped her in the state of virginity, and virginity means innocence.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:57.589
Her awakening is like Ganapati, Shakti's virgin state is the boon of Ganapati.

00:55:57.589 --> 00:56:11.188
Then, thinking like this in your heart, say how pure it is, or let it be completely rooted in us.

00:56:11.188 --> 00:56:14.040
We must be clean from the inside out.

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.329
Let us worship in that deep state today.
