00:08.440 --> 00:11.939
So now we come to the left
side then to the right side.

00:12.240 --> 00:18.862
Right side is the action, the power of action,
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

00:20.340 --> 00:25.200
When you want to enact your desire,

00:25.980 --> 00:32.294
manifest it, then you use this action
power, Iccha Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

00:32.294 --> 00:36.360
Now this power works mainly
through this second center,

00:36.360 --> 00:40.820
or we call it the third center, actually it
is the third because the second one is that.

00:40.980 --> 00:48.420
This center is called as Swadishthana and
this center has got six, you can see six

00:49.440 --> 00:51.900
plexuses, it’s like the Star of David.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.480
Moses preached something, and
Jews are doing something else.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.740
Christ preached something, and
Christians are doing something else.

01:04.740 --> 01:10.720
Adi Shankaracharya taught something,
and Hindus are doing just the opposite.

01:11.100 --> 01:14.220
Mohammed taught something, and
they did just the opposite.

01:14.220 --> 01:18.300
It’s not only in religion, in every
way you see how we are perverted.

01:18.300 --> 01:29.147
Like this center is used for converting the
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

01:29.232 --> 01:32.502
Now, do we realize that our brain is made of fat?

01:32.640 --> 01:35.880
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.220
Now there’s a general principle in this country

01:38.220 --> 01:42.120
that you should not use any
butter, which is very wrong.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.200
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

01:49.200 --> 01:52.204
I mean where will you get it,
it’s completely drained out.

01:52.260 --> 01:56.340
You use your brain so much, so much so,

01:56.340 --> 02:02.580
that this poor center has to work only for
your thinking which has no productivity.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.620
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,
thinking; two horns come out of your head of

02:07.620 --> 02:12.480
thinking; still you are thinking, and they
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.432
And what are you thinking, what
have you got out of your thinking?

02:16.800 --> 02:25.500
This right side is the one which is our
five elements also, five elements within us.

02:25.500 --> 02:33.240
So when we started discovering what
is the essence of the five elements,

02:34.080 --> 02:37.500
in India we started the Vedas
thousands of years back,

02:37.500 --> 02:41.940
and the effect of that is shown now, is
the science, you discovered, the science.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.457
That you understood how to
master these five elements.
