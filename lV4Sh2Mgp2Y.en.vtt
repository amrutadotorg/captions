00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.939
So now we come to the left&nbsp;
side then to the right side.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.862
Right side is the action, the power of action,&nbsp;
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.200
When you want to enact your desire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.294
manifest it, then you use this action&nbsp;
power, Iccha Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:36.360
Now this power works mainly&nbsp;
through this second center,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.820
or we call it the third center, actually it&nbsp;
is the third because the second one is that.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.420
This center is called as Swadishthana and&nbsp;
this center has got six, you can see six&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.900
plexuses, it’s like the Star of David.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.480
Moses preached something, and&nbsp;
Jews are doing something else.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.740
Christ preached something, and&nbsp;
Christians are doing something else.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.720
Adi Shankaracharya taught something,&nbsp;
and Hindus are doing just the opposite.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
Mohammed taught something, and&nbsp;
they did just the opposite.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.300
It’s not only in religion, in every&nbsp;
way you see how we are perverted.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:29.147
Like this center is used for converting the&nbsp;
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:32.502
Now, do we realize that our brain is made of fat?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.220
Now there’s a general principle in this country&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.120
that you should not use any&nbsp;
butter, which is very wrong.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.200
When you don’t use any butter how are you&nbsp;
going to supply this brain with something,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.204
I mean where will you get it,&nbsp;
it’s completely drained out.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.340
You use your brain so much, so much so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.580
that this poor center has to work only for&nbsp;
your thinking which has no productivity.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.620
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,&nbsp;
thinking; two horns come out of your head of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.480
thinking; still you are thinking, and they&nbsp;
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.432
And what are you thinking, what&nbsp;
have you got out of your thinking?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.500
This right side is the one which is our&nbsp;
five elements also, five elements within us.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.240
So when we started discovering what&nbsp;
is the essence of the five elements,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.500
in India we started the Vedas&nbsp;
thousands of years back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.940
and the effect of that is shown now, is&nbsp;
the science, you discovered, the science.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.457
That you understood how to&nbsp;
master these five elements.
