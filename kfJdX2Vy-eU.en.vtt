00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:36.971
According to the calendar,

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:46.731
this year there are ten days of Navaratri,

00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:48.931
not of nine.

00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:53.971
Nine are the days,

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.691
in the night,

00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:02.971
when the Goddess had to fight the demons

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:12.211
and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:18.451
On one side,

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.131
She was ocean of love and compassion,

00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.171
and on the other side,

00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:31.331
She was protecting them like a tigress.

00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.731
Because the times

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:42.171
were such that nobody could meditate,

00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.291
nobody could take the name of God,

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:49.851
nobody could think even of Self-Realisation.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.291
But those who are sitting here today,

00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.491
you have been there also in those days,

00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:05.011
and you were all saved for today, for this day,

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:10.531
so that you can achieve your Self Realisation.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.251
The form of the Goddess in those days

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:17.771
was not Maya Swarupi.

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:21.611
She was in Her real form,

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.971
and that created a great awe,

00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.411
even among the disciples.

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.251
So the question of giving them

00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:37.011
Self Realisation was not there.

00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.091
First of all, they were to be saved.

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.571
So like nine months the mother has to keep the child

00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.131
in her womb, for these nine months,

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:50.011
or you can say nine yugas, nine times,

00:03:50.211 --> 00:03:52.411
you all have been saved properly,

00:03:52.651 --> 00:04:01.531
and on the tenth month you are given your birth.

00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:07.531
Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months.

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:09.811
So we had to wait

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.771
for some time till it matures.

00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.051
Now the tenth Navaratri today

00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:20.251
is to celebrate actually the Adi Shakti.

00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:25.291
So today we are really going to worship the Adi Shakti.

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:29.611
On one side the Adi Shakti is Mahakali,

00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.531
on the other side, She is Mahasaraswati,

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.211
in the centre She is Mahalakshmi,

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.571
and also She is the Amba,

00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:45.811
the One Who is the Kundalini.

00:04:47.451 --> 00:04:50.171
But She is also beyond that.

00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:52.011
She's parashakti;

00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.131
She's beyond all the powers.

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.451
Because She is the generator of power.

00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:01.531
So, She has to be beyond all that.

00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:05.331
So today when we are worshipping Her,

00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.491
we have to worship Her in all these forms.

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:13.011
So you understand that the tenth day

00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.331
that we are having Navaratri for the first time

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:18.971
in the calendar is because

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:23.891
today is the day when we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:27.971
Adi Shakti was never worshipped before, never.

00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:32.091
But, this time, when I went to Calcutta,

00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:38.011
I told them that "You better worship Adi Shakti today."

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.091
And they were surprised,

00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.371
"Why today Mother is asking

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.171
for Adi Shakti to be worshipped?"

00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.451
So when I went back to Poona,

00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.531
they told Me that Adi Shakti, as you know,

00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.651
is the Saptashringi,

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:58.411
means the One with seven peaks.

00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:00.411
She rests on the seven peaks,

00:06:00.611 --> 00:06:06.371
means on the Sahasrara, on the seven, seven chakras.

00:06:06.571 --> 00:06:09.371
She rules all the seven chakras.

00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:16.531
They told me that when we had the puja in Calcutta,

00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.931
same time, that's the only time

00:06:20.131 --> 00:06:23.011
when those who follow Saptashringi,

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:28.171
which are very few people, all of them come there,

00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:32.851
and there they come, first of all

00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:37.051
the people from Her mother's side come down.

00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:40.011
So the mother's side of the Adi Shakti

00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:45.131
are regarded as Vaishnavites, the one who follow Vishnu.

00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:48.011
So they come first there to worship Her,

00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.251
and then the father-in-law's side,

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.291
that is Shiva's side, comes in, Sadashiva's side.

00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:58.411
That's exactly that time when we had the puja.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:02.131
They have these two groups together to worship.

00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:08.091
So now we have among ourselves people of two types.

00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:12.091
One are, we can call the one who worship Brahmadeva

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:14.011
on the right hand side,

00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:18.451
and the people who worship Shiva on the left hand side.

00:07:21.451 --> 00:07:25.051
Both sides have to meet at a point,

00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:27.171
and that point has come,

00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:29.211
that we have to worship

00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:34.411
the complete integrated form of all these powers,

00:07:35.051 --> 00:07:38.251
which has manifested within us.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.571
Now when they say there is only one God,

00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:42.451
all right there is one God.

00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:44.731
But one God has got a head,

00:07:45.091 --> 00:07:47.051
He's got His liver,

00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:49.171
He's got His stomach,

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:50.811
He's got His nose.

00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:52.451
He's got everything.

00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:55.411
Just like as human beings are.

00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.051
Because they say so,

00:07:57.291 --> 00:08:00.011
that God made human beings in their own image.

00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:02.691
So then He has different parts in the bodies,

00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:05.371
and He has to run those different parts.

00:08:05.571 --> 00:08:07.291
And for these different parts,

00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:09.131
He has to have Deities,

00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:11.411
and these Deities are to be understood.

00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:14.131
And unless und until you understand

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.851
and worship those Deities,

00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:19.491
you cannot awaken those Deities within yourself.

00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:23.811
But they all are part and parcel of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.331
Are completely under the control of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:33.811
Yesterday you heard about the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.971
It's like

00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:45.891
a tortoise takes his whole body inside his shell,

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.811
in the same way

00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:51.971
I have withdrawn all these powers within Myself.

00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:58.011
I mean, you cannot discover them easily.

00:08:58.251 --> 00:09:00.411
You cannot find them out easily.

00:09:00.611 --> 00:09:03.091
Except for these modern cameras,

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:06.491
which are trying to cheat us.

00:09:06.731 --> 00:09:11.731
They are the ones who are giving My forms and things to you.

00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:17.531
Because there is light

00:09:18.651 --> 00:09:21.771
in these vibrations,

00:09:21.971 --> 00:09:24.731
and when these vibrations are emitted,

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:29.851
you start seeing them in these cameras,

00:09:30.051 --> 00:09:32.371
even if they may not be very sensitive,

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:35.491
but somehow people catch it.

00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:40.091
There have been so many miraculous photographs, as you know.

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:42.811
One photograph you must have seen

00:09:43.091 --> 00:09:46.131
where Shri Ganesha Himself is standing behind Me.

00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:49.491
Now you don't see anyone standing just now here.

00:09:50.411 --> 00:09:54.411
But you don't know what's happening.

00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:58.771
And this is what one has to understand,

00:09:59.171 --> 00:10:06.131
That we have entered into a new realm of God's magic.

00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:10.331
And His magic works, in so many ways.

00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:18.051
Of course, sometimes, you also get lost.

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:26.051
Because of your previous problems you get dragged down.

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.851
You get tempted.

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:36.291
Sometimes you get also dominated

00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:41.451
by negative forces and you fall down.

00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:46.011
And this is a very sad thing

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:49.251
that should happen to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:53.011
Because perhaps you do not know your past,

00:10:53.211 --> 00:10:57.131
and you do not know how you have struggled,

00:10:57.611 --> 00:11:03.091
how you have worked hard to come up to this level.

00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:05.771
And after coming to this level,

00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:09.331
if you do not try to go higher,

00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:12.491
then

00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:18.411
either you'll be stuck on the same place,

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:22.691
or maybe that you may be thrown down.

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:28.731
So for you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:34.451
you are not a wife, husband, mother, father,

00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:36.771
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:38.891
Like I'm the Adi Shakti,

00:11:39.091 --> 00:11:41.371
like that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:41.771 --> 00:11:45.931
So "My main job now is to give realisation to others.

00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:51.051
And because all My relationships are already fixed properly,

00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:56.011
I don't have to worry about any Deity, about any God,

00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.091
They all work out very efficiently, everything."

00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:04.651
Now the description yesterday as you read of the Goddess,

00:12:04.851 --> 00:12:07.291
that Her hands were throwing

00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.011
all the arrows with such a speed that

00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:13.091
as if one felt that She was dancing.

00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:16.531
Is a fact, no doubt,

00:12:16.971 --> 00:12:18.811
but you don't see that.

00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:25.011
You cannot see that every hair of Mine is like an arrow.

00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:30.171
And it works so tremendously.

00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:34.571
But to you I'm just sitting here quietly,

00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:37.451
just like you as you are sitting.

00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:39.931
But it's not so.

00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:42.131
It's something much more.

00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:48.051
Now when they show a lion or a tiger,

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:50.731
as My vahana,

00:12:51.091 --> 00:12:54.251
then you have to understand that they show,

00:12:54.571 --> 00:12:56.051
actually they are.

00:12:56.251 --> 00:12:57.891
Actually they are.

00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.971
It's not that they are symbolically, actually they are.

00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:04.091
So the dignity of a tiger,

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.971
I have told you many a times how dignified it is.

00:13:07.171 --> 00:13:11.291
Because I sit on him, he's so dignified.

00:13:11.611 --> 00:13:15.531
If he has to eat the meat, he'll kill one cow or anything,

00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.331
eat the meat, leave it for others.

00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:20.731
It's so dignified.

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:23.571
And once a month he eats.

00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:30.411
So even to get a vahana of this kind,

00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:34.571
this was to be evolved from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:13:35.691 --> 00:13:38.611
Otherwise he would not have been here.

00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:43.291
In the same way you are evolved,

00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:47.451
and in you are these, all these vahanas also there.

00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.411
And they work out

00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:54.491
very quickly all that you want.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.291
You desire something;

00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:02.091
you'll be surprised immediately you'll find it works out.

00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:06.251
You ask for something, immediately it works out.

00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:13.011
But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.971
When I say Sahaj Yog,

00:14:15.171 --> 00:14:21.451
you know that is the yoga of your attention with My Feet.

00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:23.811
That's what it is.

00:14:28.611 --> 00:14:31.451
But if you are still moving with your egos

00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:35.091
and if you are still thinking on those lines

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:41.251
that "We are something and we can start our own Sahaj Yog,

00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:43.491
we can work out this way and that way,"

00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:46.251
or "My wife is like that, my child is like that,

00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:48.291
my husband is like that."

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.331
You have to give up all these problems on one side.

00:14:53.251 --> 00:14:57.171
Otherwise, you will not ascend.

00:14:58.691 --> 00:15:01.251
It was not difficult for Me to give you Realisation,

00:15:01.451 --> 00:15:03.651
because you were just ready for that.

00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:07.931
But to keep your light on, you have to work hard.

00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:10.931
Now tiger remains at its own position.

00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:12.731
He doesn't change.

00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:15.531
Lion remains at his own position,

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:18.011
and they are all available, all the time,

00:15:18.211 --> 00:15:19.691
in their own position.

00:15:19.891 --> 00:15:22.851
All the Devatas and Gods are in Their own positions

00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:26.211
with Their own qualities, They are there.

00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:31.331
Nowhere, none of these Gods have described that

00:15:31.531 --> 00:15:35.371
They give you moksha. Except for the Goddess.

00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:39.211
She's the only One who gives you Realisation.

00:15:39.811 --> 00:15:43.531
Because She's in charge of all the seven chakras.

00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:46.251
She holds all these seven chakras,

00:15:46.451 --> 00:15:50.331
and on these seven chakras She can work it out.

00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:54.491
So there's a big history,

00:15:54.691 --> 00:16:01.731
evolution of all those things even in the Virata's body,

00:16:02.011 --> 00:16:04.491
and also in you people.

00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:07.491
So you have to cope with it.

00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:09.731
If you cannot cope with it,

00:16:09.931 --> 00:16:12.411
then it won't work out.

00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:17.891
Now the problems we have, in the West, as you know,

00:16:18.131 --> 00:16:19.811
are stupid problems

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:24.011
which are not suitable to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:29.491
Attachment.

00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:31.891
First they were not attached to their wives

00:16:32.091 --> 00:16:35.131
or to their children, now they're attached like glue.

00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:43.971
I do not say you give up your children or your wife,

00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:48.211
but your attachment should be with Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:51.651
Once the blessings of Sahaja Yoga comes to you,

00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:54.091
they will flow to your children,

00:16:54.331 --> 00:16:56.691
to your wife, to everyone, to your country,

00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.931
to the whole world.

00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:03.651
Now supposing this is the attachment,

00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:06.211
a very simple electrical thing.

00:17:07.571 --> 00:17:10.291
So if its attachment is not to the mains,

00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:13.171
and anywhere else, what's the use?

00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:16.491
It cannot give electricity to anybody else.

00:17:18.411 --> 00:17:20.171
Is a simple logic,

00:17:20.371 --> 00:17:24.211
that you should be attached to the source of energy first.

00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:26.451
Simple logic.

00:17:28.051 --> 00:17:30.971
And then, that energy can flow to others.

00:17:31.171 --> 00:17:33.451
If you yourself you are not attached

00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:36.331
to that source of energy,

00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:41.491
how can that power flow anywhere?

00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:49.091
It's a simple thing we do not understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.051
And so our attachments

00:17:52.851 --> 00:17:57.851
start getting rusted and we don't understand

00:17:58.091 --> 00:18:00.091
what has happened to us.

00:18:00.291 --> 00:18:03.891
You are not attached to the main source!

00:18:07.091 --> 00:18:10.371
And that's the only attachment you need.

00:18:10.851 --> 00:18:16.171
And then the whole thing will flow to the other end.

00:18:17.491 --> 00:18:21.171
So, we have these kinds of attachments.

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:28.451
Then we are attached to so many miserable things we like,

00:18:28.691 --> 00:18:31.051
which make us miserable.

00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:43.051
For example, we are attached, to say,

00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:49.171
some sort of a stupid entrepreneur fashion.

00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:52.371
We're attached to it.

00:18:54.131 --> 00:18:56.851
Whether it is in Sahaj culture or not,

00:18:57.051 --> 00:18:59.851
we are attached to it.

00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:08.051
And all these attachments are not to the source,

00:19:08.251 --> 00:19:09.891
to the source of joy,

00:19:10.091 --> 00:19:11.451
to the source of knowledge,

00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:15.731
to the source of energy which ascends you.

00:19:20.691 --> 00:19:23.611
This is the reason why

00:19:24.171 --> 00:19:26.571
our situation

00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:32.171
of collective ascent is poor.

00:19:38.451 --> 00:19:44.491
Now the Adi Shakti's work is to give you Realisation first,

00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:51.531
second is to give you life,

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.291
to comfort you.

00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:58.051
If you have physical problems,

00:19:58.491 --> 00:19:59.971
She will look after you.

00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.171
She'll go all out.

00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:04.371
If you've mental problem,

00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:06.491
She will try to solve.

00:20:07.491 --> 00:20:09.091
So, She's a comforter;

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:10.771
She gives you the comfort.

00:20:10.971 --> 00:20:14.211
At the same time, She protects you.

00:20:15.731 --> 00:20:18.531
I've seen many people, even now,

00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:20.931
get frightened very soon,

00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:23.131
at the slightest thing.

00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.171
Why should you be frightened?

00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:27.691
There's a tiger standing.

00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:32.891
You can't see him, may be today he might be in the picture.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.011
And your Mother is so powerful.

00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:41.811
You have to understand how powerful She is.

00:20:42.011 --> 00:20:44.291
This is, the understanding is not in your heads.

00:20:44.491 --> 00:20:47.051
Sometimes your wives are more powerful

00:20:47.251 --> 00:20:49.851
or your children are more powerful.

00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:52.931
When you know that your Mother is so powerful

00:20:53.131 --> 00:20:55.131
- She's your Mother.

00:20:56.531 --> 00:21:01.451
Then you should be absolutely secured.

00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:07.811
And then things work out.

00:21:08.251 --> 00:21:10.451
I'll give you an example of one gentleman

00:21:10.651 --> 00:21:12.891
whom I met in Madras

00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:16.651
once, not many years back,

00:21:16.931 --> 00:21:19.451
about I think two, three years back or so.

00:21:19.651 --> 00:21:23.531
He was such a seeker, immediately he recognized Me.

00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:26.571
And then he went down to Bombay, posting was there,

00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:29.171
and he received a letter saying that his mother

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.171
on death bed. So he went down.

00:21:31.371 --> 00:21:33.371
The doctor said that "She has a galloping cancer

00:21:33.571 --> 00:21:36.411
and she's going to die in no time."

00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:38.851
He knows, "My Mother is Adi Shakti."

00:21:39.051 --> 00:21:40.811
Just took My photograph, sat before Me,

00:21:41.011 --> 00:21:42.731
said, "Mother, I've nothing to say,

00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:45.691
whatever You think proper for my mother, please do that."

00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:48.891
Just he said so. He's connected.

00:21:49.971 --> 00:21:52.251
They said three days after, "She's going to die."

00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:55.291
Three days after she got out of the hospital.

00:21:55.531 --> 00:22:00.491
He took him down to Bombay, showed him in a hospital,

00:22:00.691 --> 00:22:02.651
in cancer hospital.

00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:04.851
They said, "She has no cancer, nothing,

00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:07.251
she's completely cured."

00:22:11.731 --> 00:22:15.411
If the energy is not allowed to flow,

00:22:15.811 --> 00:22:18.011
you are still worried about your wife,

00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:19.171
you're worried about your house,

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.091
you're worried about your children,

00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:22.371
you're worried about this,

00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:25.211
about "my children, my house, my wife"

00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:30.531
this "my" when it drops,

00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:33.331
then I can work.

00:22:35.331 --> 00:22:37.051
But it should not be taken

00:22:37.251 --> 00:22:40.291
that I'm saying you become ascetics, no way.

00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:42.531
No saints were ascetics,

00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:45.691
they all had wives, they all had children.

00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:51.331
But all their attention was at the Lotus Feet of the Mother.

00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.371
As Guru Nanaka has said

00:22:57.531 --> 00:23:00.371
that a little boy is playing with his kite,

00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:03.451
the kite is going all over,

00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:06.731
and he is talking to his friends, joking, this thing,

00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:09.891
but his attention is on the kite.

00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:14.211
There's a lady who is cleaning her house

00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:16.531
with a little child on her waist,

00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:20.251
and she's cleaning the house and grooming it.

00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:24.371
She's doing everything, but her attention is on her child.

00:23:26.211 --> 00:23:28.091
Then there are ladies in India, as you know,

00:23:28.291 --> 00:23:31.091
they have three, four pitchers filled water

00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:33.091
and they walk with both the hands like this.

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:34.891
They know how to balance it.

00:23:35.091 --> 00:23:37.891
They're talking to each other, laughing, making fun,

00:23:38.091 --> 00:23:43.131
pulling legs. But the attention is on the pitchers.

00:23:47.771 --> 00:23:50.931
My attention is always on your Kundalini.

00:23:52.051 --> 00:23:56.851
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yog, take it from Me.

00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:00.051
Anybody who tries to play any trick

00:24:00.371 --> 00:24:02.651
will be very badly punished.

00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:06.891
So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest,

00:24:07.091 --> 00:24:10.411
and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:12.331 --> 00:24:14.691
I won't do anything, but here they are!

00:24:14.891 --> 00:24:18.451
You see already, with all his teeth.

00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:25.251
They're all fixed quantities, I have told them.

00:24:25.451 --> 00:24:27.731
They're are fixed quantities.

00:24:29.651 --> 00:24:32.611
They know what to do, and they will do it.

00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:36.491
So there is no need to play any tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:36.731 --> 00:24:40.931
This is another mistake of Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:43.131
that they think they can play tricks with Me

00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:45.491
or with Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:46.931 --> 00:24:49.851
When those things come into your head,

00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:54.011
I would say these are demonic ideas,

00:24:54.251 --> 00:24:57.291
because they will destroy you completely.

00:24:57.851 --> 00:25:01.011
On one side Sahaja Yoga is a blessing,

00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:06.291
absolutely blessing on the ascent you go ahead like that.

00:25:06.731 --> 00:25:08.411
You go to a height,

00:25:08.611 --> 00:25:11.131
but you must know also, you've reached the height;

00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:13.491
you have to be very careful to be there,

00:25:13.771 --> 00:25:16.011
because once you fall from that height,

00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:18.371
how deep you'll go?

00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:24.291
Is logical again to see that you'll fall very low.

00:25:26.971 --> 00:25:31.011
So here you are having the blessings,

00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:35.971
all the beauties, all the love, all the joy,

00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:42.931
all the knowledge, all the friends, all the care.

00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:49.691
And there, if you don't want to be here,

00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.531
just because you are playing tricks,

00:25:53.731 --> 00:25:56.731
you want to be here and play tricks, that is not possible.

00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:58.931
That doesn't work out,

00:25:59.131 --> 00:26:01.731
you are immediately thrown out,

00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:04.411
and once you are thrown out, God knows where you'll go.

00:26:04.611 --> 00:26:06.691
That's not our lookout,

00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:10.251
but you are thrown out by these.

00:26:12.411 --> 00:26:18.251
So one has to know that the Deities are extremely alert.

00:26:24.491 --> 00:26:27.251
And They're watching all of you.

00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:29.131
Because They have to guard you,

00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:30.171
They have to look after you,

00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:31.291
They have to help you,

00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:33.171
They have to do everything for you.

00:26:33.371 --> 00:26:35.411
They have to work out everything for you.

00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:38.211
They are the Ones who create flowers for you;

00:26:38.411 --> 00:26:41.371
They're doing all kinds of good things for you.

00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:44.411
But, at the same time,

00:26:45.811 --> 00:26:48.851
They are only attached to Me,

00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:51.891
all of Them,

00:26:52.811 --> 00:26:54.731
not to you.

00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:57.531
Because you are My children,

00:26:57.731 --> 00:26:59.531
They are looking after you.

00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:02.611
Once you try to misbehave,

00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:07.531
you are finished and you go down.

00:27:11.411 --> 00:27:15.371
But the compassion of your Mother is so great,

00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:19.851
that She always tries to forgive,

00:27:20.051 --> 00:27:26.011
give chances and tells those Deities to keep quiet.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:30.171
Of course They obey - up to a point.

00:27:30.771 --> 00:27:35.211
But if you want to be nasty people,

00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:38.171
if you want to be cruel,

00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:42.131
if you want to be sinful

00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:45.171
and stay in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot.

00:27:45.371 --> 00:27:48.171
It's not like any religion as you saw yesterday

00:27:48.371 --> 00:27:50.291
that you commit any mistakes,

00:27:50.531 --> 00:27:54.691
do what you like, kill anyone, cheat anyone,

00:27:54.891 --> 00:27:56.171
and still be there.

00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:57.851
It's not like that.

00:28:02.691 --> 00:28:07.371
Here you have to be Sahaja Yogi

00:28:07.571 --> 00:28:10.491
in the real sense of the word.

00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:15.691
And this is why one has to understand.

00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:20.171
There are some Sahaja Yogis have come, they can't get in,

00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:22.491
I think the doors are closed.

00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:35.891
So, now such a tremendous Power,

00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:39.131
so alert, so affectionate,

00:28:39.331 --> 00:28:41.811
so kind

00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:44.611
is there.

00:28:49.211 --> 00:28:54.091
And a Mother, Who is your teacher.

00:28:55.371 --> 00:28:59.331
Mother teaches children with love.

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:00.651
Not only that,

00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:03.891
but you never even felt how I taught you Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.291
You just learnt it like that.

00:29:06.891 --> 00:29:08.611
It's a child's play for you.

00:29:08.811 --> 00:29:11.451
It's such a difficult and subtle subject;

00:29:11.651 --> 00:29:15.451
you picked it up without any difficulties.

00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:18.331
So artfully it was done,

00:29:18.531 --> 00:29:20.171
beautifully it was done,

00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:23.331
built in within you, now you know this is Sahaja Yog,

00:29:23.531 --> 00:29:25.571
this is not Sahaj Yoga.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:29.331
All this knowledge came to you so sweetly.

00:29:29.531 --> 00:29:31.971
The way you sing Indian musics, you see,

00:29:32.171 --> 00:29:34.131
even the Indians are surprised,

00:29:34.331 --> 00:29:36.131
they can't sing like you sometimes.

00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:38.651
Those who had come to My programme, they saw you.

00:29:38.931 --> 00:29:40.011
Some musicians, they said,

00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:41.611
"We were really ashamed.

00:29:41.811 --> 00:29:45.251
How could these people sing so well?

00:29:45.651 --> 00:29:50.491
And pronounce everything so well?"

00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:58.451
And you have to trust this Power fully.

00:30:00.211 --> 00:30:03.331
Those days, when people were in difficulties,

00:30:03.531 --> 00:30:05.411
they were always attacked,

00:30:05.611 --> 00:30:08.531
they had not got their Self Realisation,

00:30:08.731 --> 00:30:12.451
they had to put their trust into the Divine Power.

00:30:12.651 --> 00:30:14.851
They had to put.

00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:20.171
But now when you have got Realisation,

00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:23.291
you have got your freedom.

00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:27.131
Should never forget that you have to trust

00:30:27.331 --> 00:30:29.451
this Divine Power.

00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:34.531
All the time that It will look after you.

00:30:36.771 --> 00:30:40.251
Now, how do we play tricks in Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:43.131 --> 00:30:46.131
Some lazy lumps come into Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:46.771 --> 00:30:49.851
Absolute lazy lumps, means they must be left-sided

00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:52.371
or whatever it is.

00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:54.291
And if you tell them,
"You better do this work."

00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:56.371
"No Mother, I won't do this work,

00:30:56.571 --> 00:30:58.611
because my right side will come up."

00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:00.811
Very common trick.

00:31:06.811 --> 00:31:08.451
Is a very common trick,

00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:10.451
"I can't do this work!"

00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:12.851
When it comes to work, they'll just run away.

00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:15.651
How many people work?

00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:17.251
Very few.

00:31:17.451 --> 00:31:19.291
The other day I went to the kitchen,

00:31:19.491 --> 00:31:21.451
and I asked this Indian girls what's happening,

00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:23.651
they said, "They are all running away.

00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:26.291
Nobody's here to help us."

00:31:29.251 --> 00:31:31.331
Nobody wants to take responsibility.

00:31:31.531 --> 00:31:35.051
But the trick is that it is played on Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:39.251
that "If I do this thing I will become right-sided."

00:31:39.651 --> 00:31:41.971
But if you become left-sided,

00:31:42.171 --> 00:31:44.211
this one is there.

00:31:46.691 --> 00:31:50.491
Is very nice you have put him here, I am very happy.

00:31:55.251 --> 00:31:59.251
So, all lethargic people, lazy lumps,

00:31:59.971 --> 00:32:02.091
always do that.

00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:04.331
Now, somebody is told that

00:32:04.491 --> 00:32:06.491
"You have to get up in the morning."

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.131
They feel terrible about it,

00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:09.931
"Oh! How to get up?"

00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:12.051
But if you go back into your own background,

00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:14.051
you'll say you must have taken drugs,

00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:16.051
you must have taken alcohols,

00:32:16.251 --> 00:32:18.971
you must have taken all these left-sided things,

00:32:19.171 --> 00:32:21.531
that's why you cannot get up in the morning!

00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:24.731
Now, how will you

00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:30.891
finish or neutralize those bad habits that you had?

00:32:31.131 --> 00:32:33.171
How will you do it?

00:32:35.491 --> 00:32:38.851
If you start getting up early in the morning,

00:32:39.251 --> 00:32:41.171
slowly the habit will be formed,

00:32:41.371 --> 00:32:43.371
and you can get rid of it.

00:32:44.051 --> 00:32:48.931
It's just to make yourselves available

00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:52.291
when the morning sun is about to come.

00:32:55.291 --> 00:32:59.251
Alcohol itself is such a left-sided nonsense.

00:33:00.171 --> 00:33:02.211
So much so that once the Goddess drank

00:33:02.411 --> 00:33:05.371
all the alcohols of the world.

00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:10.131
You won't believe, all the alcohols!

00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:19.451
Saints like Sainath smoked all the tobacco of Maharastra,

00:33:19.651 --> 00:33:22.571
but still they are smoking.

00:33:24.811 --> 00:33:29.011
Like Shiva drank the whole of the poison

00:33:30.931 --> 00:33:33.771
because He is the giver of life.

00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:38.211
Whatever They have worked so much,

00:33:38.411 --> 00:33:39.491
so sincerely,

00:33:39.691 --> 00:33:43.651
earnestly with complete concentration.

00:33:44.331 --> 00:33:46.091
You see Me working like that,

00:33:46.291 --> 00:33:49.251
but They have also worked the same way.

00:33:50.611 --> 00:33:54.691
So don't take things for granted!

00:33:57.731 --> 00:34:00.171
I have told many of you to write down,

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:03.411
what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:34:04.571 --> 00:34:08.331
For myself I'll do everything - I'll paint my house,

00:34:08.531 --> 00:34:14.531
I'll paint my kitchen, everything,

00:34:14.891 --> 00:34:18.731
I'll have a nice sari done up, blouse done up.

00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:20.571
Myself.

00:34:20.771 --> 00:34:24.811
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:34:25.531 --> 00:34:29.371
How many presents I have given to others?

00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:34.491
How many letters I've written to others?

00:34:35.091 --> 00:34:38.091
What experiences I have written down?

00:34:39.131 --> 00:34:40.491
Above all,

00:34:40.691 --> 00:34:45.611
how many times I have felt the love of my Mother in my heart?

00:34:47.411 --> 00:34:50.131
But I'll tell you the reason in the West

00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:53.251
why the big problem is, I've discovered it now.

00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:55.091
As I discovered Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:55.291 --> 00:34:57.251
also I've discovered the secret

00:34:57.451 --> 00:35:00.371
which I am telling you today.

00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:12.531
This is also the Shakti of penetration

00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:22.251
that one can find out the demons,

00:35:22.451 --> 00:35:24.971
how they work in our minds,

00:35:25.531 --> 00:35:28.371
how they prosper.

00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:31.291
I think I've told some people,

00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:33.531
but I am going to tell you all.

00:35:34.091 --> 00:35:36.371
When we are children,

00:35:36.691 --> 00:35:39.531
till the age of five years,

00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:42.011
we are ego-oriented

00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:46.091
in the sense that we are just looking after ourselves.

00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.531
You give ten toys to ten children,

00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:52.011
they'll take their toys and play with each other,

00:35:52.211 --> 00:35:55.211
don't talk to anyone, they'll just go and play.

00:35:56.931 --> 00:35:58.531
They'll not disturb another one,

00:35:58.731 --> 00:36:00.131
it's all parallel living.

00:36:00.371 --> 00:36:01.251
They won't disturb.

00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:03.051
If they disturb, they might beat,

00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:05.091
they might do something else nonsensical.

00:36:05.291 --> 00:36:08.371
This might be due to some sort of a bhoot in them

00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:11.371
as children.

00:36:11.571 --> 00:36:15.091
But when they are five years of age,

00:36:15.291 --> 00:36:18.931
supposing now, you ask somebody, a child from here,

00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:20.411
"See now, what do you see?"

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.411
He says, "I see a tiger here, and these flowers,

00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:25.051
this, this, all this I see."

00:36:25.251 --> 00:36:27.091
But if you make him stand there,

00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:29.411
supposing somebody's standing that side,

00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:32.491
what will he see? Still he will say he sees tiger,

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:36.331
flowers, this that. You try.

00:36:36.531 --> 00:36:40.411
Because he cannot see the point of view of another person.

00:36:40.611 --> 00:36:43.531
He's just busy with his ego.

00:36:43.851 --> 00:36:47.891
Now the whole culture in the West, I have found now

00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:50.491
- I don't know, formally it was not so,

00:36:50.691 --> 00:36:54.611
parents had a great grip over the children,

00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:56.811
and they had responsibility of children,

00:36:57.011 --> 00:37:00.611
they behaved well so that children should be all right.

00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:04.771
Not like before the children they go on fighting
with each other.

00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:07.131
I mean, they must be fighting little bit,

00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:09.171
but in the bedrooms they must be doing.

00:37:09.371 --> 00:37:13.171
Because I have not seen films, when I was young,

00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:16.251
where the husband/wife are only all the time fighting,

00:37:16.451 --> 00:37:18.211
or going for divorce.

00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:21.211
No, at all, understanding between husband and wife,

00:37:21.411 --> 00:37:23.251
but when it is another woman or another man,

00:37:23.451 --> 00:37:25.371
their face is going like this.

00:37:25.571 --> 00:37:27.171
If you see on the street

00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:29.491
two people going with each other like this,

00:37:29.691 --> 00:37:33.651
then you know these two are not husband and wife.

00:37:37.091 --> 00:37:39.331
This is modern times.

00:37:39.891 --> 00:37:41.011
These are modern times.

00:37:41.211 --> 00:37:42.931
And the West is the worst.

00:37:43.131 --> 00:37:47.851
So what happens that the parents are also not grown up,

00:37:48.051 --> 00:37:51.051
they are not matured, they have no sense of responsibility.

00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:53.931
They have got children, how to behave with the husband,

00:37:54.131 --> 00:37:56.331
specially the women here are extremely,

00:37:56.531 --> 00:37:59.571
extremely dominating and stupid.

00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:01.851
I must say.

00:38:03.851 --> 00:38:05.371
They don't know anything about cooking;

00:38:05.571 --> 00:38:08.211
they don't know anything about anything.

00:38:08.411 --> 00:38:10.291
They can only career girls, they can go,

00:38:10.491 --> 00:38:13.251
sit in the bank and write something.

00:38:13.451 --> 00:38:15.011
And they're extremely stupid;

00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:16.571
they don't know how to handle their husbands,

00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:19.651
they don't know how to handle their children.

00:38:20.371 --> 00:38:22.171
They have had no training.

00:38:22.371 --> 00:38:25.411
Their mother's paid no attention to them.

00:38:26.411 --> 00:38:28.491
No disciplining at all.

00:38:28.691 --> 00:38:32.691
So this-ego oriented child is still ego-oriented.

00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:35.451
No love, no affection.

00:38:35.691 --> 00:38:38.331
We would say My Mother was a very strict person.

00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:39.731
Extremely strict.

00:38:39.931 --> 00:38:42.051
But she was extremely loving also - extremely loving,

00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:46.331
extremely strict, just like Jagadamba.

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:50.291
I mean, she would make us cook food,

00:38:50.491 --> 00:38:52.251
even the handle how you hold.

00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:54.131
She would tell us, "This is not the angle,

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:56.451
it's not the way, you do this way!

00:38:58.091 --> 00:38:59.651
Why are you standing like this?

00:38:59.891 --> 00:39:02.531
Where is your attention?"

00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:05.411
And no questions were to be asked.

00:39:05.571 --> 00:39:08.011
All that disciplining and all that thing

00:39:08.251 --> 00:39:12.171
which came to us in our childhood is today helpful to us.

00:39:14.131 --> 00:39:15.971
And they were extremely loving.

00:39:16.171 --> 00:39:17.451
They were for our benevolence,

00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:19.731
whatever they did were for our benevolence.

00:39:20.131 --> 00:39:23.851
But I think, specially in Switzerland,

00:39:24.051 --> 00:39:27.171
I always felt that the mothers are uneducated

00:39:27.411 --> 00:39:30.491
and they're extremely jealous of their daughters also.

00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:35.211
Our mothers, My mother was very well educated,

00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:37.011
but her mother was not.

00:39:37.251 --> 00:39:40.171
But she was a wise woman.

00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:43.971
She had her sense of responsibility,

00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:45.611
she knows she was a mother

00:39:45.811 --> 00:39:47.771
and she has to behave herself.

00:39:47.971 --> 00:39:50.651
She has not to be childish and stupid.

00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:55.051
So because that love was not given to these ladies,

00:39:55.251 --> 00:39:57.651
they are still ego-oriented.

00:39:58.091 --> 00:40:00.131
They're still babies.

00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:02.851
They're not yet grown up.

00:40:05.211 --> 00:40:09.411
Still they cannot see the other person's point of view

00:40:10.131 --> 00:40:12.331
and they become extremely obstinate:

00:40:12.531 --> 00:40:14.611
"No, this is true!"

00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:16.371
Now let us face it,

00:40:16.611 --> 00:40:19.171
today you have had this Puja of Adi Shakti,

00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:20.251
is a dangerous one,

00:40:20.451 --> 00:40:23.091
because this is like a mirror

00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:26.331
where you will have to see yourself

00:40:27.731 --> 00:40:30.451
clearly, face yourself.

00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:38.611
To dominate your husband is a stupid nonsense.

00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:42.091
Because you don't know

00:40:42.291 --> 00:40:44.371
how to handle your husband, that's why.

00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:49.051
I would say Indian women dominate

00:40:49.251 --> 00:40:51.611
their husbands all right, in a way.

00:40:52.171 --> 00:40:54.691
The husbands can't do without their wives,

00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:56.931
can't do without their wives.

00:40:57.211 --> 00:40:59.971
They don't know even how to pack their things,

00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:02.211
they don't know how to even make tea,

00:41:02.411 --> 00:41:03.971
they don't know how to boil an egg,

00:41:04.171 --> 00:41:06.251
they don't know anything.

00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:10.131
They don't know even how to lock the house,

00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:12.731
open

00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:21.091
even open the wardrobe,

00:41:21.291 --> 00:41:22.731
how to spread a bed.

00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:27.531
They don't know anything whatsoever that is practical.

00:41:31.771 --> 00:41:33.971
I mean I would say that

00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:36.011
my husband would always come and ask Me,

00:41:36.211 --> 00:41:37.891
"Is this tie all right?"

00:41:38.091 --> 00:41:39.971
I mean this is since long, now he knows I'm Adi Shakti,

00:41:40.171 --> 00:41:42.291
but before also.

00:41:44.491 --> 00:41:45.731
He used to come and ask,

00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:47.571
"Is it all right?" "No, no it's no good."

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.811
All right, he would change.

00:41:51.691 --> 00:41:55.211
But because you are not grown up,

00:41:55.411 --> 00:41:56.491
you are not matured,

00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:58.371
you don't know how to handle your husbands.

00:41:58.571 --> 00:42:00.371
You try to dominate.

00:42:00.571 --> 00:42:02.491
And then the children learn from you,

00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:04.771
they also try to dominate you.

00:42:07.211 --> 00:42:12.171
Apparently, you must understand,

00:42:12.851 --> 00:42:15.131
it is

00:42:17.771 --> 00:42:20.251
the authority coming from the top.

00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:21.931
Like I always will say,

00:42:22.131 --> 00:42:24.851
"I am not God, Sadashiva is God."

00:42:25.051 --> 00:42:28.211
Gregoire was quiet shocked when I told him first this thing.

00:42:28.931 --> 00:42:31.611
But I am God also.

00:42:32.371 --> 00:42:34.891
Without Me what is He? I'm His Power.

00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:37.131
He's powerless.

00:42:39.611 --> 00:42:42.411
But let Him be God, good.

00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:48.811
Because if you have to blame someone,

00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:51.971
you blame Him, He's God.

00:42:52.691 --> 00:42:56.171
But I have to work hard to keep Him pleased.

00:42:56.371 --> 00:42:59.051
Otherwise you know, He doesn't care for anyone.

00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:02.211
He'll just destroy, that's all He knows.

00:43:03.771 --> 00:43:04.931
He'll destroy you,

00:43:05.131 --> 00:43:07.051
anybody tries to play any tricks with Me,

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:11.091
He'll destroy you so badly that for lives together

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:12.931
you cannot become a human being.

00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:15.291
He's like that, a terrible fellow.

00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:19.251
He's the One Who has done all these things, you know.

00:43:22.931 --> 00:43:25.331
So, we have to grow.

00:43:25.611 --> 00:43:29.491
We have to grow as wise women,

00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:37.291
as women who are like the Mother Earth, as I told you.

00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:41.131
And when you ask me that

00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:44.251
"Mother, You work so hard, and You look so fresh."

00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:47.331
Because I enjoy it.

00:43:47.651 --> 00:43:49.931
It's like a music to Me.

00:43:50.131 --> 00:43:52.291
Doing work is a music to Me.

00:43:53.171 --> 00:43:55.371
Cooking is a music to Me.

00:43:56.491 --> 00:43:58.211
Everything is a music to Me.

00:43:58.411 --> 00:44:00.451
Do you get tired of music?

00:44:00.691 --> 00:44:03.131
On the contrary you feel fresh.

00:44:03.331 --> 00:44:05.211
And when I kill demons,

00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:07.051
as you must have seen there,

00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:12.211
I get more enlightened, more light comes into Me.

00:44:13.091 --> 00:44:15.171
It's the other way round.

00:44:18.331 --> 00:44:23.251
So, I have to make you understand that

00:44:23.451 --> 00:44:29.411
today please have full introspection,

00:44:30.211 --> 00:44:32.131
soul search.

00:44:33.251 --> 00:44:36.251
Find out what's wrong with us.

00:44:39.371 --> 00:44:41.331
Do not pamper your ego,

00:44:41.571 --> 00:44:43.451
because ego makes you idiotic,

00:44:43.651 --> 00:44:45.171
that you must have seen.

00:44:45.371 --> 00:44:47.291
We have some people in Sahaja Yoga

00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:49.091
who are like that, idiots.

00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:51.451
But they think knowing of themselves.

00:44:51.651 --> 00:44:52.691
We all know that.

00:44:52.891 --> 00:44:56.811
We have to have some buffoons also in the circus.

00:44:59.451 --> 00:45:06.091
But we have to have lions and tigers.

00:45:11.171 --> 00:45:14.691
What impresses the people are the lions and the tigers

00:45:14.891 --> 00:45:17.811
and not the buffoons.

00:45:18.851 --> 00:45:21.971
So, it is important, let us have the introspection

00:45:22.171 --> 00:45:24.011
and see for ourselves

00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:28.211
how much we have done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:34.491
Of course, I have to congratulate you for one thing.

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:37.931
Because, you know, I am like that.

00:45:39.371 --> 00:45:42.331
I have done nothing to be like that, I'm just like that,

00:45:42.531 --> 00:45:44.171
I am.

00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:45.971
So I'm the Power!

00:45:46.171 --> 00:45:49.491
If I have the Power, because I am the Power.

00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:57.331
What is there to feel very elated about it?

00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:02.491
I do not feel that way at all.

00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:09.171
But if I do not use My Power,

00:46:10.851 --> 00:46:13.931
then I become like a human being.

00:46:16.491 --> 00:46:18.211
Why I am the Goddess?

00:46:18.411 --> 00:46:22.331
Because I use every bit of My Power.

00:46:24.451 --> 00:46:28.411
And if you people do not use your power,

00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:32.291
out of any nonsense, any fear you may have.

00:46:32.531 --> 00:46:37.211
You may have any kind of a temptation,

00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:39.811
or restriction, anything.

00:46:40.171 --> 00:46:44.491
If you're not going all out to use your power of love,

00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:47.331
then you cannot ascent.

00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:51.011
So the whole thing if you see so clearly,

00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:54.251
the whole Power of your Mother is of love.

00:46:54.771 --> 00:46:59.331
Whatever She does is out of Her love for Her creation.

00:47:04.451 --> 00:47:07.931
And the introspection starts,

00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:09.811
but it should not be late.

00:47:10.011 --> 00:47:11.171
I used to say since long

00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:13.491
the way they are exhausting the Mother Earth,

00:47:13.691 --> 00:47:15.011
making so many things.

00:47:15.171 --> 00:47:16.731
You must have heard Me saying this,

00:47:16.931 --> 00:47:20.131
for the last eighteen years I've been saying this.

00:47:20.451 --> 00:47:22.171
Today now ecological problems

00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:25.131
standing like a rakshasa before you.

00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:27.571
Now what do you do with him?

00:47:33.091 --> 00:47:35.091
So you face then.

00:47:35.331 --> 00:47:40.171
Automatically you have to face yourself, your destruction.

00:47:41.051 --> 00:47:44.371
Introspection, if you do not do now,

00:47:44.571 --> 00:47:49.411
you'll face it at a time when it will be very late.

00:47:49.651 --> 00:47:53.571
So don't be just satisfied with yourself,

00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:59.931
that you have now Sahaja Yogi, so done.

00:48:01.171 --> 00:48:04.731
If you have come to My Puja of course,

00:48:04.971 --> 00:48:07.291
like if you fall into the sea,

00:48:07.491 --> 00:48:11.091
the sea has a power to absorb you.

00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:14.571
But also has a power to throw you back on the shores.

00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:17.451
It acts both ways.

00:48:19.971 --> 00:48:23.371
So why can't I go deep into Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:35.211
There are excuses also: I have got no time, I am very busy,

00:48:35.411 --> 00:48:37.651
I am working in the office, I am doing that.

00:48:37.851 --> 00:48:39.851
Then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:45.291
All your time is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:49.771
But because of that,

00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:53.291
Sahaja Yoga gives you sufficient time to do everything.

00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:00.931
I know of people,

00:49:01.131 --> 00:49:03.811
whom I suddenly find in the Pujas,

00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:07.611
sometimes in Vancouver, sometimes in San Diego,

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.691
sometimes here.

00:49:09.891 --> 00:49:12.371
I said, "How are you here, what about your business?"

00:49:12.571 --> 00:49:14.371
He said, "The business has brought us here,

00:49:14.571 --> 00:49:17.051
exactly on this date."

00:49:19.651 --> 00:49:23.051
When this Power is so great, to realise it,

00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:26.251
to know how great it is,

00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:29.731
then you leave everything to this Power.

00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:32.851
It works out for you everything.

00:49:34.731 --> 00:49:37.171
So today we are talking about Shakti,

00:49:37.371 --> 00:49:41.411
about the Power of the Goddess,

00:49:42.811 --> 00:49:45.931
which are much more to be discovered

00:49:46.611 --> 00:49:49.211
and too intricate,

00:49:49.411 --> 00:49:53.611
very well balanced and extremely efficient.

00:49:56.091 --> 00:50:01.451
But whatever work these Powers have done within you,

00:50:01.651 --> 00:50:04.731
please try to respect them.

00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:16.411
Please, try to assimilate them,

00:50:17.731 --> 00:50:21.051
and let your being grow.

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:24.451
Don't say that "Now I'm married,"

00:50:24.651 --> 00:50:26.691
or that "I've got pregnancy,"

00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:30.891
that "I've got children, I've got jobs," nothing.

00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:35.011
Everything becomes perfect,

00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:39.131
as soon as you perfect yourself.

00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:44.291
Everything is related to your perfection.

00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:47.971
Then you don't ask Me question,

00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:49.931
"What job I have to do Mother,

00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:55.051
what I have to achieve?"

00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:57.971
Nothing.

00:50:58.771 --> 00:51:04.251
You just see your way through and everything works out.

00:51:09.811 --> 00:51:12.811
So, all the demons were killed,

00:51:14.131 --> 00:51:17.091
they are again back in their own seats.

00:51:17.971 --> 00:51:19.731
The worst thing is they have entered

00:51:19.931 --> 00:51:22.371
into the heads of the seekers,

00:51:22.571 --> 00:51:25.571
because they have come as gurus now.

00:51:27.811 --> 00:51:30.131
They've come as Catholic Church,

00:51:30.331 --> 00:51:32.411
as Protestant Church,

00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:36.211
as all kinds of temples

00:51:36.411 --> 00:51:40.171
and all kinds of fundamentalist and all that.

00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:43.331
All they look like rakshasas also,

00:51:43.531 --> 00:51:45.611
if you look at them.

00:51:47.171 --> 00:51:50.971
And when they influence you, they go into your heads.

00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:53.131
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:55.291
even those heads are cleansed

00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:58.411
and you are all right, out of it.

00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:01.651
But then what to do with this,

00:52:02.931 --> 00:52:05.651
with doing all this work,

00:52:06.011 --> 00:52:12.171
cleansing, and giving joy, and everything, then what to do?

00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:16.411
You have to give it to others!

00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:20.611
This is your responsibility.

00:52:20.891 --> 00:52:25.131
So first of all your character, your behaviour,

00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:29.811
your relationships should be so pure

00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:33.091
that, by itself, it will emit light.

00:52:33.291 --> 00:52:38.971
Like if you have a very clean glass,

00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:41.451
the light can pass.

00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:50.211
But also, Kundalini being the pure desire,

00:52:50.411 --> 00:52:55.331
you must have a very fervent and extremely bubbling,

00:52:55.531 --> 00:53:02.291
you can call it a absolutely pouring out desire

00:53:02.491 --> 00:53:06.371
whom to give vibrations, now, whom to give realisation.

00:53:09.011 --> 00:53:10.251
You give it to the trees,

00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:13.291
you give it to the dogs, you give it to anyone,

00:53:13.491 --> 00:53:17.291
and if you find human beings also give them.

00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:21.091
Rather difficult.

00:53:28.931 --> 00:53:31.411
So, that has to be done.

00:53:31.931 --> 00:53:34.371
But whatever you are doing,

00:53:34.571 --> 00:53:39.531
keep attention in your connection.

00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:42.131
But here they are doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:44.131
and there your connection is loose,

00:53:44.331 --> 00:53:46.251
then what you are giving? Sahaja Yog or what?

00:53:46.451 --> 00:53:49.331
You are giving darkness?

00:53:50.091 --> 00:53:53.051
Your are giving ignorance.

00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:57.971
You are giving madness.

00:54:00.651 --> 00:54:04.051
So, to this powerful Shakti

00:54:04.251 --> 00:54:11.251
you must all the time keep connection, and keep Her pleased.

00:54:11.691 --> 00:54:13.851
Like the protocol

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:18.011
is very important because all these you see.

00:54:21.651 --> 00:54:24.731
They have the protocol sense, because They are fixed.

00:54:25.131 --> 00:54:30.051
You should also fix your protocol properly.

00:54:33.891 --> 00:54:36.731
It's rather

00:54:42.451 --> 00:54:46.691
difficult or embarrassing

00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:51.411
as a human being for Me to tell you

00:54:51.611 --> 00:54:54.611
what should be the protocol of the Goddess. Really.

00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:56.851
But I have to tell you;

00:54:57.051 --> 00:54:59.811
because I don't want you should be harmed.

00:55:00.411 --> 00:55:03.331
But the protocol must be observed

00:55:07.491 --> 00:55:10.691
and could be understood very well.

00:55:11.571 --> 00:55:15.011
Of course, it's much better now.

00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:22.091
First time they had My Puja, in Delhi,

00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:26.651
they did My aarti with a plastic plate,

00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:30.771
and the kum-kum was kept in plastic boxes,

00:55:30.971 --> 00:55:33.771
and I was so much worried about these people

00:55:33.971 --> 00:55:36.971
that My whole body had shrunk like this controlling Them,

00:55:37.171 --> 00:55:39.251
"Now don't do anything!"

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:45.211
If you see My photograph you'll see Me very different.

00:55:45.731 --> 00:55:48.851
I was so surprised they didn't know what to do.

00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:54.131
All right, now, please also

00:55:54.331 --> 00:55:59.691
pay attention to your protocol.

00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:03.091
For example people walk just early in the morning

00:56:03.291 --> 00:56:06.331
in their pyjamas, that's not proper.

00:56:07.171 --> 00:56:08.811
You must dress up properly.

00:56:09.091 --> 00:56:13.291
You're going, you don't know what Adi Shakti is.

00:56:14.211 --> 00:56:16.131
Or you know?

00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:19.651
If you know then you are going to face Adi Shakti.

00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:25.531
Protocol must be understood.

00:56:27.811 --> 00:56:32.931
For that, luckily, in India, people have lot of sense;

00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:36.251
also they are sometimes missing in it.

00:56:39.971 --> 00:56:43.371
So, protocol is very important

00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:45.931
because These will be really furious

00:56:46.131 --> 00:56:48.971
if you don't keep the protocol.

00:56:54.571 --> 00:56:58.371
That is extremely important.

00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:01.691
That's why Christ has said

00:57:02.091 --> 00:57:04.491
He'll "tolerate anything against Myself,

00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:07.691
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:57:09.651 --> 00:57:11.211
And also He has said that,

00:57:11.411 --> 00:57:13.531
"Beware of the murmuring souls"

00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:18.291
because if you murmur on My back, I hear everything.

00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:21.691
They're reporting all the time.

00:57:22.571 --> 00:57:26.251
If you do anything on My back, I know what's happening.

00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:33.451
I give time. But then it acts.

00:57:36.891 --> 00:57:39.931
It's for your benevolence, for your good,

00:57:40.131 --> 00:57:45.051
for your ascent for which you have fought for ages!

00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:47.931
You must respect yourself

00:57:49.371 --> 00:57:52.091
that you are seekers,

00:57:52.291 --> 00:57:55.371
and now you have found out the truth.

00:57:55.931 --> 00:57:58.411
So, make a crown out of it,

00:57:58.651 --> 00:58:00.611
and put it on your head.

00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:03.851
Now you are like lords.

00:58:08.971 --> 00:58:11.211
Unless and until

00:58:12.491 --> 00:58:17.571
you know what powers you have and how you got them,

00:58:18.011 --> 00:58:20.291
and you remember it,

00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:25.811
and also this truth becomes part and parcel of you,

00:58:26.531 --> 00:58:29.091
your growth is going to be difficult.

00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:31.131
You'll be neither here nor there,

00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:34.011
hanging in the air like a pendulum going here to there,

00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:36.211
left to the right, right to the left.

00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:39.451
And a Sahaja Yogini should be ashamed to say

00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:43.131
that "I'll go on the left, or I'll go on the right."

00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:46.451
How can you be so vulnerable?

00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:51.531
Because you have not grown.

00:58:52.731 --> 00:58:55.771
You have to be like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:58:57.491 --> 00:59:00.291
How can you catch?

00:59:02.211 --> 00:59:05.091
All right, if you think somebody is extremely negative,

00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:07.571
don't go near that person.

00:59:09.571 --> 00:59:13.371
But you cannot become a dainty darlings.

00:59:18.691 --> 00:59:23.611
My children are viras, shivalrous.

00:59:24.331 --> 00:59:26.291
They have to be.

00:59:26.851 --> 00:59:28.491
You are My children.

00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:32.171
You are no more Christians, Hindus, Muslims,

00:59:32.891 --> 00:59:40.251
you are no more all these horrible demonic people,

00:59:40.451 --> 00:59:42.891
but you are My children and you have to be brave,

00:59:43.091 --> 00:59:44.611
you have to be righteous,

00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:46.491
you have to be good, you have to be compassionate,

00:59:46.691 --> 00:59:48.851
you have to be dynamic.

00:59:49.091 --> 00:59:51.251
That's the minimum.

00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:56.851
I hope after this Puja you'll sit down,

00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:59.851
meditate and do introspection,

01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:05.771
and find out, "Why I do it? What is the problem?"

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:11.571
Say, some people yesterday were dozing off, I saw them.

01:00:11.771 --> 01:00:14.531
Because of left Nabhi.

01:00:15.731 --> 01:00:18.571
So correct your left Nabhi.

01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:30.891
But if you are really connected with this Divine Power,

01:00:31.091 --> 01:00:34.331
you may keep awake for three days and three nights,

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:35.771
you'll not be tired.

01:00:35.971 --> 01:00:38.211
It has happened with you sometimes.

01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:40.491
But attention should be on the Power,

01:00:41.051 --> 01:00:43.331
attention should be on the connection

01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:45.891
that we have with this Power.

01:00:46.091 --> 01:00:49.411
Then only. Otherwise you'll be exhausted, naturally.

01:00:49.611 --> 01:00:53.651
Everything's so logical, so logical it is.

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:58.811
Thank God, and thank yourself,

01:00:59.011 --> 01:01:01.331
thank your luck you're so fortunate

01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:05.051
that you are very few who have achieved this connection,

01:01:05.251 --> 01:01:07.931
and that you are sucking that power

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:10.211
within yourself so easily.

01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:12.451
And what are you, why are you behaving

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:18.051
like this ordinary street people with your stupid questions?

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:30.491
You'll be surprised that Goddess,

01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:35.331
in previous lives, never spoke so much as I've spoken.

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:39.331
One or two words were sufficient,

01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:45.291
like She said, "Hoo!" and killed this, "Ha!" finished that.

01:01:45.491 --> 01:01:47.371
All these things She managed

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.731
only by saying "Hoo, Ha, Hee, Hey".

01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:55.811
But They never gave Realisation to anyone,

01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:58.491
none of the Incarnations.

01:01:58.691 --> 01:02:01.451
They said, "No, no, no, no, no not Me.

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:05.531
Not Me, sorry, I'm not going to do it.

01:02:06.451 --> 01:02:09.731
They must have seen human beings how stupid they are.

01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:12.931
"Oh God, nothing. I'm all right.

01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:16.891
I can go to jungle for fourteen years,

01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:22.691
I can do the driver's job with Arjuna,

01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:27.091
or I can get crucified, or I can take poison,

01:02:27.251 --> 01:02:30.171
but don't tell Me to deal with human beings!

01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:32.371
No, no, no, no.

01:02:33.131 --> 01:02:36.811
Is better to go to a zoo than to go to this."

01:02:37.451 --> 01:02:41.611
And that's why none of Them, none of Them,

01:02:41.931 --> 01:02:45.291
and some of Them did not even talk about it,

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.491
thinking that "If We talk, they'll say,

01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:50.571
"Then why not give us the Realisation?"

01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:54.371
None of them.

01:02:55.171 --> 01:03:02.291
So this is the Adi Shakti's compassion, love, and confidence

01:03:05.451 --> 01:03:07.531
that you should have also confidence.

01:03:07.731 --> 01:03:10.051
Not only that I have given you Realisation,

01:03:10.251 --> 01:03:11.571
but I have given you powers

01:03:11.771 --> 01:03:14.571
that you can give Realisations to others.

01:03:14.771 --> 01:03:17.331
None of these Incarnations did that,

01:03:17.571 --> 01:03:19.611
which you are doing today.

01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:28.451
With all Their Powers, They did not do it,

01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:30.491
while you can do it,

01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:34.691
despite the fact the instruments are not so strong,

01:03:35.651 --> 01:03:38.571
not so Divine.

01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:46.371
But still, still, we have to come up,

01:03:48.931 --> 01:03:53.171
and work out in our own lives

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.651
the priorities that we have.

01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:00.851
For the Gods the priorities were only Divine work,

01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:02.851
nothing else.

01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:06.331
Nobody took up a job, nobody.

01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:11.691
Nobody went to university, nobody studied.

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:17.171
Only thing They did

01:04:18.411 --> 01:04:23.931
was the work of God.

01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:33.251
So you do everything else as work of God

01:04:34.931 --> 01:04:39.891
and that's how the energy will flow into you.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:43.811
When you start doing the work of God,

01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:47.131
everything you do becomes work of God

01:04:47.331 --> 01:04:51.931
in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide,

01:04:52.131 --> 01:04:54.691
"I'm going to do the work of God," then God takes over.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.731
He does all the rest of the things,

01:04:56.931 --> 01:05:00.011
you do only the work of God, He takes over.

01:05:01.011 --> 01:05:05.051
I hope you understand this, try.

01:05:06.531 --> 01:05:08.411
Try.

01:05:08.611 --> 01:05:11.051
Have confidence.

01:05:13.971 --> 01:05:19.091
And also thank God there is Someone, like your Mother,

01:05:19.371 --> 01:05:21.371
Who can tell you what's wrong with you.

01:05:21.771 --> 01:05:23.571
Thank God!

01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:26.171
Even your mothers didn't tell you what was wrong,

01:05:26.371 --> 01:05:29.291
because they were so frightened of you.

01:05:32.691 --> 01:05:35.211
And don't say then - then, when you say something,

01:05:35.411 --> 01:05:37.931
"Mother, my heart catches."

01:05:38.131 --> 01:05:40.611
I mean, what can you do, then?

01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:47.931
If you understand that this is for your improvement

01:05:48.131 --> 01:05:52.371
I am doing it, it's out of love, out of concern,

01:05:53.611 --> 01:05:56.491
then you'll work it out.

01:05:58.891 --> 01:06:02.491
But I don't think it is so much of a mental understanding,

01:06:02.691 --> 01:06:07.931
but it's the understanding of a higher level,

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:12.851
where it becomes just part and parcel of your awareness.

01:06:13.371 --> 01:06:15.611
"How can it be wrong?

01:06:15.891 --> 01:06:19.971
It's all has to be good for me, everything is good for me."

01:06:23.211 --> 01:06:25.771
Last but not the least,

01:06:26.051 --> 01:06:30.731
one must understand that as all these seven chakras

01:06:30.931 --> 01:06:34.931
I am working on are in a collective way held

01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:37.691
by Me in My Virata.

01:06:37.891 --> 01:06:40.651
The quality of Viratangana is that,

01:06:40.851 --> 01:06:45.931
that She creates this universal awareness within us,

01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:48.571
the collectivity.

01:06:50.531 --> 01:06:55.931
And, if you do not realize that in modern times

01:06:56.171 --> 01:07:03.051
we are in a spiritual path in a collective way only.

01:07:07.171 --> 01:07:08.531
This is what it is.

01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:12.611
Because we have reached to the state of Sahasrara

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:19.611
and here we have to have a collective working only,

01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:22.851
there's no other way out!

01:07:23.731 --> 01:07:29.651
This is what is to be absolutely realized.

01:07:30.251 --> 01:07:36.651
Anybody who tries to harm the collectivity by bad behaviour,

01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:38.891
or by anything,

01:07:39.171 --> 01:07:41.331
will be thrown out, no doubt,

01:07:41.531 --> 01:07:46.651
but also will fall into wrong hands.

01:07:47.371 --> 01:07:51.491
So collectivity is the work of Adi Shakti.

01:07:52.011 --> 01:07:54.211
Because at the Sahasrara,

01:07:54.651 --> 01:07:56.131
at the Sahasrara,

01:07:56.331 --> 01:07:59.651
at the Sahasrara is the rule of Virata.

01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:03.171
And the Power of Virata is the Viratangana.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:06.291
Is the One Who does collectivity.

01:08:06.931 --> 01:08:10.011
This is the most important point we must know

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:15.651
if we cannot be collective - because of anything,

01:08:15.851 --> 01:08:19.131
jealousy maybe, inferiority complex maybe, any,

01:08:19.331 --> 01:08:21.331
anything which is coming from behind

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.891
like a worm crawling up -then,

01:08:24.091 --> 01:08:26.331
know that something wrong with you,

01:08:26.531 --> 01:08:28.571
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

01:08:30.091 --> 01:08:32.451
Don't criticize the collectivity,

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:36.651
till I Myself find it out, and I'll put it right.

01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:40.051
Keep to the collectivity, wisely

01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:46.251
and earnestly and try to keep the collectivity together.

01:08:49.771 --> 01:08:54.291
Try to help to keep the people collective to enjoy together.

01:08:54.491 --> 01:08:57.011
Don't criticize each other;

01:08:58.011 --> 01:08:59.531
only criticize yourself.

01:08:59.731 --> 01:09:02.531
If you are in the habit of criticism,

01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:04.611
better criticize yourself.

01:09:04.811 --> 01:09:07.891
It's better, because these are habits also.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:11.371
People, specially I've seen people in the West,

01:09:11.571 --> 01:09:12.931
they react to everything.

01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:14.331
If they see this carpet,

01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:16.091
"Uh! I don't like it!"

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:18.291
But this is not yours, not made for you,

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.131
what have you got to do with it?

01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:23.251
"No, I don't like it!" But it's not yours,

01:09:24.051 --> 01:09:25.251
what's the question?

01:09:25.451 --> 01:09:28.291
It's lying here, why should you be so upset about it?

01:09:28.651 --> 01:09:33.091
"I don't like that person! I don't like that dress!"

01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:36.331
Who are you?

01:09:37.771 --> 01:09:40.611
"I don't like."

01:09:42.571 --> 01:09:46.531
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga - "I don't like."

01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:52.891
There is a way of saying things.

01:09:53.091 --> 01:09:57.091
But there is no need to say anything whatsoever.

01:10:02.971 --> 01:10:05.771
So all this kind of bumptiousness

01:10:05.971 --> 01:10:10.731
and showing off is against collectivity.

01:10:12.811 --> 01:10:15.291
Then there are some other stupid type of people

01:10:15.491 --> 01:10:18.491
who are always there to take My photograph I've seen.

01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:21.971
You tell them, "Don't be so forward, don't go."

01:10:22.171 --> 01:10:25.291
"No, I will, I don't do this, I am not. Finished!"

01:10:25.731 --> 01:10:29.331
But they, some of them are really confirmed,

01:10:30.531 --> 01:10:34.411
certified I think, stupid, idiots.

01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:36.211
They cannot be improved.

01:10:36.411 --> 01:10:39.451
But I told you that don't make them your ideals,

01:10:39.691 --> 01:10:42.531
don't follow their images.

01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:47.371
So then, we come to this point,

01:10:47.611 --> 01:10:54.331
that Adi Shakti's work is the most important work

01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:57.811
in the whole creation.

01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:00.091
All right killing the demons was over,

01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.211
what is it?

01:11:02.411 --> 01:11:03.451
Done!

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:08.091
Saraswati's work was done, She created dinosaurs so what?

01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:09.691
Mahalakshmi's work was done.

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.811
She brought you to human level, all right, so what?

01:11:13.091 --> 01:11:16.731
But the climax is now that you have got your Realsation,

01:11:16.931 --> 01:11:19.931
that you have got this special quality,

01:11:20.771 --> 01:11:24.291
that now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:11:24.491 --> 01:11:26.691
So now behave yourself.

01:11:27.411 --> 01:11:30.531
And also you must have that dignity to know that,

01:11:30.731 --> 01:11:34.571
now we have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:42.331
I've seen, once I was going to see the President of India.

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:45.491
But to Me he was another human being,

01:11:45.691 --> 01:11:47.731
I mean, it never goes into My head this presidentship

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.211
and all that.

01:11:49.411 --> 01:11:50.611
I was walking up,

01:11:50.811 --> 01:11:53.171
and those who were walking with Me became very conscious,

01:11:53.331 --> 01:11:54.131
you see, like this.

01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.171
I said, "What's the matter with these people?

01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:58.611
Have they seen some ghost or something?"

01:11:58.811 --> 01:12:01.171
Just going on the steps.

01:12:01.371 --> 01:12:04.811
And they were some people standing with, you see,

01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:07.731
spears and things as guards,

01:12:07.931 --> 01:12:11.291
or whatever it is. So, I was just laughing at all that.

01:12:11.491 --> 01:12:14.371
But these people became very conscious.

01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:18.971
When you are entering into the Kingdom of God,

01:12:19.811 --> 01:12:23.771
how conscious you should be about your behaviour!

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:29.811
How you should be,

01:12:30.411 --> 01:12:32.571
how you should behave?

01:12:37.451 --> 01:12:45.971
Just feel the uniqueness of your personality

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:49.331
that you are in the Kingdom of God already.

01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:51.011
Just feel it.

01:12:51.251 --> 01:12:53.171
If you can feel only that,

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:58.371
then you will know what a place of pride you have got

01:12:58.611 --> 01:13:01.531
and how dignified you should be.

01:13:01.731 --> 01:13:04.051
How beautiful you should be.

01:13:04.251 --> 01:13:12.331
How neat and clean and sweet you should be.

01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:17.731
How much maryadas you must know, everything.

01:13:20.411 --> 01:13:28.811
And when you will realize that now you are the coveted,

01:13:29.051 --> 01:13:37.051
or we can say the highest citizens of the Kingdom of God,

01:13:37.571 --> 01:13:44.291
then you have to prove that you have really realized it.

01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:46.891
That you really feel that.

01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:52.571
And you should feel extremely joyful, happy.

01:13:52.771 --> 01:13:56.291
Like yesterday, at the smallest thing everybody's laughing

01:13:56.491 --> 01:13:58.011
like the other street people.

01:13:58.211 --> 01:13:59.451
It's not the Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:59.651 --> 01:14:01.571
If there was a big joke or something, laugh,

01:14:01.811 --> 01:14:04.531
otherwise somebody is talking, you're laughing.

01:14:06.491 --> 01:14:09.531
I was surprised, you're Sahaja Yogis.

01:14:09.731 --> 01:14:13.451
Think of saints doing this, will they do?

01:14:14.611 --> 01:14:16.371
You are saints;

01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:19.651
you are munindras with smanana,

01:14:19.851 --> 01:14:24.891
with your meditation you have become the kings.

01:14:27.451 --> 01:14:31.531
How can you behave in a indignified manner?

01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:36.411
Now, try to assume your position!

01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:40.691
Try to feel it.

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:46.251
Yesterday, of course, when the last song started,

01:14:46.731 --> 01:14:53.531
it did penetrate, I know, into many souls, to many hearts,

01:14:54.411 --> 01:15:00.491
that unique joy, which we call as Nirananda.

01:15:01.051 --> 01:15:03.051
I did feel it yesterday.

01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:07.211
But keep it up, it's just to be kept very safely

01:15:07.691 --> 01:15:11.371
into your Khumbas, is the Kundalini.

01:15:11.571 --> 01:15:14.051
And She is the One Who has come up.

01:15:14.491 --> 01:15:17.211
So, My idea was that

01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:20.971
today is not only the worship of the Khumba,

01:15:21.171 --> 01:15:25.571
where the Kundalini resides,

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:30.651
but the Khumba becomes like a flower pot.

01:15:33.051 --> 01:15:36.291
It's like that, that has happened

01:15:36.851 --> 01:15:40.451
and then it can also, as somebody said that,

01:15:40.651 --> 01:15:46.731
"Mother these flower pots also can become table lamps."

01:15:47.211 --> 01:15:50.171
I said, "See, now, you've said it!"

01:15:50.371 --> 01:15:54.571
So the Khumba becoming flowers, and flowers becoming light,

01:15:57.411 --> 01:16:00.371
and the lights with fragrance!

01:16:01.011 --> 01:16:03.291
I hope you'll understand My vision

01:16:03.491 --> 01:16:05.251
and you'll stand by Me,

01:16:05.451 --> 01:16:07.211
you'll come up to that.

01:16:07.411 --> 01:16:11.451
I depend on you entirely for My vision.

01:16:11.691 --> 01:16:15.011
We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place.

01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:19.411
Now for that not much sacrifice is needed.

01:16:19.611 --> 01:16:22.651
You're already blessed, you don't have to do much,

01:16:22.851 --> 01:16:29.731
only thing is keep your attention on the source of Power.

01:16:29.931 --> 01:16:32.771
May God bless you.

01:16:37.771 --> 01:16:40.251
Ah? Thank you.

01:16:40.451 --> 01:16:43.891
Mathias says, "We promise." You all say that.

01:16:56.371 --> 01:16:58.531
Thank you very much.

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:18.011
You should all write some of the miracles,

01:17:18.331 --> 01:17:22.331
and how things work out.

01:17:22.531 --> 01:17:27.051
Like we went to Paris,

01:17:27.251 --> 01:17:30.371
and they wanted to buy some saris for the ladies here,

01:17:30.611 --> 01:17:34.211
and nowhere we could get anything forty-five inches.

01:17:34.411 --> 01:17:36.171
Either it was thirty-six inches,

01:17:36.371 --> 01:17:39.371
or it was fifty-eight inches.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:45.491
Then while going in the car, suddenly I said, "Now stop!"

01:17:46.091 --> 01:17:48.331
They said, "What Mother? In the street?" I said,

01:17:48.531 --> 01:17:51.411
"In the street only there is somebody selling the saris."

01:17:51.611 --> 01:17:54.491
And we got them.

01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:58.931
Another - you have seen already

01:17:59.171 --> 01:18:02.491
in the Ganapatipule Ganesh Puja,

01:18:03.651 --> 01:18:10.011
that how we had a jackpot for your presents.

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:14.611
You used to always bring presents, very expensive and

01:18:16.411 --> 01:18:19.491
of no artistic value, anything,

01:18:19.691 --> 01:18:21.411
wasting so much money.

01:18:21.611 --> 01:18:25.731
Even national Pujas, you could not get anything.

01:18:27.891 --> 01:18:31.571
And how we got this, just the same way.

01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:34.451
Coming from the airport I just said,

01:18:34.651 --> 01:18:36.451
"Now there's something here!"

01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:38.251
They said, "Mother, nothing there's a shop."

01:18:38.451 --> 01:18:39.971
I said, "Let's go and see!"

01:18:40.171 --> 01:18:44.011
Just we went round, and there all this things at a song.

01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:47.011
Now same thing happened in America,

01:18:47.211 --> 01:18:50.131
I went down, I said, "The China is in trouble,

01:18:50.331 --> 01:18:51.771
let's buy something Chinese."

01:18:51.971 --> 01:18:53.891
So we went to the Chinese shops;

01:18:54.091 --> 01:18:58.051
they were so expensive, very expensive.

01:18:58.251 --> 01:19:00.531
And I turned the corner and I said,

01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:03.211
"All right let me go into a little lane,"

01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:07.171
and there it was, a shop which sold everything very cheaply,

01:19:07.411 --> 01:19:09.131
for again forty percent less.

01:19:09.331 --> 01:19:11.491
Something has to do with forty percent.

01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:17.251
And just by chance only, I think,

01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:21.411
hundred meters away they were selling at five times more,

01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:24.691
six times more. And why it is?

01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:27.851
So now you also try.

01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:32.211
But desire should be pure, understanding should be pure.

01:19:32.411 --> 01:19:34.171
So I just thought that these Sahaja Yogis

01:19:34.411 --> 01:19:36.931
spend so much money, waste so much money,

01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:39.691
and get something which is of no value.

01:19:39.891 --> 01:19:42.531
Because all the presents you give Me, actually,

01:19:42.731 --> 01:19:45.971
I have been asking them to stop it, and stop it and stop it.

01:19:46.171 --> 01:19:47.411
Now from individual,

01:19:47.611 --> 01:19:50.531
we have brought it to the level of national.

01:19:50.731 --> 01:19:52.411
But even in the national,

01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:55.451
I think we now should just have no national,

01:19:55.651 --> 01:19:57.371
but one international, if you can manage next year

01:19:57.571 --> 01:19:58.971
if you people agree.

01:19:59.171 --> 01:20:01.891
But whatever it is,

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:04.891
whatever you give Me, I'm not going to sell it,

01:20:05.131 --> 01:20:06.611
I'm not going to give it to anyone,

01:20:06.811 --> 01:20:08.651
it should be such that we can keep

01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.371
for the progeny to see what you have given.

01:20:11.571 --> 01:20:13.611
It is the value of this is this,

01:20:13.811 --> 01:20:16.691
not the value how much you spent.

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:19.491
So, there is no need for individually

01:20:19.691 --> 01:20:22.931
to give Me any presents at all, I know you love Me.

01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:26.171
And now, I don't know, I've been telling the leaders

01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:29.211
that "Please don't ask for the national present,

01:20:29.411 --> 01:20:30.891
now don't waste money."

01:20:31.091 --> 01:20:33.131
But I don't know if they are not yet agreeing,

01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:36.211
and if they agree we can stop this.

01:20:36.411 --> 01:20:38.651
And have even international present

01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:41.451
which could be also brought down.

01:20:41.651 --> 01:20:43.891
Because you know, I don't need anything.

01:20:44.091 --> 01:20:45.891
But it works.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.611
It works.

01:20:47.811 --> 01:20:50.411
Like I said, "You give Me ivory this time,"

01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:52.731
and ivory was so very expensive, everything,

01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:57.371
again that also we found it at a such a cheap place.

01:20:58.851 --> 01:21:00.931
And once you gave Me the ivory,

01:21:01.131 --> 01:21:03.651
you won't believe, I read in the newspaper

01:21:03.851 --> 01:21:06.651
that ivory used to be five hundreds dollars per kilo,

01:21:06.851 --> 01:21:10.331
now in America it is three dollars per kilo.

01:21:11.571 --> 01:21:14.331
It's true or not?

01:21:14.771 --> 01:21:18.291
And also the idea is to give more encouragement

01:21:18.491 --> 01:21:20.811
to handicrafts and to art,

01:21:21.011 --> 01:21:22.811
because so many times I have told that

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.571
a little of a clay you can take and make it

01:21:27.771 --> 01:21:30.931
into a beautiful thing which is worth such a lot.

01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:33.251
So, why should we exhaust this Mother Earth?

01:21:33.451 --> 01:21:37.051
Why not we have few artistic nice things,

01:21:37.251 --> 01:21:40.331
instead of having so many things?

01:21:40.811 --> 01:21:43.571
But if you go in the shops now you don't get anything.

01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:46.131
You don't get silk, you cannot get this,

01:21:46.331 --> 01:21:47.771
you cannot get that.

01:21:47.971 --> 01:21:50.491
So difficult to get anything natural,

01:21:50.691 --> 01:21:54.731
because people have only making unnatural things.

01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:59.811
Whatever it is, in that also you should create beauty.

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:01.611
If you start creating beauty,

01:22:01.811 --> 01:22:03.691
then we'll try to preserve it

01:22:03.891 --> 01:22:07.091
and use it sparingly instead of having thousands

01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:10.531
of nonsensical things, everything disposable.

01:22:10.811 --> 01:22:12.211
After sometime,

01:22:12.411 --> 01:22:15.371
we'll have to have human beings who are disposal.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:17.371
We'll have to dispose them off.

01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:18.771
How will they live on this earth

01:22:18.971 --> 01:22:20.651
if we do not understand that

01:22:20.851 --> 01:22:25.891
we have to live on this earth with its limitations.

01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:29.291
See, I've been telling you, many times,

01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:33.251
take to artistic things, take to handmade things,

01:22:33.451 --> 01:22:34.971
more to handmade.

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:38.051
Don't go too much to this.

01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:41.331
At least, even if you have to buy something

01:22:41.531 --> 01:22:45.251
which is, say, artificial,

01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:48.971
at least see to it that it is artistic.

01:22:55.251 --> 01:23:01.051
So, the once you have a great desire

01:23:01.251 --> 01:23:04.411
- today is the day they want in the whole world to pray

01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:06.731
for the preservation of Mother Earth,

01:23:06.931 --> 01:23:08.971
that's why I started this topic,

01:23:09.171 --> 01:23:12.691
that we should pray that we all should develop art,

01:23:12.891 --> 01:23:16.931
develop for ourselves, give as presents to others,

01:23:17.131 --> 01:23:22.171
and also to use artistic things, made of artist.

01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:24.731
We can have few things,

01:23:24.891 --> 01:23:29.811
but artistic which expresses art.

01:23:32.131 --> 01:23:34.051
Not cheap things.

01:23:34.251 --> 01:23:37.331
In the whole of France

01:23:38.091 --> 01:23:43.091
what I saw was that into everything this plastics has crept

01:23:43.531 --> 01:23:47.171
in whether it is cotton, whether it is silk,

01:23:47.371 --> 01:23:48.931
whether it is wool.

01:23:49.131 --> 01:23:52.211
It can enter into everywhere

01:23:52.411 --> 01:23:57.531
except for the brains of human beings. It's horrible.

01:23:57.731 --> 01:23:59.811
So, whatever it is,

01:24:00.011 --> 01:24:06.091
in that also see that you buy artistic things,

01:24:07.651 --> 01:24:13.811
not plain, horrible, cheap things.

01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:18.051
All right? So this is what we have to today,

01:24:18.251 --> 01:24:22.211
also, you have to pray to Me when you are doing puja,

01:24:22.411 --> 01:24:26.891
that "Oh, Mother, Oh Mother, please save our earth,

01:24:27.171 --> 01:24:29.771
and give people wisdom,

01:24:29.971 --> 01:24:33.011
that they should behave themselves.

01:24:33.411 --> 01:24:34.331
And they should be conscious".

01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:38.331
And every Sahaja Yogi should be conscious

01:24:38.571 --> 01:24:42.371
about how much energy he is using of electricity,

01:24:42.571 --> 01:24:48.571
of telephones, or of water or of anything.

01:24:49.531 --> 01:24:52.131
We have to be frugal about it.

01:24:52.331 --> 01:24:55.811
If we do not take the responsibility of these things,

01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:58.451
then it will not penetrate anywhere else.

01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:01.171
It is for you to do it.

01:25:04.251 --> 01:25:07.251
You have to take it up in your everyday life

01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:11.291
as a part and parcel of your life

01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:16.411
that you try to save the energy of this Mother Earth.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.651
Is very important.

01:25:21.371 --> 01:25:24.651
So today is the day they have sent a special prayer,

01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:27.811
of course it's done by some churches of whatever it is,

01:25:28.011 --> 01:25:29.491
but I think is a good day,

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.331
because they must have thought today

01:25:31.571 --> 01:25:33.491
is the day of the Goddess,

01:25:33.691 --> 01:25:37.131
and that's how they've asked for.

01:25:39.971 --> 01:25:42.771
May God bless you.
