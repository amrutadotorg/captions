WEBVTT

01:51.480 --> 01:57.320
Today we are going to celebrate the Puja of Lakshmi

01:59.080 --> 02:02.960
And I've already told you that

02:03.160 --> 02:07.240
Lakshmi came out of the sea.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.480
And Greece is the Nabhi of the universe.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.720
And whatever Lakshmi they have got, wealth,

02:16.960 --> 02:21.480
they have got it out of the sea faring activities there.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.720
So it is very apt that we should worship Lakshmi in Greece

02:27.320 --> 02:33.320
and understand what is the significance of Lakshmi is.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.560
Can you hear me there, all of you?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.480
Now I've described many a time,

02:43.720 --> 02:48.080
but, again I will describe it to you.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.400
Lakshmi is the one who is a Mother by nature.

02:53.720 --> 02:58.960
So a person who has Lakshmi, a person who has got wealth

02:59.160 --> 03:04.320
must have a motherly

03:04.560 --> 03:09.240
benevolent temperament; that's one thing.

03:10.160 --> 03:16.160
Then another thing is that She stands on the lotus in the water.

03:16.640 --> 03:21.240
So a person who has got Lakshmi must have a balance.

03:21.480 --> 03:24.720
If he moves this side or that side, left or right side

03:24.960 --> 03:28.320
he immediately goes inside the bhavasagar.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.880
Secondly, Her one hand is giving

03:35.400 --> 03:40.080
and another hand there is protection like this.

03:41.560 --> 03:46.400
So, at least a person who has got Lakshmi money

03:46.640 --> 03:49.560
should be generous, he should be giving

03:49.800 --> 03:53.160
and right hand should protect all the people

03:53.400 --> 03:57.320
who are working under him or who are related to him,

03:57.560 --> 04:00.720
his relations or other things

04:00.880 --> 04:04.800
or any other organizations or anything that he is connected with

04:05.080 --> 04:10.720
he should try to patronize and protect it from all kinds of dangers.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.800
The second part is that

04:16.320 --> 04:20.960
one hand of the Lakshmi has got a book in Her hand,

04:21.320 --> 04:25.080
and another has,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.720
no, second part is the

04:29.960 --> 04:33.880
two hands of the Lakshmi which are on top of head

04:34.400 --> 04:37.400
have got two lotuses in Her hand.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.400
That shows a person who is rich

04:41.560 --> 04:44.320
should have a heart like a lotus.

04:44.560 --> 04:50.560
A lotus heart is like this that even a very

04:51.640 --> 04:55.960
thorny type of an insect comes to the lotus in the night to sleep,

04:56.480 --> 05:01.240
the lotus opens its own petals and allows that

05:01.400 --> 05:04.800
thorny type of an insect to sleep

05:05.320 --> 05:12.240
in the very cozy way on the corona of the lotus

05:13.000 --> 05:17.160
so that he sleeps well there, comfort him.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.560
In the same way, a person who is very rich should have a capacity

05:24.560 --> 05:27.160
to

05:31.640 --> 05:34.240
allow guests to come in his house

05:34.480 --> 05:38.160
and to see to the comfort of the guests;

05:39.080 --> 05:41.960
whatever may be the status of that guest,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.240
whatever may be the situation of that guest,

05:45.560 --> 05:49.240
but that is immaterial.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.160
What is important is that he's your guest

05:52.400 --> 05:54.880
and you have to look after that guest

05:55.080 --> 06:00.160
and whatever he asked for you must provide him.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.080
Of course in the modern times it's all vanished into thin air.

06:05.400 --> 06:10.160
But we have so many examples in India

06:11.160 --> 06:17.080
where once a guest came like that

06:18.240 --> 06:22.880
and asked that he would like to eat the flesh

06:23.720 --> 06:28.080
of the child of the king.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.080
So the king said all right you can have the flesh,

06:34.320 --> 06:38.160
and he cooked the flesh

06:38.400 --> 06:43.560
and gave it to the guest. And guest was nobody else but

06:43.880 --> 06:47.720
it was Shri Krishna. You can say Shri Vishnu.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.960
And after five minutes he called the name of the boy

06:53.240 --> 06:55.960
and the boy came running to the parents.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.800
There are so many stories.

06:59.080 --> 07:05.080
Another one is Harishchandra who had a guest who came

07:05.320 --> 07:10.800
as Vamana. It's again Shri Vishnu to take his test.

07:11.720 --> 07:17.000
And he asked

07:18.000 --> 07:21.080
for all his kingdom.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.080
So Harishchandra gave him all his kingdom

07:24.240 --> 07:28.640
and went into the forest with his wife and suffered a lot.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.240
But in that sufferings he got his moksha

07:32.480 --> 07:35.160
and he got again complete reward

07:35.400 --> 07:39.320
of his kingdom and everything. He is very much purified.

07:39.560 --> 07:43.960
And also there is a king

07:44.480 --> 07:50.320
of this coming to a king

07:51.160 --> 07:53.720
Shri Vishnu as Vamana.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.800
and he asked

07:58.080 --> 08:02.240
that you have to give me land

08:02.880 --> 08:07.240
which is measured by my three steps.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.240
Bali was the king. He said: "All right, whatever you say".

08:12.480 --> 08:16.960
So with one foot he touched the sky;

08:17.240 --> 08:20.400
with another foot he touched the Mother Earth.

08:20.640 --> 08:25.560
The third foot he put on Bali's head and put him in the pathala,

08:25.960 --> 08:31.240
in the lower world.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.480
And that's how Vamana Avathara came.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.960
And like that we have various such examples in India.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.880
that when the guests are there how we are to treat them

08:44.080 --> 08:48.240
and how we have to be absolutely subservient

08:48.480 --> 08:53.320
and absolutely looking after.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.720
And it should be an honor for us to see our Sahaj Culture.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.480
This is our Sahaj Culture is.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.800
But what I find, that in the modern times,

09:04.080 --> 09:07.400
people just don't like this because people have become very selfish.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.160
But it is always reciprocal.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.800
If you have guests in your house and you look after them

09:16.720 --> 09:22.320
then it is always rewarded back, always

09:22.560 --> 09:24.880
in so many ways.

09:25.640 --> 09:30.400
In My own lifetime I have seen that

09:33.400 --> 09:37.080
even slightest help you give to someone

09:37.240 --> 09:40.720
how it comes back to you in a very big way.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.080
For example, there were..

09:48.640 --> 09:51.880
Lenin can't you sit properly? Is it Lenin?

09:54.560 --> 09:57.640
Whose child?

09:58.240 --> 10:01.320
Are you not Sahaja Yogis?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.960
Whose child is this one?

10:09.080 --> 10:12.400
She's a new Sahaja Yogini?

10:15.640 --> 10:18.880
Now if the children misbehave,  we'll ask them to go out of Puja,

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
all right?

10:20.320 --> 10:24.560
Children must behave themselves and sit quietly, all of you.

10:26.880 --> 10:32.800
So once I was sitting outside my house and

10:33.480 --> 10:38.640
I was knitting something in Delhi

10:39.560 --> 10:42.080
and three people came

10:42.240 --> 10:45.880
and they said that, "We have no place to go to, we are refugees,

10:46.240 --> 10:49.480
and you have such a big house, you can give us a room,

10:49.640 --> 10:51.000
we would be very thankful".

10:51.240 --> 10:54.400
And I had house which had a room which was just outside,

10:54.560 --> 10:59.320
it was in no way connected to the house.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.480
So I said: "All right, doesn't matter. You can stay with us.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.800
The vibrations you are giving - nice people

11:07.960 --> 11:09.720
you are not telling lies.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.160
In the evening My brother came and My husband came

11:12.400 --> 11:14.960
and both of them said, now what sort of people these are,

11:15.160 --> 11:19.320
God knows, and what will they  do to us, this and that, very angry.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.800
I said, now I've given them the house, all right.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.640
It is my responsibility.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.720
One month they were very much worried.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.640
They cannot come inside the house. They are outside.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.240
"What is the harm, they are refugees, let them stay."

11:33.400 --> 11:36.480
They stayed on.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.560
Actually they were very talented people.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.960
And then there was one Muslim man. And there were riots.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.560
After this whole trouble there was a riot,

11:47.720 --> 11:50.800
really of a very bad nature.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.720
And all these Sikh people came to my house,

11:55.880 --> 11:59.080
and they said we have heard there's Muslims stay here.

11:59.320 --> 12:00.720
I told them there is none.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.960
They said: "How can you say that?"

12:04.160 --> 12:08.560
I said: "You see I am wearing such big bindhi; I am myself a Hindu.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.640
Why will I keep a Muslim in my house?

12:10.800 --> 12:13.000
You get away from here. If you have to

12:13.240 --> 12:15.400
misbehave then I'll call the police."

12:15.640 --> 12:18.640
So this man was saved you see

12:18.880 --> 12:22.640
and after that what happened that I just lost them;

12:22.800 --> 12:25.480
they went away, they got some jobs.

12:25.720 --> 12:31.080
Then the lady who came, became a very great actress.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.960
And the man, the Muslim gentleman

12:35.160 --> 12:41.400
who was a poet [Shahid Udyami?]

12:42.880 --> 12:46.800
He was a great poet and

12:47.960 --> 12:52.800
after many years, see, we wanted to make a film

12:53.240 --> 12:57.800
and they wanted this lady to become mother in that film.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.960
I said I will not ask her.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.240
She doesn't know Me that I am here,

13:02.480 --> 13:06.080
and otherwise she will have to agree

13:06.320 --> 13:09.800
because she'll feel obliged to Me.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
I just don't want to say anything.

13:12.320 --> 13:17.560
If you want you can approach her and don't tell her my name.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.160
So, when they went to her she said

13:19.400 --> 13:22.480
"No, no I can't do it", and this and that, you know.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.400
So, they said all right you come to the opening ceremony

13:25.640 --> 13:28.400
then we'll see you if like it or not.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.240
She was saying: "I need a sari, you have to give me a sari",

13:31.480 --> 13:34.320
this, that and all those things she was demanding

13:34.560 --> 13:36.720
and so much money.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.160
So she came for the opening of that film.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.560
She saw me sitting,

13:41.720 --> 13:44.640
she just came to me hugged me and started crying.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.640
"How are you here? What are you doing here?

13:46.880 --> 13:49.640
After such a long time I am meeting you here.", this and that.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.880
They told that, "She's the one who wants to make this film.”

13:53.080 --> 13:54.640
"Oh My God!", she said, " You didn't tell me.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.640
What a sin I've committed.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.880
I would give my life for this lady.”, and all,

13:59.080 --> 14:03.480
and they were so surprised, and that's how the film was made.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.320
So small things you do good to somebody you see

14:06.560 --> 14:08.320
it comes out in many ways.

14:08.560 --> 14:12.880
Even if you are kind to people who are supposed to be

14:13.080 --> 14:15.720
not so good people say I think it works

14:15.960 --> 14:21.560
Like Me I was... one boy was very badly hurt: here,

14:21.800 --> 14:24.800
bandage here, bandage here and bandage there,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.320
standing there and he told Me that, “I have no work,

14:28.560 --> 14:30.800
can I come and work with You?”  I said: “all right, come along”.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.480
So I put him in the car and brought him home.

14:33.720 --> 14:37.400
So as usual My brother and My husband got very angry with Me.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.800
"Who is this one you brought in? Who is he?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.640
After all...", this and that.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.880
I said: "It's all right, I'll treat him, I will put him right,

14:44.080 --> 14:45.320
then it's all right.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.800
I was treating him, they said: "You must go to the police,

14:48.000 --> 14:49.400
you must send him to the police.

14:49.560 --> 14:54.640
Might be, he might have run away from police.", whatever.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.560
It happened about 8 days that he got cured.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.560
I said: "Let him get cured and then leave". He was much better;

15:00.800 --> 15:03.160
and that day at night he ran away from the house.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.640
Because they were forcing him to go.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.640
And he took away all My husband's money, his coats, and suits

15:09.800 --> 15:12.800
and My brother's everything that he had

15:13.000 --> 15:17.240
and My ornaments were lying there he didn't touch anything.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.320
In the morning these two got up,

15:20.560 --> 15:23.160
this your nephew has run away?  I said "Yes, but what?"

15:23.400 --> 15:27.800
"He's run away with all our things; our shoes, our coats and pants

15:28.000 --> 15:30.480
and your things he has not touched." Even My ornaments,

15:30.720 --> 15:34.320
gold ornaments were lying on the table, he didn't touch anything.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.240
I said: "This is the thing you must learn.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.720
Why were you after his life? After all he was doing well,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.160
you were after his life."

15:43.320 --> 15:46.960
So he has to prove that he has, you go to the police.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.320
But, this is the way you are going to do it.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.880
So many things like this happen in life.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.240
It's so interesting to see how and

15:57.000 --> 15:59.240
you suddenly come across somebody and

15:59.480 --> 16:00.720
they tell you, "Oh you don't remember?

16:00.960 --> 16:04.800
I have been this and I have been that, You have helped me so much."

16:05.080 --> 16:07.160
So always if you are generous,

16:07.320 --> 16:11.800
you are always fed back by someone.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.800
Like if you open one door breeze won't come.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.560
If you open the second door the breeze starts coming in.

16:19.720 --> 16:24.080
So this is one of the qualities of the person who is a Lakshmipathi,

16:24.240 --> 16:28.320
the one who has money to give and to protect.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.320
Now most of the people who are rich people

16:30.480 --> 16:34.960
are extremely harsh with their servants,

16:35.160 --> 16:38.080
the people who depend on them, very aggressive and

16:38.320 --> 16:39.720
start trying to torture.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.160
But in the long run it doesn't pay.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.640
I have seen it. See if you try to be very careful,

16:45.800 --> 16:48.400
like in My house, my servants will never leave me.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.400
I mean, I don't know, everybody used to say:

16:51.640 --> 16:53.160
"Our servant has run away",

16:53.400 --> 16:57.240
somebody would say, doesn't want to stay and

16:57.640 --> 16:59.800
we have had three servants, five servants.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.080
If I had one servant he would last me

17:02.320 --> 17:05.640
till I actually died like that.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.480
I used to wonder what is the problem with these people.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.240
Actually, in the beginning they would come,

17:11.400 --> 17:14.720
they would be very hungry, I would leave everything open to them.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.640
Eat as much as you like.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.240
They used to eat everything and they would feel very much satisfied.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.720
Then Oh! It's too much.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.640
And whatever you may leave in the fridge, anybody would not eat it.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.080
So everything used to be open in my house. Never closed.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.720
They wanted to eat rice they can eat.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.160
Whatever they wanted to do they can do.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.960
And then they became part and parcel of the household and

17:36.160 --> 17:38.400
they started looking after everything very well.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.400
They would never steal anything, never eat anything like that,

17:42.560 --> 17:45.080
and no problems. While others lock everything,

17:45.240 --> 17:47.160
even the salt they would lock.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.080
And count everything and very strict with the servant

17:51.320 --> 17:54.800
and their servants would run away after 3 days or 4 days.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.880
And they would have servants problems. I never had, anywhere.

17:59.080 --> 18:04.800
So this is it that one has to understand that

18:06.640 --> 18:07.880
how you,

18:08.080 --> 18:10.320
those people who are your near and dear,

18:10.480 --> 18:14.240
how you treat them, your neighbors, your friends,

18:14.480 --> 18:17.400
those people who are dependent on you. Now somebody dependent on you

18:17.560 --> 18:19.720
then people try to show down that person.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.080
All the time show in a way

18:22.240 --> 18:24.720
that the person feels very much humiliated.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.800
Then when he gets out of that house, he takes a revenge.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.560
And he ill-treats them.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.720
So this protection has to be there.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.880
Now She's standing on a lotus, means

18:38.080 --> 18:41.240
on something that is very beautifully made but very delicate.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.160
So She handles people very delicately.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.000
And on a balance She is.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.560
Now when people have money, they go into imbalances very easily.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.240
You give somebody some money,

18:52.480 --> 18:55.240
immediately he will go to a pub, get drunk,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.400
will have five, six women around him

18:57.640 --> 18:58.400
or if she's a woman,

18:58.560 --> 19:01.240
she'll run after men and do all kinds of things.

19:01.480 --> 19:06.080
So money is very

19:07.880 --> 19:09.800
very, I should say, a very dangerous thing,

19:09.960 --> 19:13.560
because, it gives you imbalance. It gives you terrible imbalance.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.560
If you have money, too much money,

19:15.720 --> 19:17.560
then you work through to such imbalances

19:17.720 --> 19:19.560
that you cannot get over it.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.800
And one has to be very careful.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.560
You must have seen people who have money,

19:23.800 --> 19:25.160
how their children get spoiled,

19:25.320 --> 19:27.720
how husband get spoiled, wife get spoiled.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.480
All kinds of things are there.

19:29.640 --> 19:32.160
So money has a very big spoiling effect.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.160
And so she stands on the lotus

19:35.320 --> 19:40.160
and anybody who goes into imbalances, falls into the bhavasagar.

19:40.400 --> 19:44.800
Because the Lakshmi is as you know the consort of Vishnu.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.640
And She's

19:47.880 --> 19:51.400
resides with the, on the sea.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.880
So now the word ‘Marine'.

19:55.080 --> 19:59.480
'Marine' has come also from the same, because we call Her 'Maria'.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.720
Maria is Mahalakshmi.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.880
She, the word comes from the marine,

20:04.080 --> 20:06.960
because She was born out of the sea,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.240
and that's why we call Her Maria.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.960
Now this she's born, this Mahalakshmi is a higher principle.

20:14.160 --> 20:17.400
When a person gets into balance and

20:17.560 --> 20:19.960
behaves like a Lakshmipathi and has all

20:20.160 --> 20:24.880
the affluence, he is dharmic and sensible,

20:25.080 --> 20:29.080
then what happens that he develops another

20:29.240 --> 20:33.720
principle within himself starts manifesting, is the Mahalakshmi.

20:33.880 --> 20:41.240
The Mahalakshmi is the thing that you start seeking the spirit.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.240
This Mahalakshmi principle is very important

20:44.400 --> 20:48.240
and it's also the parasympathetic nervous system

20:48.400 --> 20:50.560
is looked after by Mahalaksmi principle

20:50.800 --> 20:54.880
and the whole of Sushumna is nothing but Mahalakshmi.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.720
So when this principle is awakened within us

20:57.880 --> 21:00.240
then you start seeking. They are satisfied people

21:00.400 --> 21:05.080
who do not go hankering after others' things

21:05.240 --> 21:10.480
do not become greedy, and we do not try to acquire the things

21:10.640 --> 21:13.000
that belong to others and

21:13.240 --> 21:16.240
all other kinds of illegal things we do for money

21:16.480 --> 21:19.480
or these people now, this I saw the boat

21:19.720 --> 21:23.240
searching out those who are smuggling drugs

21:23.480 --> 21:25.400
so that it's all mad things

21:25.640 --> 21:30.240
because this is no use; what will they do with so much money?

21:30.480 --> 21:33.080
But, the greed goes on and on and on there's no end to it

21:33.320 --> 21:37.000
That's why people do all kinds of bad things to get money.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.480
But  money never gives you joy, if it had given joy

21:40.720 --> 21:43.080
then people would have been happy, but they're not.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.240
So the Mahalakshmi principle rises where you try to find beyond.

21:47.400 --> 21:52.880
Of course the Mahalakshmi principle you do get

21:53.080 --> 21:56.800
all kinds of comforts and all kinds of blessings.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.800
But you get blessings also anyway but you do not hanker after it.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.480
And you do not deprive people of their things

22:05.640 --> 22:08.400
or sort of they do not tax them with money.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.160
You are not bothered and the money runs after you.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.480
When you are in the Mahalakshmi condition

22:13.720 --> 22:16.480
then said that Lakshmi comes and fills the water in your house,

22:16.720 --> 22:19.160
like that. So then there's no problem.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.240
The Mahalakshmi principle is the one which gives you

22:22.480 --> 22:27.480
all kinds of things which you get all as of fame

22:27.720 --> 22:32.000
then also the

22:32.720 --> 22:36.800
victory also success,

22:36.960 --> 22:40.400
also satisfaction, dignity

22:40.640 --> 22:46.480
and Aiswarya is a wealth which is dignified.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.320
All this you can have if your Mahalakshmi principle is awakened.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.320
And then through Mahalakshmi principle only

22:54.560 --> 22:57.800
you get your realization.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.160
So now in India, for example, there are three temples of

23:01.320 --> 23:03.800
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswathi.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.560
The Mahalakshmi temple is in Kolapur,

23:06.800 --> 23:11.000
which is a swayambu means just come out of the mother earth.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.240
And is there, the principle is there.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.320
And this Mahalakshmi temple

23:15.480 --> 23:19.720
there people go and sing the song of this Namadeva's,

23:19.960 --> 23:24.720
which you sing ‘Jogwa' yoga pray, because only

23:24.960 --> 23:29.640
in the Mahalakshmi channel, which is the Sushumna,

23:29.880 --> 23:32.240
‘Ambe' is the Kundalini has to rise.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.240
That's why they sing the song that you be

23:36.400 --> 23:41.800
this... in the Mahalakshmi channel

23:41.960 --> 23:45.720
let the Kundalini rise, that is Ude Ude Ambe,

23:45.960 --> 23:47.640
means “Oh Kundalini you rise”.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.080
But they sing it in Mahalakshmi temple.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.400
Not in the temple of any other, Mahakali or any other

23:54.560 --> 23:56.640
but in the temple of Mahalakshmi

23:56.880 --> 23:59.640
and people didn't understand why in the temple of Mahalakshmi

23:59.880 --> 24:01.240
these people go and sing.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.960
Because only in the Mahalakshmi temple is,

24:04.160 --> 24:05.800
in the Mahalakshmi channel,

24:06.000 --> 24:10.720
this Kundalini has to rise and get awakened.

24:11.080 --> 24:15.240
Now this Mahalakshmi principle first was manifested

24:15.480 --> 24:18.960
at the time of Shri Rama as Sita.

24:19.800 --> 24:25.800
Then it was manifested later on Mahalakshmi principle as

24:30.000 --> 24:33.240
Radha, Ra dha. Ra means energy, dha means the one

24:33.400 --> 24:35.000
who sustains the energy.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.400
So it manifested as Radha.

24:37.560 --> 24:42.960
And then it manifested as 'Maria', Christ's Mother.

24:43.160 --> 24:46.640
She's Radha herself, but She created her own child.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.400
As Radha created, she, you see

24:49.640 --> 24:51.720
it's all described in the 'Devi Mahatmyam'

24:51.880 --> 24:55.240
that Radha, how she created the form

24:55.400 --> 25:00.160
and she also created her own child which is

25:00.400 --> 25:02.160
our Lord Jesus Christ.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.800
So this is how Mahalakshmi principle

25:05.000 --> 25:09.480
manifested best in the life of Maria.

25:09.880 --> 25:15.160
And then this Maria kept quiet.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.160
She never said She was anything.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.560
But Christ did say about Her,

25:19.720 --> 25:23.240
and on the cross He said, "Behold the Mother".

25:23.400 --> 25:27.240
Means the Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi...

25:27.400 --> 25:30.560
should see to Mahalakshmi. The Mahalakshmi.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.080
It has many meanings. It also means, "Behold the Adi Shakti".

25:34.240 --> 25:39.880
It also means, "Behold the Mahalakshmi",

25:40.080 --> 25:42.560
means the channel.

25:42.720 --> 25:46.240
It also means that your principle of Mahalakshmi.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.960
So that's what He said.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.560
Because on the cross He was very much in pain,

25:50.800 --> 25:52.240
but He said, "Behold The Mother".

25:52.480 --> 25:55.800
And that is the significance that these

25:56.000 --> 26:00.640
people have to look after their Mahalakshmi principle

26:00.800 --> 26:06.400
and also they have to look after the

26:06.640 --> 26:10.800
ascent and the Adi Shakti.

26:10.960 --> 26:16.560
But this Mahalakshmi principle is there within us now awakened

26:16.720 --> 26:19.640
because they are all Sahaja Yogis and Kundalini has come up.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.640
But still we sometimes lose our balance.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.880
We go to the left or to the right

26:26.080 --> 26:28.480
There are some people in Sahaja Yoga,

26:28.640 --> 26:30.800
came to Sahaja Yoga and were making money and all that

26:31.000 --> 26:32.480
and they fell off.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.080
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

26:34.240 --> 26:37.240
we continue with all our nonsensical things.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.640
So if you have to ascend you must know that

26:39.800 --> 26:44.080
our Mahalakshmi principle has to be absolutely pure.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.160
And that purity we must achieve

26:46.320 --> 26:49.160
and we should put all our attention to our Sahasrara.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.960
Because in the Sahasrara they say

26:51.240 --> 26:53.880
Mahalakshmi becomes the Viratangana.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.240
Is the power of the Virata.

26:56.480 --> 27:01.480
Virata means that, you can say the

27:02.160 --> 27:04.960
Macrocosm. Macrocosm.

27:05.480 --> 27:09.080
So in the brain She becomes the Viratangana.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.080
And there She is to look after the brain.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.960
So this Mahalakshmi principle that enters into the brain

27:17.160 --> 27:20.160
and gives you new dimensions to your awareness.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.240
And also lot of knowledge, lot of knowledge that you know

27:24.400 --> 27:28.080
and you become really very dynamic.

27:28.320 --> 27:32.640
So the first thing that happens to you with Mahalakshmi principle

27:32.880 --> 27:35.000
that you become very intelligent

27:35.240 --> 27:38.880
and you start absorbing, absorbing many things

27:39.080 --> 27:40.320
which you would normally not do.

27:40.560 --> 27:45.000
For example, to sing Hindi song and Marathi song is not easy.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.880
But you have seen how Sahaja Yogis sing it so easily.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.160
Only Sahaja Yogis can sing nobody else can sing.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.880
So that shows that it gives you a new dimension.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.400
Also you know about so many musicians

27:57.640 --> 28:00.800
who have played before me and suddenly have become

28:00.960 --> 28:03.160
very great musicians and have become

28:03.320 --> 28:05.000
very well-known people in India.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.960
So all the musicians in India respect Me very much

28:08.160 --> 28:10.960
and they always want that I should listen to them.

28:11.160 --> 28:16.960
Also it happens in every area of our adventures.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.560
Like even it helps in your business.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.080
We have some business people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.880
now they have become tycoons.

28:24.080 --> 28:29.320
So the Mahalakshmi principle acts not only on our financial side,

28:29.560 --> 28:34.880
material side, also on our creative side.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.400
Become very creative in our art,

28:37.640 --> 28:42.480
in our expressions of our literature and all those things.

28:42.720 --> 28:46.080
So this principle is the main principle we have to stick on to

28:46.320 --> 28:50.000
is the Mahalakshmi principle and I'm very happy that in this day

28:50.240 --> 28:53.480
we are celebrating this Lakshmi puja,

28:53.640 --> 28:57.160
which ultimately has to become the Mahalakshmi puja.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.160
But problem is that still the people will... are still

29:01.320 --> 29:02.640
lost into these things

29:02.800 --> 29:05.480
which are very dangerous and are harmful.

29:05.720 --> 29:09.480
First of them is alcohol; alcohol is against Lakshmi.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.880
If alcohol comes from one side they say,

29:12.080 --> 29:14.400
the bottle comes from one door,

29:14.640 --> 29:18.000
the Lakshmi runs away from another much faster than.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
So you have seen that people who drink

29:20.400 --> 29:22.480
how their families are ruined and

29:22.640 --> 29:25.640
absolutely they don't have any money left.

29:25.880 --> 29:31.080
Another is this what you call is gambling.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.080
Gambling is absolutely against,

29:33.320 --> 29:36.880
because it's a disrespect of the, it is a disrespect

29:37.160 --> 29:39.720
of the Lakshmi Tattwa.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.800
Because Lakshmi should not be achieved by

29:43.960 --> 29:47.880
dwindling or by cheating

29:48.080 --> 29:53.320
or also by some sort of a trick or a play.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.400
That should not be done and when it is done,

29:55.560 --> 29:58.320
it is not respected, so she goes away.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.880
That's why a person who goes to races you'll find

30:02.080 --> 30:03.400
he can never be rich.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.080
Today he'll be rich, tomorrow he'll be a beggar.

30:06.320 --> 30:10.720
So all these things are in Sahaja Yoga even people who play these

30:10.880 --> 30:14.640
what you call share markets and stock markets and all that.

30:14.800 --> 30:19.000
Is against the Lakshmi principle. It doesn't work out.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.560
So the Lakshmi principle if it works out well,

30:22.720 --> 30:26.320
you can get out of the problem of money.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.720
But for that it is important

30:28.960 --> 30:33.000
that you have to meditate and cleanse your Nabhis.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.320
And the Nabhis are on the right side, I tell you,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.800
is of course is the Raja Lakshmi

30:39.000 --> 30:44.320
which is the dignity is the queen, I should say.

30:44.480 --> 30:48.560
But on the left hand side is the wife, the Gruha Lakshmi.

30:48.800 --> 30:54.240
And when the Gruha Lakshmi, the wives, are not sensible,

30:54.480 --> 30:57.960
if they don't understand their responsibility,

30:58.160 --> 31:02.560
said in Sanskrit "[SANSKRIT WORDS]":

31:02.880 --> 31:06.000
where the women are respectable and respected

31:06.320 --> 31:10.160
there only the Gods will reside.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.480
So what happens is that

31:13.720 --> 31:17.720
that when the house wives lose their dignity,

31:17.960 --> 31:20.000
lose their purpose,

31:20.240 --> 31:23.080
lose their aim in life,

31:23.320 --> 31:28.160
also become very wayward and stupid

31:28.400 --> 31:30.560
when they try to compete with men.

31:30.800 --> 31:35.720
Then the society starts getting disoriented.

31:35.960 --> 31:41.160
Gradually you find there is a great decline

31:41.320 --> 31:44.080
and a decadence of the society as such.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.160
Today we find in the west we can call it a decadent society,

31:47.400 --> 31:49.560
very decadent and for that I think

31:49.720 --> 31:51.960
the women of the west are responsible.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.560
If women had kept their feet on the grounds,

31:54.800 --> 31:56.880
it would never have become so decadent.

31:57.080 --> 32:00.480
But it has happened now, it's the responsibility

32:00.720 --> 32:03.720
of all the Sahaja Yoginis to be good housewives,

32:03.960 --> 32:07.720
to live with dharmic [UNAUDIBLE], to be kind to others,

32:07.960 --> 32:10.960
look after other Sahaja Yogis, I've already told them today,

32:11.160 --> 32:14.560
how they treat others and they are there to preserve.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.240
They are not there to dominate

32:16.480 --> 32:20.880
but to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

32:22.800 --> 32:27.320
Now in this place we have here maybe

32:28.000 --> 32:30.720
the 'purvajas' the 'forefathers',

32:30.960 --> 32:34.400
the [Stamatis] might have been doing some very dharmic things

32:34.640 --> 32:37.800
or might have been very religious people

32:38.000 --> 32:40.400
or might have been very God-fearing,

32:40.640 --> 32:43.560
that I could come here and we could do this Puja here.

32:43.800 --> 32:46.400
So it is according to their punyas,

32:46.560 --> 32:51.640
their good things which has brought this Puja here,

32:51.880 --> 32:55.240
and I'm sure they all will be blessed here

32:55.400 --> 32:57.480
and their souls will be happy;

32:57.720 --> 33:02.320
and that they will take their birth again to get their realization.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.560
So it's a very good thing to come here and

33:05.800 --> 33:08.560
achieve this puja here.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.480
I'm very much thankful to you all for coming down here

33:12.640 --> 33:16.960
because it's little far away from Athens, but

33:17.160 --> 33:20.080
such a peaceful and a beautiful place for a puja

33:20.320 --> 33:23.400
and as you see today is the first moon day,

33:23.560 --> 33:27.400
is a very auspicious day today and it's the

33:27.800 --> 33:30.960
Lakshmi which came out on the first night

33:31.160 --> 33:33.400
of the ‘Manthana' they say so.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.240
So she was brought out of the sea,

33:37.400 --> 33:39.560
Lakshmi was brought out of the sea.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.160
And one of the fourteen things that came out of the sea,

33:43.400 --> 33:45.560
one of them was the Lakshmi.

33:45.720 --> 33:49.240
And Greeks understood this and they

33:51.160 --> 33:54.880
worked very hard to have fleet of ships

33:55.080 --> 33:59.000
and they made their money only out of shipping activities,

33:59.240 --> 34:01.880
and so that shows that they had the idea

34:02.080 --> 34:05.320
about Lakshmi Tattwa very well.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.400
Athena was here and

34:09.560 --> 34:11.960
once I went and saw the museum man here

34:12.160 --> 34:16.560
and he told me that we are used to believe in Athena, in one Goddess.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.400
But when some Indians came and told us

34:19.640 --> 34:22.080
this one Goddess takes three forms.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.960
These are the three forms

34:24.160 --> 34:26.240
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.480
These are the three powers [...],

34:30.800 --> 34:32.880
Also, they must have heard about Kundalini,

34:33.080 --> 34:37.160
the way they put snake form.

34:37.480 --> 34:41.160
So it is important for us to start

34:41.320 --> 34:44.400
new traditions and

34:44.560 --> 34:47.400
new behavior and a

34:47.560 --> 34:50.720
and a new type of a society, a new race

34:50.960 --> 34:53.400
that people will see and know that

34:53.560 --> 34:56.240
these are the people who are really

34:56.400 --> 34:58.960
working on their Mahalakshmi principle.

34:59.160 --> 35:02.720
May God bless you all.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.880
Children have to come up to wash My Feet.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.000
All the children, all right.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.240
Come!

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:44.400
This is just the beginning of it, still not there.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.320
Be careful; there's a light behind you.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.560
My photograph is there, but photograph is missing.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.480
Vibrations here

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.480
This is how what happens to people. This little light

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.160
passes on to them.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.160
They are all Sahaja Yogis sitting.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.880
The lines are tying up everything.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.560
Mother says that the lines are tying everyone.

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.480
They form Omkara.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.800
Omkar looking like heart later on.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:18.640
Here the Omkara has taken the form of a heart.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.880
This is Ganesha.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.320
Here the light takes the form of Mother's name.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.000
You are all become one with Me.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.800
Mother says we all have become one with the Mother.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:21.080
All other lights don't show also.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.400
See how many lights from Mother and

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.560
other lights don't show on the photo.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.960
Omkara.............. [UNAUDIBLE]

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.640
I hope you have seen My last Sahasrara's

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:37.640
where the whole [UNAUDIBLE].

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.640
All of you should see them I think. I should carry them with Me.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.560
I know.. deities, once there are so many photographs.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.080
Temple of Athena and Surya; too much of Surya heat.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.640
Zeus.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.960
So it is very good today because

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.720
after all Lakshmi is a......

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.960
Zeus is the Parashurama Avatar

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.320
and the Mahalakshmi.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.000
These are the vases from Italy.

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.960
Hello! What is this?

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.880
Such a funny present it is.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.880
Quite interesting. There is a door

01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.320
It has a center Nabhi and full of honey like you.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.160
which You have been giving all the time.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.400
What is this inside... is honey?

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.640
Oh a bottle of honey. There is Nabhi there.

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.240
It is beautiful. It is not funny. Very interesting.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:02.480
The Finnish Yoginis baked some bread for you themselves.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.800
But because the puja was delayed, so it got dried little bit [UNAUDIBLE]

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960
Can I have?

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.080
It is just a symbolic gift for You, Mother.

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.720
I can have.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.160
Very good.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.320
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.800
What is this for water? Sharbath [SYRUPY COOL DRINK]

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.560
This is coral.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:38.800
That she didn't know how to paint and suddenly she asked Me.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:46.400
She didn't know how to paint she just asked My [UNAUDIBLE]

01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:50.240
Spontaneously she painted this.

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.960
She didn't know how to paint and what to paint,

01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.640
and suddenly she has the

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:29.320
Dolphins symbolize Shri Vishnu.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.400
Shri Mataji!

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.800
The dolphin symbolize friendship

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.480
and this is from Greek, from Knossos.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.400
Not only.... evolution

01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:52.640
Dolphin was the first fish which came out of Mother Earth.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:58.080
See Vishnu took the form of dolphin also.

01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:10.800
No let her also hold,

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.800
come along, all the children have to hold it.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.480
Every child has to hold it, all right.

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.480
It's beautiful.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.400
This is from children?

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:28.640
Thank you very much.

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.560
Who is Shailaja?

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:49.080
What is your name?

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:54.320
Janaki.

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.320
Janaki come!

01:52:57.640 --> 01:52:59.400
Shri Mataji is calling.

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.880
Who is Radhika?

01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:05.240
Beautiful Radhika!

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:07.720
You have done so well!

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:10.160
Isn't it?

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.560
Who is Radhika 5 years?

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.240
Who is Kamala?

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:28.720
Where is Kamala?

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.000
She's not here?

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:44.080
She's sleeping.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.560
Who is Ganesha?

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:55.160
From Spain. What was the fight going on?

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.320
Where is Niranand?

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:11.640
That’s Radhika? Ah! Beautifully you have done it.

01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:14.960
Where is little Shakti?

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:17.880
She is sleeping

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.960
Where is Jain?

01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.320
They're all sleeping?

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.320
Who is Vidya?

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.480
What's your name?

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:36.560
Thank you very much for the nice puja.
