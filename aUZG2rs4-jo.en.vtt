00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.320
Today we are going to celebrate the Puja of Lakshmi

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.960
And I've already told you that

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.240
Lakshmi came out of the sea.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.480
And Greece is the Nabhi of the universe.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.720
And whatever Lakshmi they have got, wealth,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.480
they have got it out of the sea faring activities there.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.720
So it is very apt that we should worship Lakshmi in Greece

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.320
and understand what is the significance of Lakshmi is.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.560
Can you hear me there, all of you?

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.480
Now I've described many a time,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.080
but, again I will describe it to you.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.400
Lakshmi is the one who is a Mother by nature.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.960
So a person who has Lakshmi, a person who has got wealth

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.320
must have a motherly

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.240
benevolent temperament; that's one thing.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.160
Then another thing is that She stands on the lotus in the water.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.240
So a person who has got Lakshmi must have a balance.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.720
If he moves this side or that side, left or right side

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.320
he immediately goes inside the bhavasagar.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.880
Secondly, Her one hand is giving

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.080
and another hand there is protection like this.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.400
So, at least a person who has got Lakshmi money

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.560
should be generous, he should be giving

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.160
and right hand should protect all the people

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.320
who are working under him or who are related to him,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.720
his relations or other things

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.800
or any other organizations or anything that he is connected with

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.720
he should try to patronize and protect it from all kinds of dangers.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.800
The second part is that

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.960
one hand of the Lakshmi has got a book in Her hand,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.080
and another has,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.720
no, second part is the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880
two hands of the Lakshmi which are on top of head

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
have got two lotuses in Her hand.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.400
That shows a person who is rich

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.320
should have a heart like a lotus.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.560
A lotus heart is like this that even a very

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.960
thorny type of an insect comes to the lotus in the night to sleep,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.240
the lotus opens its own petals and allows that

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.800
thorny type of an insect to sleep

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.240
in the very cozy way on the corona of the lotus

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.160
so that he sleeps well there, comfort him.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.560
In the same way, a person who is very rich should have a capacity

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.160
to

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.240
allow guests to come in his house

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.160
and to see to the comfort of the guests;

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.960
whatever may be the status of that guest,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.240
whatever may be the situation of that guest,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.240
but that is immaterial.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.160
What is important is that he's your guest

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.880
and you have to look after that guest

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.160
and whatever he asked for you must provide him.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.080
Of course in the modern times it's all vanished into thin air.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.160
But we have so many examples in India

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.080
where once a guest came like that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.880
and asked that he would like to eat the flesh

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.080
of the child of the king.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.080
So the king said all right you can have the flesh,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.160
and he cooked the flesh

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.560
and gave it to the guest. And guest was nobody else but

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.720
it was Shri Krishna. You can say Shri Vishnu.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.960
And after five minutes he called the name of the boy

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.960
and the boy came running to the parents.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.800
There are so many stories.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.080
Another one is Harishchandra who had a guest who came

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.800
as Vamana. It's again Shri Vishnu to take his test.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.000
And he asked

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.080
for all his kingdom.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.080
So Harishchandra gave him all his kingdom

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.640
and went into the forest with his wife and suffered a lot.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.240
But in that sufferings he got his moksha

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.160
and he got again complete reward

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.320
of his kingdom and everything. He is very much purified.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.960
And also there is a king

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.320
of this coming to a king

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.720
Shri Vishnu as Vamana.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.800
and he asked

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.240
that you have to give me land

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.240
which is measured by my three steps.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.240
Bali was the king. He said: "All right, whatever you say".

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.960
So with one foot he touched the sky;

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.400
with another foot he touched the Mother Earth.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.560
The third foot he put on Bali's head and put him in the pathala,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.240
in the lower world.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.480
And that's how Vamana Avathara came.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.960
And like that we have various such examples in India.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.880
that when the guests are there how we are to treat them

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.240
and how we have to be absolutely subservient

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.320
and absolutely looking after.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.720
And it should be an honor for us to see our Sahaj Culture.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.480
This is our Sahaj Culture is.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.800
But what I find, that in the modern times,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.400
people just don't like this because people have become very selfish.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.160
But it is always reciprocal.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.800
If you have guests in your house and you look after them

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.320
then it is always rewarded back, always

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.880
in so many ways.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.400
In My own lifetime I have seen that

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.080
even slightest help you give to someone

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.720
how it comes back to you in a very big way.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.080
For example, there were..

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.880
Lenin can't you sit properly? Is it Lenin?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.640
Whose child?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.320
Are you not Sahaja Yogis?

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.960
Whose child is this one?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.400
She's a new Sahaja Yogini?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.880
Now if the children misbehave,  we'll ask them to go out of Puja,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.080
all right?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.560
Children must behave themselves and sit quietly, all of you.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.800
So once I was sitting outside my house and

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.640
I was knitting something in Delhi

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.080
and three people came

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.880
and they said that, "We have no place to go to, we are refugees,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.480
and you have such a big house, you can give us a room,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.000
we would be very thankful".

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.400
And I had house which had a room which was just outside,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.320
it was in no way connected to the house.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.480
So I said: "All right, doesn't matter. You can stay with us.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.800
The vibrations you are giving - nice people

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.720
you are not telling lies.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.160
In the evening My brother came and My husband came

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.960
and both of them said, now what sort of people these are,

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.320
God knows, and what will they  do to us, this and that, very angry.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.800
I said, now I've given them the house, all right.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.640
It is my responsibility.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.720
One month they were very much worried.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.640
They cannot come inside the house. They are outside.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.240
"What is the harm, they are refugees, let them stay."

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.480
They stayed on.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.560
Actually they were very talented people.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.960
And then there was one Muslim man. And there were riots.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.560
After this whole trouble there was a riot,

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.800
really of a very bad nature.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.720
And all these Sikh people came to my house,

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.080
and they said we have heard there's Muslims stay here.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.720
I told them there is none.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.960
They said: "How can you say that?"

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.560
I said: "You see I am wearing such big bindhi; I am myself a Hindu.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.640
Why will I keep a Muslim in my house?

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.000
You get away from here. If you have to

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.400
misbehave then I'll call the police."

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.640
So this man was saved you see

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.640
and after that what happened that I just lost them;

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.480
they went away, they got some jobs.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.080
Then the lady who came, became a very great actress.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.960
And the man, the Muslim gentleman

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:41.400
who was a poet [Shahid Udyami?]

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.800
He was a great poet and

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.800
after many years, see, we wanted to make a film

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.800
and they wanted this lady to become mother in that film.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.960
I said I will not ask her.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.240
She doesn't know Me that I am here,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.080
and otherwise she will have to agree

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.800
because she'll feel obliged to Me.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.080
I just don't want to say anything.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.560
If you want you can approach her and don't tell her my name.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.160
So, when they went to her she said

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.480
"No, no I can't do it", and this and that, you know.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.400
So, they said all right you come to the opening ceremony

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.400
then we'll see you if like it or not.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.240
She was saying: "I need a sari, you have to give me a sari",

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.320
this, that and all those things she was demanding

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.720
and so much money.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.160
So she came for the opening of that film.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.560
She saw me sitting,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.640
she just came to me hugged me and started crying.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.640
"How are you here? What are you doing here?

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.640
After such a long time I am meeting you here.", this and that.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.880
They told that, "She's the one who wants to make this film.”

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.640
"Oh My God!", she said, " You didn't tell me.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.640
What a sin I've committed.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.880
I would give my life for this lady.”, and all,

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:03.480
and they were so surprised, and that's how the film was made.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.320
So small things you do good to somebody you see

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.320
it comes out in many ways.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.880
Even if you are kind to people who are supposed to be

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.720
not so good people say I think it works

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:21.560
Like Me I was... one boy was very badly hurt: here,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.800
bandage here, bandage here and bandage there,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.320
standing there and he told Me that, “I have no work,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.800
can I come and work with You?”  I said: “all right, come along”.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.480
So I put him in the car and brought him home.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.400
So as usual My brother and My husband got very angry with Me.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.800
"Who is this one you brought in? Who is he?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.640
After all...", this and that.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.880
I said: "It's all right, I'll treat him, I will put him right,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.320
then it's all right.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.800
I was treating him, they said: "You must go to the police,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.400
you must send him to the police.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.640
Might be, he might have run away from police.", whatever.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.560
It happened about 8 days that he got cured.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.560
I said: "Let him get cured and then leave". He was much better;

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.160
and that day at night he ran away from the house.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.640
Because they were forcing him to go.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.640
And he took away all My husband's money, his coats, and suits

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.800
and My brother's everything that he had

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.240
and My ornaments were lying there he didn't touch anything.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.320
In the morning these two got up,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.160
this your nephew has run away?  I said "Yes, but what?"

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.800
"He's run away with all our things; our shoes, our coats and pants

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.480
and your things he has not touched." Even My ornaments,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.320
gold ornaments were lying on the table, he didn't touch anything.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.240
I said: "This is the thing you must learn.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.720
Why were you after his life? After all he was doing well,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.160
you were after his life."

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.960
So he has to prove that he has, you go to the police.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.320
But, this is the way you are going to do it.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.880
So many things like this happen in life.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.240
It's so interesting to see how and

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.240
you suddenly come across somebody and

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.720
they tell you, "Oh you don't remember?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.800
I have been this and I have been that, You have helped me so much."

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.160
So always if you are generous,

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.800
you are always fed back by someone.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.800
Like if you open one door breeze won't come.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.560
If you open the second door the breeze starts coming in.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.080
So this is one of the qualities of the person who is a Lakshmipathi,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.320
the one who has money to give and to protect.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.320
Now most of the people who are rich people

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.960
are extremely harsh with their servants,

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.080
the people who depend on them, very aggressive and

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.720
start trying to torture.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.160
But in the long run it doesn't pay.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.640
I have seen it. See if you try to be very careful,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.400
like in My house, my servants will never leave me.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.400
I mean, I don't know, everybody used to say:

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.160
"Our servant has run away",

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.240
somebody would say, doesn't want to stay and

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.800
we have had three servants, five servants.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.080
If I had one servant he would last me

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.640
till I actually died like that.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.480
I used to wonder what is the problem with these people.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.240
Actually, in the beginning they would come,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.720
they would be very hungry, I would leave everything open to them.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.640
Eat as much as you like.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.240
They used to eat everything and they would feel very much satisfied.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.720
Then Oh! It's too much.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.640
And whatever you may leave in the fridge, anybody would not eat it.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.080
So everything used to be open in my house. Never closed.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.720
They wanted to eat rice they can eat.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.160
Whatever they wanted to do they can do.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.960
And then they became part and parcel of the household and

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.400
they started looking after everything very well.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.400
They would never steal anything, never eat anything like that,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.080
and no problems. While others lock everything,

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.160
even the salt they would lock.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.080
And count everything and very strict with the servant

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.800
and their servants would run away after 3 days or 4 days.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.880
And they would have servants problems. I never had, anywhere.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.800
So this is it that one has to understand that

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.880
how you,

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.320
those people who are your near and dear,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.240
how you treat them, your neighbors, your friends,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.400
those people who are dependent on you. Now somebody dependent on you

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.720
then people try to show down that person.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.080
All the time show in a way

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.720
that the person feels very much humiliated.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.800
Then when he gets out of that house, he takes a revenge.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.560
And he ill-treats them.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.720
So this protection has to be there.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.880
Now She's standing on a lotus, means

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.240
on something that is very beautifully made but very delicate.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.160
So She handles people very delicately.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.000
And on a balance She is.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.560
Now when people have money, they go into imbalances very easily.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.240
You give somebody some money,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.240
immediately he will go to a pub, get drunk,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.400
will have five, six women around him

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.400
or if she's a woman,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.240
she'll run after men and do all kinds of things.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.080
So money is very

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.800
very, I should say, a very dangerous thing,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.560
because, it gives you imbalance. It gives you terrible imbalance.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.560
If you have money, too much money,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.560
then you work through to such imbalances

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.560
that you cannot get over it.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.800
And one has to be very careful.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.560
You must have seen people who have money,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.160
how their children get spoiled,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.720
how husband get spoiled, wife get spoiled.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.480
All kinds of things are there.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.160
So money has a very big spoiling effect.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.160
And so she stands on the lotus

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.160
and anybody who goes into imbalances, falls into the bhavasagar.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.800
Because the Lakshmi is as you know the consort of Vishnu.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.640
And She's

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.400
resides with the, on the sea.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.880
So now the word ‘Marine'.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.480
'Marine' has come also from the same, because we call Her 'Maria'.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.720
Maria is Mahalakshmi.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.880
She, the word comes from the marine,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.960
because She was born out of the sea,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.240
and that's why we call Her Maria.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.960
Now this she's born, this Mahalakshmi is a higher principle.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.400
When a person gets into balance and

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.960
behaves like a Lakshmipathi and has all

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.880
the affluence, he is dharmic and sensible,

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.080
then what happens that he develops another

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.720
principle within himself starts manifesting, is the Mahalakshmi.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:41.240
The Mahalakshmi is the thing that you start seeking the spirit.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.240
This Mahalakshmi principle is very important

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.240
and it's also the parasympathetic nervous system

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.560
is looked after by Mahalaksmi principle

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.880
and the whole of Sushumna is nothing but Mahalakshmi.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.720
So when this principle is awakened within us

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.240
then you start seeking. They are satisfied people

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:05.080
who do not go hankering after others' things

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.480
do not become greedy, and we do not try to acquire the things

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.000
that belong to others and

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.240
all other kinds of illegal things we do for money

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.480
or these people now, this I saw the boat

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.240
searching out those who are smuggling drugs

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.400
so that it's all mad things

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.240
because this is no use; what will they do with so much money?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.080
But, the greed goes on and on and on there's no end to it

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.000
That's why people do all kinds of bad things to get money.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.480
But  money never gives you joy, if it had given joy

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.080
then people would have been happy, but they're not.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.240
So the Mahalakshmi principle rises where you try to find beyond.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.880
Of course the Mahalakshmi principle you do get

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.800
all kinds of comforts and all kinds of blessings.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.800
But you get blessings also anyway but you do not hanker after it.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.480
And you do not deprive people of their things

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.400
or sort of they do not tax them with money.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.160
You are not bothered and the money runs after you.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.480
When you are in the Mahalakshmi condition

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.480
then said that Lakshmi comes and fills the water in your house,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.160
like that. So then there's no problem.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.240
The Mahalakshmi principle is the one which gives you

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.480
all kinds of things which you get all as of fame

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.000
then also the

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.800
victory also success,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.400
also satisfaction, dignity

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.480
and Aiswarya is a wealth which is dignified.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.320
All this you can have if your Mahalakshmi principle is awakened.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.320
And then through Mahalakshmi principle only

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.800
you get your realization.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.160
So now in India, for example, there are three temples of

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.800
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswathi.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.560
The Mahalakshmi temple is in Kolapur,

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.000
which is a swayambu means just come out of the mother earth.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.240
And is there, the principle is there.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.320
And this Mahalakshmi temple

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.720
there people go and sing the song of this Namadeva's,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.720
which you sing ‘Jogwa' yoga pray, because only

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.640
in the Mahalakshmi channel, which is the Sushumna,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.240
‘Ambe' is the Kundalini has to rise.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.240
That's why they sing the song that you be

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.800
this... in the Mahalakshmi channel

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.720
let the Kundalini rise, that is Ude Ude Ambe,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.640
means “Oh Kundalini you rise”.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.080
But they sing it in Mahalakshmi temple.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.400
Not in the temple of any other, Mahakali or any other

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.640
but in the temple of Mahalakshmi

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.640
and people didn't understand why in the temple of Mahalakshmi

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.240
these people go and sing.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.960
Because only in the Mahalakshmi temple is,

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.800
in the Mahalakshmi channel,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.720
this Kundalini has to rise and get awakened.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.240
Now this Mahalakshmi principle first was manifested

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.960
at the time of Shri Rama as Sita.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:25.800
Then it was manifested later on Mahalakshmi principle as

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.240
Radha, Ra dha. Ra means energy, dha means the one

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.000
who sustains the energy.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.400
So it manifested as Radha.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.960
And then it manifested as 'Maria', Christ's Mother.

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.640
She's Radha herself, but She created her own child.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.400
As Radha created, she, you see

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.720
it's all described in the 'Devi Mahatmyam'

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.240
that Radha, how she created the form

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.160
and she also created her own child which is

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.160
our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.800
So this is how Mahalakshmi principle

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.480
manifested best in the life of Maria.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.160
And then this Maria kept quiet.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.160
She never said She was anything.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.560
But Christ did say about Her,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.240
and on the cross He said, "Behold the Mother".

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.240
Means the Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi...

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.560
should see to Mahalakshmi. The Mahalakshmi.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.080
It has many meanings. It also means, "Behold the Adi Shakti".

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.880
It also means, "Behold the Mahalakshmi",

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.560
means the channel.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.240
It also means that your principle of Mahalakshmi.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.960
So that's what He said.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.560
Because on the cross He was very much in pain,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.240
but He said, "Behold The Mother".

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.800
And that is the significance that these

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.640
people have to look after their Mahalakshmi principle

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.400
and also they have to look after the

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.800
ascent and the Adi Shakti.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.560
But this Mahalakshmi principle is there within us now awakened

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.640
because they are all Sahaja Yogis and Kundalini has come up.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.640
But still we sometimes lose our balance.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.880
We go to the left or to the right

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.480
There are some people in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.800
came to Sahaja Yoga and were making money and all that

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.480
and they fell off.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.080
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.240
we continue with all our nonsensical things.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.640
So if you have to ascend you must know that

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.080
our Mahalakshmi principle has to be absolutely pure.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.160
And that purity we must achieve

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.160
and we should put all our attention to our Sahasrara.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.960
Because in the Sahasrara they say

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.880
Mahalakshmi becomes the Viratangana.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.240
Is the power of the Virata.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.480
Virata means that, you can say the

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.960
Macrocosm. Macrocosm.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.080
So in the brain She becomes the Viratangana.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.080
And there She is to look after the brain.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.960
So this Mahalakshmi principle that enters into the brain

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.160
and gives you new dimensions to your awareness.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.240
And also lot of knowledge, lot of knowledge that you know

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.080
and you become really very dynamic.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.640
So the first thing that happens to you with Mahalakshmi principle

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.000
that you become very intelligent

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.880
and you start absorbing, absorbing many things

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.320
which you would normally not do.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.000
For example, to sing Hindi song and Marathi song is not easy.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.880
But you have seen how Sahaja Yogis sing it so easily.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.160
Only Sahaja Yogis can sing nobody else can sing.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.880
So that shows that it gives you a new dimension.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.400
Also you know about so many musicians

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.800
who have played before me and suddenly have become

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.160
very great musicians and have become

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.000
very well-known people in India.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.960
So all the musicians in India respect Me very much

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.960
and they always want that I should listen to them.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.960
Also it happens in every area of our adventures.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.560
Like even it helps in your business.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.080
We have some business people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.880
now they have become tycoons.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.320
So the Mahalakshmi principle acts not only on our financial side,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.880
material side, also on our creative side.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.400
Become very creative in our art,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.480
in our expressions of our literature and all those things.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.080
So this principle is the main principle we have to stick on to

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.000
is the Mahalakshmi principle and I'm very happy that in this day

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.480
we are celebrating this Lakshmi puja,

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.160
which ultimately has to become the Mahalakshmi puja.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.160
But problem is that still the people will... are still

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.640
lost into these things

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.480
which are very dangerous and are harmful.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.480
First of them is alcohol; alcohol is against Lakshmi.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.880
If alcohol comes from one side they say,

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.400
the bottle comes from one door,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.000
the Lakshmi runs away from another much faster than.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.240
So you have seen that people who drink

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.480
how their families are ruined and

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.640
absolutely they don't have any money left.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.080
Another is this what you call is gambling.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.080
Gambling is absolutely against,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.880
because it's a disrespect of the, it is a disrespect

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.720
of the Lakshmi Tattwa.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.800
Because Lakshmi should not be achieved by

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.880
dwindling or by cheating

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.320
or also by some sort of a trick or a play.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.400
That should not be done and when it is done,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.320
it is not respected, so she goes away.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.880
That's why a person who goes to races you'll find

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.400
he can never be rich.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.080
Today he'll be rich, tomorrow he'll be a beggar.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.720
So all these things are in Sahaja Yoga even people who play these

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.640
what you call share markets and stock markets and all that.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.000
Is against the Lakshmi principle. It doesn't work out.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.560
So the Lakshmi principle if it works out well,

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.320
you can get out of the problem of money.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.720
But for that it is important

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:33.000
that you have to meditate and cleanse your Nabhis.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.320
And the Nabhis are on the right side, I tell you,

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.800
is of course is the Raja Lakshmi

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.320
which is the dignity is the queen, I should say.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.560
But on the left hand side is the wife, the Gruha Lakshmi.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:54.240
And when the Gruha Lakshmi, the wives, are not sensible,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.960
if they don't understand their responsibility,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.560
said in Sanskrit "[SANSKRIT WORDS]":

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.000
where the women are respectable and respected

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.160
there only the Gods will reside.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.480
So what happens is that

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.720
that when the house wives lose their dignity,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.000
lose their purpose,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.080
lose their aim in life,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.160
also become very wayward and stupid

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.560
when they try to compete with men.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.720
Then the society starts getting disoriented.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:41.160
Gradually you find there is a great decline

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.080
and a decadence of the society as such.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.160
Today we find in the west we can call it a decadent society,

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.560
very decadent and for that I think

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.960
the women of the west are responsible.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.560
If women had kept their feet on the grounds,

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.880
it would never have become so decadent.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.480
But it has happened now, it's the responsibility

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.720
of all the Sahaja Yoginis to be good housewives,

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.720
to live with dharmic [UNAUDIBLE], to be kind to others,

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.960
look after other Sahaja Yogis, I've already told them today,

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.560
how they treat others and they are there to preserve.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.240
They are not there to dominate

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.880
but to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:27.320
Now in this place we have here maybe

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.720
the 'purvajas' the 'forefathers',

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.400
the [Stamatis] might have been doing some very dharmic things

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.800
or might have been very religious people

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.400
or might have been very God-fearing,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.560
that I could come here and we could do this Puja here.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.400
So it is according to their punyas,

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.640
their good things which has brought this Puja here,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.240
and I'm sure they all will be blessed here

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.480
and their souls will be happy;

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.320
and that they will take their birth again to get their realization.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.560
So it's a very good thing to come here and

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.560
achieve this puja here.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:12.480
I'm very much thankful to you all for coming down here

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.960
because it's little far away from Athens, but

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.080
such a peaceful and a beautiful place for a puja

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.400
and as you see today is the first moon day,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.400
is a very auspicious day today and it's the

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.960
Lakshmi which came out on the first night

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.400
of the ‘Manthana' they say so.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.240
So she was brought out of the sea,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.560
Lakshmi was brought out of the sea.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.160
And one of the fourteen things that came out of the sea,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.560
one of them was the Lakshmi.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.240
And Greeks understood this and they

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.880
worked very hard to have fleet of ships

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.000
and they made their money only out of shipping activities,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.880
and so that shows that they had the idea

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.320
about Lakshmi Tattwa very well.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.400
Athena was here and

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.960
once I went and saw the museum man here

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.560
and he told me that we are used to believe in Athena, in one Goddess.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.400
But when some Indians came and told us

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.080
this one Goddess takes three forms.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.960
These are the three forms

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.240
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.480
These are the three powers [...],

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.880
Also, they must have heard about Kundalini,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.160
the way they put snake form.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.160
So it is important for us to start

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.400
new traditions and

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.400
new behavior and a

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.720
and a new type of a society, a new race

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.400
that people will see and know that

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.240
these are the people who are really

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.960
working on their Mahalakshmi principle.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.720
May God bless you all.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.880
Children have to come up to wash My Feet.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.000
All the children, all right.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.240
Come!

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:44.400
This is just the beginning of it, still not there.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.320
Be careful; there's a light behind you.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.560
My photograph is there, but photograph is missing.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.480
Vibrations here

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.480
This is how what happens to people. This little light

01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:40.160
passes on to them.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:44.160
They are all Sahaja Yogis sitting.

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.880
The lines are tying up everything.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.560
Mother says that the lines are tying everyone.

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.480
They form Omkara.

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:59.800
Omkar looking like heart later on.

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:18.640
Here the Omkara has taken the form of a heart.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.880
This is Ganesha.

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.320
Here the light takes the form of Mother's name.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.000
You are all become one with Me.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:59.800
Mother says we all have become one with the Mother.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:21.080
All other lights don't show also.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.400
See how many lights from Mother and

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.560
other lights don't show on the photo.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.960
Omkara.............. [UNAUDIBLE]

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:31.640
I hope you have seen My last Sahasrara's

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:37.640
where the whole [UNAUDIBLE].

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:50.640
All of you should see them I think. I should carry them with Me.

01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.560
I know.. deities, once there are so many photographs.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:26.080
Temple of Athena and Surya; too much of Surya heat.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.640
Zeus.

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.960
So it is very good today because

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.720
after all Lakshmi is a......

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.960
Zeus is the Parashurama Avatar

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.320
and the Mahalakshmi.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.000
These are the vases from Italy.

01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:52.960
Hello! What is this?

01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:54.880
Such a funny present it is.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.880
Quite interesting. There is a door

01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.320
It has a center Nabhi and full of honey like you.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.160
which You have been giving all the time.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.400
What is this inside... is honey?

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.640
Oh a bottle of honey. There is Nabhi there.

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.240
It is beautiful. It is not funny. Very interesting.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:02.480
The Finnish Yoginis baked some bread for you themselves.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:06.800
But because the puja was delayed, so it got dried little bit [UNAUDIBLE]

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960
Can I have?

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.080
It is just a symbolic gift for You, Mother.

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.720
I can have.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:29.160
Very good.

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.320
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:04.800
What is this for water? Sharbath [SYRUPY COOL DRINK]
