00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:37.750
Today we have such a great opportunity to
celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.420
He was born in a manger.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.110
All these things are already pre-planned.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:02.989
That He should be born in a manger in difficult
situations, to show that whether you are born

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:13.352
poor or rich, whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems, if you have Divinity within

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:19.060
you it shines by itself.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:37.700
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated
line, they have never been able to understand

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.759
the significance of Christ.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:51.960
To them immaculate conception is absolutely
not possible.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.009
Most of the people think that it's some sort
of a mythical story.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:19.150
But in India we do believe that Gauri created
Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations and

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.260
that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.340
We accept it.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.490
But not in the West.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.360
They will never accept such a thing because
their mental side is over-developed and dominates

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.960
them.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:52.599
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians
to understand that above all He is God.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.980
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:08.580
Moreover, the way Christianity has been, it
has not provided any proper guidance.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:16.290
On the contrary wherever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.640
But it's very simple to understand for Indians,
that anything is possible for God.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.439
After all He is God.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.480
He is God Almighty.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:40.611
Because of this mental attitude which is much
lower than the knowledge of your spirit, the

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:51.239
ordinary, mundane type of the superficial
knowledge can never allow the personality

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.860
to accept the greatness of God.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.010
I had a grandma.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:10.340
She was My father's aunt and she used to tell
us a nice story about somebody who was going

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.340
to meet God.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.319
Of course this - in India everybody understands
all these things.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.799
They will not say: "How he is going to meet
God?"

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.840
but they accept.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.829
All right, he is going to meet God.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.890
So when he was going on the way, on the road,
he found one gentleman sitting there nicely

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:35.190
singing songs, bhajans of God, doing nothing
on the roadside.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.120
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet
God?"

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.910
"Yes, I am going to meet Him.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.470
So have you any message for Him?"

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.900
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,
but He should arrange for my food, because

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.360
I think the food is now finishing."

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.449
He said: "Really, that's what you want me
to tell Him?"

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.500
"Yes, yes, please tell Him.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.210
Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell
Him."

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.646
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian

00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:11.646
way I would say he was going to church every
day with nice suits, and singing hymns every

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:14.380
day, listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say; and in the Indian way

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.690
we can say he was going to the temple every
day, standing on his head, doing all kinds

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.690
of yoga asanas and everything.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.690
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've
tried everything.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.560
When is He going to meet me?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.940
I would like to see Him.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.710
I would like to have His darshan."

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.919
He said: "All right."

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:40.880
So he went to God, and whatever work he had
he finished with it, and then God asked him:

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.490
"Have you got anything to tell Me?"

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:50.800
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman
while coming and he said that 'I'm doing all

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.810
kinds of things, I have tried everything,
and when will God meet me?

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.139
I am standing on my head, and I am doing also
all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.100
things, and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying, doing all sorts of prayers,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.100
but when will God meet me?'"

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:13.449
So God said: "Tell him he has to do a little
more.

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.530
See, it's not easy.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:30.340
When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.840
So then even he said: "And there is another
one who was on the road, You see.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.740
As he was just enjoying himself singing songs,
he suddenly saw me, and he told me: 'You see,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.700
my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange
it for me.'"

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.270
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?"

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.470
Immediately God said: "What are you doing,
why don't you go and look after him?

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.470
His food is finishing."

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.940
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged
it, all that."

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.250
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter."

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.440
You see, he couldn't understand, you know,
that this fellow who is trying all these things

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.849
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.510
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that, and why is it so much

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:16.540
impressed by this another fellow who is doing
nothing to seek God?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.270
So then God realized that he is in some sort
of an illusion.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.280
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:32.020
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there was that He

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:40.270
made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.819
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:46.910
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the
reaction."

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.910
So he went down.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.169
So this is, the first one met him, he said:
"What God has said?"

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:55.310
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja
Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.039
Before that you'll go around like this."

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.479
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.130
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.400
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.979
And he was quite disappointed.

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:11.720
So he went.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.699
And he asked him that: "What did you see with,
there when you went to see God?"

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:22.770
He said: "I saw that, you know, He passed
a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.259
He said: "What?

00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:26.259
How is it possible?

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:27.259
It's impossible!"

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:28.259
(Now mental.)

00:08:28.259 --> 00:08:33.219
"How is it possible, that a camel gets passed
through the eye, it's not possible, see the

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:36.150
volume of this one and such a little thing.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.190
How can he pass?

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:42.030
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story
because you have been to God, you are trying

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.180
to show off, that's all.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.110
I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.480
It's.. you are just telling me lies, and don't
try to befool me."

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.310
So he went to another person who was on the
street eating nicely.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.910
He said: "How are you?"

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.900
"I know He had arranged before you reached
there, I know it was all right after all.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.810
You see He looks after me all the time.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.339
So what did you see when you went there?"

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:10.920
He said: "I saw that God Almighty passed a
camel through an eye of a needle.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.979
It's a very amazing thing."

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:13.979
He said: "What, amazing?

00:09:13.979 --> 00:09:16.360
He is God, do you know He is God?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.740
Do you know He is God?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.300
God can do anything.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.040
He can do anything!"

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:35.110
That's made him understand, that if you understand
that God is all-powerful, all-powerful, it

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.480
doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to
Maharashtra.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:52.280
It doesn't mean that!

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.930
But it means He is all powerful.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:10:02.530
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing,
and such things which our brain, this mental

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.839
side cannot understand.

00:10:04.839 --> 00:10:09.870
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:17.000
This is what God is.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.810
He's the One who has created human beings.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.650
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.250
If a potter creates a pot that means he is
beyond the pot.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.549
Pot cannot create God.. the potter.

00:10:27.549 --> 00:10:36.770
And the potter has created the pot, so that
means that this pot which is created by him

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:42.690
has to be something which is made by him,
so he has to be much more powerful than the

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.980
pot is.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:57.800
But it is unbelievable, or say beyond the
conception of human beings, that what a God

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:05.790
it must be Who has made this great computer.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.220
We take everything for granted.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:16.010
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.790
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot
make.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.910
Ha, if there is some stone, all right you
can put this up.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.150
If there is some clay you can make some sort
of a house out of it.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.030
That's all dead from the dead.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:43.230
But can you make a candle which will burn
badhas?

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:55.569
You have seen it with your own eyes that before
My photograph the badhas burn.

00:11:55.569 --> 00:12:00.490
Can you do that?

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:15.559
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the
complete, intricate working, delicate machinery,

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:24.860
and also very dynamic explosive machinery,
how it works to create human beings, to create

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:31.560
all this universe, to create all these beautiful
flowers and trees and everything.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.790
Look at the stars.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:38.040
Look at how many they are.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:43.610
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.850
How He has made it?

00:12:48.850 --> 00:13:00.140
When He wants to send His own Son, He can
send it the way He wants to send it.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:15.709
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind
which is in, absolutely in mud.

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:25.150
So to accept it is only possible when you
have saints, real saints who tell you, that

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:32.579
this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:44.310
But to jump into it, into faith, when you
come to Sahaja Yoga you start seeing miracles

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.650
taking place.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:53.699
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place and if there is another miracle

00:13:53.699 --> 00:13:57.419
that has to take place it will take place
in any case.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:01.329
We are not doing anything, it is all done.

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:04.959
And we don't doubt it.

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:15.550
Once you doubt you become again the same human
being which is just embedded in the mud.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:22.120
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.100
You are not flying in the air.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.910
Your roots are down there.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:37.730
But you are now lotuses, and that's what is
on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.190
is born.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:52.819
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came
on this earth as Sitaji, as Radha and also

00:14:52.819 --> 00:14:58.829
as Mary, as Mother Mary.

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:03.360
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of
the sea.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.150
What is the meaning of "Mary"?

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:11.230
Maria means, you know, Mare means "the sea".

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.290
She was born out of the sea.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:22.430
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could
create a child.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.520
What's the harm?

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:35.250
She could do anything, and this is the thing
you have to rise above.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:41.970
Christians have to rise above this Christianity,
and has to understand that it's such a great

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:47.380
thing that was Christ Who came on this earth,
Who was the Incarnation of the principle of

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.480
Ganesha.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:56.790
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big
thing which one should try to understand.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:02.450
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:18.370
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created
before creating anything, any atmosphere,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:28.480
anything, because He is the Omkara, and the
Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480
from Shiva.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.610
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:41.069
From there started Omkara and He is the One
Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:50.069
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,
was created first foremost thing, just to

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:53.579
create holiness [SOUNDS LIKE povitrada].

00:16:53.579 --> 00:17:00.560
When this holiness was created, this [povitrada]
was created, then everything was created in

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.549
the sea of that holiness.

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:20.230
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu,
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.370
And who is Vishnu?

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:28.720
Is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.760
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:45.360
So He was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu,
we can say, but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.170
of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:54.180
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the
Shri Ganesha is connected on the left hand

00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:05.580
side to the Ida Nadi, and the Kundalini is
above that.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:14.040
So now what has happened is this, that He
transcended that part, and if He had to come

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:21.030
for the redemption, He had to come as the
Son of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:27.890
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him, or
we should say really, conceived Him within

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:38.510
Himself as Christ, and He became Mahavishnu.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:46.910
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:58.420
It is beyond human mind to understand how
these things are working out in that realm.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.270
Very difficult.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:06.430
But now you have got Realization you can feel
in the cool breeze, so many new things are

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:07.820
happening to you.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:16.800
So now believe Me, that there is no unholy
alliances among the Gods and Goddesses, no

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.860
unholy alliances.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:23.170
There is nothing that is human in them.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.940
They're all divine, pure people.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:40.520
Once you understand this point then you will
understand why Shri Ganesha had to accept

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:50.419
to be a Son of Mahalakshmi, was born to Him
as Christ.

00:19:50.419 --> 00:20:02.310
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the
redemption as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:12.740
part, because at that stage He is for the
innocence, for the holiness, for the wisdom

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.860
or also for destroying the negativity.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:30.180
But He had to come up, only He, only Ganesha
could be brought to this very constricted

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:36.540
chakra, Agnya chakra.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.990
Now why is it constricted?

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.431
It's quite a scientific thing which I would
not like to discuss today.

00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:48.820
But it had to be constricted and it goes on
getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:57.410
the more, the more we think, the more we go
into the left or right, it goes on really

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.130
becoming like this, absolutely like this.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:11.710
So in this very subtle area only Christ could
be subtle, because He's the subtlest of subtle.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:22.670
He's even subtler than an atom, because in
the atom those vibrations which move asymmetric

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.680
and symmetric movements are subtler than the
atom.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.450
And this is the subtler of that also.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:45.050
So in that little very constricted area, only
a personality like Christ, which is nothing

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.200
but purity.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:59.890
There is no other element in Him but purity.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:10.350
All other Incarnations have all the five elements
in it.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.350
He has nothing.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:17.240
He is nothing but pure vibrations.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:25.160
That's why He could walk on the water, because
there was no mass in His body, no matter in

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160
His body.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.010
No matter.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:34.650
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:43.460
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud, or the
what you can say, the thing that came out

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:44.460
of Her body.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.270
Only the Chaitanya.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:56.230
So at Ganesha's stage we can say that the
Chaitanya was kept in that form, but in the

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:03.270
state of Christ it was not there.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:12.590
But the whole drama was played later on, of
His death and resurrection, because He is

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:18.900
the One who is responsible for our resurrection,
because He is the Gate.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.090
He's the Path because He's Shri Ganesh.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:30.560
Omkara is the Path, and He's the Gate, but
He is not the destination.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.310
His Mother is the destination.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:39.130
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.380
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:48.260
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where
you have to reach.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:54.100
All these things were never told in the Bible,
because He could hardly live for four years

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.630
with public life.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:24:05.220
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know, also there was a definite

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:13.270
suppression of all Divine things, for these
people are all commercialized institutions,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:17.650
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial
institutions.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:23.410
But the only advantage in India is that religion
is not organized.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.440
Thank God for that!

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:32.440
But they organized it, they organized Christ,
they organized all His principles, everything,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.270
and now they think He was a good human being.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.770
What a certificate to give Him!

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:46.190
So today we are here to celebrate the birth
of Omkara.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.240
It's a very big thing.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.920
I don't know if you can realize it, what it
is, which moves into everything, whether it

00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:04.400
is [SOUNDS LIKE anu, paramanu], is the atom,
molecules, into all the organizing of chemicals

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:15.550
and also the periodic laws, and also in the
gravity, into every thing that moves is this

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.940
Omkara, and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:26.620
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:32.590
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:37.650
How is it happening, these lights look like
Omkara?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:43.330
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis, there's all the Sahaja Yogis' heads,

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.950
there is Omkara?

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:55.900
- or Allah in Arabic language - My name also,
in Arabic.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.550
Who is doing this?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:06.780
It is He who is doing all this.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:15.490
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:22.270
He's the One who is handling all these powers.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:31.600
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no,
He does not, but He plays a trick.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:39.100
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.130
Through the light.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.420
The light passes straight, a straight line.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.510
But if He wants He can make the light pass
another way round.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.309
He can just transform the light into something
else.

00:26:52.309 --> 00:26:56.860
He can do whatever He likes.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.200
And that's what He does to convince you.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:08.990
And He said that: "Anything against Me I'll
tolerate, but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:15.120
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:22.370
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:28.350
So that in the whole play He is like the [SOUNDS
LIKE sutra dhara], He's the One who is the

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:34.810
conductor, the One moves the strings in a
puppet show.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:41.070
And so it is very important to pray to Shri
Ganesha every time we have Puja.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:48.910
We have to pray to Him and we, that's how
we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:49.910
Every time.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:55.260
Without His auspiciousness, without His help,
we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.730
He's the Manager.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:01.730
See I'm sitting here and He's the manager.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.020
Supposing there's no management how will I
speak here?

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.280
Nothing can happen.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.790
But He is so efficient, and you never see
Him working out everything, doing everything.
