WEBVTT

00:14.880 --> 00:19.359
it's only the human beings who have got

00:16.640 --> 00:19.359
this freedom

00:20.000 --> 00:27.599
the will free will as they call it

00:24.640 --> 00:29.679
if you want to go to heaven you can go

00:27.599 --> 00:32.160
to heaven if you want you can go

00:29.679 --> 00:32.160
to hell

00:35.440 --> 00:40.640
and that is what we are facing now in

00:37.920 --> 00:40.640
modern times

00:42.840 --> 00:50.399
that if we do not

00:44.879 --> 00:50.399
take course to sensible things

00:52.559 --> 00:57.280
we may be all wiped out of the surface

00:56.239 --> 00:59.840
of the

00:57.280 --> 00:59.840
earth

01:00.480 --> 01:04.479
i've been telling since long that it

01:03.199 --> 01:09.200
affects our

01:04.479 --> 01:12.400
genes supposing a father is an alcoholic

01:09.200 --> 01:14.880
the son also gets it in his jeans

01:12.400 --> 01:16.320
so many things most of the vulnerability

01:14.880 --> 01:18.560
that you are

01:16.320 --> 01:18.560
or

01:19.439 --> 01:29.759
what you can call the susceptibility

01:26.560 --> 01:31.840
is coming from these genes

01:29.759 --> 01:34.079
now the susceptibility to do something

01:31.840 --> 01:34.079
wrong

01:34.799 --> 01:40.640
always to take to something bad whatever

01:38.159 --> 01:43.600
is destructive

01:40.640 --> 01:43.600
comes from the gene

01:45.280 --> 01:48.399
and it was said that

01:48.560 --> 01:56.560
the asians have two genes

01:52.399 --> 02:01.280
which protects them bars them

01:56.560 --> 02:01.280
for doing something wrong

02:03.200 --> 02:12.000
might be the culture is such i don't

02:09.039 --> 02:13.680
and the aboriginals and the people who

02:12.000 --> 02:17.599
have lived in the nature

02:13.680 --> 02:19.680
have only one gene that protects

02:17.599 --> 02:23.280
but for white skin there's no gene to

02:19.680 --> 02:26.560
protect can you imagine

02:23.280 --> 02:29.920
they are left winds whichever way the

02:26.560 --> 02:29.920
wind blows they start blowing

02:32.800 --> 02:38.640
so it's such a big problem with the

02:36.160 --> 02:40.319
white skin

02:38.640 --> 02:41.680
also they think they are the higher race

02:40.319 --> 02:42.800
but they are not according to the

02:41.680 --> 02:45.440
biological

02:42.800 --> 02:46.879
process you can say you can see the

02:45.440 --> 02:49.760
germans what they did

02:46.879 --> 02:51.040
i mean killing children in the gas but

02:49.760 --> 02:54.800
how could they do it i mean i

02:51.040 --> 02:54.800
just unimaginable

02:57.920 --> 03:02.080
the way they have killed people in all

02:59.760 --> 03:05.040
the con all the

03:02.080 --> 03:08.159
african countries also especially in

03:05.040 --> 03:08.159
america the spanish

03:10.640 --> 03:14.640
unimaginable the way they have treated

03:13.760 --> 03:19.200
other people

03:14.640 --> 03:23.120
everywhere cruelty comes to them first

03:19.200 --> 03:23.120
very easily they can become cruel

03:26.319 --> 03:32.159
they take to bad things very easily

03:30.239 --> 03:34.319
there are some sahaja yogis who came to

03:32.159 --> 03:36.480
sahaja yoga stayed in sahaja yoga

03:34.319 --> 03:39.200
for so much and again they have taken to

03:36.480 --> 03:39.200
their bad life

03:42.080 --> 03:49.120
so now it is very much to be understood

03:46.400 --> 03:51.599
that you have to be very careful and

03:49.120 --> 03:51.599
cautious

03:52.959 --> 03:56.560
the bhoots will first catch you

03:57.280 --> 04:01.040
that's why it's so much schizophrenia

03:59.040 --> 04:01.599
everywhere if your schizophrenia is so

04:01.040 --> 04:06.319
much true

04:01.599 --> 04:09.439
in america so much

04:06.319 --> 04:15.120
all kinds of horrible diseases there i

04:09.439 --> 04:18.799
can't understand how they got it

04:15.120 --> 04:21.759
so one has to be very careful

04:18.799 --> 04:24.160
that after coming to sahaja yoga you

04:21.759 --> 04:26.840
must stick on

04:24.160 --> 04:28.240
to your sublime self to your glorious

04:26.840 --> 04:30.800
self

04:28.240 --> 04:30.800
otherwise

04:31.360 --> 04:34.240
it is dangerous

04:35.440 --> 04:39.680
one one thing about sahaja yoga was

04:37.199 --> 04:44.080
amazed at how

04:39.680 --> 04:47.840
it cleanses the genes actually jane

04:44.080 --> 04:50.080
uh in a

04:47.840 --> 04:52.639
partial language scholar like bhuta you

04:50.080 --> 04:56.000
know gene

04:52.639 --> 05:00.160
but this

04:56.000 --> 05:00.160
whole theory is now showing

05:00.560 --> 05:02.880
that

05:03.759 --> 05:12.080
white-skinned people are more

05:07.199 --> 05:12.080
vulnerable to all kinds of things

05:13.520 --> 05:17.759
and i think they are the ones who have

05:16.080 --> 05:20.240
suffered a lot

05:17.759 --> 05:21.039
because there must have been a big fight

05:20.240 --> 05:23.120
within

05:21.039 --> 05:25.840
what is this nonsense we are doing why

05:23.120 --> 05:25.840
should we do it

05:27.199 --> 05:30.560
and that's why so many

05:30.880 --> 05:40.479
of them started seeking so many of them

05:38.400 --> 05:42.560
the seeking is so much suggested in

05:40.479 --> 05:44.880
indian culture everything

05:42.560 --> 05:45.680
but nobody did that the way you people

05:44.880 --> 05:49.039
were seeking

05:45.680 --> 05:50.160
it's creditable because you realized

05:49.039 --> 05:52.479
perhaps that

05:50.160 --> 05:54.720
this is a terrible life we are into why

05:52.479 --> 06:00.240
are we here

05:54.720 --> 06:02.720
so unprotected and that's why so much of

06:00.240 --> 06:05.199
we have so many sahaja yogis all over

06:02.720 --> 06:05.199
the world

06:05.600 --> 06:12.639
who have taken to sahaja yoga

06:08.880 --> 06:17.199
and are studying themselves

06:12.639 --> 06:19.600
and are progressing beautifully

06:17.199 --> 06:23.199
that means the genes which we are not

06:19.600 --> 06:26.400
protecting have become protective

06:23.199 --> 06:29.280
one thing and those genes which

06:26.400 --> 06:31.520
make you vulnerable to things also

06:29.280 --> 06:34.319
become clean

06:31.520 --> 06:37.520
and you cannot get to those things they

06:34.319 --> 06:39.919
said the people who get aids

06:37.520 --> 06:48.560
are the ones who have genes like that

06:39.919 --> 06:52.639
they are vulnerable to aids

06:48.560 --> 06:56.319
so this new dimension that

06:52.639 --> 06:59.840
science has exposed before us

06:56.319 --> 06:59.840
tells us two things that

07:00.240 --> 07:06.720
by living like a

07:03.840 --> 07:06.720
white country

07:07.440 --> 07:15.039
people saw the hell itself

07:11.759 --> 07:17.199
and that's why they have taken now it's

07:15.039 --> 07:20.000
such a big jump

07:17.199 --> 07:20.000
to sahaja yoga

07:21.039 --> 07:24.400
and your duty is

07:24.639 --> 07:27.440
to see that

07:27.680 --> 07:33.199
you get more out of all that hell

07:31.199 --> 07:36.080
around you if you see i mean when you

07:33.199 --> 07:38.000
read the newspaper you're shocked

07:36.080 --> 07:39.360
it's not the accident by which people

07:38.000 --> 07:42.639
die

07:39.360 --> 07:44.560
but all kinds of diseases murders this

07:42.639 --> 07:48.160
that going on god knows

07:44.560 --> 07:50.240
such violence especially in america you

07:48.160 --> 07:52.560
will be surprised

07:50.240 --> 07:54.000
that i can't even wear my wedding ring

07:52.560 --> 07:56.479
there my husband doesn't allow me to

07:54.000 --> 07:59.599
wear my wedding ring

07:56.479 --> 08:02.800
even mangal sutra

07:59.599 --> 08:06.720
and what goes wrong with them

08:02.800 --> 08:10.080
i don't know that they take to violence

08:06.720 --> 08:10.080
without any difficulties

08:11.199 --> 08:14.319
we had one gentleman who came from

08:13.120 --> 08:16.240
america

08:14.319 --> 08:17.440
he had already murdered his brother and

08:16.240 --> 08:21.280
murdered his mother

08:17.440 --> 08:24.560
mother also mother and brother both

08:21.280 --> 08:26.800
i said how could you do that

08:24.560 --> 08:29.599
and so many you will find in england who

08:26.800 --> 08:31.360
have killed their children

08:29.599 --> 08:33.039
and now as i was telling you it's a very

08:31.360 --> 08:35.680
dangerous situation

08:33.039 --> 08:38.479
when you ideate about the genes and the

08:35.680 --> 08:40.880
no protective genes

08:38.479 --> 08:42.000
because i remember once one student who

08:40.880 --> 08:44.880
had

08:42.000 --> 08:46.959
uh gone to cambridge he came back and he

08:44.880 --> 08:50.000
said what surprises me

08:46.959 --> 08:53.519
he they take to drugs like a venture

08:50.000 --> 08:55.200
they take to anything bad like a venture

08:53.519 --> 08:56.800
for us we are frightened you know we

08:55.200 --> 08:57.920
think this is wrong all throughout we

08:56.800 --> 09:01.519
know it is wrong

08:57.920 --> 09:01.519
and we are doing wrong knowingly

09:01.920 --> 09:05.279
he told me i don't know how they get

09:03.920 --> 09:08.399
over this

09:05.279 --> 09:09.680
uh protectiveness they just go ahead

09:08.399 --> 09:12.240
long input

09:09.680 --> 09:13.920
anything you know allow affair with any

09:12.240 --> 09:16.160
unknown girl

09:13.920 --> 09:17.600
they'll sleep with anyone how can they

09:16.160 --> 09:19.360
do it

09:17.600 --> 09:21.040
they don't even think whether it is

09:19.360 --> 09:24.080
right or wrong

09:21.040 --> 09:24.080
that's what is true

09:24.160 --> 09:31.839
that to introspect and see for yourself

09:29.040 --> 09:34.240
whether it is good or bad is very

09:31.839 --> 09:37.440
important

09:34.240 --> 09:39.360
now also we have some national problems

09:37.440 --> 09:40.720
different nationality has different

09:39.360 --> 09:42.800
problems

09:40.720 --> 09:46.480
but in sahaja yoga i think we are washed

09:42.800 --> 09:46.480
off all these things
