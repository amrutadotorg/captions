H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Press-Conference

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:36,920
London, England, July 8, 1999

3
00:00:36,920 --> 00:01:09,120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:24,980
First of all, it’s important to know what
the truth is.

5
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:33,090
You find so many people are seeking the truth,
but they don’t know what to find and that’s

6
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,360
how they are twisted around, taken to some
sort of a false rites.

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,430
It’s important first of all to know what
is the truth that we are seeking.

8
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:59,690
The truth is, if I tell you, it’s very simple:
that you are not this body, you are not this

9
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:10,970
mind, you are not this intellect, you are
not these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit.

10
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,650
That’s what you have to become – the pure
Spirit.

11
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:28,489
And another truth is that the power that leads
you to the state were you know the truth about

12
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:36,280
yourself, about everything is within you,
this power is within you, is your own.

13
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,790
Born with you, with every human being.

14
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:47,329
That’s surprising: if all the human beings
in the whole world have this power within

15
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,959
their triangular bone - how can we differentiate
them?

16
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,670
They are all just the same, everybody has
a power based in their triangular bone known

17
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:04,500
as sacrum, that means the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone.

18
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:12,519
This fact that there is a power in the triangular
bone was known thousands of years back, I

19
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,799
should say, in India and in various countries.

20
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,670
I was surprised – even in Sweden I found,
Norway I found, people were talking about.

21
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,840
I don’t know how they came to know about.

22
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,219
Specially Moscow I found people who knew about
it.

23
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:35,079
“How do you know?”

24
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,109
I asked them.

25
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,989
They said: “Our forefathers told us”,
like that.

26
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:46,959
Specially with Indian Americans they are very,
very down-to-earth people, very natural people,

27
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,340
I think – they also knew about it.

28
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,370
And Africans also knew about it.

29
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,709
But they didn’t know how to raise it.

30
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,309
That was the only problem they had.

31
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:08,079
And though they knew about the centres, about
which just now you have been told, they didn’t

32
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,640
know how to enlighten them through this power
– can you imagine?

33
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,489
This knowledge became – sort of - a knowledge
which people would not accept, because we

34
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,830
live with science or rationality.

35
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:30,759
This is something beyond that, but Einstein
has said so, Einstein has said very clearly

36
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,430
- that there is a torsion area beyond the
mind.

37
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:45,960
And you have to go to that torsion area where
you can get cognitive science – called science,

38
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,270
but I would say, cognitive personality.

39
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,760
So, how is it going to happen to go beyond
the mind?

40
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,240
If you try anything it is through your mind
only.

41
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,400
Whatever you do is through your mind.

42
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,130
So to go beyond your mind is not possible.

43
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:11,910
Now this power lies in the triangular bone,
which we can see also clearly sometimes in

44
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,360
some people who have obstruction, where it
cannot rise.

45
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,840
You see the pulsation in the triangular bone
which is just a bone.

46
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,380
But when it rises it is a so smooth movement
of this power.

47
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:33,180
Now there are some people who have written
that this is a very dangerous thing and this

48
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,590
happens and that happens, maybe because they
can’t explain, maybe because they don’t

49
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:46,300
know anything about it perhaps, maybe they
do not want to know human beings to have it.

50
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:56,400
Now, this power is kept within us because
now our last breakthrough of our evolution

51
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,440
has to take place.

52
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,140
We have to rise to that state which you can
call self-realized or there is 1001 names

53
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,140
for it.

54
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:15,129
So many people had this power within them
- they felt it also but they were not so much

55
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,840
capable I think, of raising the Kundalini.

56
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,900
Sufis, you have heard about.

57
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:28,330
Saints, many saints – William Blake, I would
say, from England, there were so many people.

58
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,060
Shakespeare is another one.

59
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,530
They all were realized souls.

60
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:38,789
The way they have expressed themselves shows
very well how detached they were and how beautifully

61
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,349
they understood the reality.

62
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:49,090
So when this Kundalini rises as they have
been told, She passes through these six centres.

63
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:56,979
And these six centres are responsible for
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

64
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:57,979
being.

65
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:08,740
So, when these centres go into jeopardy, some
because of exhaustion, maybe something, then

66
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,539
it is needed to be nourished and this Kundalini
nourishes them.

67
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,830
Not only It nourishes but It also integrates
them.

68
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,719
So you get your personality in a state where
you are completely integrated.

69
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:26,300
But then She pierces through your fontanel
bone area.

70
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,870
This is the actualisation of baptism, you
can say.

71
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:37,199
Actually She pierces through and gets you
connected to the all pervading power of Divine

72
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,199
Love.

73
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,210
It’s all love, nothing else but love.

74
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,990
Truth is love and love is truth.

75
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,370
And when She becomes one with that you are
a transformed personality.

76
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,080
Firstly your centres are enlightened.

77
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:01,060
So your health improves, mentally you get
balanced and also emotionally you understand.

78
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:09,930
But the greatest thing that happens to you
is that you become a new personality with

79
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,289
collective consciousness.

80
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,879
Jung has talked about it – “collective
consciousness”.

81
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,819
That you can feel another person.

82
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,509
You can feel your own centres on your fingertips.

83
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,060
First you feel the cool breeze in your hand.

84
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,029
That is the cool breeze described in the bible
as “the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

85
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,010
And also in Sanskrit language they call it
“Saleelam, Saleelam”.

86
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,690
In Koran it is described as “Ruh”.

87
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,919
Everywhere it is described with different
names, meaning the same.

88
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,290
You start feeling this cool breeze in your
hands, specially on your fingertips and these

89
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,820
fingertips denote your different chakras as
shown there.

90
00:08:52,820 --> 00:09:00,430
So, if there is something wrong with your
centres, then it is indicated on your fingertips;

91
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,300
but if it is something wrong with others also
it is indicated because you become, - again

92
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,880
I say, it’s a question of becoming - you
become collectively conscious.

93
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:21,950
But with that you are not disturbed, you are
absolutely at peace with yourself and absolutely

94
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,950
satisfied.

95
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,279
How it happens that our mind is always thinking
about the future, about the past.

96
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:36,860
And our mind is dancing over the cusp of these
thoughts, which are like this.

97
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,130
But when this Kundalini rises She elongates
them and there is a space in between created

98
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,889
and that space is, what we can say, is the
present.

99
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:55,149
We can be in the future, we can be in the
past, but we cannot be in the present, and

100
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,980
when you are in the present you are absolutely
thoughtless.

101
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,790
You just become a witness.

102
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:09,850
A witness state comes into you and you start
watching everything, not reacting.

103
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,710
And absorbing everything, very easy.

104
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,070
It’s a very wonderful thing that happens
to you.

105
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:25,350
So this mechanism is placed within you to
give you that special personality, to give

106
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,600
you that new awareness of collective consciousness,
and the last breakthrough of your evolution.

107
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:40,779
Till human awareness you are alright, till
that I must say they still are there somehow.

108
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:47,250
But we are afraid of the future of human beings,
because such a turmoil, so many problems,

109
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,380
so many kinds of ideas people have, which
is surprising that in these modern times what

110
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,190
people are thinking: they are something absolutely
primitive, I should say, criminal.

111
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,329
Violence and things, all this has to disappear.

112
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:14,050
And I was happy to hear that you all want
transformation, the resurrection.

113
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:21,360
You want transformation, and transformation
on a collective scale.

114
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,820
This is quite possible, absolutely possible.

115
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,529
Once you are transformed, you become a person
of tremendous love and patience.

116
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,290
You love everything.

117
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,449
You understand everything through love.

118
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:48,120
It’s not love of – some sort of a – expectations,
it’s a love of giving.

119
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:56,490
You just enjoy giving, giving everything is
so enjoyable that time, that state and you

120
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,490
become so peaceful.

121
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:03,340
Then, as you know, the economics is like that,
people will work very hard to have, say, a

122
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:10,870
carpet like this and then this is all done,
then they will have some motorcar, then they

123
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,440
want to have a house, I mean, goes on from
one to another, they are never satisfied.

124
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,649
The thing for which you have worked so hard
is finished.

125
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:26,000
Then again starts a new urge to have something
new.

126
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,410
Goes on like that, the whole economics work
like that.

127
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,881
But here, once I see this carpet, for example
here, I just go into thoughtless awareness.

128
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,730
And what do I see?

129
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:46,540
I see the joy, I feel the joy of the person,
of the artist, who makes and enjoy this.

130
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:55,300
Otherwise thinking, I would think how much
it must have cost, where can I buy this, or

131
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:02,329
if it is mine I would be worried, Oh God,
how I’ve not insured this, which has no

132
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,329
meaning.

133
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,650
But I cannot enjoy unless and until I become
thoughtlessly aware.

134
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:13,210
Also in our Patanjali Yoga it is written down
as Nirvichara Samadhi.

135
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:20,209
But he has made four stages of the whole thing
is that first is this “Sarvichar”.

136
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,860
Sarvichar means “with thoughts” and then
without thoughts, but in Sahaja Yoga it is

137
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,910
not so.

138
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:35,850
It is so quick that you become thoughtlessly
aware first, and then you become doubtlessly

139
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,850
aware.

140
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,380
That is there are no doubts about yourself.

141
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,810
You know there is a power flowing and you
know by experiment that this power, this power

142
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,920
can cure people, can help others.

143
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,230
And the attention, which is very high.

144
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,769
Like I found people say “I like this, I
want this” - that disappears.

145
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,449
Attention goes to others.

146
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:08,190
You want to see what others would like, others
would feel, and the whole personality gets

147
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:14,319
completely enshrined with the feeling of oneness
with others.

148
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,830
It’s something has to happen to all of you.

149
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:27,190
I’m happy I lived in England at least for
20 or 22 years and couldn’t meet you people.

150
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,670
But now, thank God, you people have thought
of it.

151
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,259
Now we live with science and rationality.

152
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,009
This is something beyond that, as I told you.

153
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:41,230
It is beyond science and rationality which
is accepted as cognitive science, people say.

154
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,980
And also as I’ve told you Einstein has talked
about the torsion area.

155
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,779
But how to achieve it, I don’t think he
has written anything about it.

156
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:59,550
So this is your own power within yourself
for which I don’t have to do anything – they

157
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,319
might have said it, alright.

158
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:02,389
I accept it.

159
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,810
But once it rises in you, it’s like one
candle can enlighten many candles.

160
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,949
And that’s how you can spread Sahaja Yoga
very far.

161
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:19,600
We have, say, they say so, we are now in 72
countries, possibly.

162
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,540
Because one person gets it, he goes to his
country, starts working.

163
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,709
And India, of course, Indians know this very
well, they know they have to achieve only

164
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,720
this.

165
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:38,370
Like some people told me that we are like
Indian culture.

166
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:46,340
So, we have taken to Indian style of life
and we are very satisfied.

167
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,940
I said “Is that the end?”

168
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,750
We have so many Indians who are following
that culture.

169
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,339
Are they satisfied people?

170
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:56,420
Is that the end?

171
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:01,980
What have you to do according to Indian scriptures
also - that you have to know yourself.

172
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,500
You don’t know yourself.

173
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,660
You don’t know what’s wrong with you,
unless and until you can feel your centres

174
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,230
on your fingertips.

175
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,759
You will not know what’s wrong with you
– till you end up with something horrible.

176
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,100
But as soon as you get your Realisation, immediately
you can feel it on your fingertips - your

177
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
problems.

178
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,100
Now, supposing you know how to cure it, you
can cure anybody’s and you don’t have

179
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,160
to pay for it.

180
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,570
See, again and again I’ve said that “it
is your own, it’s your power.

181
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,020
You can’t pay for it.”

182
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,170
I don’t know how people believe that for
spirituality you can pay, it cannot be sold.

183
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,160
In America it was very difficult.

184
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,500
They all came to me and told me: “You have
to sell it”.

185
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,520
I said: “How?”

186
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,920
They said: “Do something, otherwise nobody
will come to you.”

187
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,519
I said: “But I cannot do something that
is not done.”

188
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,880
So they said: “Alright, you do one thing:
take money from them and tell them that when

189
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,069
you come for follow-up you will get back your
money.”

190
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,860
So much we are bound by money that if you
have paid the money you think you are bound.

191
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,380
You have to do it.

192
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,130
And absurd things like that human beings think.

193
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,839
But why don’t they think that we have to
change this world?

194
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,060
They have to have emancipation of human being.

195
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Why now?

196
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,000
Instead of doing all kinds of other things,
the best thing is to change yourself, transform

197
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,799
yourself and enjoy.

198
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,360
And enjoyment is complete.

199
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,340
Because enjoyment is singular.

200
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,520
It is not happiness, unhappiness, it’s just
enjoyment.

201
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,640
You enjoy everything.

202
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,430
Even the smallest thing can give you enjoyment.

203
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:02,280
And then you don’t start feeling depressed
or doing that kind of a tantrums that you

204
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,730
do to trouble others, but you are so much
enjoying and everybody enjoys you also, because

205
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,450
you are so enjoyable.

206
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,730
That’s the thing that should happen to human
beings and when it happens it’s something

207
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,680
really very, very great and that should happen
to all of you.

208
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,490
And I’ll be very happy, I was told you are
all very great dignitaries here and you can

209
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:37,760
do a lot and this is how we have a chance
of first of all getting your Self Realisation.

210
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Knowing your Self.

211
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
And then helping people.

212
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,059
With a genuine love and affection.

213
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:53,043
I don’t know how much I should talk because
we’ve had so many lectures after lectures

214
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,510
and there’s no end to it.

215
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,630
But lecturing doesn’t help – it is something
else to work out within yourself.

216
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,780
That is the most important thing.

217
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,980
Now, I would like also to have some questions
from you.

218
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:12,860
If you have gone thoughtless I can’t help
it.

219
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:21,669
Question: Have you overcome all the fears
of life?

220
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:28,520
You are not afraid of death also?

221
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:37,780
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that part, but
definitely I knew that I have to find out

222
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:45,590
a way and method by which I could give en-masse
realisation.

223
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,929
Because people used to give realisation, no
doubt, but one person used to give to one

224
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:50,929
person.

225
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,696
One of the reasons maybe because anybody who
was saintly, people used to torture them,

226
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:54,696
trouble them.

227
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:55,696
They wouldn’t like a person like that because
that person was something – out of the blue,

228
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:56,696
you can call it.

229
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,340
So that was an attitude towards a person who
was a realised soul.

230
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:11,409
Everybody suffered, whether they were Sufis
or they were – otherwise even William Blake,

231
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:19,220
I mean, everyone whosoever said something
different, people didn’t like.

232
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,950
So maybe that’s the reason they used to
give it to one person.

233
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,080
That was the tradition.

234
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,390
Realisation was such that out of thousands
they used to select one person, work on him,

235
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,210
cleanse him, do this, do that and then give
realisation.

236
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,429
One person.

237
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:45,059
But I felt that the time has come that you
must give en-masse realisation.

238
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:51,220
Unless and until people get en-masse realisation,
we cannot change this world.

239
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,910
And I worked, I should say, for days together.

240
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,450
Luckily my father was a very social personality,
even my husband was.

241
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,380
So I had a good chance to meet people.

242
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:10,510
In my own subtle ways I used to find out what
is the permutation and combination of problems

243
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,580
inside the human beings and then how to work
it out.

244
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,010
That’s the only thing I did more, I think,
otherwise so many people used to give Self

245
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,049
Realisation at different times.

246
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:27,710
But what I found out a method by which thousands
of people can get realisation.

247
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,180
Question: How did you come upon this method?

248
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,640
Shri Mataji: Just, you see, I discovered it.

249
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:43,410
You see, it’s a thing I worked it out.

250
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:54,770
Have all gone thoughtless, or what?

251
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,559
Yes, madam?

252
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:12,299
Question: When you depart from this body,
as this lady was asking, where does the spirit,

253
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,570
where do the energy stay?

254
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,700
Shri Mataji: Spirit – it’s a very long
answer, but I would say, Spirit goes according

255
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,400
to its desire, alright.

256
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:32,690
Now, supposing there is a drunkard, who dies,
now he wants to drink still, even if he’s

257
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,690
dead.

258
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:40,830
He will hang in somewhere in the limbo, I
think, he will get hold of somebody who drinks

259
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,470
a lot.

260
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,779
This side of psychology, people don’t understand
in the west.

261
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:52,909
Because it’s nothing in the medicine about
this.

262
00:22:52,909 --> 00:23:00,059
The other day I read a very nice article about
it, was published in America.

263
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,540
That Japanese believe that you get possessed
by a spirit.

264
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,850
Even in the bible it is so that you get possessed
by the spirit.

265
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:16,270
But they have said that 50 to 60% people get
possessed.

266
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:20,690
Schizophrenia, all kinds of psychological
problems come from that.

267
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,840
Now, in India also we believe in it.

268
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,350
And if you can remove the possession of a
person the person completely changes, no doubt.

269
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,230
But this is still in the realm of science,
you cannot get it.

270
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:43,179
I mean, I would say that, psychology is still
a childish science and in that realm they

271
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,640
don’t understand what is this possession.

272
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:54,049
Is a fact that so far they have not gone into
it, but we know in Sahaja Yoga very clearly,

273
00:23:54,049 --> 00:24:02,950
because we get catches on the left hand side,
say here on this thumb, that means a person

274
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,950
is possessed.

275
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,340
Yes, it’s like that, it’s so simple.

276
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,440
And then you can cure that person.

277
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,299
So many persons have been cured.

278
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:14,460
So many.

279
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:23,309
Who have given up as lunatics, or schizophrenic
or all kinds have been cured, no doubt.

280
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:29,210
But it is to be seen and to be worked out,
then you can believe it.

281
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,970
Because people don’t believe that there
is such a thing.

282
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,650
But there is.

283
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,529
There is some sort of a negative force which
overpowers human beings, it is true.

284
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,520
I must tell you the truth.

285
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:55,700
We have had so many cases, even in England,
where people were possessed.

286
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,750
So many cases.

287
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:05,210
On the contrary I would say that cancer and
all psychosomatic troubles come to people

288
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,780
when they shift to the left side.

289
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,760
Means to the past.

290
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,350
Maybe some viruses which are dead long time
back are in our being – that everything

291
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,210
is past is in our being.

292
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,640
So they can attack.

293
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,770
And I’ve told them long time back somehow
through this cognitive knowledge that they

294
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:30,242
will call by 53 proteins and 63 progenides
[ ? UNCLEAR] I told them.

295
00:25:30,242 --> 00:25:34,620
And now they know it is so.

296
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,370
So cancer is curable in Sahaja Yoga, we have
cured cancers, of many people.

297
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,900
Absolutely curable.

298
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,840
We have an hospital in India, already established
near Bombay.

299
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,289
There’s a nice hospital where people are
cured.

300
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:56,289
And we don’t charge them for any treatment,
only for the stay.

301
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:05,940
It’s a fact, you see, because people never
talk about it, they never told you.

302
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,640
So you think it’s a, some sort of a mythological
thing, it’s not.

303
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,740
It is there, it exists.

304
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,149
So many diseases are not cured because we
don’t know about them.

305
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:30,190
You see, I was myself in a medical school,
so I know that they know very limited things.

306
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,320
Beyond that, they don’t know.

307
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
But in Japan, I was surprised that they believe
in it and they treat people.

308
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,330
Even in India, I mean, they know.

309
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:52,039
Question: What do you give, provide the definition
of enlightenment?

310
00:26:52,039 --> 00:27:05,789
Shri Mataji: Enlightened means a personality,
enlightened personality, I can tell you, is

311
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:12,289
a person who is beyond his mind.

312
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:19,539
And he is in contact completely with this
all-pervading power of divine love.

313
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:28,110
As a result everything in that person is guided,
helped by that divine love.

314
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:39,140
That power is so great that it looks after
you, it organizes everything, it thinks, it

315
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,770
understands, it is wisdom of all the things.

316
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,270
You become a person who is so collectively
conscious.

317
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,049
Today we need people like that.

318
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,390
Otherwise you always think about yourself.

319
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:04,630
About others you can only think when you are
collectively conscious.

320
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:10,049
But these days there are so many people marketing
their spirituality, you see.

321
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,919
That’s also there.

322
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,620
And just people jump to it, I don’t know
why.

323
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:24,399
Why don’t they find out what is the gain,
what did you gain out of it?

324
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,029
Nobody wants to know.

325
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:52,510
Question: How did you find America?

326
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,380
Shri Mataji: They are antipodes.

327
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,769
I don’t know what to say, they are very
money-oriented, extremely money-oriented.

328
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:06,950
And they can’t understand me because I’m
not asking for money, you see, they can’t

329
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,950
understand.

330
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,950
It’s very difficult.

331
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,120
And how to penetrate that veil of theirs?

332
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:22,789
So, this time it has been much better, I should
say, I’ve been there.

333
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:28,380
I went first, long time back, 1973 I went
there, and I saw the people how mad they were.

334
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,790
After one boy was a 16 years old guru, you
see.

335
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,269
They just giving money to him.

336
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:39,000
So, I asked him “Why they are giving money?”

337
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,539
What is the need to give money like this?

338
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:41,539
To this guru?

339
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,890
They said: “Because he is giving us spirit.”

340
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,179
Where is he giving you spirit?

341
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:54,010
And then this fellow, he was wiser than others
I should say, because he settled down as a

342
00:29:54,010 --> 00:30:00,649
young one, he married some American lady and
used his money, but all the rest of them,

343
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:09,470
so many of them, went there to befool them.

344
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,440
It’s endless.

345
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,380
Still going on.

346
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:28,370
But unless and until you accept the truth,
you cannot change.

347
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,030
Accept us in the sense you have to ask for
it.

348
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,030
You should have pure desire.

349
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:40,070
This Kundalini is the power of pure desire
within you.

350
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,140
When She rises She gives you your pure desire.

351
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,140
Not like this, changing from one to another.

352
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,980
And if you have pure desire only then it works
out.

353
00:30:50,980 --> 00:31:04,919
If you don’t have, it won’t work out - no.

354
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:07,690
I cannot force it.

355
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:17,790
Cannot be forced, you see.

356
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:23,360
Question: How are children, young children?

357
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,549
Shri Mataji: Oh, some of them are great.

358
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,690
These days so many realised souls have been
born, these state [or these days?

359
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,120
UNCLEAR] . We don’t understand them.

360
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,600
But there are so many, even in England there
are born so many of them.

361
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:46,080
Born realized – they are special ones.

362
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,940
I mean, this fact, it happens, so many good
things happen to the society, like drug addiction,

363
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:59,450
over night people in this England gave up
drugs, over night.

364
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:08,679
I’ve got one land far away from madding
crowd, I should say, in upstate New York,

365
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:16,419
and I wanted to start a curative centre for
drug addicts, because that is one of the big

366
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:18,210
problems here.

367
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,649
But they said the public won’t allow.

368
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,799
I said: “Why?”

369
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,730
They said: “They go amok.”

370
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:30,950
This place is so far fetched, you cannot give
a walk all the way – and if, I mean, they

371
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,830
allow me I could help a lot.

372
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,360
But somehow, even in Italy, is difficult.

373
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:44,630
And the biggest problem today, even in America,
is drug addiction.

374
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,230
Another you can call AIDS.

375
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:54,600
We tried AIDS also, but AIDS-people are something
wrong with them, they are extremely arrogant.

376
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,500
Quarrelsome, arrogant, they think they are
martyrs - something like that.

377
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,270
We’ve tried, we’ve helped one or two – no
doubt.

378
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
But it’s very difficult.

379
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,740
But these drug addicts can’t be helped very
easily.

380
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,510
But there is no proper way, if you all can
arrange something - I would like to.

381
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:20,019
In your, this London city only, I should say,
at least 10 or 11 people like that.

382
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:21,670
First time I talked they’ve got cured.

383
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:29,890
They were all doing very well, were very well
educated.

384
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,330
All these problems can be solved.

385
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,889
But the government should help, in a way.

386
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:46,070
Because you know they, so much time even to
take permission for something.

387
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:52,399
Sometimes like 10 years, 20 years, you go
on applying.

388
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,289
I am already very old and I don’t know what
will happen, if I go on like this.

389
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,679
For 20 years for a permission.

390
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,840
Very difficult.

391
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:08,000
But you people can organize something like
that.

392
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,460
And I can work it out.

393
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:21,680
You can see the results.

394
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,120
You can see the results, you can save these
children.

395
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Alcoholism, alcoholism also can be corrected.

396
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Yes, please?

397
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Question: Shri Mataji, would you say a few
words about the golden age?

398
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,910
The forthcoming golden age?

399
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:45,571
Shri Mataji: You see, Aquarius, as they say,
Aquarius according to our astrology is the

400
00:34:45,571 --> 00:34:46,571
Kundalini.

401
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:54,840
The Kundalini is Aquarius according to Indian,
I should say, Indian science of (HINDI word

402
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,460
– Sir C.P. explains:)

403
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Astrology.

404
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:07,240
And, you see, they, what they say that this
age of Aquarius is very important, because

405
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,060
this will change the lives of people.

406
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:19,890
And that is what they have already described
about this, that now there was Kali Yuga,

407
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,190
means the worst possible times.

408
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:30,960
The whole Kali Yuga means the absolutely the
worst and worst possible time for our destruction.

409
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,240
That was over.

410
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,540
Then comes Kruta Yuga, I mean, overlapping.

411
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:46,320
Now, in Kruta Yuga, this all-pervading power,
they call it Paramchaitanya, becomes active.

412
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,570
It starts helping people to come along.

413
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,680
That also has been going on some days.

414
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,020
After this, is Satya Yuga.

415
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,680
It’s the age of truth.

416
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,250
But it’s a last judgement.

417
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,920
If you take to truth, alright, well and good.

418
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,800
But if you don’t take to truth you are judged.

419
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
It’s like this.

420
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,950
Now how many people take to truth, very surprising.

421
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,880
Like a place like Russia, you’ll be amazed
- Russia.

422
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,530
Country like Russia.

423
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:25,370
I went there and I first time went to Saint
Petersburg, that’s Leningrad that time.

424
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:37,460
And when I went to the hall I saw about 2000
people sitting outside.

425
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:46,930
Because there you have to pay for a hall,
I mean, the hall people.

426
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,700
So, 2000 seats were all occupied inside.

427
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:53,460
So these people outside, people said: “Maa,
are you not going to give us realisation?”

428
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,550
I said: “How do they know all this?”

429
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,550
Somebody must have told them.

430
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:06,650
When I went in I said: “Alright, wait, I’ll
come back then I’ll give you Realisation.”

431
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,980
So, I went inside.

432
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,960
Inside there were 2000 people nicely sitting
down, listening to me and then they got their

433
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
realisation.

434
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
All of them.

435
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,960
I was amazed.

436
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
What’s the matter?

437
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,310
How is it they’re working so fast?

438
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:29,730
And then I came out and I saw there were again
these 2000 still sitting there.

439
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,970
45 minutes they were still.

440
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:36,890
I said: “Alright, you all come tomorrow
morning, we’ll sit outside.”

441
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,790
Now, in Moscow they have huge big places,
huge big compounds and buildings.

442
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:48,310
I said: “I’ll sit on the steps and I’ll
try to give you realisation.”

443
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,900
You won’t believe – 2000 from inside,
2000 from outside and one thousand extra,

444
00:37:53,900 --> 00:38:00,570
I mean, 5000 people gathered there next morning
and they all got their realisation.

445
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,690
In Moscow, you won’t believe how many people,
if somebody asks me, I cannot say, have got

446
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,690
realisation.

447
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,440
Now, the reason, I reasoned it out what must
be the reason.

448
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,030
I asked them: “How is it?

449
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,020
Had you advertised that much?”

450
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,200
“No”, they said, “we saw your photograph.

451
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,400
We knew.

452
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,590
We came.”

453
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,990
So sensitive, I say.

454
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,050
And thousands and thousands have got realisation.

455
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:38,200
These people are so deep, so deep, so humble.

456
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:49,040
I couldn’t understand why, why are they
so much spiritually endowed, how did they

457
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,310
get all this.

458
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:58,680
And what I found is that communism has given
them no freedom of any kind.

459
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:06,380
And as a result, I think, they got completely
oppressed and the whole thing growth was inside.

460
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:15,700
And also if you have read those great novelist,
even Tolstoi, or anyone - they always show

461
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:25,700
introspection, even by the hero or by the
villain, anybody, they all introspect.

462
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,770
And this is the one, I thought, is the very
deep personalities they develop.

463
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,590
And immediately they got it.

464
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:40,350
A far fetched place called Togliatti where
they make motorcars, thousands and thousands

465
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,470
– we could not get to any hall, because
formerly, I mean, normally what was the thing

466
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:57,262
we were taken, we would have to take a stadium
– 18 to 20.000 in Moscow or Leningrad or

467
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,930
a big city.

468
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,410
But in Togliatti we didn’t know what to
do.

469
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,850
So we just had it in the open.

470
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,850
Thousands and thousands.

471
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,000
But not in England – no.

472
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,080
Much worse is America.

473
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,150
I don’t know why.

474
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,770
Even Indians in England are no good.

475
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:16,910
I just don’t know what happens to them.

476
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:30,640
They are neither English nor Indian, I think,
something is, but we have very few Indians

477
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,390
even, I must tell you this, very frankly.

478
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:42,060
But in India we have so many, so thousands
and thousands who have got realisation.

479
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:49,420
Though Indians know they have to have self
realisation, even here.

480
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,220
But somehow they are fed up, I don’t know
of what.

481
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:59,880
Even if you read Shakespeare you feel like
understanding that he was a great realised

482
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
soul.

483
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,570
What he showed was the futility of human endeavour
in every line, it’s clearly shown.

484
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,150
That’s what he was.

485
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:20,550
I can’t understand, see, because I’ve
read so much Indian novels and English novels

486
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,810
and English writers.

487
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,430
I find all of them are so enlightened.

488
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:28,780
Can’t understand what’s happening in England
now.

489
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
Why?

490
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:41,850
Now, 20 years I’ve been in England, first
time I’m meeting people like you.

491
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,430
Why?

492
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:51,370
I would ask you, people.

493
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:57,730
Really, I can’t understand.

494
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,570
Even Austria, you have thousands.

495
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,050
Italy, where Roman Catholics you know, are
so many.

496
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,980
Italians, wonderful.

497
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,980
Thousands.

498
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:15,220
But I didn’t live so long there as I‘ve
lived in England.

499
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,340
Moreover, you see, language-wise, I know this
language, though I never studied English,

500
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:24,790
but I know English language, how to speak.

501
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:35,410
But there in their language, it’s Italian
or, I don’t know how.

502
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:44,460
I’m very happy today that you all have come
and I hope now from you it will start going

503
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,140
into other people.

504
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:54,050
Because it’s very important: we have to
change this world.

505
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,270
And, I would say, they also said, some newspaper
people have come, but I said: “I’m sorry,

506
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,650
I don’t know what they will think of me.”

507
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:04,550
Because they have never been very supportive.

508
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,270
But I think they don’t realise their responsibility.

509
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:09,270
Really!

510
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:17,330
Sometimes I see newspapers, I think they don’t
realise how much they are harming people by

511
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,580
wrong directions.

512
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:21,760
By sensational things.

513
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,610
What they have to do is to see what will be
the effect of these things that we are writing.

514
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:35,590
Is it going to help them to rise above all
these things like jealousies and violence

515
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:43,040
and all these things that are really completely
corroding our humanity.

516
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:52,460
So, I think, all those lines, I don’t find
them and by head, I would say, I’ve met

517
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,200
some of them, they were just after me.

518
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,970
“How is it you are in England?”

519
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,540
I said: “Because my husband has a job here,
that’s how I’ve come.”

520
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,780
Then all kinds of funny, funny questions they
were asking.

521
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,500
You know, I was surprised, they are not interested
in spirituality at all.

522
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:21,030
So, then, whenever they said “Mother, somebody
is coming from there” I said: “Now - please.”

523
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,750
All kinds of things they would say.

524
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:27,760
“Your country is so poor, what are you doing
here?”

525
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,730
Then I had to tell them why we are poor.

526
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:40,130
I said: “300 years if you have a guest in
your house without a visa what will happen

527
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:41,750
to you?”

528
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:53,030
Then another question: “Why you have got
so many, such a big population, so many children

529
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,030
born?”

530
00:44:54,030 --> 00:45:01,590
I said: “In that also, I would say, that
what I have read about England is this, that

531
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,730
so many children are killed every week, by
the parents even.”

532
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:13,620
I said: “So, the children must be deciding
to be born in a poor country than in a country

533
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,340
where they can be killed.”

534
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,600
I mean, simple thing like that.

535
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,500
Because children want love, they don’t understand
anything else.

536
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,850
So like that they asked me funny, funny questions.

537
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:33,220
I said: “I am here for spirituality, talking
to about spirituality, and why should I worry

538
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,710
about what I am, what is this and what is
that?”

539
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,680
Say, we have to change our attitude.

540
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,560
Very important.

541
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,090
Of course I know some people who are very
broad, broad minded attitude towards people,

542
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,140
very much.

543
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,740
I’ve known some in India also, but there
are so few.

544
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:04,280
If this thing has to be done it has to be
mass-scale.

545
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,770
Now, we have Sahaja Yogis, many Sahaja Yogis,
I should say, but still I’m not satisfied.

546
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:16,860
I think we need many more.

547
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,880
Hindustani…

548
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,900
HINDI…

549
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:32,860
I don’t know why.

550
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:44,580
Such a big tradition you have in our country.

551
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:51,950
Instead of bringing that here to this country,
I don’t know what’s happening.

552
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,160
And they are also very, very spiritual people.

553
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:01,920
There too, you read their books you see, you’ll
be amazed.

554
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,150
Very spiritual.

555
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:09,910
But suddenly the whole thing has turned round,
I think so that spirituality has lost its

556
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,910
power.

557
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:17,100
And maybe some, you imported some of the horrible
gurus from there also might be.

558
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:25,330
That might be another reason, I think so.

559
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:30,260
But now, I think, they are very much reduced
in number, there are few still going round,

560
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,280
making money, doesn’t matter.

561
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,580
But now you people are very sensible, very
highly placed, you should do something about

562
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,220
it, my request is.

563
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:50,320
I’m available and never used to say, whatever
you say.

564
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,360
It’s a new mission where you have to do
something.

565
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:23,200
You are the ones who are going to completely
revolutionize the whole world.

566
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,200
You can do it.

567
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,760
Absolutely everybody is capable of doing that.

568
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,530
Question: Another question: What’s your
opinion of Avataras?

569
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,970
Shri Mataji: Alright, what’s the use of
my opinion about it?

570
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,080
There are Avataras, no doubt.

571
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
Alright?

572
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,290
But you don’t believe me when I say that.

573
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,340
Unless and until you experience you shouldn’t
believe even me.

574
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:43,440
Alright, this is something and because you
asked me I’m saying so.

575
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,550
But I don’t say you believe in some Avataras,
first of all you experience them.

576
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:54,700
Everything that is now – you will know gradually
into different things and on every centre

577
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,700
there is somebody sitting there.

578
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,700
Who are they and what work they do?

579
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:07,500
All this is to be consumed and to be seen
and to be experimented.

580
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:12,480
Now, I say, supposing this centre is catching
…. [UNCLEAR] it is the centre very important

581
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,860
because it is in the optic chiasma like this,
you see, it’s constricted.

582
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,460
Now, how to open this?

583
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,900
Very difficult.

584
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,050
Now, I say, you forgive everybody.

585
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:32,040
You forgive everybody – it opens.

586
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,410
Why?

587
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,830
Because Christ, Christ is on that centre.

588
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,030
And his message is to forgive.

589
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:49,010
Is, I mean, you should know who is on which
centre and what works out.

590
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,380
That’s only to be known.

591
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,970
Once you get your Self Realisation, only you
have to know this much, who is the one responsible

592
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,950
for which chakras.

593
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,260
That’s all.

594
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:09,080
And you, you have to do according to – like
it’s a mantra now, to say that “I forgive

595
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,080
everyone”.

596
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,130
Now, some people would say it’s very difficult
to forgive.

597
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:17,720
But logically: if you forgive or don’t forgive
– what are you doing?

598
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,920
You don’t do anything.

599
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,200
But if you don’t forgive then you torture
yourself.

600
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,190
That’s why you forgive everyone.

601
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,580
And this opens.

602
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,370
Most constricted – it opens like this.

603
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:40,760
Question: So, which God is for the Kundalini?

604
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,880
Christ is over here.

605
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,650
Which God is in the Kundalini?

606
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:44,650
In the triangle?

607
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:50,150
Sahaja Yogi: What is the God or the deity
in the triangular bone, the Kundalini?

608
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,100
Shri Mataji: Kundalini itself.

609
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,540
The Kundalini is your own mother.

610
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,770
Your individual mother.

611
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:05,910
And She has tape-recorded all your past and
your aspirations, everything.

612
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:15,000
And She rises because She wants to give you
your second birth, but She is your individual

613
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
mother.

614
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,281
You don’t share Her with anybody else.

615
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:23,090
Yours is a different, somebody else’s is
different.

616
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,160
Because the tape-recording is different.

617
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
And She knows everything about you.

618
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,020
So, when She rises She does, goes very slowly,
without harming you, without troubling you

619
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:40,530
and pierces through.

620
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:56,760
We say She is the reflection of the Adi Shakti
who is called as Holy Ghost in the bible.

621
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,650
But She rises without any difficulty.

622
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,160
Hardly any time it takes.

623
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,530
Would they like to have their Self Realisation?

624
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,270
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji asks if you would
like to experience this and have your Self

625
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:14,270
Realisation?

626
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,290
Very quick, very easy.

627
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,310
Shri Mataji: Hardly any time.

628
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:21,590
Now, you forget the past.

629
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:26,770
Another thing you have to do is to forgive
yourself.

630
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:27,770
And not to feel guilty about anything.

631
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:39,760
Very important, because if you feel guilty
then this centre catches here on the left.

632
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,910
When it catches here on the left you can get
spondylitis, you can also get angina.

633
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,290
So why, why to feel guilty?

634
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,690
Whatever has happened has happened, forget
everything.

635
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,350
Not to feel guilty – very important.

636
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:00,500
I know here people feel more guilty, not in
India.

637
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,880
They never feel guilty.

638
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,360
But in the west they do.

639
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,590
But there’s no need, no need to condemn
yourself, you have to have great honour and

640
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:25,670
love for yourself, because you are special
people and that you are going to help the

641
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,580
whole world.

642
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,960
So respect yourself!

643
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:43,170
As I respect you and love you.

644
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:51,920
You, please, respect and love yourself.

645
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,380
Alright.

646
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:02,550
Now, what you have to do is to put both the
hands towards me, like this, just like this,

647
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:07,740
because I told you these are the endings of
the sympathetic nervous system.

648
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:15,330
It’s like this – little open, like this.

649
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:23,620
You don’t have to doubt yourself, by any
chance.

650
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,420
Please, don’t doubt.

651
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:38,920
Now, you put your left hand like this towards
me and right hand on top of your head here.

652
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:45,550
On top, means away, not touching the head.

653
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:53,020
You can bend your head and see for yourself.

654
00:54:53,020 --> 00:55:01,920
Now see, if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

655
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,380
was a soft bone in your childhood.

656
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:13,630
Just see for yourself, if there’s a hot
or a cool breeze-like vibrations coming out

657
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:20,380
of your fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

658
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,140
Now, you can move your hand and see for yourself.

659
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:31,990
You can move it, sometimes you can feel it
higher, sometimes lower or on the sides.

660
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,990
See for yourself.

661
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:37,050
If it is hot that means, of course, you have
got your Realisation, but if it is hot that

662
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,400
means you have not forgiven yourself.

663
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,890
Or you have not forgiven others.

664
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:54,670
So, please forgive others, also forgive yourself
fully.

665
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:57,360
Please forgive.

666
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:12,190
Now, please put your right hand towards me,
bend your head.

667
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:24,820
And see for yourself if you have cool or hot
breeze-like vibrations coming out of your

668
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:35,310
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone
in your childhood.

669
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:40,370
Please try.

670
00:56:40,370 --> 00:57:00,610
Please bend your head and see for yourself.

671
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:09,940
Now, please take down your hands, both hands
and put them towards me, like this.

672
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,340
And don’t think.

673
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:18,290
Just don’t think.

674
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:32,230
Because I already told you, you have a right,
it’s your birthright to have this Yoga,

675
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,210
union with the divine, it’s your birthright.

676
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:54,320
Now, you have to put both your hands towards
the sky like this and push back your head

677
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:06,120
and ask me – I’ll tell you about three,
three things, three questions you can say.

678
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,500
You have to say one question three times,
only one of them.

679
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:20,090
For example you can ask, you can call me Mother,
Mother – or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

680
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:24,950
Mother is, is this the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost?

681
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:30,840
Ask in your heart this question “Mother
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

682
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Ask three times.

683
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:38,570
Or, you can ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of divine love?”

684
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:45,730
Or you can ask third question “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?”

685
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:52,760
Ask anyone of these questions, anyone of them,
three times.

686
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,850
Now - let’s have it.

687
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:06,040
Alright, please put down your hands again
and put them towards me.

688
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,600
Please, don’t doubt, please don’t doubt.

689
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,950
That’s something very important.

690
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:25,340
If you start feeling a cool or a hot breeze
on your fingertips or on your palm, same or

691
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:35,460
out of your fontanel bone area, out of your
head, anyone of them, then raise your both

692
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,200
the hands, raise your both the hands – those
who have felt it that way.

693
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:57,770
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands.

694
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:23,210
Thank you very much!

695
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:43,720
Most of you have got it.

696
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
Unbelievable…

697
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,590
You got it?

698
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:50,500
No – not yet?

699
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Alright.

700
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,550
Who didn’t get it now?

701
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:55,550
She also.

702
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:56,550
You didn’t get it, madam?

703
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,550
You got it?

704
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,020
They can help you, let us see.

705
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,190
You got it?

706
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,810
You felt the cool breeze?

707
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:10,950
Now – you felt it.

708
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:19,350
Keep it like that.

709
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:35,780
Let it flow as much as possible, is very good.

710
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:42,740
You all can do this, it’s very simple.

711
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,910
She has it now?

712
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,930
Sahaja Yogi: It’s warm, Mother, it’s warm.

713
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,660
Shri Mataji: It’s warm?

714
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:58,500
Alright, put her left to the right.

715
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:08,890
Raise her left.

716
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:22,740
What’s she catching on?

717
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:46,970
Sahaja Yogi: It’s left Vishuddhi, Shri Mataji.

718
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:57,360
Shri Mataji: Left….

719
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:07,750
Are you Bengali?

720
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:28,520
Seeker: I am from the Caribbean.

721
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:52,760
Shri Mataji: Now you just don’t think.

722
01:03:52,760 --> 01:04:01,330
That’s what you should practice a little
bit.

723
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:07,280
Put your hands towards me, all of you and
don’t think.

724
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,110
What is it?

725
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,890
Did you feel the Kundalini?

726
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,870
Are you feeling it on the head?

727
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:22,260
Warm, so that’s it – put her left to the
right.

728
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,650
Raise her left and put down the right.

729
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,900
It has nothing to do with the air-condition.

730
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,670
You feel it on your fingers – alright?

731
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,670
Now better?

732
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,670
Now alright?

733
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,730
May God bless you!

734
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:37,020
Just keep go on like that.

735
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,020
Alright?

736
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,020
Are you feeling?

737
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,020
Cool or hot?

738
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:41,020
Cool now?

739
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,020
Now she’s got it.

740
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,020
So, thank you very much!

741
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,020
Thank you, all of you!

742
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:45,020
May God bless you! (quietly)

743
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:47,410
You have to practice now.

744
01:04:47,410 --> 01:05:59,290
Can you not tell them to come to some follow-up
or some program like that?
