00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.550
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.950
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.040
where the evil has been suppressed.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.870
The evil that spreads its power all over

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.120
is only because of two factors.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.950
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.870
you are still blind,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.160
and you follow things

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.910
which are not right but you think are powerful.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.830
This illusion creates not only problems,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.160
but absolute destruction.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.080
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.950
and it was easily solved.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.910
It was based on all wrong basis,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.950
just to create a problem.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.120
Problem was created with a purpose,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.990
and nobody could imagine

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.200
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.160
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.830
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.950
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.950
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.950
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.950
and they cling on to the fact

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.830
that they know everything.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.040
With all this happening,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.790
there have been so many fractions,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.160
so many stupid people

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.830
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.950
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.830
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.120
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.990
it is very subtle.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.200
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.120
they fall into the wrong path of,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.950
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.790
the people who are doing good.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.830
But above all is the power of God.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.870
All this drama is played to prove the existence

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.040
of that great Power.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.080
It has all worked out so well,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.160
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.790
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.120
Many people who have achieved

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.120
so-called success cannot see that point,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.830
but you can see it because you are spectators.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.790
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.120
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.240
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.240
that would finish before Diwali.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.910
So it goes like this, the stupidity

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.990
which is being created;

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.290
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.200
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.830
If you see among all these people who have lost,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.950
what impression have they created?

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.990
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.870
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.290
But what impression they have created?

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.990
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.870
they can see that it’s a miracle,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.120
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.950
Now the new phase has started.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.950
You all have a very, very open challenge

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.160
to get people into enlightenment.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.240
People are not so ignorant now,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.120
they are not so much blasted.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.950
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.830
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.120
and they understand

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.120
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.990
It’s very important,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.830
because if a human being starts thinking

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.040
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.910
At any cost, whatever may happen,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.240
he’ll go on sticking to that.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.870
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.200
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.200
to smell the evil – innate.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.240
We cannot, human beings cannot.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.290
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.950
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.040
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.240
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.950
who is a thief and who is not?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.240
We have a higher awareness.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.830
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.160
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.080
We cook our food – they don’t.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.950
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.870
because the way people behave

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.790
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.200
All this happening

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.120
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.330
and apply it to yourself, and see

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.160
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.240
For that, you have to rise higher.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.950
You have to rise higher

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.870
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.200
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.830
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.950
Why my attention is like that?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.870
What is the main reason

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.870
for my own

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.990
possession, I should say, or my own

00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:01.200
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.040
Once you’ll start seeing that,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.240
and if you find even a wee bit of such

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.790
nonsensical understanding within you,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.870
then you can forgive also people

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.910
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.330
absolutely brainwashed,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.200
and they did everything under that influence.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.120
As it is now you have risen much higher

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.830
than all these people,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.910
and much more aware than all of them.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.830
So you have to just understand this point,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.830
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:05.950
And for the people who are actually bad,

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.240
you don’t have to worry.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.040
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:21.040
But watch yourself and see for yourself

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:28.240
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.160
You should try to cleanse the mirror

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:41.080
so you see your complete image

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.910
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.990
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:08.120
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.790
I simply pity them.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.330
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.950
to see what they have been doing.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.120
Why have they been doing like that?

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.160
What is the need to do that?

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:35.330
All this introspection will work out so well.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.080
Then your real powers will come out

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:47.040
– your powers of giving realization,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:55.950
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.120
of the whole world.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:07.330
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.990
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.160
then things will work out.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:20.120
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:27.370
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.830
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:41.200
Of course, with that beautiful idea

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:48.950
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.450
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.450
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.950
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.910
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.910
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:22.490
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.330
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.830
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.410
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:40.950
and that you cannot do it.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:49.120
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.040
because looks there’s a very little distance

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.950
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.370
It is a very difficult task sometimes

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.990
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.450
At that point I find some of you fail.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.990
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.870
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.120
it’s best is to introspect,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.490
“Am I doing everything right?

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:44.330
How am I working for my betterment?”

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.080
The illusion is such

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.040
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.160
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.910
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.910
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.990
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.290
The purpose should be

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:15.200
that you should be able to see yourself within.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.950
You must see what is the problem inside,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.490
and you can very well understand

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:34.790
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:42.830
For example, there’s a very big building,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.870
and all the buildings in the nearby area

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.160
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:02.120
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.450
is constructed on very solid grounds.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.990
In the same way

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.370
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.240
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.200
and every person has to do that.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.410
For example, some people told Me,

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.200
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.950
they are big show-offs and that.”

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.240
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.450
that they could be like that.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.120
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.450
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.490
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.370
I said, “Myself I know everything,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.950
but I want you to know everything.”

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.490
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.200
– but find out faults within yourself.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.870
What are these things that are strangling us?

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:38.490
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:46.950
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.910
you have to know how you are driving,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.080
you have to see what are the problems.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.240
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.330
– it won’t work out.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:09.160
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.120
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.370
joyous thing.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:27.950
But this joy is not for ourselves;

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.910
this joy is for the whole world.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.490
We have to work for the whole world.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.450
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.830
but what are you doing for others?

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.910
That you should see for yourself,

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:57.240
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.330
because they have concern, they have care,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.290
and they are doing something for others.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:12.790
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.160
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:24.910
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.120
that we have to do something ourselves

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.290
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:42.410
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.200
to make this light unshaky

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.790
and full of enthusiasm.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.950
It’s there. It is you who are

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:09.370
anxious to fill your pitchers.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.040
You can do it.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:19.160
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.200
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.950
complete picture about yourself,

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:37.830
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:43.490
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.290
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.450
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.450
what is the aim of our lives?

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:07.450
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.290
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.410
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.200
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.790
then can you imagine what will happen?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.330
Think of that dream I have,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.950
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.990
and we have to transform them into good people.

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.950
If they are not transformed

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.490
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.040
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:03.490
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.160
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.330
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.790
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.790
– you have now overcome it.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.870
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.790
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.790
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.950
your method of working it out,

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.490
your anxiety to work it out.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.200
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.290
You can transform anyone.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.200
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.160
Like when we came in the plane,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:11.040
I found at the airport so many people

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:13.870
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.950
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:23.830
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.830
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.370
” They didn’t know anything about it,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.990
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.160
Then what is this cool coming?

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.950
That basically they are there to get their realization,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.870
only we have to extend our ideals,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.370
we have to extend our love to them.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.370
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.990
better is to give them a chance

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.160
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:09.490
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.240
It’s over now. You will be amazed

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:19.240
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:25.200
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.830
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.200
You have to have more and more of candles,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.080
and that’s what is your job.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.330
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:51.330
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.410
at any cost, at any place?

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.160
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.830
I asked them, “What did you do?”

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.160
They said, “No, nothing.”

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.830
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.040
“No, nothing.”

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.490
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.410
If you have done nothing,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.990
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.450
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.870
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.160
we are coming from a program.”

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.370
“How are you so late?”

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.080
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.910
“So you were waiting outside?”

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.240
“Yes.” “How many?”

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.950
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:00.080
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:03.040
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.410
“But you were realized souls?”

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.200
“No, we had our realization,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.240
that sometimes we have to wait too.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.910
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.990
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.330
Only we do it to ourselves.”

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.790
So again I will say introspection

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.200
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:34.240
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:42.240
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:49.160
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.290
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.790
– how timely they were! It never happened,

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:04.080
in the history of this world it never happened;

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.240
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.990
give a new experience of the showers?

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.200
All this is a time, we should say,

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:25.790
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.240
that this is the time for a special thing.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.290
Normally I get letters

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.870
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.160
this is sick, all kinds of things.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.240
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.290
then somebody has children, they are sick –

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.330
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.290
The reason is they

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.910
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.160
or maybe they are halfway,

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.950
because they could themself say

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.040
that “Why should we write to Mother?

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.200
We can get it done ourselves.”

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:15.870
Instead of that, one has to write

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.830
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.950
how they have got love from others,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.240
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.370
All this is much better to write,

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.240
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:42.160
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.240
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.120
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.950
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.240
So let it be. That’s not your job,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.240
you don’t have to work it out.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:07.240
Even before coming I got letters like that:

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.080
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.990
So I asked this lady, I said,

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.080
“Why do you write all these things

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.790
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.870
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.240
“How?”

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:30.490
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.410
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.870
This looks like advertising or something,

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.490
speciality that you should cure somebody,

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.330
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.490
We just don’t want such people to come.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.290
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.950
and understanding, and the wisdom.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:01.200
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:05.370
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:10.290
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.870
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:21.370
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.410
You have to respect yourself.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.830
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:33.080
Like understanding,

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:40.490
wisdom that we have come here for a

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.490
very,  very special work of very high quality:

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.040
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.870
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:01.240
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:05.290
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:09.160
And all my relations are now saying,

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.240
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.040
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.240
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.790
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.160
that “all my family people are saying ...

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.450
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.120
If this marriage doesn’t become

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:39.200
all right, then they will say there’s

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.370
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:47.990
We have not committed that way.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.990
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.200
father, this, that.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.830
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.240
You yourself can cure them

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.120
you can work it out yourself.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.120
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.950
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160
“Mother?" " No.”

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.790
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:28.790
So why are you asking Me?

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:31.950
What relationship I have with them?

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.240
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:41.200
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.830
It is impossible to understand.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.410
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.790
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.910
you can give them and fix them properly.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:06.410
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.870
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.410
all kinds of things

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.990
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.990
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.870
What you should do is to see

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.370
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.290
And you must tell them,

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.870
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.830
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.950
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.040
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.490
so everybody comes there.

00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:56.330
I would request you on a Diwali day

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.290
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.080
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.450
” It’s very important,

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.490
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.330
and on wrong basis.

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.870
If you have some intelligence

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.290
you must know that now you belong

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:33.160
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:39.370
which are very few. In this world

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:46.240
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:53.410
to see that this quality

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.490
must be in so many people,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.490
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:05.370
Find out such people, tell them

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.330
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.370
But don’t worry about things

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.450
which are of no value to us.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.870
You must know you are a special race.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.160
You are special soldiers

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.240
who have been trained

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.990
for doing Sahaj work only.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.200
So wasting energy on your relations

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:42.370
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.200
It is to be understood now

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:54.410
that you have your own energy reserved

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.120
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:07.830
You should help everyone

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.990
who is a Sahaja yogi

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.490
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.990
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:22.450
you must help them; because we are one Personality

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.160
and these are all the different hands

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.950
of one Personality, one God.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.040
So this oneness must be established

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:45.410
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.950
There are some people who are very active.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.910
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.870
All that will work out, I’m sure,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.080
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.200
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.080
nothing will work out.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.160
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:32.080
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.450
All the armament they have, everything they have;

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.040
but we need more.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.450
And for that we have to work out collectively,

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.120
must plan what should we do.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.290
Recently there has been a big

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.080
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.910
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:12.950
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.490
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.450
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:25.910
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:30.490
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.200
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:41.040
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.240
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:52.330
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:58.410
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.410
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.410
And you will definitely try to correct it,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.450
if you love them

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.040
– or you give up.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.450
These are special people, specially selected

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.290
for a very special cause,

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:28.910
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.080
That is one thing you should know.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.330
On this Diwali day you have to know

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.990
that you have to burn yourself

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:46.330
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.450
But don’t do it too much.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.120
Like some people came and told Me,

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.080
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.410
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.080
Still we are not good.”

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.160
So I said, “Why should you give up?

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.160
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.830
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.290
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:24.160
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.790
Such half-baked people are no good,

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.910
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.160
They don’t deserve any attention.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.990
That is very much to be understood,

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.990
that you should not be also like that,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.200
nor you should have friends like that,.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.410
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.910
Sahaja yogi is a special character

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.870
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:08.370
That kind of a personality when you will have,

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:13.040
there will be lights all over.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.040
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.910
and I want you to respect yourself

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:30.910
and understand what is the position of

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.830
your being in this

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:42.330
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:47.240
And how are we working it out?

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.040
The attention should move from

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.240
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:59.870
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.990
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:13.040
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.950
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:20.120
May God bless you.
