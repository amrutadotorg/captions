00:03.500 --> 00:10.380
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.140
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

00:14.340 --> 00:25.180
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

00:26.180 --> 00:33.020
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

00:33.220 --> 00:37.300
who had no idea about God at all

00:37.500 --> 00:41.180
because they started a theme

00:41.380 --> 00:46.180
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

00:46.380 --> 00:53.580
So, the birth determined the caste of a person.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.740
Before that,

00:55.940 --> 01:03.020
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

01:03.220 --> 01:05.820
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

01:06.060 --> 01:08.500
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

01:08.700 --> 01:13.620
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

01:14.620 --> 01:18.140
And that is how also

01:18.340 --> 01:22.180
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

01:22.380 --> 01:24.980
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

01:25.180 --> 01:28.660
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

01:28.900 --> 01:33.580
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

01:33.780 --> 01:37.380
So it was agreed that

01:37.580 --> 01:42.740
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.940
Gradually, it amounted to this

01:45.100 --> 01:47.780
that any child born out

01:47.980 --> 01:50.100
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.980
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

01:54.180 --> 01:56.700
Realized souls as their children.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.980
Maybe their own karmas,

01:59.180 --> 02:02.300
maybe the child, anything it is,

02:02.500 --> 02:06.660
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

02:06.820 --> 02:10.060
devilish children.

02:10.260 --> 02:19.740
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

02:19.980 --> 02:24.220
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

02:24.420 --> 02:27.700
or the one who has known the Brahma.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.540
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

02:30.740 --> 02:35.060
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

02:35.260 --> 02:36.900
by what you do.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.340
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

02:41.612 --> 02:44.085
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.272
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

02:47.393 --> 02:54.366
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

02:54.846 --> 03:01.446
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

03:02.006 --> 03:06.486
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

03:06.686 --> 03:09.686
who can only worship God.

03:10.086 --> 03:15.886
So to put another extreme

03:16.126 --> 03:20.086
to what Rama has created,

03:20.766 --> 03:23.006
to bring people into the centre,

03:23.206 --> 03:27.046
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

03:27.366 --> 03:29.446
and rigidity of ritualism

03:29.766 --> 03:35.526
and too much of fundamentalism.

03:35.846 --> 03:37.526
So to put an end to that

03:37.766 --> 03:40.566
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

03:40.766 --> 03:46.606
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

03:46.966 --> 03:51.366
So he started a new theme of,

03:51.566 --> 03:57.806
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

03:58.006 --> 04:00.406
that such a new theme should come up.

04:00.646 --> 04:05.606
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

04:06.286 --> 04:08.806
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

04:09.046 --> 04:12.566
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

04:12.766 --> 04:19.246
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

04:19.566 --> 04:21.966
So, the whole thing is a Leela.

04:22.206 --> 04:26.566
And on this theme he worked out everything

04:26.886 --> 04:29.926
to establish that it is a play.

04:30.606 --> 04:33.566
And that is what you see in America,

04:33.766 --> 04:36.926
very common that for people it has become a joke,

04:37.166 --> 04:39.686
life has become a joke.

04:39.966 --> 04:42.646
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

04:42.886 --> 04:46.926
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

04:47.166 --> 04:53.046
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

04:53.286 --> 04:58.766
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

04:59.126 --> 05:02.006
But it is a myth with Americans now

05:02.206 --> 05:05.046
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

05:05.286 --> 05:07.086
you have to have realisation.

05:07.326 --> 05:10.126
Like if you are standing in the water,

05:10.406 --> 05:17.326
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

05:18.526 --> 05:23.246
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

05:23.926 --> 05:27.366
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

05:27.566 --> 05:29.646
by asserting itself.

05:29.886 --> 05:31.766
But if you're in the boat

05:32.046 --> 05:35.926
then the water that is around is an illusion.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.606
So, it's the state at which you are.

05:38.886 --> 05:43.286
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

05:43.486 --> 05:47.886
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

05:48.126 --> 05:51.966
It is a reality. So, what they forgot this point,

05:52.166 --> 05:55.206
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

05:55.486 --> 05:59.326
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

05:59.766 --> 06:01.086
thinking that it's an illusion

06:01.286 --> 06:05.286
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

06:06.646 --> 06:09.406
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

06:09.606 --> 06:10.966
this thing should be so

06:11.166 --> 06:14.526
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

06:14.726 --> 06:17.966
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

06:18.166 --> 06:21.966
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

06:22.246 --> 06:24.366
And some people go to that limit to say

06:24.566 --> 06:27.326
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

06:27.566 --> 06:29.846
nothing like a evil force.

06:30.126 --> 06:33.766
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

06:34.006 --> 06:39.846
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

06:40.566 --> 06:45.126
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

06:45.966 --> 06:49.886
In that play he was to be destroyed.

06:50.526 --> 06:55.966
So, he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

06:56.166 --> 06:58.566
what not to be destroyed.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.206
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

07:02.446 --> 07:05.046
So, to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

07:05.246 --> 07:08.406
Like even if you think everything is a play,

07:08.606 --> 07:12.846
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

07:13.126 --> 07:15.886
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

07:16.126 --> 07:17.646
like in a drama you sit down

07:17.886 --> 07:19.966
and you watch everything as a spectator,

07:20.206 --> 07:26.126
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

07:26.526 --> 07:30.606
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

07:30.846 --> 07:34.006
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

07:34.286 --> 07:36.646
You have a sense of discretion to know

07:36.846 --> 07:39.406
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

07:39.646 --> 07:44.206
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

07:44.726 --> 07:49.206
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

07:49.446 --> 07:52.606
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

07:52.846 --> 07:55.926
you're involved in it. So, it is not,

07:56.246 --> 07:57.966
for you do not know the discretion

07:58.166 --> 07:59.766
between the tragedy and the comedy.

07:59.966 --> 08:03.046
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

08:03.286 --> 08:06.766
if you do your job well then, it's a comedy,

08:06.966 --> 08:09.846
otherwise it's a tragedy.

08:10.366 --> 08:14.126
So, there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

08:14.366 --> 08:17.966
another of the one who is in it.

08:18.286 --> 08:20.926
So, one has to understand in that light,

08:21.206 --> 08:24.086
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

08:24.286 --> 08:29.326
he was meaning for him, not for others.

08:29.886 --> 08:31.326
For him it is a play.

08:31.526 --> 08:35.326
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

08:35.526 --> 08:38.686
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.686
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

08:41.886 --> 08:47.206
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

08:47.566 --> 08:50.846
So, to him it was a play, everything was a play

08:51.046 --> 08:55.766
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

08:56.246 --> 09:01.086
So, the first thing if you are

09:01.406 --> 09:03.566
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

09:03.766 --> 09:08.086
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

09:08.606 --> 09:13.166
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

09:13.366 --> 09:15.726
You cannot say what is wisdom.

09:15.966 --> 09:19.846
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

09:20.046 --> 09:23.406
Wisdom is a temperament,

09:23.646 --> 09:26.886
is a quality of a personality

09:27.246 --> 09:32.246
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

09:32.486 --> 09:36.486
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

09:36.726 --> 09:38.486
who are not traditional.

09:38.726 --> 09:41.606
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

09:41.806 --> 09:44.926
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

09:45.166 --> 09:49.166
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

09:49.366 --> 09:51.886
so he did not need any tradition at all.

09:52.086 --> 09:55.246
But for you, you have to understand from the people

09:55.446 --> 09:57.606
who have tradition what is wisdom.

09:57.846 --> 10:02.046
So, we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

10:02.286 --> 10:07.566
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

10:07.766 --> 10:12.446
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

10:12.686 --> 10:19.326
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

10:19.526 --> 10:21.366
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

10:21.606 --> 10:26.006
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

10:26.366 --> 10:30.086
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

10:30.446 --> 10:33.486
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

10:33.686 --> 10:36.246
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

10:36.446 --> 10:37.886
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

10:38.086 --> 10:41.326
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

10:41.686 --> 10:45.646
So, because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

10:45.926 --> 10:50.446
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

10:50.646 --> 10:53.606
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

10:53.806 --> 10:54.726
instead of

10:54.926 --> 10:57.086
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

10:57.286 --> 10:59.886
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

11:00.086 --> 11:03.766
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

11:03.966 --> 11:07.006
spoiling the other chakra also.

11:07.246 --> 11:14.926
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

11:15.446 --> 11:17.766
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

11:18.006 --> 11:21.966
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

11:22.486 --> 11:24.726
That's the best way to escape it.

11:25.006 --> 11:29.406
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

11:29.726 --> 11:32.326
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

11:32.526 --> 11:35.286
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

11:35.486 --> 11:39.206
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

11:39.486 --> 11:40.526
Now the another side

11:40.726 --> 11:43.566
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

11:43.766 --> 11:45.846
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

11:46.086 --> 11:50.406
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.966
So, "What's wrong?"

11:55.646 --> 11:59.366
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

11:59.926 --> 12:02.326
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

12:02.566 --> 12:06.966
So, it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

12:07.166 --> 12:09.326
for example they paint their hair.

12:09.566 --> 12:12.966
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

12:13.166 --> 12:18.126
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

12:18.446 --> 12:20.846
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

12:21.046 --> 12:24.046
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

12:24.286 --> 12:30.766
They cannot even create a little ant,

12:31.046 --> 12:34.686
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

12:35.126 --> 12:37.446
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

12:37.686 --> 12:39.126
So, this is the right side thing

12:39.366 --> 12:45.646
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

12:47.286 --> 12:50.966
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

12:51.246 --> 12:55.566
that eyes are the ones

12:55.766 --> 12:58.606
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

12:59.086 --> 13:00.406
the power of Shri Krishna.

13:00.686 --> 13:05.926
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

13:06.126 --> 13:08.886
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

13:09.086 --> 13:10.766
if he has Krishna consciousness,

13:10.966 --> 13:13.726
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

13:13.926 --> 13:17.326
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

13:17.566 --> 13:19.006
should be able to cure anyone.

13:19.246 --> 13:21.886
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

13:22.126 --> 13:23.926
if it has Krishna consciousness,

13:24.166 --> 13:28.006
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

13:28.246 --> 13:32.526
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

13:32.766 --> 13:37.046
So, on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

13:37.286 --> 13:38.326
When you feel guilty,

13:38.566 --> 13:41.566
they try to find out some method of expression.

13:41.766 --> 13:43.566
So they say they go to some guru

13:43.766 --> 13:46.366
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

13:46.606 --> 13:49.046
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.966
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.206
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

13:56.406 --> 13:58.726
you get completely caught-up.

13:58.926 --> 14:01.126
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

14:01.366 --> 14:04.806
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

14:05.046 --> 14:08.566
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

14:08.766 --> 14:13.966
who get anginas and also who get cancer

14:14.166 --> 14:16.326
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

14:16.526 --> 14:19.206
without the connection with the Divine.

14:19.446 --> 14:22.086
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

14:22.286 --> 14:25.086
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

14:25.286 --> 14:28.606
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

14:28.846 --> 14:34.006
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

14:34.206 --> 14:38.686
without feeling the power of that mantra.

14:39.366 --> 14:41.526
So, in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

14:41.726 --> 14:44.486
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.086
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

14:47.326 --> 14:50.606
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.526
They think they're very responsible people

14:52.726 --> 14:54.846
and do all irresponsible things.

14:55.046 --> 14:57.566
So, when you want to spoil that chakra,

14:57.766 --> 15:01.766
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

15:01.966 --> 15:06.406
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

15:06.646 --> 15:12.526
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

15:13.326 --> 15:16.326
When you start saying in the ego form that,

15:16.566 --> 15:21.766
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

15:22.046 --> 15:26.126
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

15:26.366 --> 15:30.206
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

15:30.486 --> 15:32.086
then the whole thing disappears

15:32.326 --> 15:36.366
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.046
Islam is nothing but surrender.

15:39.286 --> 15:43.086
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

15:43.326 --> 15:48.046
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

15:48.286 --> 15:51.086
So, you play the melody of God.

15:51.286 --> 15:55.566
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

15:55.806 --> 15:58.126
Every time you go back to discretion.

15:58.326 --> 16:00.766
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

16:01.006 --> 16:04.046
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

16:04.286 --> 16:05.886
Like somebody wants to drink.

16:06.086 --> 16:11.406
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

16:12.366 --> 16:15.366
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

16:15.646 --> 16:20.446
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

16:21.126 --> 16:25.886
So, this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

16:26.206 --> 16:31.926
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

16:32.126 --> 16:35.166
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

16:35.406 --> 16:37.126
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

16:37.366 --> 16:40.246
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

16:40.446 --> 16:43.366
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

16:43.606 --> 16:46.286
And then whatever you do has a justification.

16:46.526 --> 16:51.766
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

16:51.966 --> 16:53.886
they actually robbed the other people of their land

16:54.086 --> 16:56.446
and now very nicely settled down.

16:56.686 --> 16:57.926
Now, when I say that,

16:58.166 --> 17:00.646
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

17:00.886 --> 17:04.886
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

17:05.166 --> 17:07.406
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

17:07.646 --> 17:10.046
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

17:10.286 --> 17:13.046
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

17:13.286 --> 17:18.566
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

17:18.766 --> 17:21.326
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

17:21.526 --> 17:24.046
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

17:24.286 --> 17:27.446
This is the way you face and not just to say,

17:27.646 --> 17:31.926
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

17:32.166 --> 17:34.406
But what are you doing about it?

17:34.646 --> 17:38.206
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

17:38.406 --> 17:41.926
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

17:42.166 --> 17:44.246
I said, "What did you do there?

17:44.486 --> 17:46.886
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

17:47.126 --> 17:49.526
at least you did not go to fight there.

17:49.726 --> 17:51.366
Why did you feel guilty about it?"

17:51.606 --> 17:53.726
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

17:53.926 --> 17:58.886
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

17:59.166 --> 18:01.526
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

18:01.726 --> 18:06.126
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

18:06.326 --> 18:11.246
that we suddenly become a personality

18:11.486 --> 18:14.606
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

18:14.886 --> 18:19.646
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

18:19.846 --> 18:22.886
Alright, how?

18:23.246 --> 18:28.086
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

18:28.366 --> 18:32.006
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

18:32.246 --> 18:34.766
Both are headaches to the whole world.

18:35.006 --> 18:38.166
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

18:38.526 --> 18:42.326
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

18:42.646 --> 18:49.086
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

18:49.526 --> 18:54.286
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

18:54.566 --> 18:56.966
Children and father cannot live together.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.926
Mother cannot live with the children.

18:59.126 --> 19:02.206
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

19:02.446 --> 19:06.486
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

19:06.726 --> 19:11.606
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

19:11.886 --> 19:13.886
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.366
There's no unison, there is no concord.

19:16.606 --> 19:20.286
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

19:20.486 --> 19:24.886
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

19:25.086 --> 19:30.526
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

19:30.766 --> 19:33.966
Even the destruction of evil is important,

19:34.286 --> 19:37.366
even the killing of the evil is important.

19:37.606 --> 19:41.046
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.646
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

19:42.846 --> 19:46.966
and should have been put in charge of God?

19:48.126 --> 19:50.406
He's saved by killing him.

19:50.646 --> 19:52.406
Because he was destroyed,

19:52.606 --> 19:57.526
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

19:58.006 --> 20:01.286
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

20:01.486 --> 20:04.766
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

20:04.966 --> 20:07.286
evil is to be finished.

20:07.566 --> 20:08.646
So, what you have to pray

20:08.846 --> 20:11.646
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

20:11.886 --> 20:16.366
all the destruction of the world,

20:16.566 --> 20:20.126
all the minds which build up our destruction,

20:20.326 --> 20:22.966
please try to neutralise it."

20:23.166 --> 20:25.486
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

20:25.686 --> 20:26.486
Instead of that,

20:26.686 --> 20:31.646
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

20:31.886 --> 20:34.006
That's not correct . You have to stand up

20:34.246 --> 20:36.166
and you have to say, "That it's wrong",

20:36.406 --> 20:39.766
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

20:40.006 --> 20:41.286
we have no right."

20:41.486 --> 20:46.046
So when Krishna told Arjuna that, "You kill everyone

20:46.286 --> 20:48.806
who are related to you, who are your friends

20:49.046 --> 20:54.086
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

20:54.286 --> 20:56.446
It was Shri Krishna who said,

20:56.726 --> 21:00.966
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

21:01.206 --> 21:03.486
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

21:03.686 --> 21:08.766
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

21:09.846 --> 21:13.846
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

21:14.046 --> 21:16.086
which started killing everyone,

21:16.286 --> 21:20.326
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

21:20.686 --> 21:22.286
You have no sense of right and wrong.

21:22.526 --> 21:25.966
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.446
First of all try to save instead of killing.

21:28.686 --> 21:33.166
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

21:33.366 --> 21:34.686
people are getting drowned

21:34.886 --> 21:37.046
and you find that you have to save the people.

21:37.286 --> 21:41.126
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

21:41.326 --> 21:43.246
There is no occasion for killing now.

21:43.446 --> 21:46.486
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

21:46.686 --> 21:49.166
What you have to do is to save people,

21:49.366 --> 21:53.446
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

21:53.686 --> 21:58.246
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

21:58.486 --> 22:01.686
You just move them out. Take them away.

22:01.966 --> 22:03.086
Have nothing to do with them.

22:03.286 --> 22:06.446
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

22:06.686 --> 22:10.326
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

22:10.566 --> 22:14.166
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

22:14.406 --> 22:18.086
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

22:18.326 --> 22:21.646
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

22:22.006 --> 22:25.006
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

22:25.206 --> 22:29.446
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

22:29.646 --> 22:32.006
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

22:32.206 --> 22:32.926
you don't take up

22:33.126 --> 22:36.806
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

22:37.046 --> 22:39.966
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

22:40.166 --> 22:42.286
I've seen people become very aggressive,

22:42.486 --> 22:44.126
they talk very aggressively.

22:44.326 --> 22:47.446
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

22:47.686 --> 22:51.526
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

22:51.726 --> 22:54.246
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

22:54.486 --> 22:57.286
Very common.

22:58.486 --> 23:02.926
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

23:03.366 --> 23:05.766
Then you start aggressing each other also,

23:05.966 --> 23:08.806
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

23:09.006 --> 23:09.926
You're not to aggress.

23:10.126 --> 23:12.886
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

23:13.086 --> 23:16.206
What is discretion is diplomacy.

23:16.486 --> 23:19.606
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.886
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

23:22.086 --> 23:23.806
this man is dangerous,

23:24.046 --> 23:25.406
he is troubling you,

23:25.606 --> 23:27.286
now if you have a proper sense,

23:27.486 --> 23:30.926
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

23:31.166 --> 23:35.966
that there won't be any more discussion or destruction.

23:36.166 --> 23:40.806
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

23:41.046 --> 23:43.766
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

23:44.006 --> 23:48.326
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

23:48.686 --> 23:50.686
So must have discretion, must understand.

23:50.886 --> 23:53.886
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

23:54.086 --> 23:55.966
where you find somebody is telling you,

23:56.166 --> 23:58.886
"You see, this person has said this about you."

23:59.126 --> 24:01.606
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

24:01.846 --> 24:04.326
"That person has said this about you."

24:04.526 --> 24:06.246
Then you start quarelling

24:06.446 --> 24:10.606
instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

24:10.766 --> 24:13.726
"Why, why this is happening,

24:13.966 --> 24:16.406
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

24:16.646 --> 24:18.206
We were friends, what has happened?"

24:18.406 --> 24:21.326
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

24:21.526 --> 24:27.886
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

24:28.126 --> 24:32.886
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

24:33.126 --> 24:35.166
delicate, beautiful.

24:35.366 --> 24:39.046
Nobody should notice

24:39.246 --> 24:45.326
that you have been in any way effective,

24:46.926 --> 24:49.246
and that's how you'll work it out.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.286
So, the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

24:52.486 --> 24:56.046
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

24:56.446 --> 24:58.926
So, he plays.

24:59.126 --> 25:01.166
Give you an example how he plays.

25:01.366 --> 25:06.726
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

25:07.126 --> 25:12.206
who had a blessing from Shiva

25:12.446 --> 25:18.526
that nobody can kill him.

25:19.526 --> 25:25.326
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

25:25.686 --> 25:29.086
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

25:29.526 --> 25:34.006
So, there was a saint who had a blessing

25:34.326 --> 25:37.926
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

25:38.126 --> 25:42.046
sleep in your yoga sleep,

25:42.246 --> 25:45.126
and once you open your eyes

25:45.326 --> 25:50.806
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

25:53.046 --> 25:56.286
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

25:56.566 --> 25:59.446
He was fighting this devil

25:59.646 --> 26:03.326
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

26:03.526 --> 26:07.366
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

26:07.766 --> 26:10.526
So he started running away from the field,

26:10.766 --> 26:12.766
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

26:12.966 --> 26:15.526
the one who runs away from the battle field,

26:15.766 --> 26:18.366
is regarded as something really derogatory,

26:18.566 --> 26:22.206
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

26:22.446 --> 26:23.326
So, he didn't mind,

26:23.526 --> 26:27.166
he ran away and then this devil started following him

26:27.366 --> 26:28.486
And he went into the cave

26:28.686 --> 26:32.846
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

26:33.486 --> 26:36.446
And he removed his shawl

26:36.646 --> 26:40.766
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

26:41.046 --> 26:42.726
and hid himself.

26:42.966 --> 26:45.006
So, this rakshasa came behind him.

26:45.206 --> 26:48.886
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

26:49.126 --> 26:52.766
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

26:53.006 --> 26:55.046
Come along now, open your eyes!"

26:55.286 --> 27:01.246
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

27:01.486 --> 27:04.286
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

27:04.486 --> 27:07.526
and he just was burnt.

27:10.526 --> 27:14.326
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

27:14.606 --> 27:17.926
That is the sign of diplomacy.

27:18.126 --> 27:23.326
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

27:23.526 --> 27:26.126
the whole discretion, what he should do,

27:26.326 --> 27:28.046
what is right, what is wrong,

27:28.286 --> 27:31.846
is he doesn't have this problem.

27:32.126 --> 27:36.966
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

27:37.206 --> 27:38.686
So, he played a trick .

27:38.886 --> 27:44.646
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

27:45.206 --> 27:50.886
And he made one king - you see-

27:51.846 --> 27:59.126
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

27:59.326 --> 28:01.846
But he could never touch them.

28:02.046 --> 28:04.886
So, Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

28:05.086 --> 28:07.006
He has to have justification also;

28:07.206 --> 28:09.806
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

28:10.126 --> 28:12.686
So he killed this king, brought all these women

28:12.926 --> 28:18.766
and they all became his wives, so-called.

28:20.326 --> 28:22.446
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

28:22.646 --> 28:25.166
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

28:25.366 --> 28:28.606
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

28:28.886 --> 28:31.806
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

28:32.086 --> 28:36.086
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

28:36.326 --> 28:39.766
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

28:39.966 --> 28:44.126
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

28:44.326 --> 28:48.446
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

28:48.686 --> 28:51.766
meaning the power of creation,

28:52.006 --> 28:54.086
because creation has been done already.

28:54.326 --> 28:57.286
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

28:57.486 --> 28:59.326
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

28:59.526 --> 29:01.486
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

29:01.686 --> 29:04.926
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

29:05.126 --> 29:08.126
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

29:08.366 --> 29:11.486
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

29:11.726 --> 29:13.446
and she opens her left side.

29:13.686 --> 29:15.526
And in front of her

29:15.766 --> 29:19.766
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

29:20.006 --> 29:22.646
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

29:22.846 --> 29:25.126
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

29:25.326 --> 29:29.566
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

29:29.766 --> 29:32.686
But in this one, the one that they have here

29:32.926 --> 29:34.846
is the child is kept underneath this,

29:35.086 --> 29:38.366
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

29:38.566 --> 29:42.566
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

29:42.766 --> 29:45.566
So I'll tell you the last story about her

29:45.766 --> 29:52.206
which will conclude this talk about

29:52.446 --> 29:54.166
Radha and Shri Krishna.

29:54.406 --> 29:56.846
That one day,

29:57.646 --> 30:03.286
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

30:03.526 --> 30:05.246
and Narada said, "See,

30:05.486 --> 30:07.966
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

30:08.166 --> 30:10.446
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

30:10.646 --> 30:15.286
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

30:15.526 --> 30:20.206
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

30:20.446 --> 30:24.166
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

30:24.366 --> 30:27.406
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

30:27.606 --> 30:30.526
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

30:30.726 --> 30:32.406
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

30:32.606 --> 30:35.686
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

30:35.886 --> 30:37.286
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

30:37.486 --> 30:41.206
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

30:41.406 --> 30:43.166
so don't listen to him."

30:43.366 --> 30:45.486
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

30:45.726 --> 30:47.286
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

30:47.486 --> 30:49.446
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

30:49.646 --> 30:53.006
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

30:53.206 --> 30:56.766
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

30:57.006 --> 30:59.966
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

31:00.166 --> 31:01.926
He said, "There's very simple thing that

31:02.126 --> 31:06.846
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

31:07.086 --> 31:10.606
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

31:10.846 --> 31:12.406
then I'll be saved."

31:12.606 --> 31:16.046
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

31:16.246 --> 31:17.766
"Already he doesn't love us

31:18.006 --> 31:20.006
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

31:20.206 --> 31:23.966
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

31:24.166 --> 31:27.046
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

31:27.246 --> 31:28.686
it's better to forget about it."

31:28.886 --> 31:31.206
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

31:31.406 --> 31:34.806
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

31:35.006 --> 31:38.006
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

31:38.206 --> 31:41.246
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

31:41.446 --> 31:43.726
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

31:43.966 --> 31:46.246
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

31:46.446 --> 31:48.806
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

31:49.006 --> 31:51.646
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

31:51.846 --> 31:54.886
and he said to her that,

31:55.086 --> 31:58.166
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

31:58.366 --> 32:03.366
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

32:03.926 --> 32:06.406
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

32:06.726 --> 32:09.446
for that pain, of course, why not?"

32:10.246 --> 32:15.886
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

32:16.126 --> 32:18.086
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

32:18.326 --> 32:20.406
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

32:20.646 --> 32:22.406
he has no sense of sin at all.

32:22.646 --> 32:24.686
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

32:24.926 --> 32:26.246
what am I to worry about sins.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.606
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

32:29.806 --> 32:30.926
this is his worry."

32:31.206 --> 32:33.726
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

32:33.926 --> 32:36.246
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

32:36.486 --> 32:39.286
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

32:39.486 --> 32:41.646
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

32:41.886 --> 32:45.166
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

32:45.406 --> 32:48.246
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

32:48.446 --> 32:50.166
He said, "You'll understand just now."

32:50.446 --> 32:52.726
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

32:52.966 --> 32:57.966
you see Radha's feet were dusted

32:58.166 --> 33:00.166
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

33:00.366 --> 33:06.606
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

33:06.806 --> 33:09.286
you see, the soil is yellowish

33:09.486 --> 33:13.646
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

33:13.846 --> 33:16.126
which she removed and took it.

33:16.326 --> 33:21.366
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

33:21.846 --> 33:25.406
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

33:25.606 --> 33:30.366
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

33:30.606 --> 33:32.646
on the lotus of his heart.

33:32.846 --> 33:38.846
The lotus had the pollen,

33:39.326 --> 33:41.366
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

33:41.566 --> 33:43.246
and was making it yellow.

33:43.566 --> 33:46.966
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

33:47.166 --> 33:53.166
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

33:55.286 --> 33:59.806
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

34:00.046 --> 34:03.006
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

34:03.246 --> 34:06.566
They have to be Radha to understand him.

34:06.806 --> 34:09.046
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

34:09.286 --> 34:12.006
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

34:12.246 --> 34:17.886
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

34:18.086 --> 34:21.286
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

34:21.566 --> 34:24.686
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

34:24.926 --> 34:27.486
give him the the power and everybody danced.

34:27.726 --> 34:31.286
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

34:31.566 --> 34:35.006
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

34:35.206 --> 34:39.246
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

34:39.486 --> 34:41.326
For a minute you abandon everything."

34:41.566 --> 34:44.406
And that abandonment has now become a,

34:44.646 --> 34:46.526
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

34:46.726 --> 34:50.526
here it has become a year-long Holi.

34:50.766 --> 34:52.606
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

34:52.806 --> 34:54.486
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.966
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

34:58.166 --> 35:00.766
And that's why I think, what happens that

35:00.966 --> 35:04.846
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

35:05.086 --> 35:08.086
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

35:08.326 --> 35:11.326
And once they get into you, you get funny,

35:11.526 --> 35:13.046
you don't know why you behave like this,

35:13.246 --> 35:15.606
why things work out that way.

35:15.886 --> 35:17.766
This is why we have to understand

35:17.966 --> 35:20.606
that we have to be attractive to God.

35:20.846 --> 35:25.166
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

35:25.446 --> 35:29.166
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

35:29.646 --> 35:32.326
So May God Bless You.

35:34.046 --> 35:37.055
I'll have some water to drink.

35:38.045 --> 35:40.060
Can we not open the sight a little bit of this?

35:41.040 --> 35:43.057
It's too much!

35:46.064 --> 35:51.063
Also something from this side to pass a little bit here.

35:57.047 --> 36:02.051
YOGI: This now is the english version, I read this to You.

36:04.041 --> 36:07.042
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, this you can do it and wash my feet.

36:07.047 --> 36:08.059
... one this ... with this ...

36:08.064 --> 36:12.042
So once it is to say in Sanskrit, then you say it to it that

36:12.047 --> 36:16.050
and just pour water on my feet. All right?

36:21.048 --> 36:25.045
As soon as you will open the breeze will start.

36:25.054 --> 36:28.056
That's all sufficient.

36:38.045 --> 36:40.058
So now you put the thing here.

36:40.063 --> 36:44.053
It's too much. Now this water should not be touched with hand,

36:44.060 --> 36:48.057
should be kept for using it for all kinds of purposes

36:48.062 --> 36:54.051
and also now somebody in Austria has experimented with this water

36:54.057 --> 36:59.063
and he found that corn which was only so

37:00.043 --> 37:03.053
so much developed with normal water,

37:03.061 --> 37:06.055
because he didn't want to use a hybrid seed, you see,

37:06.060 --> 37:09.044
so with that it developed only up to this point,

37:09.049 --> 37:14.061
but with the vibrated water it became very normal thing

37:15.042 --> 37:18.045
and gave very beautiful corn.

37:18.050 --> 37:24.059
So he has written a very nice article about it

37:24.064 --> 37:26.050
which is going to sent to all the people.

37:26.055 --> 37:28.054
I hope he sent it to you also,

37:28.059 --> 37:31.042
so that now we need not use hybrid,

37:31.047 --> 37:33.048
we can use ordinary seed.

37:33.053 --> 37:37.051
Ordinary seeds, vibrate them and we can get a good gield,

37:37.056 --> 37:40.059
because hybrid you know cannot regenerate and creates problem.

37:41.045 --> 37:45.041
I mean if you eat hybrid food maybe your brain might go out.

37:45.046 --> 37:47.061
Those people who talk about insanity in America,

37:48.041 --> 37:52.059
have to know much more about these things I think.

37:53.064 --> 37:58.042
Ask someone to pour the water just on me.

38:08.040 --> 38:13.064
Hmm just pour it - now is it warm water?

38:16.052 --> 38:18.050
Slowly ... now ...

38:18.055 --> 38:21.058
Do you see that? Start it.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.064
Now you read it.

41:56.042 --> 41:58.043
You have to remove it.

41:58.050 --> 41:59.064
Yes remove this water.

42:18.064 --> 42:21.054
This is the translation [inaudible]

42:30.062 --> 42:32.046
This is meaning the Virat, you see,

42:32.051 --> 42:34.052
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

42:34.057 --> 42:39.045
So everybody has to say with the same frequency, same

42:39.050 --> 42:42.050
- ah - understanding,

42:42.055 --> 42:47.060
same voice, because you belong to one personality.

44:22.047 --> 44:25.054
Again the discrition. You see in the Krishna

44:25.059 --> 44:32.041
in the Krishna-consciousness He is the discrition.

45:42.042 --> 45:44.055
Why it is said it is only you

45:44.060 --> 45:48.062
and alone you, because Kundalini doesn't exist there,

45:49.043 --> 45:52.042
this is the point, you see, it is a very subtle point there.

45:52.047 --> 45:55.040
Kundalini doesn't exist on Mooladhara-Chakra,

45:55.050 --> 45:56.060
She exists on Mooladhara.

45:57.040 --> 46:00.052
So the confusion that people are creating, that by doing sex

46:00.058 --> 46:04.051
you can achieve God is a wrong confusion.

46:04.056 --> 46:09.053
It is He, is the innocence that resides there.

46:10.045 --> 46:12.059
That's a very important point.

50:36.045 --> 50:37.058
So now you should get

50:37.063 --> 50:40.061
unmarried girls who are not very young.

50:41.043 --> 50:44.051
Big, big girls unmarried to put the rest of it.

50:44.056 --> 50:50.046
All right. Now you take that "Yah Devi Bhut -"

50:50.051 --> 50:53.056
Yes, that one, you have to say that.

50:54.042 --> 51:00.046
So now ... the Puja of the Shakti

51:00.051 --> 51:03.044
is the Power for the Ladies

51:03.051 --> 51:06.063
ah, who are not married girls, but not very small girls,

51:07.043 --> 51:10.052
but girls who are not married.

51:10.062 --> 51:13.053
As you like.

51:27.064 --> 51:30.042
Yes come here! Remove that

51:30.048 --> 51:33.056
and with this you have to fill up the whole thing.

51:34.040 --> 51:38.048
Beyond this. Remove it on top of this.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.059
Please come along, come, everyone, everyone.

51:40.064 --> 51:45.042
Just tell them how to do it. Come along.

51:46.061 --> 51:49.060
Please come forward.

52:00.059 --> 52:02.058
Not beyond the line.

52:03.046 --> 52:06.062
Be carefull not to go, not on the line, beyond the line, that side.

52:07.044 --> 52:09.063
YOGI: We begin by taking the twenty -one names of Lord Vishnu.

52:10.044 --> 52:12.058
SHRI MATAJI: Now you should read Devis' this time.

52:13.041 --> 52:15.058
YOGI: Om Keshavaya namaha.

52:16.041 --> 52:20.056
Salutations to the one who has hair like a lion.

52:20.062 --> 52:23.050
Om Narayana namaha.

52:23.057 --> 52:27.056
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, this is the one of the, Krishnas, isn't it?

52:27.061 --> 52:31.060
Ah, no, no, just now you have to take the names of the Goddess.

52:32.040 --> 52:38.056
Ah of ah, Ya Devi sarva bhute shu.

52:44.064 --> 52:47.064
Devika [inaudible]

53:02.064 --> 53:08.041
All right. Let others also come and do it.

58:19.051 --> 58:22.058
SHRI MATAJI: Chiti Rupena ... Chiti Rupena

58:22.064 --> 58:25.056
Chiti is the power of attention.

58:25.061 --> 58:27.049
Chiti Rupena.

58:27.054 --> 58:31.058
YOGI: Chiti Rupena Ya Krutsnam etad.

58:31.064 --> 58:34.042
Vyapya Sthita Jagat

58:34.047 --> 58:36.055
Nmastasyai, Namastasyai

58:36.061 --> 58:40.053
Namastasyai Namoh Namah.

58:40.060 --> 58:43.045
SHRI MATAJI: Done so well.

58:43.050 --> 58:46.063
She is the power of the attention, is the Mother.

58:47.048 --> 58:52.053
So She is as the Chiti pervades the whole Universe,

58:52.058 --> 58:55.041
Her attention is everywhere.

58:55.049 --> 58:59.044
That's what it means. Now

58:59.049 --> 59:01.055
Now have you got a translation there?

59:01.061 --> 59:03.058
But in the -, have you got the Gheeta?

59:03.063 --> 59:06.050
Have you got the book?

59:06.056 --> 59:09.041
Yes, yes, just read it out to them.

59:09.046 --> 59:12.049
Done? Good.

59:18.056 --> 59:21.043
May God bless you.

59:25.053 --> 59:28.040
SHRI MATAJI: You have to stay here. There is one more person only?

59:28.045 --> 59:30.047
Come along. You see, because she can't do the [inaudible]

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:11.046
SHRI MATAJI: Not that, the feet, the feet, not that, the feet

01:01:13.054 --> 01:01:14.041
SHRI MATAJI: That?

01:01:14.046 --> 01:01:15.063
YOGI: Take your names Shri Mataji? SHRI MATAJI: Aah?

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.062
YOGI: Should we take the names of the Devi?

01:01:19.044 --> 01:01:23.048
SHRI MATAJI: I think, ah, you have to now start on the other one.

01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:28.060
A little later, all right, you can take some names, it's all right.

01:01:29.043 --> 01:01:32.042
[Hindi]

01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:35.048
Just put it on.

01:01:35.055 --> 01:01:36.059
Today is Krishna Puja,

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.062
that's why I want to have 108 names of Shri Krishna,

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:43.059
but let the feet be done with that.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.062
Ha, I must show this,

01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:50.059
they have brought some Gold in India,

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:54.043
they wanted to make something for My feet,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:59.055
from America, so Indians have made this,

01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:03.050
and this is to be kept here only for you people,

01:02:03.055 --> 01:02:05.055
Whenever I come you can use it,
01:02:06:20 -->01:02:10:03 s
o this is to go on the Vishuddi Chakra,

01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:12.044
on the Vishuddi-Finger, yeah, best,

01:02:12.052 --> 01:02:15.044
now, hmm,

01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:17.052
not you can do it, the girls have to do it,

01:02:17.057 --> 01:02:19.054
you leave it here, all right,

01:02:19.059 --> 01:02:23.051
now these three ladies can do it, come along.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.050
Please come forward. Now let her also come.

01:02:31.058 --> 01:02:33.057
Just here! Now, ah?

01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:34.059
YOGI: Shri Krishna?

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:38.062
SHRI MATAJI: You have to take the names of the Goddess, ah,

01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:44.054
yes, about twenty-one will do.

01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:53.064
YOGI: These are 108 of the thousand Names of the Mahadevi

01:02:54.044 --> 01:02:56.056
given in the Shri Lalitasahasranama.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:58.057
The great Goddess is at the same time

01:02:58.063 --> 01:03:01.050
simple and innocent as a little child

01:03:01.055 --> 01:03:04.064
and unfathomable, all pervading, totally illusive,

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.049
transcending all categories of perception,

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:10.046
all known and unknown Universes.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:13.055
The names simply expose some aspects of Her field,

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.050
SHRI MATAJI: A little slowly so that they consume it also,

01:03:16.055 --> 01:03:18.047
rather fast. Again, again read it!

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:22.047
YOGI: These are the 108 out of the thousand names of the Mahadevi,

01:03:22.057 --> 01:03:25.064
given in the Shri Lalita Sahasranama,

01:03:26.044 --> 01:03:28.054
The great Goddess is at the same time

01:03:28.061 --> 01:03:31.060
simple and innocent as a little child

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.063
and unfathomable, all-pervading, totally illusive,

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:39.041
transcending all categories of perception,

01:03:39.046 --> 01:03:42.042
all known and unknown Universes,

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:46.040
the names simply expose some aspects of Her field.

01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:48.056
She is to be worshipped.

01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:51.055
These Mantras should remind us that ultimately

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:54.064
it is only through the devotion and worship of the heart

01:03:55.044 --> 01:03:56.061
that the true nature of Her Holiness

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:59.059
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi can be exposed.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:04.056
May She, the ocean of mercy bless us all.

01:04:05.053 --> 01:04:10.040
YOGI: Om. SHRI MATAJI: That doesn't mean I am a diplomat, all right?

01:04:13.046 --> 01:04:16.043
Only I have to open your heart, that's all.

01:04:16.049 --> 01:04:19.042
I am not a diplomat.

01:04:23.053 --> 01:04:26.050
Not to My devotees.

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.063
YOGI: Can we take the names of Shri Vishnu, Mother?

01:26:19.051 --> 01:26:23.051
SHRI MATAJI: Not now, just a minute, just a minute.

01:26:53.051 --> 01:26:56.064
Now that's the Sari of Radaji [??], you can start Vishnus names.

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.051
YOGI: What do You want, Shri Mataji?

01:26:58.052 --> 01:27:00.061
SHRI MATAJI: Vishnus names. YOGI: Twenty-one?

01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:01.063
SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:04.064
You might take 108? But you are going to do the - ?

01:27:04.064 --> 01:27:07.045
YOGI: THe Havan. SHRI MATAJI: Alll right,

01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:10.045
twenty-one names and now bring the - ...

01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:08.063
These are only twenty -one, won't work out I think.

01:31:09.051 --> 01:31:13.051
Better do hundred and eight Names.

01:32:56.052 --> 01:32:59.063
Vanamala, Vanamadi here.

01:33:00.051 --> 01:33:06.051
Vanamadi is the One who is the garden.

01:33:08.051 --> 01:33:12.052
But it is all right, He has also Vaijayanti-mala, the whole thing.

01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:16.063
YOGI: Aum Sakshat Shri Kshetra-dnya namoh namaha.

01:40:17.051 --> 01:40:20.063
Salutations to the one who is the knower of the field.

01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:23.063
SHRI MATAJI: Knower of the field, field is the whole -,

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:27.063
kshetra is the whole being and the knower is the spirit,

01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:33.051
Kshetra-dnya, the One who knows the field.

01:45:32.052 --> 01:45:37.051
SHRI MATAJI: This is Shri Krishnas [inaudible].

01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:54.051
And Shivajis is like this, it makes the cross.

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.063
You have to hold the mirror

01:49:20.051 --> 01:49:25.051
and you tie it up. Still tie it like that.

01:49:30.053 --> 01:49:36.051
Lower! I think somebody else has to hold it.

01:49:37.052 --> 01:49:41.051
Lower! Put it lower.

01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:54.051
Just a minute, just a minute, all right.

01:50:06.051 --> 01:50:09.051
Hold it tight!

01:50:20.053 --> 01:50:22.052
All right.

01:50:40.052 --> 01:50:41.064
To have Vishuddi on the [inaudible],

01:50:42.052 --> 01:50:46.053
you have the cold also, [inaudible]

01:50:50.053 --> 01:50:56.051
Can I have that ... oil?

01:50:58.053 --> 01:51:03.051
So ... it's all right, it doesn't matter, show Me.

01:51:04.052 --> 01:51:05.040
YOGI: Do you think it is upstairs. Shri Mataji?

01:51:05.053 --> 01:51:08.053
SHRI MATAJI: No, no - it's all right.

01:51:37.051 --> 01:51:39.051
How? It's all right?

01:51:41.051 --> 01:51:45.051
Comb this hair, comb Shri Krishnas hair.

01:51:49.051 --> 01:51:51.051
Do it.

01:51:52.052 --> 01:51:56.051
That's good. The other side.

01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:03.051
It is fine.

01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:06.051
It's all right.

01:52:07.051 --> 01:52:10.052
He has combed Shri Krishnas hair.

01:52:12.052 --> 01:52:16.051
Now this Sari should be put right, not?

01:52:19.052 --> 01:52:23.052
All of them have to be brought on.

01:52:30.051 --> 01:52:33.040
This should be on the top

01:52:33.053 --> 01:52:36.053
not on the head ... all right ...

01:52:37.051 --> 01:52:39.064
... now this one more on this side ...

01:52:40.052 --> 01:52:43.053
... this one ... on this ... all right ...

01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:50.052
...  that's better ...

01:53:06.052 --> 01:53:09.051
I just vibrate it.

01:53:26.051 --> 01:53:30.064
Now, you have to take a full photograph, that's the main thing.

01:53:31.052 --> 01:53:33.053
[inaudible]

01:53:34.052 --> 01:53:36.064
[inaudible]

01:53:37.052 --> 01:53:42.040
Also these things, you see, you can put all these things in front.

01:53:42.053 --> 01:53:46.053
No, no, you see all those plastics you can put it here.

01:53:47.051 --> 01:53:48.064
Not, put it there infront,

01:53:49.052 --> 01:53:50.064
because that can look nice in the photograph.

01:53:51.052 --> 01:53:53.053
Just put it there.

01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:58.063
Also the worshipp-things, all brass things you can put there.

01:53:59.051 --> 01:54:03.051
Remove that cloth and just put the brass things on it.

01:54:05.052 --> 01:54:09.054
All right, it's better. It won't come that big,

01:58:44.051 --> 01:58:46.052
That we'll do later, all right?

01:58:46.055 --> 01:58:48.064
First of all, let them take a photograph I think ...

01:58:49.052 --> 01:58:52.054
Can you put it infront on that side?

01:58:58.051 --> 01:59:01.040
This one, now, yeah, now put it here for a while,

01:59:01.053 --> 01:59:06.054
Now take one photograph like that, for the Indians, you see?

01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:11.051
At the most you can garland.

01:59:17.055 --> 01:59:21.054
You just don't, they would like to see Me in complete ...

01:59:33.051 --> 01:59:36.051
Now somebody has to take the whole of it.

01:59:36.054 --> 01:59:39.055
Now who can do it, who have got a periscope?

01:59:53.054 --> 01:59:54.064
Are you getting the full?

01:59:55.052 --> 01:59:56.063
YOGI: Yeah, the whole thing.

01:59:57.051 --> 02:00:00.052
SHRI MATAJI: You just raise the full.

02:00:14.051 --> 02:00:15.063
Why don't you sit all the time,

02:00:16.051 --> 02:00:17.063
are you going to be busy with your child?

02:00:18.051 --> 02:00:20.051
Come along, sit down.

02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:23.063
All the time she is moving this way, that way.

02:00:24.051 --> 02:00:27.051
That's not good for vibrations. Sit down!

02:00:29.051 --> 02:00:31.052
Sit down with your baby.

02:08:33.054 --> 02:08:36.054
YOGI: You get some more water, Shri Mataji?

02:09:02.054 --> 02:09:04.040
You like some diet-coke? SHRI MATAJI: Hmm?

02:09:04.053 --> 02:09:07.052
YOGI: You like some diet-coke? You like some diet coke?

02:09:08.051 --> 02:09:10.051
SHRI MATAJI: You got [inaudible] YOGI: Would you like some diet-coke?

02:09:10.054 --> 02:09:13.051
SHRI MATAJI: Not that one.

02:09:16.051 --> 02:09:19.054
That's for Mataji Nirmala Devi, not for Shri Krishna.

02:09:28.051 --> 02:09:32.052
Before you come to America you must learn to take coke, isn't it?

02:09:33.051 --> 02:09:35.063
[inaudible] is too My brother,

02:09:36.051 --> 02:09:38.064
[inaudible] My brother, become like that, isn't it?

02:09:39.052 --> 02:09:43.063
When Krishna was playing with the boys

02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:47.051
who were looking after the herds of cows

02:09:47.054 --> 02:09:49.052
and He had to take the butter

02:09:49.055 --> 02:09:52.040
and now when you come to America you have to take coke.

02:09:52.053 --> 02:09:55.054
So better to have diet-coke.

02:09:56.051 --> 02:10:01.055
And if you go to Italy you have to eat Pizzas.

02:10:06.052 --> 02:10:09.052
That's all the play.

02:10:14.051 --> 02:10:19.051
Now, let's have it, is a play.

02:23:30.059 --> 02:23:34.051
Why the baby is so [inaudible] restless?

02:23:35.054 --> 02:23:38.055
She is crying out.

02:23:39.051 --> 02:23:43.051
Get some vibrated oil rubbed on her head.

02:23:45.051 --> 02:23:46.052
Good.

02:23:48.053 --> 02:23:52.052
It's good. May God bless you.

02:23:53.051 --> 02:23:56.064
If the children are very restless you must get some vibrated oil

02:23:57.052 --> 02:23:59.064
rub on the head, rub on the body every night.

02:24:00.052 --> 02:24:03.051
A child should not be restless. It should be able to sit quiet,

02:24:03.054 --> 02:24:06.051
otherwise it is not a good sign, especially in the Puja

02:24:06.054 --> 02:24:09.063
a child has to be quiet, otherwise there is something wrong.

02:24:10.051 --> 02:24:14.054
Look after your children, watch them.

02:24:19.051 --> 02:24:21.052
May God bless you.

02:24:23.053 --> 02:24:27.052
What a wonderfull Puja. Thank you very much!

02:25:42.051 --> 02:25:44.059
Thank you very much.

02:25:51.051 --> 02:25:54.054
If you all keep all right, I keep all right.

02:25:59.058 --> 02:26:02.056
Because you all are in My body.

02:26:27.051 --> 02:26:30.052
It's all right. Now what is the situation?

02:26:36.051 --> 02:26:39.056
YOGI: No, no, Shri Mataji we haven't planned any further.

02:26:40.054 --> 02:26:42.052
SHRI MATAJI: That's why I - if you have noticed

02:26:42.055 --> 02:26:45.051
today the ritual was up side down,

02:26:45.054 --> 02:26:47.058
because I wanted to bring forth that,

02:26:48.051 --> 02:26:51.054
that nothing is ...  YOGI: fixed.

02:26:51.057 --> 02:26:55.057
SHRI MATAJI: fixed for you, that is Shri Krishnas style.

02:27:04.054 --> 02:27:08.051
It was quiet nice

02:29:02.055 --> 02:29:06.056
YOGI: It is pretty in that frame. SHRI MATAJI: Hmm, good, good.

02:29:12.051 --> 02:29:15.040
YOGI: We hold it up. SHRI MATAJI: Ah, [inaudible].

02:29:15.053 --> 02:29:18.055
SHRI MATAJI: That's again the stylized one?

02:29:20.052 --> 02:29:22.055
What is the style called as?

02:29:22.058 --> 02:29:25.058
YOGI: I don't know on this. ANOTHER YOGI: Natural.

02:29:28.058 --> 02:29:30.058
Spontaneous.

02:29:34.051 --> 02:29:35.064
Some of the native art, Shri Mataji.

02:36:43.051 --> 02:36:46.051
SHRI MATAJI: Aha, that's beautiful.

02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:49.057
You know in this one also from My face,

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:52.059

02:36:52.062 --> 02:36:56.064
Can you see that? YOGI: Ah, yes Shri Mataji.

02:37:03.051 --> 02:37:08.051
YOGI: Another copy? ANOTHERYOGI: The whole book.

02:37:09.051 --> 02:37:12.064
SHRI MATAJI: This is a beautiful photograph.

02:37:15.051 --> 02:37:18.057
I don't know how she got it, on the top of My head.

02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:21.059
YOGINI: Sahasrara-Day-Puja, Shri Mataji.
02:37:23:19 -->02:37:25:19 In Vienna.

02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:30.051
SHRI MATAJI: That's another one.

02:37:30.059 --> 02:37:33.059
She has done some very good photographs.

02:37:35.054 --> 02:37:38.061
And this one, can you beat it?

02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:40.061
YOGINI: That's Gregoires, Mother.

02:37:40.064 --> 02:37:44.051
SHRI MATAJI: It's Gregoires, but still look at the red.

02:37:44.057 --> 02:37:46.058
This says automatically it came like that,

02:37:46.061 --> 02:37:49.052
like little [inaudible]

02:37:49.056 --> 02:37:52.062
which was not that red, but again it has come up.

02:37:53.051 --> 02:37:55.058
YOGI: It became red like Kumkum?

02:37:55.061 --> 02:37:59.057
SHRI MATAJI: Not Kumkum, it's red, shining red.

02:38:06.053 --> 02:38:10.051
This is another one, you see? YOGI: Ah?

02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:14.063
SHRI MATAJI: This Baby is crying.

02:38:20.051 --> 02:38:23.051

YOGI: Matterhorn. SHRI MATAJI: Matterhorn.

02:38:40.062 --> 02:38:42.059
OGI: The same shape as India up side down.

02:38:42.062 --> 02:38:46.052
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, but it is actually Ganeshas faces,

02:38:46.055 --> 02:38:49.055
You see there are Ganeshas, one Ganesha is like this,

02:38:49.058 --> 02:38:51.063
another like that, another like that.

02:38:52.051 --> 02:38:55.051
Four Ganeshas put together.

02:38:56.062 --> 02:39:00.061
This one is remarkable. How did you get My hair like that?

02:39:01.051 --> 02:39:03.063
YOGINI: You just moved it, I don't know, it came out [inaudible].

02:39:04.058 --> 02:39:07.053

SHRI MATAJI: Nagas. YOGINI: Gregoire said Nagas.

02:39:13.057 --> 02:39:15.060
SHRI MATAJI:It's very nice, it is very beautiful,

02:39:15.063 --> 02:39:18.063
she has a talent for that.

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:24.051
A real talent I must say.

02:39:29.051 --> 02:39:30.055
YOGI: We should publish a book

02:39:30.058 --> 02:39:32.040
of colour-photographs of You, Shri Mataji.

02:39:32.053 --> 02:39:35.040
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. YOGIS: It would be a bestseller, Shri Mataji.

02:39:35.053 --> 02:39:38.062
SHRI MATAJI: This looks like as if I am sitting in the Himalayas

02:39:39.057 --> 02:39:44.058
and it was not such a wild thing there, nothing, it's in a village.

02:39:46.051 --> 02:39:49.052
I can't explain it. This is another very good.

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:57.059
It's very nice, see that, very well.

02:39:57.062 --> 02:40:01.057
You all can go through it and see for yourself.

02:40:02.055 --> 02:40:04.055
Very beautiful.

02:40:16.058 --> 02:40:19.062
What have you written? YOGINI: This is the translation in Italian,

02:40:20.051 --> 02:40:22.058
from Saundaryalahari from Adi Shankara Charya.

02:40:22.061 --> 02:40:25.061
SHRI MATAJI: Oh I see, but then who is going to tran-

02:40:26.051 --> 02:40:27.060
which one it is you, just tell Me.

02:40:27.063 --> 02:40:29.060
YOGINI: It's all of it. SHRI MATAJI: Now I see.

02:40:29.063 --> 02:40:32.063
YOGINI: And we would like to publish it, publish it.

02:40:33.051 --> 02:40:36.040
SHRI MATAJI: Oh I ... YOGINI: It's all You.

02:40:39.058 --> 02:40:43.056
I couldn't written, I couldn't have written.

02:40:44.051 --> 02:40:46.051
Complete.

02:40:47.063 --> 02:40:49.063
Very beautiful.

02:40:54.053 --> 02:40:58.053
Very well done. May God bless you.
