00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.380
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.140
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:25.180
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.020
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.300
who had no idea about God at all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.180
because they started a theme

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.180
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.580
So, the birth determined the caste of a person.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.740
Before that,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.020
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.820
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.500
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.620
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.140
And that is how also

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.180
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.980
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.660
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.580
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
So it was agreed that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.740
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.940
Gradually, it amounted to this

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.780
that any child born out

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.100
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.980
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.700
Realized souls as their children.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.980
Maybe their own karmas,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.300
maybe the child, anything it is,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.660
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.060
devilish children.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:19.740
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.220
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.700
or the one who has known the Brahma.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.540
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.060
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.900
by what you do.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.340
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

00:02:41.612 --> 00:02:44.085
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:47.272
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

00:02:47.393 --> 00:02:54.366
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:03:01.446
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:06.486
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.686
who can only worship God.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:15.886
So to put another extreme

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:20.086
to what Rama has created,

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.006
to bring people into the centre,

00:03:23.206 --> 00:03:27.046
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.446
and rigidity of ritualism

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:35.526
and too much of fundamentalism.

00:03:35.846 --> 00:03:37.526
So to put an end to that

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.566
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:46.606
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:51.366
So he started a new theme of,

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:57.806
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:00.406
that such a new theme should come up.

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:05.606
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.806
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.566
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:19.246
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:21.966
So, the whole thing is a Leela.

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:26.566
And on this theme he worked out everything

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:29.926
to establish that it is a play.

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:33.566
And that is what you see in America,

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:36.926
very common that for people it has become a joke,

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.686
life has become a joke.

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.646
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:46.926
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:53.046
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:58.766
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:02.006
But it is a myth with Americans now

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:05.046
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:07.086
you have to have realisation.

00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:10.126
Like if you are standing in the water,

00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:17.326
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:23.246
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:27.366
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:29.646
by asserting itself.

00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:31.766
But if you're in the boat

00:05:32.046 --> 00:05:35.926
then the water that is around is an illusion.

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:38.606
So, it's the state at which you are.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:43.286
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:47.886
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:51.966
It is a reality. So, what they forgot this point,

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:55.206
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

00:05:55.486 --> 00:05:59.326
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:01.086
thinking that it's an illusion

00:06:01.286 --> 00:06:05.286
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:09.406
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:10.966
this thing should be so

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:14.526
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:17.966
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

00:06:18.166 --> 00:06:21.966
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

00:06:22.246 --> 00:06:24.366
And some people go to that limit to say

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:27.326
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:29.846
nothing like a evil force.

00:06:30.126 --> 00:06:33.766
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:39.846
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:45.126
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:49.886
In that play he was to be destroyed.

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:55.966
So, he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.566
what not to be destroyed.

00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:02.206
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:05.046
So, to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

00:07:05.246 --> 00:07:08.406
Like even if you think everything is a play,

00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:12.846
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

00:07:13.126 --> 00:07:15.886
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:17.646
like in a drama you sit down

00:07:17.886 --> 00:07:19.966
and you watch everything as a spectator,

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:26.126
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:30.606
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:34.006
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.646
You have a sense of discretion to know

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.406
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

00:07:39.646 --> 00:07:44.206
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:49.206
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:52.606
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

00:07:52.846 --> 00:07:55.926
you're involved in it. So, it is not,

00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:57.966
for you do not know the discretion

00:07:58.166 --> 00:07:59.766
between the tragedy and the comedy.

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:03.046
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

00:08:03.286 --> 00:08:06.766
if you do your job well then, it's a comedy,

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.846
otherwise it's a tragedy.

00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:14.126
So, there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:17.966
another of the one who is in it.

00:08:18.286 --> 00:08:20.926
So, one has to understand in that light,

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:24.086
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:29.326
he was meaning for him, not for others.

00:08:29.886 --> 00:08:31.326
For him it is a play.

00:08:31.526 --> 00:08:35.326
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:38.686
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

00:08:38.886 --> 00:08:41.686
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:47.206
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

00:08:47.566 --> 00:08:50.846
So, to him it was a play, everything was a play

00:08:51.046 --> 00:08:55.766
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

00:08:56.246 --> 00:09:01.086
So, the first thing if you are

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:03.566
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:08.086
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:13.166
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:15.726
You cannot say what is wisdom.

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:19.846
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:23.406
Wisdom is a temperament,

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.886
is a quality of a personality

00:09:27.246 --> 00:09:32.246
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

00:09:32.486 --> 00:09:36.486
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:38.486
who are not traditional.

00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:41.606
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

00:09:41.806 --> 00:09:44.926
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:49.166
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

00:09:49.366 --> 00:09:51.886
so he did not need any tradition at all.

00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:55.246
But for you, you have to understand from the people

00:09:55.446 --> 00:09:57.606
who have tradition what is wisdom.

00:09:57.846 --> 00:10:02.046
So, we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:07.566
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:12.446
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

00:10:12.686 --> 00:10:19.326
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:21.366
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:26.006
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:26.366 --> 00:10:30.086
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:33.486
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

00:10:33.686 --> 00:10:36.246
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:37.886
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

00:10:38.086 --> 00:10:41.326
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:10:41.686 --> 00:10:45.646
So, because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:50.446
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

00:10:50.646 --> 00:10:53.606
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

00:10:53.806 --> 00:10:54.726
instead of

00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:57.086
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

00:10:57.286 --> 00:10:59.886
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:03.766
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:07.006
spoiling the other chakra also.

00:11:07.246 --> 00:11:14.926
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

00:11:15.446 --> 00:11:17.766
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:21.966
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:24.726
That's the best way to escape it.

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:29.406
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

00:11:29.726 --> 00:11:32.326
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:35.286
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:39.206
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

00:11:39.486 --> 00:11:40.526
Now the another side

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:43.566
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.846
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

00:11:46.086 --> 00:11:50.406
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:53.966
So, "What's wrong?"

00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:59.366
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

00:11:59.926 --> 00:12:02.326
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

00:12:02.566 --> 00:12:06.966
So, it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:09.326
for example they paint their hair.

00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:12.966
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:18.126
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.846
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

00:12:21.046 --> 00:12:24.046
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:30.766
They cannot even create a little ant,

00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:34.686
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

00:12:35.126 --> 00:12:37.446
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:39.126
So, this is the right side thing

00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:45.646
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

00:12:47.286 --> 00:12:50.966
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:55.566
that eyes are the ones

00:12:55.766 --> 00:12:58.606
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:00.406
the power of Shri Krishna.

00:13:00.686 --> 00:13:05.926
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

00:13:06.126 --> 00:13:08.886
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

00:13:09.086 --> 00:13:10.766
if he has Krishna consciousness,

00:13:10.966 --> 00:13:13.726
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:17.326
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

00:13:17.566 --> 00:13:19.006
should be able to cure anyone.

00:13:19.246 --> 00:13:21.886
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

00:13:22.126 --> 00:13:23.926
if it has Krishna consciousness,

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:28.006
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

00:13:28.246 --> 00:13:32.526
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:37.046
So, on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

00:13:37.286 --> 00:13:38.326
When you feel guilty,

00:13:38.566 --> 00:13:41.566
they try to find out some method of expression.

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:43.566
So they say they go to some guru

00:13:43.766 --> 00:13:46.366
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

00:13:46.606 --> 00:13:49.046
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:52.966
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:56.206
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:58.726
you get completely caught-up.

00:13:58.926 --> 00:14:01.126
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:04.806
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

00:14:05.046 --> 00:14:08.566
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:13.966
who get anginas and also who get cancer

00:14:14.166 --> 00:14:16.326
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

00:14:16.526 --> 00:14:19.206
without the connection with the Divine.

00:14:19.446 --> 00:14:22.086
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

00:14:22.286 --> 00:14:25.086
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

00:14:25.286 --> 00:14:28.606
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

00:14:28.846 --> 00:14:34.006
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:38.686
without feeling the power of that mantra.

00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:41.526
So, in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

00:14:41.726 --> 00:14:44.486
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:47.086
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

00:14:47.326 --> 00:14:50.606
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:52.526
They think they're very responsible people

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:54.846
and do all irresponsible things.

00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:57.566
So, when you want to spoil that chakra,

00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.766
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

00:15:01.966 --> 00:15:06.406
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

00:15:06.646 --> 00:15:12.526
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

00:15:13.326 --> 00:15:16.326
When you start saying in the ego form that,

00:15:16.566 --> 00:15:21.766
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:26.126
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:30.206
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

00:15:30.486 --> 00:15:32.086
then the whole thing disappears

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:36.366
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:39.046
Islam is nothing but surrender.

00:15:39.286 --> 00:15:43.086
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

00:15:43.326 --> 00:15:48.046
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

00:15:48.286 --> 00:15:51.086
So, you play the melody of God.

00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:55.566
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:58.126
Every time you go back to discretion.

00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:00.766
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:04.046
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

00:16:04.286 --> 00:16:05.886
Like somebody wants to drink.

00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:11.406
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

00:16:12.366 --> 00:16:15.366
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:20.446
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:25.886
So, this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

00:16:26.206 --> 00:16:31.926
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

00:16:32.126 --> 00:16:35.166
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

00:16:35.406 --> 00:16:37.126
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

00:16:37.366 --> 00:16:40.246
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

00:16:40.446 --> 00:16:43.366
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:46.286
And then whatever you do has a justification.

00:16:46.526 --> 00:16:51.766
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:53.886
they actually robbed the other people of their land

00:16:54.086 --> 00:16:56.446
and now very nicely settled down.

00:16:56.686 --> 00:16:57.926
Now, when I say that,

00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:00.646
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

00:17:00.886 --> 00:17:04.886
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.406
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

00:17:07.646 --> 00:17:10.046
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:13.046
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

00:17:13.286 --> 00:17:18.566
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

00:17:18.766 --> 00:17:21.326
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

00:17:21.526 --> 00:17:24.046
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

00:17:24.286 --> 00:17:27.446
This is the way you face and not just to say,

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:31.926
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:34.406
But what are you doing about it?

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:38.206
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:41.926
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.246
I said, "What did you do there?

00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:46.886
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

00:17:47.126 --> 00:17:49.526
at least you did not go to fight there.

00:17:49.726 --> 00:17:51.366
Why did you feel guilty about it?"

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:53.726
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

00:17:53.926 --> 00:17:58.886
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:01.526
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:06.126
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

00:18:06.326 --> 00:18:11.246
that we suddenly become a personality

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:14.606
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:19.646
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:22.886
Alright, how?

00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:28.086
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:32.006
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

00:18:32.246 --> 00:18:34.766
Both are headaches to the whole world.

00:18:35.006 --> 00:18:38.166
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:42.326
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

00:18:42.646 --> 00:18:49.086
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

00:18:49.526 --> 00:18:54.286
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:56.966
Children and father cannot live together.

00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.926
Mother cannot live with the children.

00:18:59.126 --> 00:19:02.206
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

00:19:02.446 --> 00:19:06.486
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

00:19:06.726 --> 00:19:11.606
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

00:19:11.886 --> 00:19:13.886
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:16.366
There's no unison, there is no concord.

00:19:16.606 --> 00:19:20.286
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:24.886
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

00:19:25.086 --> 00:19:30.526
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:33.966
Even the destruction of evil is important,

00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:37.366
even the killing of the evil is important.

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:41.046
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:42.646
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

00:19:42.846 --> 00:19:46.966
and should have been put in charge of God?

00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:50.406
He's saved by killing him.

00:19:50.646 --> 00:19:52.406
Because he was destroyed,

00:19:52.606 --> 00:19:57.526
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

00:19:58.006 --> 00:20:01.286
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

00:20:01.486 --> 00:20:04.766
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.286
evil is to be finished.

00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:08.646
So, what you have to pray

00:20:08.846 --> 00:20:11.646
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:16.366
all the destruction of the world,

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:20.126
all the minds which build up our destruction,

00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:22.966
please try to neutralise it."

00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.486
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

00:20:25.686 --> 00:20:26.486
Instead of that,

00:20:26.686 --> 00:20:31.646
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:34.006
That's not correct . You have to stand up

00:20:34.246 --> 00:20:36.166
and you have to say, "That it's wrong",

00:20:36.406 --> 00:20:39.766
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:41.286
we have no right."

00:20:41.486 --> 00:20:46.046
So when Krishna told Arjuna that, "You kill everyone

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:48.806
who are related to you, who are your friends

00:20:49.046 --> 00:20:54.086
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:56.446
It was Shri Krishna who said,

00:20:56.726 --> 00:21:00.966
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

00:21:01.206 --> 00:21:03.486
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

00:21:03.686 --> 00:21:08.766
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

00:21:09.846 --> 00:21:13.846
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

00:21:14.046 --> 00:21:16.086
which started killing everyone,

00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:20.326
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

00:21:20.686 --> 00:21:22.286
You have no sense of right and wrong.

00:21:22.526 --> 00:21:25.966
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

00:21:26.166 --> 00:21:28.446
First of all try to save instead of killing.

00:21:28.686 --> 00:21:33.166
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

00:21:33.366 --> 00:21:34.686
people are getting drowned

00:21:34.886 --> 00:21:37.046
and you find that you have to save the people.

00:21:37.286 --> 00:21:41.126
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

00:21:41.326 --> 00:21:43.246
There is no occasion for killing now.

00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:46.486
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:49.166
What you have to do is to save people,

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:53.446
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

00:21:53.686 --> 00:21:58.246
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:01.686
You just move them out. Take them away.

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:03.086
Have nothing to do with them.

00:22:03.286 --> 00:22:06.446
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

00:22:06.686 --> 00:22:10.326
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:10.566 --> 00:22:14.166
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

00:22:14.406 --> 00:22:18.086
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

00:22:18.326 --> 00:22:21.646
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

00:22:22.006 --> 00:22:25.006
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

00:22:25.206 --> 00:22:29.446
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:32.006
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

00:22:32.206 --> 00:22:32.926
you don't take up

00:22:33.126 --> 00:22:36.806
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

00:22:37.046 --> 00:22:39.966
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:42.286
I've seen people become very aggressive,

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.126
they talk very aggressively.

00:22:44.326 --> 00:22:47.446
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

00:22:47.686 --> 00:22:51.526
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

00:22:51.726 --> 00:22:54.246
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

00:22:54.486 --> 00:22:57.286
Very common.

00:22:58.486 --> 00:23:02.926
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:05.766
Then you start aggressing each other also,

00:23:05.966 --> 00:23:08.806
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

00:23:09.006 --> 00:23:09.926
You're not to aggress.

00:23:10.126 --> 00:23:12.886
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

00:23:13.086 --> 00:23:16.206
What is discretion is diplomacy.

00:23:16.486 --> 00:23:19.606
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:21.886
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

00:23:22.086 --> 00:23:23.806
this man is dangerous,

00:23:24.046 --> 00:23:25.406
he is troubling you,

00:23:25.606 --> 00:23:27.286
now if you have a proper sense,

00:23:27.486 --> 00:23:30.926
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:35.966
that there won't be any more discussion or destruction.

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:40.806
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

00:23:41.046 --> 00:23:43.766
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

00:23:44.006 --> 00:23:48.326
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

00:23:48.686 --> 00:23:50.686
So must have discretion, must understand.

00:23:50.886 --> 00:23:53.886
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

00:23:54.086 --> 00:23:55.966
where you find somebody is telling you,

00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:58.886
"You see, this person has said this about you."

00:23:59.126 --> 00:24:01.606
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

00:24:01.846 --> 00:24:04.326
"That person has said this about you."

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:06.246
Then you start quarelling

00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:10.606
instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

00:24:10.766 --> 00:24:13.726
"Why, why this is happening,

00:24:13.966 --> 00:24:16.406
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

00:24:16.646 --> 00:24:18.206
We were friends, what has happened?"

00:24:18.406 --> 00:24:21.326
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

00:24:21.526 --> 00:24:27.886
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

00:24:28.126 --> 00:24:32.886
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

00:24:33.126 --> 00:24:35.166
delicate, beautiful.

00:24:35.366 --> 00:24:39.046
Nobody should notice

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:45.326
that you have been in any way effective,

00:24:46.926 --> 00:24:49.246
and that's how you'll work it out.

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:52.286
So, the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

00:24:52.486 --> 00:24:56.046
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:58.926
So, he plays.

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:01.166
Give you an example how he plays.

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:06.726
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

00:25:07.126 --> 00:25:12.206
who had a blessing from Shiva

00:25:12.446 --> 00:25:18.526
that nobody can kill him.

00:25:19.526 --> 00:25:25.326
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

00:25:25.686 --> 00:25:29.086
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:34.006
So, there was a saint who had a blessing

00:25:34.326 --> 00:25:37.926
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

00:25:38.126 --> 00:25:42.046
sleep in your yoga sleep,

00:25:42.246 --> 00:25:45.126
and once you open your eyes

00:25:45.326 --> 00:25:50.806
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

00:25:53.046 --> 00:25:56.286
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

00:25:56.566 --> 00:25:59.446
He was fighting this devil

00:25:59.646 --> 00:26:03.326
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

00:26:03.526 --> 00:26:07.366
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:10.526
So he started running away from the field,

00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:12.766
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

00:26:12.966 --> 00:26:15.526
the one who runs away from the battle field,

00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:18.366
is regarded as something really derogatory,

00:26:18.566 --> 00:26:22.206
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

00:26:22.446 --> 00:26:23.326
So, he didn't mind,

00:26:23.526 --> 00:26:27.166
he ran away and then this devil started following him

00:26:27.366 --> 00:26:28.486
And he went into the cave

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:32.846
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

00:26:33.486 --> 00:26:36.446
And he removed his shawl

00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:40.766
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

00:26:41.046 --> 00:26:42.726
and hid himself.

00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:45.006
So, this rakshasa came behind him.

00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:48.886
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

00:26:49.126 --> 00:26:52.766
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

00:26:53.006 --> 00:26:55.046
Come along now, open your eyes!"

00:26:55.286 --> 00:27:01.246
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:04.286
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

00:27:04.486 --> 00:27:07.526
and he just was burnt.

00:27:10.526 --> 00:27:14.326
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

00:27:14.606 --> 00:27:17.926
That is the sign of diplomacy.

00:27:18.126 --> 00:27:23.326
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

00:27:23.526 --> 00:27:26.126
the whole discretion, what he should do,

00:27:26.326 --> 00:27:28.046
what is right, what is wrong,

00:27:28.286 --> 00:27:31.846
is he doesn't have this problem.

00:27:32.126 --> 00:27:36.966
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.686
So, he played a trick .

00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:44.646
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

00:27:45.206 --> 00:27:50.886
And he made one king - you see-

00:27:51.846 --> 00:27:59.126
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

00:27:59.326 --> 00:28:01.846
But he could never touch them.

00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:04.886
So, Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

00:28:05.086 --> 00:28:07.006
He has to have justification also;

00:28:07.206 --> 00:28:09.806
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

00:28:10.126 --> 00:28:12.686
So he killed this king, brought all these women

00:28:12.926 --> 00:28:18.766
and they all became his wives, so-called.

00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:22.446
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

00:28:22.646 --> 00:28:25.166
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:28.606
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

00:28:28.886 --> 00:28:31.806
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

00:28:32.086 --> 00:28:36.086
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

00:28:36.326 --> 00:28:39.766
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

00:28:39.966 --> 00:28:44.126
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:48.446
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

00:28:48.686 --> 00:28:51.766
meaning the power of creation,

00:28:52.006 --> 00:28:54.086
because creation has been done already.

00:28:54.326 --> 00:28:57.286
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:59.326
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

00:28:59.526 --> 00:29:01.486
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:04.926
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

00:29:05.126 --> 00:29:08.126
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

00:29:08.366 --> 00:29:11.486
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:13.446
and she opens her left side.

00:29:13.686 --> 00:29:15.526
And in front of her

00:29:15.766 --> 00:29:19.766
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

00:29:20.006 --> 00:29:22.646
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

00:29:22.846 --> 00:29:25.126
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:29.566
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

00:29:29.766 --> 00:29:32.686
But in this one, the one that they have here

00:29:32.926 --> 00:29:34.846
is the child is kept underneath this,

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:38.366
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

00:29:38.566 --> 00:29:42.566
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

00:29:42.766 --> 00:29:45.566
So I'll tell you the last story about her

00:29:45.766 --> 00:29:52.206
which will conclude this talk about

00:29:52.446 --> 00:29:54.166
Radha and Shri Krishna.

00:29:54.406 --> 00:29:56.846
That one day,

00:29:57.646 --> 00:30:03.286
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

00:30:03.526 --> 00:30:05.246
and Narada said, "See,

00:30:05.486 --> 00:30:07.966
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

00:30:08.166 --> 00:30:10.446
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

00:30:10.646 --> 00:30:15.286
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

00:30:15.526 --> 00:30:20.206
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:24.166
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

00:30:24.366 --> 00:30:27.406
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:30.526
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

00:30:30.726 --> 00:30:32.406
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

00:30:32.606 --> 00:30:35.686
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

00:30:35.886 --> 00:30:37.286
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

00:30:37.486 --> 00:30:41.206
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.166
so don't listen to him."

00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:45.486
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

00:30:45.726 --> 00:30:47.286
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

00:30:47.486 --> 00:30:49.446
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:53.006
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

00:30:53.206 --> 00:30:56.766
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

00:30:57.006 --> 00:30:59.966
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

00:31:00.166 --> 00:31:01.926
He said, "There's very simple thing that

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:06.846
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:10.606
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

00:31:10.846 --> 00:31:12.406
then I'll be saved."

00:31:12.606 --> 00:31:16.046
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

00:31:16.246 --> 00:31:17.766
"Already he doesn't love us

00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:20.006
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

00:31:20.206 --> 00:31:23.966
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:27.046
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

00:31:27.246 --> 00:31:28.686
it's better to forget about it."

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:31.206
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

00:31:31.406 --> 00:31:34.806
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

00:31:35.006 --> 00:31:38.006
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

00:31:38.206 --> 00:31:41.246
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

00:31:41.446 --> 00:31:43.726
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

00:31:43.966 --> 00:31:46.246
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:48.806
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

00:31:49.006 --> 00:31:51.646
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

00:31:51.846 --> 00:31:54.886
and he said to her that,

00:31:55.086 --> 00:31:58.166
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

00:31:58.366 --> 00:32:03.366
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

00:32:03.926 --> 00:32:06.406
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:09.446
for that pain, of course, why not?"

00:32:10.246 --> 00:32:15.886
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

00:32:16.126 --> 00:32:18.086
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

00:32:18.326 --> 00:32:20.406
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

00:32:20.646 --> 00:32:22.406
he has no sense of sin at all.

00:32:22.646 --> 00:32:24.686
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

00:32:24.926 --> 00:32:26.246
what am I to worry about sins.

00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:29.606
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

00:32:29.806 --> 00:32:30.926
this is his worry."

00:32:31.206 --> 00:32:33.726
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

00:32:33.926 --> 00:32:36.246
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

00:32:36.486 --> 00:32:39.286
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

00:32:39.486 --> 00:32:41.646
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

00:32:41.886 --> 00:32:45.166
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:48.246
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

00:32:48.446 --> 00:32:50.166
He said, "You'll understand just now."

00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:52.726
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

00:32:52.966 --> 00:32:57.966
you see Radha's feet were dusted

00:32:58.166 --> 00:33:00.166
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

00:33:00.366 --> 00:33:06.606
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:09.286
you see, the soil is yellowish

00:33:09.486 --> 00:33:13.646
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:16.126
which she removed and took it.

00:33:16.326 --> 00:33:21.366
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

00:33:21.846 --> 00:33:25.406
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

00:33:25.606 --> 00:33:30.366
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

00:33:30.606 --> 00:33:32.646
on the lotus of his heart.

00:33:32.846 --> 00:33:38.846
The lotus had the pollen,

00:33:39.326 --> 00:33:41.366
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

00:33:41.566 --> 00:33:43.246
and was making it yellow.

00:33:43.566 --> 00:33:46.966
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:53.166
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

00:33:55.286 --> 00:33:59.806
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

00:34:00.046 --> 00:34:03.006
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

00:34:03.246 --> 00:34:06.566
They have to be Radha to understand him.

00:34:06.806 --> 00:34:09.046
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

00:34:09.286 --> 00:34:12.006
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

00:34:12.246 --> 00:34:17.886
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

00:34:18.086 --> 00:34:21.286
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

00:34:21.566 --> 00:34:24.686
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

00:34:24.926 --> 00:34:27.486
give him the the power and everybody danced.

00:34:27.726 --> 00:34:31.286
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

00:34:31.566 --> 00:34:35.006
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:39.246
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

00:34:39.486 --> 00:34:41.326
For a minute you abandon everything."

00:34:41.566 --> 00:34:44.406
And that abandonment has now become a,

00:34:44.646 --> 00:34:46.526
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

00:34:46.726 --> 00:34:50.526
here it has become a year-long Holi.

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:52.606
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

00:34:52.806 --> 00:34:54.486
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:57.966
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.766
And that's why I think, what happens that

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:04.846
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

00:35:05.086 --> 00:35:08.086
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

00:35:08.326 --> 00:35:11.326
And once they get into you, you get funny,

00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:13.046
you don't know why you behave like this,

00:35:13.246 --> 00:35:15.606
why things work out that way.

00:35:15.886 --> 00:35:17.766
This is why we have to understand

00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:20.606
that we have to be attractive to God.

00:35:20.846 --> 00:35:25.166
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

00:35:25.446 --> 00:35:29.166
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

00:35:29.646 --> 00:35:32.326
So May God Bless You.

00:35:34.046 --> 00:35:37.055
 I'll have some water to drink.

00:35:38.045 --> 00:35:40.060
Can we not open the sight a little bit of this?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.057
 It's too much!

00:35:46.064 --> 00:35:51.063
Also something from this side to pass a little bit here.

00:35:57.047 --> 00:36:02.051
YOGI: This now is the english version, I read this to You.

00:36:04.041 --> 00:36:07.042
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, this you can do it and wash my feet.

00:36:07.047 --> 00:36:08.059
 ... one this ... with this ...

00:36:08.064 --> 00:36:12.042
 So once it is to say in Sanskrit, then you say it to it that

00:36:12.047 --> 00:36:16.050
 and just pour water on my feet. All right?

00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:25.045
As soon as you will open the breeze will start.

00:36:25.054 --> 00:36:28.056
That's all sufficient.

00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:40.058
So now you put the thing here.

00:36:40.063 --> 00:36:44.053
 It's too much. Now this water should not be touched with hand,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.057
 should be kept for using it for all kinds of purposes

00:36:48.062 --> 00:36:54.051
and also now somebody in Austria has experimented with this water

00:36:54.057 --> 00:36:59.063
and he found that corn which was only so

00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:03.053
so much developed with normal water,

00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:06.055
because he didn't want to use a hybrid seed, you see,

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.044
so with that it developed only up to this point,

00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:14.061
 but with the vibrated water it became very normal thing

00:37:15.042 --> 00:37:18.045
and gave very beautiful corn.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:24.059
So he has written a very nice article about it

00:37:24.064 --> 00:37:26.050
which is going to sent to all the people.

00:37:26.055 --> 00:37:28.054
I hope he sent it to you also,

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:31.042
so that now we need not use hybrid,

00:37:31.047 --> 00:37:33.048
we can use ordinary seed.

00:37:33.053 --> 00:37:37.051
 Ordinary seeds, vibrate them and we can get a good gield,

00:37:37.056 --> 00:37:40.059
 because hybrid you know cannot regenerate and creates problem.

00:37:41.045 --> 00:37:45.041
I mean if you eat hybrid food maybe your brain might go out.

00:37:45.046 --> 00:37:47.061
Those people who talk about insanity in America,

00:37:48.041 --> 00:37:52.059
have to know much more about these things I think.

00:37:53.064 --> 00:37:58.042
Ask someone to pour the water just on me.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:13.064
Hmm just pour it - now is it warm water?

00:38:16.052 --> 00:38:18.050
Slowly ... now ...

00:38:18.055 --> 00:38:21.058
Do you see that? Start it.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.064
Now you read it.

00:41:56.042 --> 00:41:58.043
You have to remove it.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:59.064
Yes remove this water.

00:42:18.064 --> 00:42:21.054
This is the translation [inaudible]

00:42:30.062 --> 00:42:32.046
 This is meaning the Virat, you see,

00:42:32.051 --> 00:42:34.052
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:42:34.057 --> 00:42:39.045
So everybody has to say with the same frequency, same

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.050
 - ah - understanding,

00:42:42.055 --> 00:42:47.060
same voice, because you belong to one personality.

00:44:22.047 --> 00:44:25.054
Again the discrition. You see in the Krishna

00:44:25.059 --> 00:44:32.041
in the Krishna-consciousness He is the discrition.

00:45:42.042 --> 00:45:44.055
Why it is said it is only you

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:48.062
 and alone you, because Kundalini doesn't exist there,

00:45:49.043 --> 00:45:52.042
this is the point, you see, it is a very subtle point there.

00:45:52.047 --> 00:45:55.040
 Kundalini doesn't exist on Mooladhara-Chakra,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.060
She exists on Mooladhara.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.052
So the confusion that people are creating, that by doing sex

00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:04.051
you can achieve God is a wrong confusion.

00:46:04.056 --> 00:46:09.053
 It is He, is the innocence that resides there.

00:46:10.045 --> 00:46:12.059
That's a very important point.

00:50:36.045 --> 00:50:37.058
So now you should get

00:50:37.063 --> 00:50:40.061
unmarried girls who are not very young.

00:50:41.043 --> 00:50:44.051
Big, big girls unmarried to put the rest of it.

00:50:44.056 --> 00:50:50.046
All right. Now you take that "Yah Devi Bhut -"

00:50:50.051 --> 00:50:53.056
Yes, that one, you have to say that.

00:50:54.042 --> 00:51:00.046
So now ... the Puja of the Shakti

00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:03.044
is the Power for the Ladies

00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:06.063
ah, who are not married girls, but not very small girls,

00:51:07.043 --> 00:51:10.052
but girls who are not married.

00:51:10.062 --> 00:51:13.053
As you like.

00:51:27.064 --> 00:51:30.042
Yes come here! Remove that

00:51:30.048 --> 00:51:33.056
and with this you have to fill up the whole thing.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.048
Beyond this. Remove it on top of this.

00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:40.059
Please come along, come, everyone, everyone.

00:51:40.064 --> 00:51:45.042
Just tell them how to do it. Come along.

00:51:46.061 --> 00:51:49.060
Please come forward.

00:52:00.059 --> 00:52:02.058
Not beyond the line.

00:52:03.046 --> 00:52:06.062
Be carefull not to go, not on the line, beyond the line, that side.

00:52:07.044 --> 00:52:09.063
YOGI: We begin by taking the twenty -one names of Lord Vishnu.

00:52:10.044 --> 00:52:12.058
SHRI MATAJI: Now you should read Devis' this time.

00:52:13.041 --> 00:52:15.058
YOGI: Om Keshavaya namaha.

00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:20.056
Salutations to the one who has hair like a lion.

00:52:20.062 --> 00:52:23.050
Om Narayana namaha.

00:52:23.057 --> 00:52:27.056
 SHRI MATAJI: No, no, this is the one of the, Krishnas, isn't it?

00:52:27.061 --> 00:52:31.060
Ah, no, no, just now you have to take the names of the Goddess.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:38.056
Ah of ah, Ya Devi sarva bhute shu.

00:52:44.064 --> 00:52:47.064
Devika [inaudible]

00:53:02.064 --> 00:53:08.041
All right. Let others also come and do it.

00:58:19.051 --> 00:58:22.058
SHRI MATAJI: Chiti Rupena ... Chiti Rupena

00:58:22.064 --> 00:58:25.056
Chiti is the power of attention.

00:58:25.061 --> 00:58:27.049
Chiti Rupena.

00:58:27.054 --> 00:58:31.058
YOGI: Chiti Rupena Ya Krutsnam etad.

00:58:31.064 --> 00:58:34.042
 Vyapya Sthita Jagat

00:58:34.047 --> 00:58:36.055
Nmastasyai, Namastasyai

00:58:36.061 --> 00:58:40.053
Namastasyai Namoh Namah.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:43.045
SHRI MATAJI: Done so well.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:46.063
 She is the power of the attention, is the Mother.

00:58:47.048 --> 00:58:52.053
So She is as the Chiti pervades the whole Universe,

00:58:52.058 --> 00:58:55.041
Her attention is everywhere.

00:58:55.049 --> 00:58:59.044
That's what it means. Now

00:58:59.049 --> 00:59:01.055
 Now have you got a translation there?

00:59:01.061 --> 00:59:03.058
But in the -, have you got the Gheeta?

00:59:03.063 --> 00:59:06.050
Have you got the book?

00:59:06.056 --> 00:59:09.041
Yes, yes, just read it out to them.

00:59:09.046 --> 00:59:12.049
Done? Good.

00:59:18.056 --> 00:59:21.043
May God bless you.

00:59:25.053 --> 00:59:28.040
SHRI MATAJI: You have to stay here. There is one more person only?

00:59:28.045 --> 00:59:30.047
Come along. You see, because she can't do the [inaudible]

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:11.046
SHRI MATAJI: Not that, the feet, the feet, not that, the feet

01:01:13.054 --> 01:01:14.041
SHRI MATAJI: That?

01:01:14.046 --> 01:01:15.063
YOGI: Take your names Shri Mataji? SHRI MATAJI: Aah?

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.062
YOGI: Should we take the names of the Devi?

01:01:19.044 --> 01:01:23.048
SHRI MATAJI: I think, ah, you have to now start on the other one.

01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:28.060
A little later, all right, you can take some names, it's all right.

01:01:29.043 --> 01:01:32.042
[Hindi]

01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:35.048
Just put it on.

01:01:35.055 --> 01:01:36.059
Today is Krishna Puja,

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.062
that's why I want to have 108 names of Shri Krishna,

01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:43.059
but let the feet be done with that.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.062
Ha, I must show this,

01:01:48.043 --> 01:01:50.059
they have brought some Gold in India,

01:01:51.042 --> 01:01:54.043
they wanted to make something for My feet,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:59.055
from America, so Indians have made this,

01:02:00.053 --> 01:02:03.050
and this is to be kept here only for you people,

01:02:03.055 --> 01:02:05.055
Whenever I come you can use it,
01:02:06:20 --&gt;01:02:10:03 s
o this is to go on the Vishuddi Chakra,

01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:12.044
on the Vishuddi-Finger, yeah, best,

01:02:12.052 --> 01:02:15.044
 now, hmm,

01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:17.052
 not you can do it, the girls have to do it,

01:02:17.057 --> 01:02:19.054
 you leave it here, all right,

01:02:19.059 --> 01:02:23.051
now these three ladies can do it, come along.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.050
 Please come forward. Now let her also come.

01:02:31.058 --> 01:02:33.057
 Just here! Now, ah?

01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:34.059
 YOGI: Shri Krishna?

01:02:34.064 --> 01:02:38.062
SHRI MATAJI: You have to take the names of the Goddess, ah,

01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:44.054
yes, about twenty-one will do.

01:02:50.052 --> 01:02:53.064
 YOGI: These are 108 of the thousand Names of the Mahadevi

01:02:54.044 --> 01:02:56.056
 given in the Shri Lalitasahasranama.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:58.057
 The great Goddess is at the same time

01:02:58.063 --> 01:03:01.050
 simple and innocent as a little child

01:03:01.055 --> 01:03:04.064
 and unfathomable, all pervading, totally illusive,

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.049
 transcending all categories of perception,

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:10.046
 all known and unknown Universes.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:13.055
 The names simply expose some aspects of Her field,

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.050
 SHRI MATAJI: A little slowly so that they consume it also,

01:03:16.055 --> 01:03:18.047
 rather fast. Again, again read it!

01:03:18.052 --> 01:03:22.047
YOGI: These are the 108 out of the thousand names of the Mahadevi,

01:03:22.057 --> 01:03:25.064
 given in the Shri Lalita Sahasranama,

01:03:26.044 --> 01:03:28.054
The great Goddess is at the same time

01:03:28.061 --> 01:03:31.060
simple and innocent as a little child

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.063
and unfathomable, all-pervading, totally illusive,

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:39.041
 transcending all categories of perception,

01:03:39.046 --> 01:03:42.042
 all known and unknown Universes,

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:46.040
 the names simply expose some aspects of Her field.

01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:48.056
She is to be worshipped.

01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:51.055
These Mantras should remind us that ultimately

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:54.064
 it is only through the devotion and worship of the heart

01:03:55.044 --> 01:03:56.061
 that the true nature of Her Holiness

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:59.059
 Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi can be exposed.

01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:04.056
 May She, the ocean of mercy bless us all.

01:04:05.053 --> 01:04:10.040
YOGI: Om. SHRI MATAJI: That doesn't mean I am a diplomat, all right?

01:04:13.046 --> 01:04:16.043
 Only I have to open your heart, that's all.

01:04:16.049 --> 01:04:19.042
 I am not a diplomat.

01:04:23.053 --> 01:04:26.050
Not to My devotees.

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.063
 YOGI: Can we take the names of Shri Vishnu, Mother?

01:26:19.051 --> 01:26:23.051
SHRI MATAJI: Not now, just a minute, just a minute.

01:26:53.051 --> 01:26:56.064
Now that's the Sari of Radaji [??], you can start Vishnus names.

01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:58.051
YOGI: What do You want, Shri Mataji?

01:26:58.052 --> 01:27:00.061
SHRI MATAJI: Vishnus names. YOGI: Twenty-one?

01:27:00.061 --> 01:27:01.063
SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:04.064
 You might take 108? But you are going to do the - ?

01:27:04.064 --> 01:27:07.045
YOGI: THe Havan. SHRI MATAJI: Alll right,

01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:10.045
 twenty-one names and now bring the - ...

01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:08.063
These are only twenty -one, won't work out I think.

01:31:09.051 --> 01:31:13.051
Better do hundred and eight Names.

01:32:56.052 --> 01:32:59.063
Vanamala, Vanamadi here.

01:33:00.051 --> 01:33:06.051
Vanamadi is the One who is the garden.

01:33:08.051 --> 01:33:12.052
But it is all right, He has also Vaijayanti-mala, the whole thing.

01:40:14.051 --> 01:40:16.063
YOGI: Aum Sakshat Shri Kshetra-dnya namoh namaha.

01:40:17.051 --> 01:40:20.063
 Salutations to the one who is the knower of the field.

01:40:21.051 --> 01:40:23.063
SHRI MATAJI: Knower of the field, field is the whole -,

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:27.063
kshetra is the whole being and the knower is the spirit,

01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:33.051
Kshetra-dnya, the One who knows the field.

01:45:32.052 --> 01:45:37.051
SHRI MATAJI: This is Shri Krishnas [inaudible].

01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:54.051
And Shivajis is like this, it makes the cross.

01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:19.063
You have to hold the mirror

01:49:20.051 --> 01:49:25.051
and you tie it up. Still tie it like that.

01:49:30.053 --> 01:49:36.051
Lower! I think somebody else has to hold it.

01:49:37.052 --> 01:49:41.051
Lower! Put it lower.

01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:54.051
Just a minute, just a minute, all right.

01:50:06.051 --> 01:50:09.051
Hold it tight!

01:50:20.053 --> 01:50:22.052
All right.

01:50:40.052 --> 01:50:41.064
To have Vishuddi on the [inaudible],

01:50:42.052 --> 01:50:46.053
you have the cold also, [inaudible]

01:50:50.053 --> 01:50:56.051
 Can I have that ... oil?

01:50:58.053 --> 01:51:03.051
 So ... it's all right, it doesn't matter, show Me.

01:51:04.052 --> 01:51:05.040
 YOGI: Do you think it is upstairs. Shri Mataji?

01:51:05.053 --> 01:51:08.053
SHRI MATAJI: No, no - it's all right.

01:51:37.051 --> 01:51:39.051
How? It's all right?

01:51:41.051 --> 01:51:45.051
 Comb this hair, comb Shri Krishnas hair.

01:51:49.051 --> 01:51:51.051
Do it.

01:51:52.052 --> 01:51:56.051
That's good. The other side.

01:52:00.052 --> 01:52:03.051
 It is fine.

01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:06.051
It's all right.

01:52:07.051 --> 01:52:10.052
He has combed Shri Krishnas hair.

01:52:12.052 --> 01:52:16.051
Now this Sari should be put right, not?

01:52:19.052 --> 01:52:23.052
All of them have to be brought on.

01:52:30.051 --> 01:52:33.040
This should be on the top

01:52:33.053 --> 01:52:36.053
not on the head ... all right ...

01:52:37.051 --> 01:52:39.064
 ... now this one more on this side ...

01:52:40.052 --> 01:52:43.053
 ... this one ... on this ... all right ...

01:52:47.052 --> 01:52:50.052
 ...  that's better ...

01:53:06.052 --> 01:53:09.051
I just vibrate it.

01:53:26.051 --> 01:53:30.064
Now, you have to take a full photograph, that's the main thing.

01:53:31.052 --> 01:53:33.053
 [inaudible]

01:53:34.052 --> 01:53:36.064
[inaudible]

01:53:37.052 --> 01:53:42.040
Also these things, you see, you can put all these things in front.

01:53:42.053 --> 01:53:46.053
No, no, you see all those plastics you can put it here.

01:53:47.051 --> 01:53:48.064
Not, put it there infront,

01:53:49.052 --> 01:53:50.064
 because that can look nice in the photograph.

01:53:51.052 --> 01:53:53.053
Just put it there.

01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:58.063
Also the worshipp-things, all brass things you can put there.

01:53:59.051 --> 01:54:03.051
 Remove that cloth and just put the brass things on it.

01:54:05.052 --> 01:54:09.054
All right, it's better. It won't come that big,

01:58:44.051 --> 01:58:46.052
That we'll do later, all right?

01:58:46.055 --> 01:58:48.064
First of all, let them take a photograph I think ...

01:58:49.052 --> 01:58:52.054
Can you put it infront on that side?

01:58:58.051 --> 01:59:01.040
This one, now, yeah, now put it here for a while,

01:59:01.053 --> 01:59:06.054
Now take one photograph like that, for the Indians, you see?

01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:11.051
At the most you can garland.

01:59:17.055 --> 01:59:21.054
You just don't, they would like to see Me in complete ...

01:59:33.051 --> 01:59:36.051
Now somebody has to take the whole of it.

01:59:36.054 --> 01:59:39.055
Now who can do it, who have got a periscope?

01:59:53.054 --> 01:59:54.064
 Are you getting the full?

01:59:55.052 --> 01:59:56.063
YOGI: Yeah, the whole thing.

01:59:57.051 --> 02:00:00.052
SHRI MATAJI: You just raise the full.

02:00:14.051 --> 02:00:15.063
Why don't you sit all the time,

02:00:16.051 --> 02:00:17.063
are you going to be busy with your child?

02:00:18.051 --> 02:00:20.051
 Come along, sit down.

02:00:21.051 --> 02:00:23.063
All the time she is moving this way, that way.

02:00:24.051 --> 02:00:27.051
That's not good for vibrations. Sit down!

02:00:29.051 --> 02:00:31.052
Sit down with your baby.

02:08:33.054 --> 02:08:36.054
YOGI: You get some more water, Shri Mataji?

02:09:02.054 --> 02:09:04.040
 You like some diet-coke? SHRI MATAJI: Hmm?

02:09:04.053 --> 02:09:07.052
 YOGI: You like some diet-coke? You like some diet coke?

02:09:08.051 --> 02:09:10.051
SHRI MATAJI: You got [inaudible] YOGI: Would you like some diet-coke?

02:09:10.054 --> 02:09:13.051
 SHRI MATAJI: Not that one.

02:09:16.051 --> 02:09:19.054
That's for Mataji Nirmala Devi, not for Shri Krishna.

02:09:28.051 --> 02:09:32.052
Before you come to America you must learn to take coke, isn't it?

02:09:33.051 --> 02:09:35.063
 [inaudible] is too My brother,

02:09:36.051 --> 02:09:38.064
[inaudible] My brother, become like that, isn't it?

02:09:39.052 --> 02:09:43.063
When Krishna was playing with the boys

02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:47.051
who were looking after the herds of cows

02:09:47.054 --> 02:09:49.052
 and He had to take the butter

02:09:49.055 --> 02:09:52.040
and now when you come to America you have to take coke.

02:09:52.053 --> 02:09:55.054
So better to have diet-coke.

02:09:56.051 --> 02:10:01.055
 And if you go to Italy you have to eat Pizzas.

02:10:06.052 --> 02:10:09.052
 That's all the play.

02:10:14.051 --> 02:10:19.051
 Now, let's have it, is a play.

02:23:30.059 --> 02:23:34.051
 Why the baby is so [inaudible] restless?

02:23:35.054 --> 02:23:38.055
She is crying out.

02:23:39.051 --> 02:23:43.051
Get some vibrated oil rubbed on her head.

02:23:45.051 --> 02:23:46.052
 Good.

02:23:48.053 --> 02:23:52.052
It's good. May God bless you.

02:23:53.051 --> 02:23:56.064
If the children are very restless you must get some vibrated oil

02:23:57.052 --> 02:23:59.064
 rub on the head, rub on the body every night.

02:24:00.052 --> 02:24:03.051
 A child should not be restless. It should be able to sit quiet,

02:24:03.054 --> 02:24:06.051
 otherwise it is not a good sign, especially in the Puja

02:24:06.054 --> 02:24:09.063
 a child has to be quiet, otherwise there is something wrong.

02:24:10.051 --> 02:24:14.054
 Look after your children, watch them.

02:24:19.051 --> 02:24:21.052
 May God bless you.

02:24:23.053 --> 02:24:27.052
What a wonderfull Puja. Thank you very much!

02:25:42.051 --> 02:25:44.059
Thank you very much.

02:25:51.051 --> 02:25:54.054
If you all keep all right, I keep all right.

02:25:59.058 --> 02:26:02.056
 Because you all are in My body.

02:26:27.051 --> 02:26:30.052
It's all right. Now what is the situation?

02:26:36.051 --> 02:26:39.056
YOGI: No, no, Shri Mataji we haven't planned any further.

02:26:40.054 --> 02:26:42.052
SHRI MATAJI: That's why I - if you have noticed

02:26:42.055 --> 02:26:45.051
 today the ritual was up side down,

02:26:45.054 --> 02:26:47.058
 because I wanted to bring forth that,

02:26:48.051 --> 02:26:51.054
that nothing is ...  YOGI: fixed.

02:26:51.057 --> 02:26:55.057
SHRI MATAJI: fixed for you, that is Shri Krishnas style.

02:27:04.054 --> 02:27:08.051
It was quiet nice

02:29:02.055 --> 02:29:06.056
YOGI: It is pretty in that frame. SHRI MATAJI: Hmm, good, good.

02:29:12.051 --> 02:29:15.040
YOGI: We hold it up. SHRI MATAJI: Ah, [inaudible].

02:29:15.053 --> 02:29:18.055
SHRI MATAJI: That's again the stylized one?

02:29:20.052 --> 02:29:22.055
 What is the style called as?

02:29:22.058 --> 02:29:25.058
 YOGI: I don't know on this. ANOTHER YOGI: Natural.

02:29:28.058 --> 02:29:30.058
 Spontaneous.

02:29:34.051 --> 02:29:35.064
 Some of the native art, Shri Mataji.

02:29:36.052 --> 02:29:38.052
 SHRI MATAJI: Oh I see.

02:29:39.051 --> 02:29:42.051
YOGI: See the shining eyes of the seekers.

02:29:42.055 --> 02:29:46.054
Of their Mother, it's the Mother giving them the shining eyes.

02:29:47.055 --> 02:29:50.056
 SHRI MATAJI: Very nice these small little eyes.

02:30:00.056 --> 02:30:03.051
That's an american girl, on Me.

02:32:53.055 --> 02:32:57.054
SHRI MATAJI: This is in the Nepal-version of the Goddess.

02:32:58.051 --> 02:33:01.055
YOGI: Excuse me! SHRI MATAJI: Nepal-version of the Goddess.

02:33:03.053 --> 02:33:04.064
This is the -

02:33:05.052 --> 02:33:07.057
 This One is Mahakali.

02:33:08.057 --> 02:33:13.052
 Is left side, Mahakali.

02:33:16.057 --> 02:33:19.053
 May God bless you.

02:34:09.055 --> 02:34:12.057
 SHRI MATAJI: So? YOGINI: This is for You.

02:34:13.057 --> 02:34:15.057
SHRI MATAJI: What's that?

02:34:16.051 --> 02:34:20.058
 YOGINI: It is a little bit inspired and this is my new name.

02:34:25.052 --> 02:34:29.057
And this is the Lady who gave me a Sari to wear today.

02:34:30.052 --> 02:34:32.057
You know her.

02:34:33.051 --> 02:34:35.058
 She lives in my [inaudible]. SHRI MATAJI: She is gone away now?

02:34:36.051 --> 02:34:37.063
 YOGINI: No. She still lives there.

02:34:38.051 --> 02:34:40.040
 SHRI MATAJI: Ah, very nice. YOGINI: Okay.

02:34:40.053 --> 02:34:43.057
SHRI MATAJI: Very sweet, but this is a nice [inaudible].

02:34:44.051 --> 02:34:45.064
 YOGINI: You like that? SHRI MATAJI: Yes, beautiful,

02:34:46.052 --> 02:34:49.057
[inaudible]and advices. YOGINI: Yes, okay.

02:34:50.051 --> 02:34:53.055
 SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you. That's a nice one: Helen Joy Bliss.

02:34:53.058 --> 02:34:56.051
 YOGINI: Yes, that's what I call myself now.

02:34:56.054 --> 02:34:57.058
 SHRI MATAJI: Beautifull, that you are.

02:34:58.051 --> 02:35:01.051
 YOGINI: Thank You. SHRI MATAJI: Is a fact, is actually your nature.

02:35:01.054 --> 02:35:03.052
 YOGINI: Yes. SHRI MATAJI: Can we keep it for the next day?

02:35:03.055 --> 02:35:05.058
YOGINI: And I want You to enjoy that little gift.

02:35:06.052 --> 02:35:09.054
SHRI MATAJI: All right, I know, I do it definitelly.

02:35:09.063 --> 02:35:12.059
I enjoy it, there is no doubt.

02:35:14.059 --> 02:35:15.061
Very kind of you.

02:35:15.064 --> 02:35:17.058
 YOGINI: Her telephone-number is there in case You want it.

02:35:17.061 --> 02:35:21.056
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I would like to keep that with Me. YOGINI: Okay.

02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:23.057
 SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much.

02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:25.062
Oh very sweet of you! YOGINI: Okay.

02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:27.051
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much.

02:35:27.054 --> 02:35:29.053
YOGINI: Thank You.
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you.

02:36:36.053 --> 02:36:37.051
YOGINI: I am extremely shivering,

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:40.054
 SHRI MATAJI: Ah? YOGINI: I wanted to give you, to you in Italy,

02:36:40.058 --> 02:36:42.063
 but I didn't, I couldn't think, Shri Mataji.

02:36:43.051 --> 02:36:46.051
SHRI MATAJI: Aha, that's beautiful.

02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:49.057
You know in this one also from My face,

02:36:49.060 --> 02:36:52.059
from when I am smiling the vibrations are coming out.

02:36:52.062 --> 02:36:56.064
Can you see that? YOGI: Ah, yes Shri Mataji.

02:37:03.051 --> 02:37:08.051
YOGI: Another copy? ANOTHERYOGI: The whole book.

02:37:09.051 --> 02:37:12.064
SHRI MATAJI: This is a beautiful photograph.

02:37:15.051 --> 02:37:18.057
 I don't know how she got it, on the top of My head.

02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:21.059
YOGINI: Sahasrara-Day-Puja, Shri Mataji.
02:37:23:19 --&gt;02:37:25:19 In Vienna.

02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:30.051
 SHRI MATAJI: That's another one.

02:37:30.059 --> 02:37:33.059
 She has done some very good photographs.

02:37:35.054 --> 02:37:38.061
And this one, can you beat it?

02:37:39.051 --> 02:37:40.061
YOGINI: That's Gregoires, Mother.

02:37:40.064 --> 02:37:44.051
SHRI MATAJI: It's Gregoires, but still look at the red.

02:37:44.057 --> 02:37:46.058
This says automatically it came like that,

02:37:46.061 --> 02:37:49.052
like little [inaudible]

02:37:49.056 --> 02:37:52.062
which was not that red, but again it has come up.

02:37:53.051 --> 02:37:55.058
YOGI: It became red like Kumkum?

02:37:55.061 --> 02:37:59.057
 SHRI MATAJI: Not Kumkum, it's red, shining red.

02:38:06.053 --> 02:38:10.051
This is another one, you see? YOGI: Ah?

02:38:12.051 --> 02:38:14.063
 SHRI MATAJI: This Baby is crying.

02:38:20.051 --> 02:38:23.051
 One better there, see this one.

02:38:32.054 --> 02:38:34.062
It is very beautifull photographs, I might [inaudible].

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.064
This is the one where We went up -

02:38:38.062 --> 02:38:40.059
 YOGI: Matterhorn. SHRI MATAJI: Matterhorn.

02:38:40.062 --> 02:38:42.059
 OGI: The same shape as India up side down.

02:38:42.062 --> 02:38:46.052
 SHRI MATAJI: Yes, but it is actually Ganeshas faces,

02:38:46.055 --> 02:38:49.055
You see there are Ganeshas, one Ganesha is like this,

02:38:49.058 --> 02:38:51.063
another like that, another like that.

02:38:52.051 --> 02:38:55.051
Four Ganeshas put together.

02:38:56.062 --> 02:39:00.061
This one is remarkable. How did you get My hair like that?

02:39:01.051 --> 02:39:03.063
 YOGINI: You just moved it, I don't know, it came out [inaudible].

02:39:04.058 --> 02:39:07.053
 YOGI: Nilachikurya. YOGINI: It's a ...

02:39:07.056 --> 02:39:09.056
SHRI MATAJI: Nilachikurya. YOGINI: Nagas

02:39:10.051 --> 02:39:12.059
SHRI MATAJI: Nagas. YOGINI: Gregoire said Nagas.

02:39:13.057 --> 02:39:15.060
SHRI MATAJI:It's very nice, it is very beautiful,

02:39:15.063 --> 02:39:18.063
she has a talent for that.

02:39:21.051 --> 02:39:24.051
A real talent I must say.

02:39:29.051 --> 02:39:30.055
YOGI: We should publish a book

02:39:30.058 --> 02:39:32.040
 of colour-photographs of You, Shri Mataji.

02:39:32.053 --> 02:39:35.040
 SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. YOGIS: It would be a bestseller, Shri Mataji.

02:39:35.053 --> 02:39:38.062
SHRI MATAJI: This looks like as if I am sitting in the Himalayas

02:39:39.057 --> 02:39:44.058
 and it was not such a wild thing there, nothing, it's in a village.

02:39:46.051 --> 02:39:49.052
 I can't explain it. This is another very good.

02:39:54.060 --> 02:39:57.059
 It's very nice, see that, very well.

02:39:57.062 --> 02:40:01.057
You all can go through it and see for yourself.

02:40:02.055 --> 02:40:04.055
Very beautiful.

02:40:16.058 --> 02:40:19.062
What have you written? YOGINI: This is the translation in Italian,
