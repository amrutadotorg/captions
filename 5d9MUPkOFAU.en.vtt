00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.380
You have to know that you all have been seekers before

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.980
this is not the first time you have been seeking.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.620
So already you have reached a certain state

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
where you feel and you are aware that something more

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.860
has to happen to you, you are already ready for that,

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.100
some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.300
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.260
past is over now, we have to think of the present.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.100
One has to know that all of you, get Realization,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.700
some people have certain problems,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.220
on their different centers as I told you,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.060
different types of problems people have.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.100
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.420
to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.100
She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.300
and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.940
how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.820
how to understand your own problem and give additional help

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.500
to solve the problem.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.100
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.260
false identifications with yourself.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.180
You become absolutely detached from that,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.420
because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.980
You start saying that this center is bad, that center is bad,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.460
this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.660
that is wrong with me, that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.540
you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.940
You just say : “Mother this center is not alright,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.180
that center is not alright.”

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.340
Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.820
as -they are, the ones who really are the channels

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.900
for the energy of God to flow in.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.620
Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.020
Are you clean or not?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.420
Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.300
but may be, one chakra is catching.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.540
On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.900
you might feel also a kind of a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.100
– we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.700
Now wherever there is tingling,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.900
you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.420
between those chakras and the Kundalini.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.460
So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.820
and also must know that every one of you

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.380
are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.740
you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.180
Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.500
But if others, those who are not Realized,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.580
I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.100
There can be any number of devils or anything,

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.540
doesn’t matter to me.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.980
But if you people, who are Realized souls,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.020
have a slight problem immediately I know

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.580
that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.020
So you must understand that the attention is all the time there

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:45.620
to look after you, to give you a better guidance,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.300
your Spirit is all the time working.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.420
But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.860
that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.180
I’ve seen some people who were declared as

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.380
drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.140
[with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.820
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.020
in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.100
but your past is great, that shows.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.300
So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.580
there’s no degree or anything to measure it.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.980
They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.580
first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.100
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.860
and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.140
because he has a very bad Vishuddhi.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.300
And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.660
you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.220
but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.620
And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.580
Gradually your fingers will start improving

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.940
and they will give you better results.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.580
For example, people who do hard work with their hands,

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.660
also their fingers can be numbed,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.780
so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.940
This body now is a temple of God

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.100
so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.380
not for the way the – you see, the prostitutes,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.780
when they want to sell their body they look after their body.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500
No, but respect, with respect to our body.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.140
We have to look after ourselves in a way

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.740
that we should keep good health.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.740
And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.060
there are thousand and one things, which you have to know,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.380
which is very easy to understand,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.260
and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.300
It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.060
that you should settle down, that you should enjoy.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.420
So you don’t have to be so anxious about it.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.620
These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.340
Now many of you who did feel the cool breeze.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.300
But maybe, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.580
You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.500
It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.420
Now supposing you try a method, a simple method,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.540
that you first put your left hand towards my photograph

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.940
– just now you can try –

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.140
and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.500
Right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.260
that’s why I wanted to have it in the open,

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.500
but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers,

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.340
let’s have it.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.940
So now put your left hand like this,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.220
and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.900
Like this. Back. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.780
[Yogi] …the ground. No like this.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.700
Back. Yes, right hand.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.420
Now what we are doing, the left hand side power,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.580
is the emotional power.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.900
Now if you have an emotional problem

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.140
– say, somebody has been taking drugs,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.780
he’s a left sided person.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.100
Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.460
but most of the drugs take you to the left side.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.100
Gurus are left sided part.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.340
Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:21.980
But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided,

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.500
futuristic people is right sided.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.180
People who are running the rat race are right sided,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.900
you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.180
On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.020
So first try with the left, let’s see.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.340
Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.620
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.140
Now, put your left hand towards me.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.260
Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in you left hand.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.300
Is it flowing?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.900
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.820
because the Mother Earth takes away ;

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.980
you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it,

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.100
touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.580
is a very simple thing.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.940
Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.140
it’s true, but the best is to have a light.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.900
Now, say, if you have a candle,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.500
candle is the best, for left sided problems,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.460
candle is the best thing to take it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.020
Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.820
or problems which arise from coldness.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.180
You see, a person who becomes inactive.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.980
Now see.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.620
You just put your left hand towards me like this

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.380
and right hand towards a candle.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.220
You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.940
the candle starts burning “tac”and drop like that

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.660
and sometimes it creates such black smoke that,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.100
if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.980
It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.460
but you must have a photograph in front.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.980
And there should be a candle in front of the photograph

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.300
and one candle like this to take it out.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.020
Right, now, see better?

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.140
Alright?

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.940
You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.260
you see, the pressure is going down.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.100
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.220
not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.500
Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.060
it’s better to put towards me, left hand.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.620
It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.500
It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.340
it’s pushing it down towards the light,

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.020
and the light burns it off : light gets awakened, by you.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.820
It’s surprising but it does.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.060
It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.700
You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.220
You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.140
left hand towards me like this, yes.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.980
You all will feel it yourself.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.180
Now people who have been to gurus,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.780
who have sort of schizophrenic attitude,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.900
who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these,

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.100
to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.900
some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.340
can be controlled by this simple method

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.460
of putting left hand towards the photograph

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.700
and right hand towards a candle.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.020
See, it’s working out?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.620
You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel. [Yogi] Yes.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.020
Feeling it now. No?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.020
[Yogi] So, it’s not there.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.580
Now with the right hand up,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.580
those who are running the rat race,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.020
you see big people who think they must earn money and all,

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.540
they are running in the politics and

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.420
all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see,

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.420
that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.260
So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.540
they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:49.540
Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:55.380
in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.980
One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.100
So supposing you are an overactive person,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.140
then if you are an overactive person,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.620
you are studying very hard

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.100
or thinking about the future or planning something,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.940
then, you have a heart which is overactive.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.300
Or you have an intestine which is overactive.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.140
The liver is overactive, the whole system is overactive,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.940
you’ll have high blood pressure

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.820
and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation,

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.780
all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.060
Then, another personality could be a lethargic.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.260
A person who has a lethargic heart,

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.100
may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that,

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.820
because the heart doesn’t pump.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.700
You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.100
– whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom,

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.620
sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.940
When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.500
Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.580
But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.660
then the same liver which was giving you these allergies,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.580
will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness,

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.140
migraine, and vomiting, emesis.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.900
So there are two types of livers also.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.620
We have two types of kidneys,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.660
two types of, everything is two types.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.900
So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.300
then what you have to do is to use the light.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.540
For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light,

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:35.060
to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.700
And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.180
Mother Earth is the best or water and salt.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.020
So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.060
from an over-activity. Now how do you do it?

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.500
It’s good for both, but specially for them.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.780
Like you have to put both the hands, first towards the photograph

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.340
both the feet in the water, with little salt.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.140
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.100
equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.460
But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.820
The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.060
The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.380
and another one has to go out.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.700
And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.860
you will feel within yourself these balloons will be moving like that.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.260
And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:34.260
you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master,

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.660
you will know how to handle this body,

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.700
absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.300
– people have become masters in eight days, in eight days.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.180
Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.260
and help other people. It’s as simple as that.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.100
So forget about the past, now the present,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.740
we have to be in the present.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.740
Is there any other question now?

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.060
[Yogi] … about mantras…

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.220
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.540
and all these centers have got different deities.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.020
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:20.660
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.540
We have books which will be given to you.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.540
Now, we have to make, you see-

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:31.100
[Yogi] Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart]

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.780
Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.260
this one is very clear cut.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.900
Now on different chakras, we have different deities

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.020
– come forward, you come forward and see, alright?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.740
Alright, just let him see. You can pass it on.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.540
[Yogi] May be there’s another chart.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.900
Another chart, alright.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.180
We have books, you see, why not give them books?

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.620
[Yogi] …They can have the other books

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.740
Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.180
Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.060
and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to –

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.420
Sahaja Yogi :… they can meet here first until we get a hall

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.340
Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.220
You can always come and find out. Now, what is it?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.940
There are books. Now, I’ll show.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.660
These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.660
Now here, this is all given in short.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.740
Now this is the chart you have to follow

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.780
– you can pass it on…

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.740
Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.220
Gentleman : I got it here.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.340
Oh I see. You also take.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:05.780
Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.900
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.140
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.980
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.580
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:25.420
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.820
On this side, if you see it clearly?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.820
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.300
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.620
what are the different deities.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.860
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.660
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.660
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.180
– so have you given that?

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.780
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.100
But they will tell you.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.580
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.580
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.820
- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.100
So you have to say that

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.900
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.540
So just you have to use that particular thing

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.380
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:26.900
And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.980
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.260
But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple,

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.980
it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.500
First of all, you must become sensitive.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.420
So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.900
for your fingers and for your toes, you see,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.220
rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.380
Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:00.100
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.580
And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.540
they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.540
And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut,

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.180
sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.420
So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.140
with your nails. But for yourself also,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.260
you should not have very –right hand specially –

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.140
because you’ll have to use it like this here,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.900
say, you have a Vishudhi chakra,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.580
then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.020
So what, actually, is the matter with you,

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.300
is to be first heard. So first you have to understand yourself,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.220
what is your problem, what you are suffering from,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.300
and then, how to correct.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.180
If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:53.580
then it is the easiest thing, is to coil a mantra to improve yourself.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.660
Alright? It’s very simple.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.940
Now you have met me only a day back, I should say,

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.900
but you’ll be amazed the knowledge

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.980
that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.380
So first is SelfRealization, means you know yourself.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.340
Once you know yourself, you start knowing others,

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.940
because we are all collectively conscious.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.460
Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.660
So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.380
you have to put yourself into bandhan like this,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.140
as I told you, like this.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.820
Now, let’s do it.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.740
Put your left hand towards me.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.660
[Yogi] Like this towards Shri Mataji…

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.100
Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check,

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.420
see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:06.700
Now this is left Nabbhi. Now which one is burning, be careful.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.540
Pay attention.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.420
Which one?

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.140
[Newcomer] [Inaudible]….

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.260
Which one?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.420
May be he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation?

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:43.380
Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver, you see and also constipated.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.620
So he is more a right sided person,

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.380
because right side is this thing.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.700
So he has to put left to the right, like this. Alright?

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.900
[Newcomer] I’m just warm [?] and [?]..what could that mean?

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.380
You have a heart [problem]

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.860
[Newcomer] It’s allergy [?]

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.580
You put your right hand on your heart.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.580
New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible]…. Rather warm.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.420
Warm? Alright, doesn’t matter, and the other one?

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:15.180
Nothing. Alright. So put your left to the right. Left to the right.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.460
[Yogi] You take it- when She says left to the right,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.180
what you’re doing is not just this one,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.300
put you are actually lifting the left side

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.820
And taking the grace from the right.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.620
[Yogi] … because you’re balancing

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.340
And taking the grace, you see, on the right side,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.620
because right side is showing nothing.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.300
If the right side is showing nothing,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.500
then what you are doing, you are lifting your left

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.020
which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down,

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.260
with your right hand. Left to the right.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.380
[Yogi] If you got problems on the right side,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.940
you take from the left side, and over the top

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.740
and bring down the grace into the right side….

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.300
Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.340
If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.900
then you have right hand problem.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.420
You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum?

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.300
And left hand, you are feeling what?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.460
[Yogi] Slightly warm on the left side….

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.260
So she has to go from right to left.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.380
Just do it yourself now, get into balance

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.180
that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.820
[Yogini] Can we change hands?

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.460
Yes you can, you change hands.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.860
[Yogi] Just to repeat it again, if you have abnormal sensations,

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.500
heat or something in your right hand, that means there is a damage

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.700
on that side, so you lift the left side

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.460
and you bring down the grace inti the right side.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.500
Just do that if you got that problem.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.060
Right to the left.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.700
You take your right hand and put it like that.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.180
[Yogi] If you got it in the other direction, you change hand as She said,

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.780
and you go the other way. It’s as simple as that.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.980
Until it balances, until it works ou t. Keep doing until it works out.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.580
Did you come to my program before?

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.200
No

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.300
That’s why. Just it has started, you see,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.700
you have to get your Realization first of all, alright?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.340
You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.860
as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.700
Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out,

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.380
then only you can feel it properly. That’s why.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:44.140
Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Are you feeling ?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.660
Good. Left hand what are you feeling?

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.940
Cool breeze, in the left hand and not on the right. Alright.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.260
So what you do is to take left to the right

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.740
No, with the right hand.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.340
[New Yogini] Oh, yes.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:07.660
Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good?

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.460
Good! He’s alright.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.420
Are you alright? How are you feeling?

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.860
[Yogi] She’s asking you get heat on the left side or the left hand?

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.820
You can get it on left hand or left side, anywhere. Where are you getting?

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.180
Yes, you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right?

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.980
Then you put your left to the right.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.740
No, no, no, left hand towards Me, and right hand like this,

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.460
Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don’t go back.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.020
Both the hands cool?

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.020
Look at Me. Left hand to Me, like this

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.740
and right hand you pick it up, come here and push it down.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.340
She’s alright. You're alright.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.300
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands?

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.900
The balance, yes. You start feeling the balance. That’s the best way.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.580
You have a Vishuddhi that way. Doesn’t matter.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:20.020
You put your left hand at the back of your chakra, here.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:26.420
And put your right hand towards Me. Right hand.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.860
What about you? Are you feeling?

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.740
Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:39.020
You come from which state? UP!

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.420
[Hindi conversation]

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.420
New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..?

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.580
Split of a second.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.740
New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself?

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.140
[Yogi] How long will the balancing last you?

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.540
Last? I mean there is no timing for it.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.500
It can last you for ever, but if you are a very wobbly type,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.180
it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see?

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:51.620
Now, we can say we are driving a car.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.500
Now, how long will it last there?

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.860
As long as you keep it.

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:59.260
You are driving this car, alright?

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.860
Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.900
[New Yogini] I? Yes.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.140
Good, then it’s good.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.660
[Yogi] When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it.

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.140
[New Yogini] So, just trough the day, you just have to

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.700
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:17.580
there is nothing wrong, it’s alright, perfectly alright.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.940
[Yogi] Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing?

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.060
Have you got your Realization?

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.500
That is the first, that’s the first thing.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.060
Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it?

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.940
First thing is to have your Realization and then, now,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.380
put your hands towards me.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.660
[Yogi] Everybody should do that because

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.700
the more you put your hands to Mother,

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.580
the stronger the vibrations will flow.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.100
Take this chance because it has to develop.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.900
It might be a little uncomfortable, but just keep your hands to Mother.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.020
You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling?

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.780
Start, close your eyes.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.020
What about you? No.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.940
[Yogi] Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.260
You come forward. I think best is

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.500
- and the rest of the people and Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.460
Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization,

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.300
you are alright, three of you, go ahead. [People move]

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.420
And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:54.340
Sit down, sit down.

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.580
Just like this. Put your hand.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:46.060
Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:52.420
Just press them, press your eyes hard, very hard- thrice.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.300
Hard, press them hard, thrice.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.060
Alright?

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:08.140
Not yet? It will come. It will work out.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.500
Watch me, watch me here.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:23.100
[Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face,

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:27.660
then in front of her right hand

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.380
and the new people are sent to another room

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.580
where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.100
Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.380
Alright, just for a minute

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.460
Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.780
Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say:

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.980
Mother I am not guilty. Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.980
There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.620
Whatever you have done is finished now.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:21.420
You are entering into new awareness now. Into the kingdom of God.

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.420
Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.060
Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.380
Just forget them. Just start to be yourself.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.460
They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.340
Those who have got liver problem should take sugar

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.540
and they’ll tell you what is to be done.

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:54.740
If you have diabetes you can take salt.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.700
And for other people who have arthritis and all that also,

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.020
I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on,

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.780
if not you can come back again and take it from these.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.500
Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.100
May God bless you!
