WEBVTT

03:04.446 --> 03:11.646
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

03:27.776 --> 03:34.616
Shri Ganesha resides in Mooladhara,

03:34.816 --> 03:41.066
on the chakra, Mooladhara chakra.

03:43.118 --> 03:55.475
and not on mooladhar.
In the mooladhar is placed the Kundalini.

03:55.476 --> 04:08.666
She is the mother of Shri Ganesh, we call
her Gauri. Yesterday you saw the picture,

04:08.666 --> 04:29.885
the drama, how Shri Ganesha got his head of
an elephant. All these things have happened

04:29.885 --> 04:55.925
in another world. There
are many worlds of which we know of this world,

04:55.925 --> 05:12.926
is a question of our awareness. Now we are
at a human awareness, and we have risen to

05:12.926 --> 05:29.975
a higher awareness which is called as the
fourth dimension. Without Shri Ganesha it

05:29.975 --> 05:45.736
is not possible. As you know he is the symbol
of innocence within us. This innocence never

05:45.736 --> 06:01.776
gets destroyed because it is eternal. But
it may happen that it will get covered with

06:01.776 --> 06:19.374
some clouds by our mistakes that we commit.
But once you get your realization, your innocence

06:19.375 --> 06:38.717
is re-established, it manifests. And you become
innocent, your attention becomes innocent.

06:38.718 --> 06:51.232
It is impossible to follow your religion,
either Christ or Mohammed-Sahib or Jews, if

06:51.233 --> 07:09.031
you do not have enlightenment.This is one
thing they did not realize, because they were

07:09.032 --> 07:24.556
of a very high level people. They did not
know what is the condition of human beings.

07:27.406 --> 07:34.922
As in the Bible is written that if your right
eye commits sins – means goes against Shri

07:34.923 --> 07:40.039
Ganesha- you take it away.

07:45.707 --> 07:54.906
Or if your righthand does anything wrong against Shri Ganesha,
then cut it out.

07:59.172 --> 08:05.339
Just imagine, if Christians
were really practising Christianity, they

08:05.340 --> 08:10.156
all would have been without hands, without
eyes.

08:14.722 --> 08:18.322
Because it is said that if you make

08:18.323 --> 08:25.239
any mistakes you better cut out, yourself.

08:25.439 --> 08:30.322
Christ said that you should do it, and also

08:30.323 --> 08:34.772
for men he was very strict, not for women
so much.

08:40.056 --> 08:43.822
So Mohammed-Saheb thought , that

08:43.823 --> 08:48.289
why not say about women also?

08:48.489 --> 08:52.256
Why not restrictthem, why only men?

08:56.222 --> 09:02.572
So he made strict rules for women also.

09:04.806 --> 09:11.556
In this case he said that you should hurt the woman or hit the woman

09:11.557 --> 09:16.521
or should try to restrict the woman, that
is on the husband.

09:24.507 --> 09:27.539
But to do so, the husband

09:27.646 --> 09:34.978
himself has to be an innocent person. what

09:37.408 --> 09:43.219
If he himself committed such mistakes, then

09:43.256 --> 09:50.339
What right he has got to become strict with his wife or with his sister?

10:00.591 --> 10:03.339
And the worst thing was, were the Jews,

10:03.357 --> 10:09.199
when Moses brought the Ten Commandments, he found that the Jews were

10:09.214 --> 10:13.189
having a decadent society as they have now.

10:27.549 --> 10:32.289
Nowadays we have this decadent society in America, in.. everywhere.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.721
There are no morals,

10:43.291 --> 10:45.321
and nobody talks of morality.

10:49.345 --> 10:56.538
I feel that Sahaj is the only way where human beings can become innocent.

11:02.668 --> 11:07.832
Because Jews were given what you call the Sheriat (sp?). Where it was , if

11:07.818 --> 11:15.977
you are a thief , cut your hands, cut your
nose, cut this portion, cut that portion…it is very seriuos.

11:31.459 --> 11:38.379
I saw that it is impossible to follow them because they are too pure,

11:38.376 --> 11:39.632
too important.

11:46.906 --> 11:53.261
If you are Christians, you can’t have two
eyes, you can’t have your hands.

11:57.041 --> 12:04.341
And if you are Muslims, your wives and your daughters and your sisters are always in danger.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.420
And if you are a Jew then all kinds of punishments are written for them.

12:23.996 --> 12:25.639
On the contrary , only

12:25.623 --> 12:30.489
the saints have been punished.

12:31.563 --> 12:34.063
All the good people are punished.

12:35.311 --> 12:40.977
Because there are so many people who are extremely aggressive and sinful.

12:47.607 --> 12:51.483
And they also do not know that there is wrong with them,

12:51.474 --> 12:56.233
something very much against the dharma, against the religion.

13:03.871 --> 13:08.091
With Sahaj only , you get the light of the Spirit.

13:11.888 --> 13:14.388
Shri Ganesha is the Spirit within us.

13:17.932 --> 13:24.122
And he incarnated on this earth as our lord Jesus Christ.

13:29.962 --> 13:35.116
But all kinds of things have been done against such great people.

13:41.402 --> 13:44.958
And they made separate religions.

13:47.068 --> 13:51.668
None of these books have separated themselves from each other.

13:57.398 --> 14:06.648
For example, Mohammed-Saheb has described about Moses, Abraham, Christ, Mother of Christ.

14:14.655 --> 14:21.154
So he never established another religion,

14:21.480 --> 14:25.330
he was talking about all the religions

14:26.230 --> 14:29.720
woven together in one.

14:32.001 --> 14:45.895
But we have now people who do not believe that all the religions are born out of one tree of spirituality.

14:52.303 --> 14:55.853
They are not only fighting with others, but
among themselves.

15:02.763 --> 15:08.133
In the name of God they are killing so many people.

15:10.842 --> 15:14.572
Innocence is the source of love.

15:20.153 --> 15:28.554
Like small children , when you see them sweetly dancing, you feel such tremendous love for them.

15:36.624 --> 15:42.232
When you see a little baby, very sweet baby smilingat you,

15:42.232 --> 15:45.142
you feel tremendous love for that child.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.406
If you do not respect your innocence,

15:56.406 --> 15:58.915
you can never be a loving person.

16:06.325 --> 16:09.556
And without love you cannot know truth.

16:17.926 --> 16:23.508
Only thing is that we feel rather sometimes awkward,

16:23.511 --> 16:28.225
sometimes frightened, to love the innocent people.

16:40.199 --> 16:45.435
The innocent are most harmless people.

16:50.122 --> 16:55.165
I do not like parents to beat their children at all.

17:00.127 --> 17:08.377
They are in innocence do something, so you must be really kind to them, and understand them.

17:17.145 --> 17:24.461
Nowadays, in Russia also, there are
many children who are born realized.

17:30.702 --> 17:39.144
Because you all are now enlightened, and there are so many great saints who want to be born.

17:46.686 --> 17:51.037
But you have to be innocent yourself.

17:53.455 --> 17:59.527
The countries where the children are not respected, children don’t want to be born there.

18:05.877 --> 18:11.059
There is a minus growth in those countries.

18:13.527 --> 18:19.027
But in a country like India, where there is so much love for children,

18:19.037 --> 18:23.267
they want to take birth in India though there is poverty.

18:31.838 --> 18:37.638
Children don’t understand money and material things.

18:39.598 --> 18:42.463
They understand love.

18:43.595 --> 18:50.623
If you don’t have love in your heart, Shri Ganesha cannot shine within you.

18:56.669 --> 19:05.509
Now the difference between a mother and a mother who is very angry with her children is this:

19:16.336 --> 19:25.332
The mother who loves her child, enjoys everything she has to do for her child,

19:30.458 --> 19:37.649
while the mother who doesn’t love the child feels that she is doing too much, she can’t do it, it’s too much.

19:47.649 --> 19:52.357
If you ask her what’s the matter, she will say I have to wash this, I have

19:52.362 --> 19:58.311
to clean this, I have to look after this child,
all kinds of stories.

20:05.616 --> 20:12.704
But a mother who is enlightened will love doing all that, and enjoy it.

20:18.694 --> 20:21.971
She will have respect for her children,

20:23.011 --> 20:25.854
and she will make them respectable.

20:27.651 --> 20:34.078
There is no need to be harsh with your children.

20:37.451 --> 20:43.750
Children are very sensitive and intelligent.

20:45.538 --> 20:51.808
Maybe among thousands you might find one child who is not so good.

20:59.211 --> 21:04.343
But later on , they pick
up things from elders, especially from parents,

21:04.344 --> 21:08.093
and from the atmosphere, and they start becoming
troublesome.

21:24.869 --> 21:34.409
That doesn’t mean that you should not control  and restrict your children, and train them.

21:39.189 --> 21:46.401
Best way is to be yourself innocent and dharmic.

21:50.571 --> 21:53.922
Ganesha is the basis of morality.

21:58.362 --> 22:09.208
Moral behavior, when it is lost in a society, that society becomes destroyed.

22:12.862 --> 22:22.392
Whatever maybe the economic advantages they have, or they have financial advantages, or political advantages,

22:23.492 --> 22:27.398
but, they get destroyed from within.

22:36.199 --> 22:42.321
For example, take the case of America, which is supposed to be an affluent country.

22:49.349 --> 22:54.896
Which is doubtful  to me that they are affluent, because they are indebted.

23:01.369 --> 23:05.418
But what is happening there?

23:06.193 --> 23:10.697
Small children of twelve years are killing and selling drugs.

23:17.059 --> 23:19.534
In some other countries in the west,

23:21.604 --> 23:24.837
so many children are killed by the parents.

23:31.484 --> 23:39.719
Every country which is affluent has some sort of a specialty of immorality.

23:47.039 --> 23:52.855
They are absolutely violent people, arrogant and egoistical.

23:57.669 --> 24:05.259
Innocence, first of all, absolutely dissolves the ego.

24:11.069 --> 24:15.656
And when you talk to children they make such sweet comments,

24:15.702 --> 24:21.356
such intelligent comments, that you are amazed how they are saying all these things.

24:29.889 --> 24:34.809
They are extremely affectionate, and extremely kind.

24:41.109 --> 24:52.989
I’ll tell you a story of some friends went to see the grave of president of America, Kennedy.

25:00.883 --> 25:06.993
So the child was looking at it, you
see, and everybody was very solemn.

25:14.046 --> 25:18.540
Then the child turned to his father and mother and said

25:18.814 --> 25:27.891
“Mommy, why should you put this president under the earth, all the worms will eat him up..

25:37.899 --> 25:40.464
Why this punishment?”

25:41.827 --> 25:45.900
There are so many things which you can

25:45.900 --> 25:53.470
see from these children when they talk, how they describe about other people.

25:59.734 --> 26:08.538
One day we had gone to the airport,
and one child was doing like that, like that.

26:12.768 --> 26:17.934
So I said, “What are you doing?”

26:18.285 --> 26:23.597
He said, “I am trying to tie up these people, they are all off their heads.”

26:26.195 --> 26:30.994
Like yesterday’s swadisthana chakra, they were.

26:33.105 --> 26:38.021
So children see also the game, and the whole drama is absurd.

26:45.782 --> 26:52.165
They are very innocent and so its the easiest thing to give them good manners.

26:57.702 --> 27:01.745
In the case of Shri Ganesha, you have heard about the story

27:01.775 --> 27:09.625
that they had given – the parents, the father specially-

27:09.685 --> 27:16.517
said that the one who will go around the mother earth, I’ll
give him some present.

27:26.188 --> 27:30.717
And Shri Ganesha thought that look at this Kartikkeya,

27:30.717 --> 27:38.747
he can go faster because he’s going on this peacock, which is a bird, which can fly,

27:39.001 --> 27:47.083
what about me? I’m just going on a little rat.

27:55.210 --> 28:01.295
But as he is the source of all wisdom , in his wise wisdom he thought,

28:01.311 --> 28:05.395
“My Mother is greater than this Mother earth . ”

28:14.170 --> 28:19.702
So he went three times around his Mother, and he got the present.

28:24.973 --> 28:30.922
A person who is innocent is extremely humble.

28:31.182 --> 28:34.952
He doesn’t try to show off .

28:35.683 --> 28:38.183
He doesn’t know how to show off.

28:39.812 --> 28:46.844
For example, Shri Ganesha has a little rat as his conveyance.

28:52.003 --> 29:00.196
But if you see people who are show offs, they try to buy cars beyond their means,

29:00.251 --> 29:05.507
with big loans, just to show off that they are rich.

29:15.701 --> 29:21.791
This is a disease of people who are not innocent.

29:22.841 --> 29:27.954
And people take advantage of this very much in the world.

29:30.354 --> 29:35.055
Like in the west, you see, they have designers.

29:38.988 --> 29:42.214
And they put their stamp as designers.

29:44.151 --> 29:46.884
And one has to pay a lot for that.

29:49.978 --> 29:54.373
So if it is on the coat written the designer’s name,

29:54.391 --> 29:59.063
they always try to show like that, while going on the road.

30:04.493 --> 30:09.916
But nowadays, they are putting the sign here, of the designer.

30:15.346 --> 30:21.328
Is a very much in the west, not so much in Russia, but it will come.

30:27.229 --> 30:30.509
And the enrepreneurs take full advantage of it.

30:35.356 --> 30:42.578
That way I must say Indians are very very
wise. Not all, but most of them.

30:49.153 --> 30:55.939
And because they believe in Shri Ganesha, they would not
waste their money for showing off.

31:01.526 --> 31:08.058
So thus the entrepreneurs take full advantage of the
people who try to show off.

31:15.378 --> 31:20.538
Innocent person is not bothered about his
own body.

31:23.188 --> 31:32.689
About any fashions or about any additions to his body,

31:32.708 --> 31:38.797
like people wear things
just to show off.

31:48.578 --> 31:54.222
I’m just telling you because all this nonsense is coming to your country.

32:02.928 --> 32:08.726
I hope you people will understand that

32:08.755 --> 32:16.746
the greatest quality of beauty of personality
is innocence.

32:24.586 --> 32:31.816
When the innocence is lost, people play into the hands of these designers

32:31.933 --> 32:34.433
who make funny clothes.

32:44.166 --> 32:51.098
They make clothes for women which expose their bodies.

32:53.979 --> 32:59.511
And the more it exposes, the more it is expensive.

33:04.669 --> 33:12.351
And despite all the cold, they try to wear
clothes which are very scanty.

33:17.192 --> 33:19.962
And you can’t even look at them.

33:21.935 --> 33:25.052
But they think no end of themselves.

33:27.726 --> 33:36.214
And all our films in the west are so horrible now that you just don’t want to see.

33:42.202 --> 33:48.366
If they make some films out of children which are innocent,

33:48.359 --> 33:52.808
I tell you they can earn a lot of money.

34:07.286 --> 34:11.646
The foundation of dharma is Shri Ganesh.

34:15.593 --> 34:20.946
If you see children, they don’t know how to
tell lies, very difficult.

34:24.906 --> 34:31.122
And they say things
sometimes which might be embarassing.

34:33.663 --> 34:39.375
Like one mother was saying in the presence of the
child to her husband

34:39.507 --> 34:46.681
that the man who is coming in the evening, he eats like a hog.

35:01.243 --> 35:05.527
So this boy heard it and when that gentleman came

35:05.523 --> 35:09.017
and started eating , he was looking at him.

35:15.417 --> 35:19.156
And then he says, “Mother, he doesn’t eat like a hog,

35:22.676 --> 35:25.410
why did you say that he eats
like a hog?

35:28.580 --> 35:31.080
You should not tell lies.”

35:32.176 --> 35:35.675
And the mother was so embarassed.

35:36.335 --> 35:42.775
So they minimize
also, innocent person by his innocence minimizes

35:42.763 --> 35:46.812
the judgement of others and criticism of others.

35:52.537 --> 35:57.150
Because they don’t see things which normally

35:57.150 --> 36:01.078
a person who is immoral can see.

36:05.634 --> 36:10.368
Or who is not innocent can see.

36:11.204 --> 36:17.811
I remember my own granddaughter once she saw a lady in a swimming dress.

36:23.914 --> 36:29.696
It was a picture. So she said “Hey, you go
and dress up properly,

36:30.047 --> 36:34.379
otherwise my grandma will be angry with you.

36:40.337 --> 36:47.196
So when you see all these small little children
talking, the way they behave, the way they

36:47.280 --> 36:56.149
are innocent, you really enjoy because innocence
is the source of love.

37:05.227 --> 37:09.493
And it is the source of joy.

37:10.273 --> 37:16.813
Because if you do not have love , you
cannot enjoy anything.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.907
And you start criticising

37:23.750 --> 37:25.460
and judging

37:25.937 --> 37:30.303
and wasting your energy on nonsensical
things.

37:34.050 --> 37:37.815
Like the other day I was listening to some good music,

37:37.875 --> 37:44.645
and the gentleman was singing with his
hands, a little bit more of action.

37:55.045 --> 37:59.007
But he had closed his eyes and
music was wonderful.

38:02.237 --> 38:05.397
I really got lost into it.

38:08.185 --> 38:13.884
But there were some ladies who said what
clothes he was wearing, how he was putting

38:13.908 --> 38:20.440
his hands, all these superficial things they
were saying, not the essence.

38:26.951 --> 38:30.675
But innocence takes to the essence.

38:34.196 --> 38:36.696
And the essence is love.

38:39.847 --> 38:43.655
Thus we have to understand that the quality of Ganesha

38:43.693 --> 38:47.346
we must all imbibe within ourselves.

38:53.897 --> 39:02.047
His quality of innocence which is already
there within us has to be manifested.

39:08.217 --> 39:16.902
Like I was with one Sahaja yogi in his house, and we had a meeting there of about 25 people.

39:22.788 --> 39:28.811
And the meeting was over, I thought that he had said that I’ll have my dinner there.

39:29.185 --> 39:33.371
So I just waited for all of them to go away.

39:40.435 --> 39:45.130
This gentleman was in the kitchen when they
all went away.

39:47.262 --> 39:52.623
He came back and he said, “Mother what have you done? Why have they gone?

39:52.643 --> 39:55.333
I have cooked for all of them.”

40:01.315 --> 40:04.246
And tears came into his eyes.

40:05.766 --> 40:13.648
I was so much overwhelmed by
his generosity, by his kindness.

40:19.419 --> 40:27.809
And when the generosity is done innocently, you are
not even aware of what you are doing.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.681
You just enjoy your generosity,

40:40.521 --> 40:45.381
and you don’t bother as to see what is the reaction of another person is.

40:51.660 --> 40:58.781
We have in our shastras description of such
people.

41:02.381 --> 41:08.303
Like Shri Rama, he went into the forest

41:08.291 --> 41:22.003
and there was a very old lady of, what you
call, a tribal area. Very old, only she had

41:21.971 --> 41:24.355
two teeth left.

41:35.457 --> 41:38.249
Her name was Shabari.

41:39.419 --> 41:51.935
And she came before Shri Ram and offered him some
plums, you can say, pears.

41:59.299 --> 42:05.385
And she very innocently
told him, “See, all these I have tested with my teeth

42:05.416 --> 42:10.405
and those who are sour I have
thrown away because you don’t like sour ones.

42:10.433 --> 42:12.065
But they are all sweet.”

42:26.166 --> 42:29.866
Normally in India people don’t eat anything which

42:29.895 --> 42:35.261
has been touched by another mouth.

42:39.913 --> 42:43.263
So Shri Ram says “Oh , I see, you have done this

42:43.313 --> 42:46.923
work, so please may I have all these?”

42:53.499 --> 42:56.909
But his brother Lakshmana was angry, what is this

42:56.919 --> 43:01.419
lady she has no manners?

43:04.156 --> 43:11.524
So when she started putting this pear into the mouth of Shri Rama , he was getting even worse.

43:18.332 --> 43:24.845
So she said “See how carefully I have done this testing and

43:24.865 --> 43:30.445
you are enjoying , otherwise you would not
have enjoyed them.”

43:37.697 --> 43:42.429
And here Lakshmana was getting angry, very angry.

43:45.836 --> 43:53.176
So Shri Rama says, “Oh, what wonderful fruits, I have never eaten such fruits in my lifetime.”

43:59.666 --> 44:03.906
So his wife Sita she said “Why don’t you give me some?”

44:08.346 --> 44:12.336
He said “No, no these are for me, I can’t give you.”

44:15.656 --> 44:23.771
So Sitaji said that “After all, I am your wife, and you have to share everything with me.”

44:28.583 --> 44:34.866
So he said, “All right, as a matter of right, I am giving you.”

44:36.729 --> 44:41.278
So he gave those pears, those fruits to her.

44:44.362 --> 44:51.728
So Sita said, “What? This is just like ambrosia, such beautiful fruits I have never
eaten!”

44:57.532 --> 44:59.862
So she tells her brother in law,

44:59.919 --> 45:05.351
“See, what fruits, these are heavenly fruits!”

45:08.660 --> 45:11.160
So he got tempted.

45:12.130 --> 45:17.133
So Lakshmana said, “Give me some to taste also.”

45:17.952 --> 45:23.945
So Sitaji said “No no no, I am not going to share, after all,

45:23.939 --> 45:31.738
I have got it with great difficulty from your
brother, I am not going to share.”

45:35.859 --> 45:40.558
So Shri Rama said, “all right, give him some.”

45:42.335 --> 45:47.535
So this innocent old lady says, “No, I have some more, I can give him.

45:52.885 --> 45:59.017
You can have your
share, I have some more, I can give him.”

46:02.088 --> 46:04.812
And she gave it to Lakshmana.

46:05.912 --> 46:10.051
He started eating and he really enjoyed, so much he enjoyed,

46:10.074 --> 46:14.606
he said “My god, I have never eaten such
beautiful fruits.”

46:23.477 --> 46:31.120
Even Shri Krishna, whenever he used to go to the capital of Hastinapur,

46:31.567 --> 46:37.970
he would not live with the kings there, with Duryodana,

46:38.320 --> 46:43.330
but with Vidura, who was the son of a maidservant.

47:01.461 --> 47:04.937
Because Vidura was an enlightened man

47:06.461 --> 47:11.993
and he used to respect Vidura much more
than anybody else.

47:23.044 --> 47:33.639
But sometimes a mistake we commit that we
get too much attached to innocent children.

47:38.709 --> 47:42.295
Give them too much importance.

47:43.367 --> 47:45.867
Innocence is like a river flowing,

47:49.099 --> 47:54.459
but if you try to stagnate it then the children get spoiled.

47:58.919 --> 48:03.969
They must be respected, but one should not try to make

48:03.962 --> 48:09.494
them look like something very exceptional.

48:12.591 --> 48:14.661
They are all just the same,

48:16.005 --> 48:23.537
they have certain various facets, but I have seen, children are just the same.

48:28.411 --> 48:31.461
Firstly, they never get bored.

48:35.021 --> 48:38.164
If you are innocent you will never
be bored,

48:39.434 --> 48:42.512
you see beauty all the time,

48:44.824 --> 48:48.290
and even if you are alone you enjoy yourself.

48:50.440 --> 48:54.540
It is only the grownups get bored.

48:57.504 --> 49:06.017
Now supposing you are in the airport and its late, and the
plane is late. All the others, all the older

49:06.057 --> 49:09.989
people will be very upset.

49:17.657 --> 49:23.158
But children will start playing with something that is in the airport – anything,

49:23.558 --> 49:29.374
a railing is there, or a steps are there, they will go up and down, enjoy themselves.

49:36.570 --> 49:43.260
They don’t want to make a sort of a life miserable by just

49:43.380 --> 49:47.262
bringing everything to some meticulous definition.

49:57.133 --> 50:00.393
I have seen in the airport many a times people

50:00.473 --> 50:04.839
just feeling very bored and terrible and while
the children are running up and down and playing

50:04.863 --> 50:08.707
and enjoying and making friends with other
children whom they have never met.

50:19.074 --> 50:25.163
Only by innocence you can transcend your limited ideas.

50:32.307 --> 50:43.047
I have seen parents who are extremely racist. Their children take to other people in no time.

50:55.022 --> 51:03.168
An innocent person is like that. He
just can carry on with any type of person

51:03.188 --> 51:08.363
without even thinking what sort of a color
he has, what sort of face he has,

51:08.483 --> 51:12.243
or what sort of hair he has done.

51:22.879 --> 51:27.095
These things do not matter.

51:28.214 --> 51:30.414
These are superficial.

51:31.346 --> 51:35.857
But children do not bother about superficial things.

51:37.267 --> 51:42.077
They just want to see the heart of the person.

51:45.246 --> 51:52.612
If the person is loving, whatever may be the
race, religion, anything, children will jump.

52:01.157 --> 52:07.156
I’ve already told you that innocence dissolves the ego.

52:10.877 --> 52:14.587
Innocent person cannot be aggressive.

52:15.347 --> 52:20.137
And if the aggression is there that is also very loving aggression.

52:25.374 --> 52:33.888
Like a child would come and say that ” Why
don’t you give my clothes to this boy?”

52:40.868 --> 52:47.417
And if you say, “Oh God, I paid so much
money and you want to give it to this boy?”

52:52.841 --> 52:59.823
So he’ll say “Alright, next time again you buy for me, but let me give this to this boy” innocently.

53:06.649 --> 53:11.289
Innocent children do not have sense of possession.

53:15.339 --> 53:20.072
Also they do not hesitate to share their things if they are innocent.

53:28.339 --> 53:32.385
But if they are brought up in a way that they show that

53:32.396 --> 53:36.415
“This is yours and this should be kept as yours” all the time

53:36.416 --> 53:44.232
put into his head that this is yours, then they start becoming possessive of their things.

53:55.486 --> 53:58.958
The best thing to enjoy is to live with children.

54:09.278 --> 54:11.314
And to be like them.

54:13.384 --> 54:15.884
And to enjoy them.

54:16.884 --> 54:21.602
This is how our innocence gets nourishment.

54:25.192 --> 54:30.957
In Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people become really very innocent.

54:33.891 --> 54:40.336
Shri Ganesha who is on the backside of your head also, who is MahaGanesha

54:40.371 --> 54:44.006
here, starts acting on the eyes.

54:55.779 --> 54:59.868
The lust and greed from the eyes just drop out,

55:04.371 --> 55:08.626
because you become innocent in your attention.

55:10.958 --> 55:15.323
So you don’t have to take out your eyes as Christ has said.

55:20.070 --> 55:22.603
Nor you have to cut your hands.

55:25.093 --> 55:27.593
Because you really become moral.

55:30.175 --> 55:34.791
I don’t know how many of you know that all
of you have become saints.

55:39.642 --> 55:43.424
As Ganesha was created, you are also created as innocent saints.

55:53.692 --> 55:57.722
Try to respect your innocence.

56:00.642 --> 56:05.442
That will make you feel young and happy.

56:10.782 --> 56:17.680
Is a , in India, in Maharastra, we have eight swayambu Ganeshas.

56:26.036 --> 56:30.898
And I have seen the people of Maharastra are quite innocent.

56:35.263 --> 56:40.930
Somehow, its a very ancient country, and in that area specially

56:40.930 --> 56:46.730
Shri Ganesha is worshipped, so people have become very innocent.

56:54.113 --> 57:03.352
They have a Ganesha being established during certain time, now is the time, for ten days.

57:11.522 --> 57:19.389
Made out of clay and later on is put in the water, sea or river.

57:29.638 --> 57:35.104
But as this Coca cola culture has also come to India,

57:38.724 --> 57:46.374
in the presence of Shri Ganesha they were singing horrible
vulgar song and drinking in his presence.

57:53.420 --> 57:58.000
These were all public Ganeshas, you see.

57:59.300 --> 58:02.758
So I warned them in two lectures, that don’t do this,

58:02.808 --> 58:07.368
because if Shri Ganesha gets angry, you will get earthquakes.

58:15.198 --> 58:17.616
They would not believe me.

58:24.376 --> 58:30.954
So third year these people in a village, quite

58:30.964 --> 58:39.544
a big place, went to the Ganesha resurgion,
means where they put it Ganesha

58:39.554 --> 58:43.966
in the water, and they came back.

58:53.617 --> 58:57.437
And they were all drunk and they were dancing

59:00.441 --> 59:02.181
in the night.

59:03.608 --> 59:08.432
And suddenly this great earthquake
came in,

59:11.982 --> 59:15.290
and all of them were buried.

59:18.370 --> 59:21.413
Except for Sahaja Yogis,

59:22.721 --> 59:32.491
and the Sahaja Yoga Center which was there was not at all hit by the earthquake.

59:39.021 --> 59:47.270
And there was a big gap round
the Center,

59:50.777 --> 59:56.172
so the people ran toward the Center that they can be saved.

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:04.223
But they all fell in that big gap and died.

01:00:09.053 --> 01:00:14.039
So on the other side, the innocence is very
powerful.

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:24.703
Anybody who tries to molest or to

01:00:24.703 --> 01:00:31.102
try to destroy somebody’s innocence is ultimately very badly punished by Shri Ganesha.

01:00:43.124 --> 01:00:53.572
Those people who do not worship Ganesha in their heart can become right- sided or can become left-sided.

01:01:01.462 --> 01:01:05.522
If they become right-sided they get all kinds of diseases,

01:01:11.362 --> 01:01:13.572
which are more physical.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:23.763
And if they become left sided then they get diseases which are psycho-somatic.

01:01:27.969 --> 01:01:29.715
Which are incurable.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:34.305
We have had some horrible people

01:01:34.339 --> 01:01:46.569
in our country who preached that through mooladhara chakra , through sex, you can raise the kundalini.

01:01:55.055 --> 01:01:57.261
And they became tantrikas.

01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:04.811
People who were tantrikas did all kinds of horrible things

01:02:04.775 --> 01:02:10.434
in the temples they put erotics, insult to Shri Ganesha.

01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:25.834
They are all now being destroyed.

01:02:28.865 --> 01:02:33.079
So one should never try to challenge a person who is innocent,

01:02:33.104 --> 01:02:36.599
who has the blessings of Shri Ganesha.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:52.011
Only through enlightenment one can awaken Shri Ganesha within yourself.

01:02:57.296 --> 01:02:59.796
May God bless you all.
