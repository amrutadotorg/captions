WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:17.610
I talked to you about the Void in our body,
which is called as Bhavasagara [Hindi], Bhavasagara

00:17.610 --> 00:19.670
in our Sahaja Yoga language.

00:19.670 --> 00:29.030
Today we have to understand the other chakras,
which are above the Bhavasagara.

00:29.030 --> 00:37.499
Last time I told you how by following wrong
gurus and spoiling your Guru principle you

00:37.499 --> 00:41.039
get problems in your stomach.

00:41.039 --> 00:52.140
Also your extreme behavior towards religion,
your fanaticism, creates problems which may

00:52.140 --> 00:57.199
go up to something like cancer.

00:57.199 --> 01:07.800
Also, the another extreme behavior of people
who become very dry by their over-activity

01:07.800 --> 01:16.360
on the right side and have no feelings for
the family and neglect the family, have no

01:16.360 --> 01:25.110
relationship with their wives of a normal
nature, also may develop problems of the stomach.

01:25.110 --> 01:37.900
This chakra I didn’t talk to you before,
about the speedometer within us, which is

01:37.900 --> 01:41.890
the Nabhi.

01:41.890 --> 01:44.180
I think I did mention something about it.

01:44.180 --> 01:49.560
This is one of the most important chakras
within us and I think, before going over to

01:49.560 --> 01:56.190
other chakras, I must say that how our spleen
gets spoilt and how we get into problems like

01:56.190 --> 02:01.200
blood cancer, which is a very common disease
today in the West and is also invading our

02:01.200 --> 02:09.520
country, with such a speed [Hindi].

02:09.520 --> 02:19.140
This is a – I didn’t talk to you about
it but I have talked about this to other people.

02:19.140 --> 02:27.230
Now this spleen is the one which creates blood
cells for our emergencies.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.670
Any emergency comes in, it has to produce
new blood cells to fight the emergency or

02:31.670 --> 02:37.750
to face the emergency or to solve the problems
of the emergency.

02:37.750 --> 02:45.830
In the modern times, we have lost the idea
of controlling our speed.

02:45.830 --> 02:54.650
We talk telescopically, we walk telescopically,
we arrive at a point so telescopically that

02:54.650 --> 02:58.870
the point is left behind before we arrive.

02:58.870 --> 03:06.040
Now this spleen is the one, when you are eating
your food, is also producing blood corpuscles

03:06.040 --> 03:10.760
to fight or, you can say, to digest the food.

03:10.760 --> 03:21.000
At the same time if you are listening to some
horrid news and horrible emergencies that

03:21.000 --> 03:27.610
suddenly come up, or if you are reading newspapers,
or if you are running away to your office,

03:27.610 --> 03:33.870
this is a very common thing with government
servants that they have no time for their

03:33.870 --> 03:34.870
breakfast.

03:34.870 --> 03:39.020
They will take one hour in the bathroom and
in five minutes, they want to finish their

03:39.020 --> 03:40.020
breakfast.

03:40.020 --> 03:47.489
All such persons face the problem of getting
into some sort of a complication of the spleen

03:47.489 --> 03:53.580
because when you eat your food, and suddenly
try to run, the poor spleen has to go with

03:53.580 --> 04:01.849
a double speed to cope up with your additional
activities.

04:01.849 --> 04:12.450
It used to be a style in olden days that all
the people would sit for food very comfortably

04:12.450 --> 04:19.280
and the food was served with great care and
everybody was given sufficient time to eat

04:19.280 --> 04:20.280
the food.

04:20.280 --> 04:29.060
And there would be a lady to fan the gentleman
who would keep the pace of the man’s eating

04:29.060 --> 04:37.700
process at a proper level, and the food would
be eaten with little leisure.

04:37.700 --> 04:44.169
But nowadays I find that people have no sense
that we are human beings and we are not machines.

04:44.169 --> 04:49.250
In Delhi, I feel the schools are really very
cruel people.

04:49.250 --> 04:56.150
I find even in this winter season the children
have to go to school at 6.30 or 6 o’clock

04:56.150 --> 04:57.340
in the morning.

04:57.340 --> 05:02.280
And somebody must bring some legal procedure
against these schools.

05:02.280 --> 05:07.070
Is absolutely essential, your children are
going to be in great difficulties if you do

05:07.070 --> 05:09.500
not pay attention to this fact.

05:09.500 --> 05:15.970
To get up early in the morning at that time,
then walk in the cold season, take your bath,

05:15.970 --> 05:20.670
many people take their bath, also with hot
water, and then suddenly go out in that cold,

05:20.670 --> 05:28.130
take your breakfast just in a standing manner,
in a very rushing manner, the mother is running

05:28.130 --> 05:32.020
with a bottle in the hand, and pouring the
milk for the child, and the child is somehow

05:32.020 --> 05:36.750
or other trying to gulp it down and taking
a bread in the hand and rushing about.

05:36.750 --> 05:41.000
This is even worse than military, I can tell
you.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.880
For such small children who are growing, it
is essential that they must have their breakfast

05:45.880 --> 05:54.830
when they are quite in tune with the atmosphere,
not at the early in the morning at 6:30 to

05:54.830 --> 06:01.400
get up and rush them with their breakfast
is something extremely cruel that we are doing

06:01.400 --> 06:02.690
to our children.

06:02.690 --> 06:09.120
This will not only spoil their Vishuddhi – according
to, I think modern people, Vishuddhi trouble

06:09.120 --> 06:13.200
is to be accepted all the time, means all
cold, coughs, and all that is a part of life,

06:13.200 --> 06:16.540
you can’t complain about it, somehow it
has to go hand in hand with you.

06:16.540 --> 06:20.040
They do not want to find solutions for that.

06:20.040 --> 06:25.220
People might say in olden days, people used
to get up at 4 o’clock, all right, they

06:25.220 --> 06:26.680
would.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.680
But they never used to get out of their houses
so fast.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.820
And the style of life was very different in
those days.

06:32.820 --> 06:39.570
People had very good food to eat, they had
things full of vitamins, and the pressures

06:39.570 --> 06:41.780
on their lives were much -, much less.

06:41.780 --> 06:46.540
As it is we have no time to pay any attention
to our children.

06:46.540 --> 06:51.420
On top of that, the way we hurry them up is
so dangerous, that I don’t know, I have

06:51.420 --> 06:57.680
never known that children go so early in Delhi,
which is so freezingly cold, so early and

06:57.680 --> 07:00.520
come back home at about 2:30 in the afternoon.

07:00.520 --> 07:06.900
To come back at 2:30 in the afternoon, after
eating that hurried meal at home, or whatever

07:06.900 --> 07:11.110
you may call a breakfast or whatever you may
call it, so called, and then come back at

07:11.110 --> 07:13.509
2:30 and what are they going to eat?

07:13.509 --> 07:16.360
There is timing for everything.

07:16.360 --> 07:20.570
The food digestion takes about three hours
and children feel hungry.

07:20.570 --> 07:25.539
As it is there is no food and this is how
about five and a half hours, you keep them

07:25.539 --> 07:28.180
away in the schools without any food for what?

07:28.180 --> 07:30.400
What knowledge are you giving to your children?

07:30.400 --> 07:33.280
What is the special knowledge you are giving
to your children?

07:33.280 --> 07:39.210
What is such a great thing that the world
has achieved by having these institutions

07:39.210 --> 07:40.919
of education, so called?

07:40.919 --> 07:48.630
First of all you are creating children who
will be very sick.

07:48.630 --> 07:51.889
It is not going to give them longevity.

07:51.889 --> 08:01.210
Secondly, the way the people rush about for
their work.

08:01.210 --> 08:04.669
In the morning time, there is no need to rush
about.

08:04.669 --> 08:10.169
If you can get up early in the morning, sleep
early and get up in the morning, take your

08:10.169 --> 08:18.660
time and eat your breakfast properly and go
to office, have something in the afternoon,

08:18.660 --> 08:24.560
and then in the evening, you’ll be amazed,
you will get over fifty percent of your sicknesses.

08:24.560 --> 08:31.530
Because at the right time, if you give a proper
practice to your stomach, you get your juices

08:31.530 --> 08:34.270
oozing out at the right time.

08:34.270 --> 08:36.959
You don’t make your stomach crazy by that.

08:36.959 --> 08:41.719
But, by this kind of emergency all the time
arising, listening to horrible things at the

08:41.719 --> 08:50.470
time when you are eating your food or doing
something important, your spleen goes crazy.

08:50.470 --> 08:51.740
It does not know.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.910
It loses its power to produce proper blood
cells.

08:55.910 --> 09:00.950
It does not know how to produce it, it really
becomes crazy and in that craziness, it starts

09:00.950 --> 09:06.760
producing blood cells at odd hours, wrong
hours, it does not know when to produce, it

09:06.760 --> 09:11.910
is always in emergency, it is never stationed
in its normal state.

09:11.910 --> 09:18.959
At this stage, if there is an attack from
your collective subconscious area, about which

09:18.959 --> 09:24.370
now doctors are now talking in England, that
there is an attack of some proteins unknown

09:24.370 --> 09:32.230
to them, they call them as protein 58 and
all that, you are very much prone to get blood

09:32.230 --> 09:33.790
cancer.

09:33.790 --> 09:40.839
Moreover, if your attention is too much on
the left or the right to the extreme, you

09:40.839 --> 09:42.170
are even more prone.

09:42.170 --> 09:47.360
For example, you are a planner, you plan morning
till evening, so your attention is more on

09:47.360 --> 09:48.440
the future.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.410
That means your attention is on the right-hand
side.

09:50.410 --> 09:55.060
It’s like a cloth you can say, the attention
in the stomach, is protruding to the right

09:55.060 --> 09:57.320
or to the left.

09:57.320 --> 10:01.620
Now, if your attention is too much on the
right, means you are planning all the time,

10:01.620 --> 10:05.700
as I told you, doctors may not accept it,
but is a fact that when you think too much

10:05.700 --> 10:14.760
and plan too much, your Nabhi or your Swadishthana
Chakra is converting the fat cells for the

10:14.760 --> 10:16.400
use of the brain.

10:16.400 --> 10:25.360
At that time, if you put more pressure into
it, by over-activity of the right-hand side,

10:25.360 --> 10:31.010
which is your kriya shakti, it happens that
you may enter into it to such an extent that

10:31.010 --> 10:37.790
at that time, if you have any such problem,
you are easy to get some problem with your

10:37.790 --> 10:42.750
liver because it is on the right-hand side;
and the poor liver suffers, you get cyrrosis

10:42.750 --> 10:49.500
of the liver or just like cancer of the liver.

10:49.500 --> 10:55.940
Now, in Sahaja Yoga, what happens really is
this, your attention is spread like a cloth,

10:55.940 --> 11:06.550
and when the Kundalini rises, She pushes your
attention upward and the attention is a sheath

11:06.550 --> 11:07.550
around the Kundalini.

11:07.550 --> 11:13.060
When She pierces the Brahmarandhra, then your
attention starts oozing out into the Supreme

11:13.060 --> 11:21.029
or what we call the Super Consciousness, which
is here spread, into the sukshma, into the

11:21.029 --> 11:22.430
subtle consciousness.

11:22.430 --> 11:31.100
Your whole attention is pulled up there and
that is how you cure your blood cancer, your

11:31.100 --> 11:40.149
liver cancer, and all the cancer that is connected
with this kind of attention.

11:40.149 --> 11:47.180
Not only cancer but many other diseases, like
kidney trouble, liver trouble and all other

11:47.180 --> 11:59.240
– we can say diabetes, intestinal troubles,
and even you might get relief to your diaphragm,

11:59.240 --> 12:04.990
sometimes which is very much in tension with
people who are agitated all the time.

12:04.990 --> 12:12.800
Those people who think they are important,
I think are really not aware of what importance

12:12.800 --> 12:14.649
they have to themselves.

12:14.649 --> 12:19.470
We must understand our own esteem, and we
must know that we are human beings, and that

12:19.470 --> 12:23.329
we are very important to God if not to anybody
else.

12:23.329 --> 12:29.170
As human beings, we have to also realize that
we have come on this earth from amoeba stage

12:29.170 --> 12:35.950
to this stage, and God has worked so hard
for us that we have no business to go on slashing

12:35.950 --> 12:44.430
ourselves into absolutely ridiculous sick
people who are no good for God and no good

12:44.430 --> 12:46.990
for anyone whatsoever.

12:46.990 --> 12:54.870
Now, this attention is, how it is diverted
from this to that, can be seen that when people

12:54.870 --> 13:02.000
are very much right-handed or ego-oriented,
as we call it, they try to take their attention

13:02.000 --> 13:03.860
away from their ego.

13:03.860 --> 13:09.370
Actually those people who are very ego-oriented
always take to some kind of intoxication because

13:09.370 --> 13:11.350
they just can’t sleep in the night.

13:11.350 --> 13:14.550
Their attention so much is in the future that
they cannot sleep.

13:14.550 --> 13:17.020
By sleep, they might go into the left side.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.010
So they have to drink a lot.

13:19.010 --> 13:22.260
They will have more alcohols than normal people
do.

13:22.260 --> 13:27.350
They’ll have drugs or they’ll have some
sort of a thing, ultimately they have to take

13:27.350 --> 13:31.240
sleeping pills, without sleeping pills they
cannot sleep.

13:31.240 --> 13:36.980
The reason is, the attention in the man is
so disturbed, and he does not know how to

13:36.980 --> 13:46.350
give it a proper chance to lead a normal existence
that this attention is always thinking, thinking,

13:46.350 --> 13:52.320
thinking like mad and he does not know how
to stop that thinking.

13:52.320 --> 13:58.260
In Sahaja Yoga, it happens automatically because
your attention goes beyond thinking.

13:58.260 --> 14:05.360
You develop your thoughtless awareness without
any difficulties, but you do not establish

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
it.

14:06.360 --> 14:10.839
You have to establish your thoughtless awareness
and for that, you have to work it out.

14:10.839 --> 14:13.370
And that working out takes little time.

14:13.370 --> 14:18.350
If people can really work it out properly,
they can never get into these troubles.

14:18.350 --> 14:22.829
On the contrary, even if they may not be doctors,
or may not be physicians, they may be able

14:22.829 --> 14:26.610
to cure other people who have this problem.

14:26.610 --> 14:29.230
But in Sahaja Yoga, you must know that it’s
a new knowledge for you.

14:29.230 --> 14:32.480
It was a secret knowledge before this, very
much a secret.

14:32.480 --> 14:38.620
Of course, I must say Kabirdas and Guru Nanak
and Adi Shankaracharya and all these people

14:38.620 --> 14:39.700
talked of Kundalini.

14:39.700 --> 14:44.540
Gyaneshwara talked of Kundalini and he said
that this is this and this is that.

14:44.540 --> 14:50.170
But they did not give a full detailed idea
about Sahaj Yog because it was useless to

14:50.170 --> 14:53.550
tell them all about it when they were not
realized.

14:53.550 --> 14:57.460
But they did inform because they knew that
this time was going to come when they will

14:57.460 --> 15:02.470
be told about it and if they had not said
about this, they would have come up and said

15:02.470 --> 15:04.399
that, “From where are you getting word Kundalini?

15:04.399 --> 15:06.149
It is not written anywhere."

15:06.149 --> 15:11.290
Because as I told yesterday in My lecture
that people have more faith in My photograph

15:11.290 --> 15:13.610
that than in Myself.

15:13.610 --> 15:18.870
Human beings are so funny that they believe
into something that is printed than what is

15:18.870 --> 15:19.870
said.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.579
Just now, I’m saying something to you.

15:21.579 --> 15:22.779
I’m standing before you.

15:22.779 --> 15:25.780
But when I’m in the present, you do not
want to accept Me.

15:25.780 --> 15:29.740
But if I have said something, and is printed,
you’ll say, “Yes."

15:29.740 --> 15:35.010
I’ve seen also people who have My tapes,
they believe into My tapes than into My speeches

15:35.010 --> 15:36.110
when I’m speaking to them.

15:36.110 --> 15:41.980
It’s most surprising how a human mind rushes
off to the past or to the future.

15:41.980 --> 15:49.570
This is a human nature which is always going
out, and it is the attention which is going

15:49.570 --> 15:54.029
out because of a particular problem within
human beings.

15:54.029 --> 16:00.510
Now that problem I just cannot discuss because
I need little drawings for that which we don’t

16:00.510 --> 16:01.510
have.

16:01.510 --> 16:06.790
But I have got in some of My speeches I’ve
explained, why the attention of man goes out

16:06.790 --> 16:10.769
– because of his prismatic nature of his
brain.

16:10.769 --> 16:19.079
But that prismatic nature and the, I should
say, the dual density of his brain creates

16:19.079 --> 16:22.310
a problem, by which the attention of man goes
out.

16:22.310 --> 16:26.339
Now the attention [of] the man has to be sucked
in.

16:26.339 --> 16:29.459
If I tell you, you pay attention to Me, you
can.

16:29.459 --> 16:33.410
If I tell these children, “Pay attention
to Me”, they may for a while, but again

16:33.410 --> 16:34.440
they’ll start playing.

16:34.440 --> 16:39.760
So, if I tell them that “pay attention to
Me”, they will see Me and they’ll start

16:39.760 --> 16:41.149
paying attention to Me.

16:41.149 --> 16:44.839
But if I say, “Pay attention to yourself”,
you cannot pay.

16:44.839 --> 16:49.680
You may say that, “All right, we are praying
inside, we are doing antar yoga, this that”

16:49.680 --> 16:51.870
– is all a myth, it’s not there.

16:51.870 --> 16:55.579
When the attention is inside, you are in the
present, you don’t think, you are in the

16:55.579 --> 16:56.579
present.

16:56.579 --> 17:01.699
When the attention is outside, then either
you are on the left side or the right side,

17:01.699 --> 17:05.149
by which you are paying attention to your
past or to the future.

17:05.149 --> 17:09.429
All your thoughts are coming from the past
and from the future.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.769
At this present moment, there is no thought.

17:11.769 --> 17:14.900
But this, to stop this, is very difficult.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.919
To say now, you cannot do that.

17:16.919 --> 17:22.100
There’s a space in between, which is called
Vilamba, which is achieved through Kundalini

17:22.100 --> 17:28.199
awakening, it passes through the left and
right side of ego and superego, and in the

17:28.199 --> 17:31.389
center you achieve your thoughtless awareness.

17:31.389 --> 17:40.859
Now, this process of Kundalini rising upward
can be hampered at a [level] – another chakra

17:40.859 --> 17:48.529
which is at the heart level, in the center
in the spinal cord.

17:48.529 --> 17:53.890
It is expressed outside in the sternum and
we can say that till the boy or the girl is

17:53.890 --> 17:58.559
about twelve years of age, from the sternum
the anti-bodies are created, they go in the

17:58.559 --> 18:02.440
whole body and spread there and fight the
diseases.

18:02.440 --> 18:10.559
Now, these anti-bodies, in Sahaja Yoga language,
are the armies of the Jagadamba, of Durga,

18:10.559 --> 18:13.850
of the Mother of this world.

18:13.850 --> 18:19.049
She resides in this center according to Sahaja
Yoga language.

18:19.049 --> 18:24.229
But it may be that people will not believe
into it, “How can that be that Durga resides

18:24.229 --> 18:25.229
there?”

18:25.229 --> 18:26.679
Somebody told Me it’s not written in the
book.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.549
I said, “Thank God, it is not written."

18:28.549 --> 18:33.380
Otherwise you would have never understood
it and you would have a mess of everything,

18:33.380 --> 18:38.000
as you have done it of whatever was written
has been made into a rigmarole.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.039
So now, this Goddess is in this center.

18:46.039 --> 18:52.289
When this center is out of gear, first of
all your anti-bodies are reduced.

18:52.289 --> 18:57.789
There are so many medicines which reduce your
anti-bodies.

18:57.789 --> 19:03.100
But people take it because it gives them a
little relief for the time being.

19:03.100 --> 19:08.309
But they become then prone to other diseases
because if the anti-bodies are reduced, then

19:08.309 --> 19:13.639
you cannot find [may Shri Mataji mean “fight”?]
the other, other diseases and the strength

19:13.639 --> 19:14.639
is reduced.

19:14.639 --> 19:21.730
Now, in all our medicines, we forget that
we are a complete being, we are not just a

19:21.730 --> 19:26.830
physical being, but emotional being, and also
a mental being, and above all, a spiritual

19:26.830 --> 19:27.830
being.

19:27.830 --> 19:33.519
Now when we forget this, we are only worried
about the physical side of it.

19:33.519 --> 19:40.779
And when our physical side is in trouble,
we want to do everything under the sun; but

19:40.779 --> 19:44.539
we do not know by doing that we are spoiling
our emotional side.

19:44.539 --> 19:50.879
By spoiling our emotional side, it can be
very dangerous, that medicines, which reduce

19:50.879 --> 19:56.929
the anti-bodies in the body, can lead you
to madness, ultimately.

19:56.929 --> 20:01.660
First they give you giddiness, must you sleep
a lot, and after that too much sleeping, too

20:01.660 --> 20:04.759
much of these medicines, can cause madness.

20:04.759 --> 20:09.419
Because you are thrown into the left side
and you can be attacked and you can become

20:09.419 --> 20:10.889
a mad person.

20:10.889 --> 20:16.789
So these medicines are so dangerous that people
without understanding the complete nature

20:16.789 --> 20:20.279
of man just try to treat part of it.

20:20.279 --> 20:27.529
In Sahaja Yoga we, as he said, I do not take
any medicines, My ….

20:27.529 --> 20:32.619
as Kabira has said, “I do not take any medicines,
for me Parabrahma is the one who is my Vaidya,

20:32.619 --> 20:33.669
He treats me”.

20:33.669 --> 20:39.820
And is a fact, now the time has come to prove
what Kabira has said, what Nanaka has said,

20:39.820 --> 20:43.389
what Adi Shankaracharya has said, what Christ
has said.

20:43.389 --> 20:47.619
There is no need to take medicine to cure
this centre.

20:47.619 --> 20:51.139
We spoil this centre by other means also.

20:51.139 --> 20:53.320
For example, if you…

20:53.320 --> 20:56.409
there can be very simple reasons for spoiling
it.

20:56.409 --> 20:59.279
You take your bath with hot water.

20:59.279 --> 21:04.559
Normally to take a hot bath – a hot bath
is all right, but that should be done in the

21:04.559 --> 21:06.909
night when you don’t go out at all.

21:06.909 --> 21:10.760
Then you sleep off, you are in the room and
there cannot be a problem.

21:10.760 --> 21:15.960
But I’ve seen in England most of the Indians
who come and see Me have got trouble with

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
their lungs.

21:16.960 --> 21:21.840
They have a problem with their lungs and sometimes
they get lung cancer very easily.

21:21.840 --> 21:25.690
And what I found out that they take a very
hot bath like English people.

21:25.690 --> 21:28.639
Actually English people take seldom their
baths.

21:28.639 --> 21:34.989
So [She laughs, general laughter] and it is
very common to see in English homes sixty

21:34.989 --> 21:38.009
bedrooms with a bath, you see.

21:38.009 --> 21:40.639
Because they don’t require it much.

21:40.639 --> 21:42.460
But even if they have to take, they take it
in the night.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.739
[Laughter] They don’t take it early in the
morning like Indians do.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.809
You see, you have to live in England the way
English are – and not that, you cannot live

21:49.809 --> 21:57.340
like that, is a bit too much [laughter] – but
still you can sometimes understand that if

21:57.340 --> 22:02.460
you have to take the bath early in the morning,
and then go to office, you are definite to

22:02.460 --> 22:07.809
catch this centre or a centre next to that
which is called as right heart in our Sahaja

22:07.809 --> 22:09.610
Yoga language.

22:09.610 --> 22:16.529
Now this center heart is caught, or the right
heart is caught, because you suddenly expose

22:16.529 --> 22:19.489
yourself to cold weather.

22:19.489 --> 22:24.220
In the same way in Delhi you may catch it,
that you just have your hot bath and get out

22:24.220 --> 22:26.039
into the cold.

22:26.039 --> 22:33.460
Now best thing is that you take your hot bath
always, and then allow the water to be mixed

22:33.460 --> 22:40.889
with cold water, make the tap run and then
you take your bath, end up with cool water.

22:40.889 --> 22:45.059
You’ll be amazed you will never catch cold.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.740
Is a very simple thing to do.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.320
Once you practice this, you will never catch
cold.

22:51.320 --> 22:58.600
I have seen people living very near Himalayas
where it’s absolutely very, very cold twelve

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
months.

22:59.600 --> 23:08.450
They always take their baths early in the
morning sitting outside with cold water.

23:08.450 --> 23:11.080
They never take bath with hot water.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.279
They never have hot water to take their bath.

23:14.279 --> 23:19.940
And I’ve not seen any person suffering from
this cold in the hills.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.340
They keep very good health as far as the cold
is concerned despite the fact it is very cold.

23:24.340 --> 23:30.039
It’s a matter of little habit, if the sahaj
yogis who are realized souls, if they practice

23:30.039 --> 23:34.950
this, I tell you all your Vishuddhis which
are so horribly caught up will be all right

23:34.950 --> 23:38.970
and I will have less trouble [laughter, She
laughs].

23:38.970 --> 23:43.710
Because today I was clearing everybody’s
Vishuddhi there.

23:43.710 --> 23:49.279
Now this right-side heart is caught up, is
most surprising that it is caught up, because

23:49.279 --> 23:56.190
it is the, it is bestowed upon by the deity
of Shri Rama.

23:56.190 --> 23:58.460
Shri Rama is the Father deity.

23:58.460 --> 24:08.359
He is the Father, he is the Father king and
he is the Father of this world, is the Father

24:08.359 --> 24:09.359
head.

24:09.359 --> 24:12.840
Supposing you are a bad father, you will catch
this.

24:12.840 --> 24:18.049
Ultimately, with this center you always get
asthma, always.

24:18.049 --> 24:23.090
All asthma patients who have come to Me have
been cured – so far.

24:23.090 --> 24:27.889
I have cured most of the ailments of right
heart.

24:27.889 --> 24:33.520
There is another cause of this is, supposing
somebody’s father is dead in early years,

24:33.520 --> 24:39.969
very early years when the child was not yet
properly settled down, or he died at a time

24:39.969 --> 24:45.739
with an accident or may be with a worry about
the child.

24:45.739 --> 24:46.759
Then he haunts the child.

24:46.759 --> 24:48.129
This is true.

24:48.129 --> 24:54.950
At that time, if you just tell your father
that “I’m all right, don’t worry, you

24:54.950 --> 25:00.799
take your birth, I’ll be all right”, you’ll
be amazed, this asthma can go.

25:00.799 --> 25:07.879
There was a governor of Kashmir, who was a
very, very respectable man and we had gone

25:07.879 --> 25:11.519
to him as state guests.

25:11.519 --> 25:18.010
One morning he came walking barefeet in Kashmir
to our guesthouse, I was amazed why he was

25:18.010 --> 25:19.010
walking down.

25:19.010 --> 25:20.220
So went down to see him.

25:20.220 --> 25:24.110
He said, “Today I’ve come to see You as
a Mother and not as Mrs.

25:24.110 --> 25:26.299
Shrivastava.

25:26.299 --> 25:30.779
And I have come to ask You for one boon that
I’ve had this asthma for twenty-five years

25:30.779 --> 25:32.509
and can You cure me?”.

25:32.509 --> 25:34.559
And it was cured in five minutes flat.

25:34.559 --> 25:36.690
It’s that simple.

25:36.690 --> 25:43.050
If you take the name of Shri Rama, if Nanaka
says is all right or if Kabira does is all

25:43.050 --> 25:48.349
right, but if you unauthorized way if you
go on pestering Shri Ram for everything, then

25:48.349 --> 25:50.379
also this chakra can be caught.

25:50.379 --> 25:56.109
Those people who believe in Hanumana, also
if they go on too much with it, it can be

25:56.109 --> 25:57.109
caught.

25:57.109 --> 26:04.450
Hanumana is the deity for your air, for your
breathing, and when you try to suffocate Hanumana

26:04.450 --> 26:11.469
within you, you get the trouble of His disappearing
from that center, or you can say He sleeps

26:11.469 --> 26:17.479
and you get these two troubles of – one
is asthma and also sometimes you might get

26:17.479 --> 26:18.479
choking.

26:18.479 --> 26:23.039
Suddenly, people, some people when they are
talking, suddenly they choke up.

26:23.039 --> 26:30.649
Now this, this is very easy to cure, very,
very easy to cure asthma can be cured very

26:30.649 --> 26:31.649
easily.

26:31.649 --> 26:39.009
But the center heart when it is in problem
it can be with anything.

26:39.009 --> 26:46.479
We have here a patient who was doing this
Santoshi Mata’s vrat and she got this trouble.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.549
Now Santoshi Mata, there’s nothing like
that.

26:49.549 --> 26:50.549
It’s absurd!

26:50.549 --> 26:54.720
Any Santoshi Mata is created by some cinema
fellow and all the women are doing this and

26:54.720 --> 26:56.729
they are fasting on Friday.

26:56.729 --> 27:01.019
If you fast on Friday in the name of the Goddess,
you can fast if you want to, but not in the

27:01.019 --> 27:06.289
name of Goddess – you are definite to catch
this thing because that is the day when She

27:06.289 --> 27:07.289
was born.

27:07.289 --> 27:11.019
Friday is the day as regarded as the day of
the Goddess.

27:11.019 --> 27:14.010
And that day one has to celebrate it instead
of fasting.

27:14.010 --> 27:18.341
Apart from that, when you start taking Her
name morning till evening every time, She

27:18.341 --> 27:21.389
gets fed up of you and She disappears from
there.

27:21.389 --> 27:24.389
She just doesn’t like you and you might
develop a big problem.

27:24.389 --> 27:27.219
She is the One who gives you sense of security.

27:27.219 --> 27:28.729
She is the One She gives you sense of security.

27:28.729 --> 27:33.149
When your sense of security is disturbed,
then you get the catch on this one.

27:33.149 --> 27:38.460
For example, the women who suffer from, say,
breast cancer are only doing so because of

27:38.460 --> 27:42.269
this, because She is the Great Mother and
as a mother, you suffer.

27:42.269 --> 27:46.309
Supposing a husband is a bad man and a flirt,
and the woman thinks he is not all right.

27:46.309 --> 27:52.149
It is important for man to console his wife
and see that she has complete faith in her

27:52.149 --> 27:53.149
security.

27:53.149 --> 27:57.929
But specially in India we try to make our
women extremely insecure by the way we talk

27:57.929 --> 27:59.609
to them, the way we treat them.

27:59.609 --> 28:06.210
I mean, we are extremely cruel people as far
as our wives are concerned.

28:06.210 --> 28:11.799
Because I have seen people here, we have such
a big dowry system and all sorts of systems

28:11.799 --> 28:14.580
in all our horrible customs and castes.

28:14.580 --> 28:21.229
If a daughter is there, then there’s all
weakness for her, but the wife is also a daughter

28:21.229 --> 28:23.070
of somebody else, nobody thinks.

28:23.070 --> 28:27.259
They will say if the wife asks for anything,
“Go and ask your father.

28:27.259 --> 28:30.059
Why didn’t he give it in the marriage?”

28:30.059 --> 28:33.049
There is no fondness for the wife.

28:33.049 --> 28:35.999
There’s no understanding that she is the
one who is to be loved.

28:35.999 --> 28:37.799
She is to be given all the security.

28:37.799 --> 28:42.879
And we put all kinds of insecurities into
her, we shout at her, some… so many people

28:42.879 --> 28:45.070
also beat their wives.

28:45.070 --> 28:49.789
In England, invariably men beat their wives,
surprisingly supposed to be very educated,

28:49.789 --> 28:50.789
sophisticated people.

28:50.789 --> 28:53.639
The more sophisticated they are, the worse
they are.

28:53.639 --> 28:55.789
Not only they beat their wives, but they kill
their children.

28:55.789 --> 28:57.820
Every week two children are killed in England.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.710
And we are going the same way.

28:59.710 --> 29:04.729
I tell you I had never known people who used
to beat their wives when I was a child or

29:04.729 --> 29:05.729
when I was grown up.

29:05.729 --> 29:09.679
I have seen My father that he always respected
My mother very much.

29:09.679 --> 29:14.289
But nowadays I find that husbands have no
respect for the wife at all.

29:14.289 --> 29:18.219
They think they are very great people even
if they are clerks or anything they think

29:18.219 --> 29:19.419
the wife is a peon.

29:19.419 --> 29:26.940
If the husband is a peon he thinks the wife
is a jamadar [laughter].

29:26.940 --> 29:29.559
If he is the jamadar I don’t know what he
must be thinking his wife to be.

29:29.559 --> 29:37.830
And this kind of mythical complexes that human
beings have developed, women develop this

29:37.830 --> 29:42.139
kind of a trouble, specially when men are
flirts.

29:42.139 --> 29:48.289
You see, when men start looking out for other
women it upsets women; it upsets their sense

29:48.289 --> 29:49.289
of security.

29:49.289 --> 29:50.919
She is the mother of your children.

29:50.919 --> 29:56.249
She feels that any day she is challenged and
any days she’ll be insulted, she is a mother

29:56.249 --> 29:58.929
and as your children’s mother, she must
be respected.

29:58.929 --> 30:04.859
If she is not respected, she is absolutely
prone to this kind of a sense of insecurity

30:04.859 --> 30:09.259
in which she might develop this breast cancer.

30:09.259 --> 30:12.710
And this breast cancer is a very serious disease,
as you know.

30:12.710 --> 30:16.119
We have cured many people from breast cancer.

30:16.119 --> 30:19.909
Many people have been cured of breast cancer
and the relationship between husband and wife

30:19.909 --> 30:21.219
has improved after that.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.830
But while she gets breast cancer, then you
should see the husband.

30:24.830 --> 30:29.349
He gets absolutely upset, he does not know
what to do because Indian husbands do not

30:29.349 --> 30:35.869
know how to cook even, they do not know even
how to buy a vegetable, they don’t know

30:35.869 --> 30:37.059
what are different dhals are.

30:37.059 --> 30:38.779
They don’t know any work whatsoever in the
house.

30:38.779 --> 30:43.919
They are not like English husbands or any
Western husbands, and some of the Western

30:43.919 --> 30:46.269
people told me that Indian men are cowards.

30:46.269 --> 30:49.080
They cannot take a divorce because they don’t
know how to cook [laughter].

30:49.080 --> 30:59.269
So, this is the condition of our Indian men,
they are entirely dependant on their wives

30:59.269 --> 31:04.259
for everything, still they try to dominate
their women so much; and I’m speaking in

31:04.259 --> 31:09.039
English, I’m sorry I have to say this but
it is the case.

31:09.039 --> 31:16.830
And when, you see, the women, when they find
men behaving like this, they become tigresses.

31:16.830 --> 31:21.399
Some of them become such horrible tigresses
that they can ruin not only the family but

31:21.399 --> 31:26.489
families after families and nations after
nations.

31:26.489 --> 31:32.289
You are creating a woman who is challenging
you and then once she starts challenging – and

31:32.289 --> 31:37.789
the result of that I have seen that in England
or in any other such country, France, Germany,

31:37.789 --> 31:39.070
Germany specially.

31:39.070 --> 31:44.070
In Germany women are hitlerish, absolutely
hitlerish, men shake before them [laughter].

31:44.070 --> 31:48.499
Absolutely, they are just like ghatis, you
see, in the hamals, working in the house.

31:48.499 --> 31:52.220
The woman stands with her both hand on her
hips and she says, “You haven’t cleaned

31:52.220 --> 31:53.220
this.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.499
You haven’t done this, what have you been
doing?

31:54.499 --> 31:57.039
This is not clean."

31:57.039 --> 32:02.099
They have to clean all the utensils in the
house, everything, they have to keep the kitchen

32:02.099 --> 32:07.499
absolutely sparklingly clean, otherwise the
men would be scolded on, “You don’t know

32:07.499 --> 32:08.499
how to keep it clean?

32:08.499 --> 32:10.129
Better go and learn from your neighbor."

32:10.129 --> 32:16.799
And poor neighbors consult each other and
do their homework [laughter].

32:16.799 --> 32:24.909
Moreover the laws are such, they have passed
such laws that when the wife divorces a husband,

32:24.909 --> 32:30.109
she gets half of the property, half of the
income of the husband, as long as she does

32:30.109 --> 32:31.109
not marry.

32:31.109 --> 32:34.009
For example, a man is living in a huge big
place.

32:34.009 --> 32:38.759
Suddenly his wife decides to divorce – decides,
there’s no reason needed for that.

32:38.759 --> 32:44.359
If she decides to divorce, then they get a
divorce, and the house is to be sold, and

32:44.359 --> 32:46.029
the money is to be given half, half.

32:46.029 --> 32:47.029
[Laughter]

32:47.029 --> 32:51.299
Then if such a wife marries twice or thrice,
she is a rich lady while this man is a pauper

32:51.299 --> 32:52.299
[laughter].

32:52.299 --> 32:53.299
This is a very common sight.

32:53.299 --> 33:04.659
I have seen this very common in America specially,
that she says that he was my husband, he looks

33:04.659 --> 33:14.269
like a chauffeur, and this lady is going in
such big Cadillacs and all that, with a [laughter]

33:14.269 --> 33:18.960
– I wouldn’t say cigarette, it’s more
than that [laughter] – and with a stick

33:18.960 --> 33:21.509
in the hand, you see, very smart.

33:21.509 --> 33:28.019
And while the husband is all tattered and
torn, and working as a chauffeur somewhere.

33:28.019 --> 33:31.879
So, that another extreme is also horrid.

33:31.879 --> 33:39.659
A woman is not to be like that, she has to
be a decent gracious personality and she is

33:39.659 --> 33:44.429
not to take up this challenge, it’s not
wise to take these challenges from men.

33:44.429 --> 33:50.549
At least, Indian women know that, most of
them know, I hope so, they will keep it up.

33:50.549 --> 33:53.940
But the men must understand now that they
have to respect women.

33:53.940 --> 34:00.109
If they do not respect their women, then the
daughters that they have, will be coming out

34:00.109 --> 34:05.039
like that and they’ll show such results
that you’ll be shocked.

34:05.039 --> 34:07.469
One day they may even slap their father on
the face.

34:07.469 --> 34:11.500
It is quite possible, all such things can
happen in this country also.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.789
So one has to be careful.

34:12.789 --> 34:19.620
Now I’ve said it because these two centers
are very important, Shri Rama, who is the

34:19.620 --> 34:24.379
deity of Maryadas, of boundaries, how a human
being must live.

34:24.379 --> 34:32.889
All His life, He never showed any special
interest in giving realization to people.

34:32.889 --> 34:39.179
But – of course, He destroyed Ravana and
He destroyed many rakshasas.

34:39.179 --> 34:48.440
But main message of His life is a life of
a dedicated husband, who loved His wife very

34:48.440 --> 34:55.779
much and a man who sacrificed His beloved
for the sake of His being a good king.

34:55.779 --> 35:04.270
But just the other way round you find, in
this country where we think love is great

35:04.270 --> 35:09.940
– here, I’ve known of many Ministers whose
wives rule the family.

35:09.940 --> 35:15.900
Take, sacrifice is not there, on the contrary,
the wives are so important that they can make

35:15.900 --> 35:21.859
the husbands just sit in the corner and nobody
says anything about it.

35:21.859 --> 35:29.150
But I have also known even worse cases where
the whole country is sold in the name of their

35:29.150 --> 35:30.150
children.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.450
It is such a serious thing.

35:32.450 --> 35:37.839
We do not understand that these children are
not something that are going to carry your

35:37.839 --> 35:46.890
name, but what is going to carry your name
is your own worth, is your own style, is in

35:46.890 --> 35:47.890
your own character, and your own leadership.

35:47.890 --> 35:53.910
Nobody is going to be bothered who is the
one who is your son or who is your daughter

35:53.910 --> 35:55.589
or who is who.

35:55.589 --> 36:03.359
So those people who try such things, to think
that their children and their children or

36:03.359 --> 36:08.760
– children are so important, then they should
realize that it was Shri Rama who sacrificed

36:08.760 --> 36:17.140
His beloved, when She was pregnant and He
led a life of an ascetic remembering His wife.

36:17.140 --> 36:22.819
This sacrifice was too much for Shri Ram because
He really loved Her, really, could not exist

36:22.819 --> 36:24.920
without Her, it was too much.

36:24.920 --> 36:29.220
And then at a time when it comes to, Sita
also left Him.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.630
And She left Him in Her own grace and in Her
own grandeur.

36:32.630 --> 36:36.900
She didn’t allow Him to touch His body and
She just disappeared, like a woman has to

36:36.900 --> 36:37.900
do.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.000
While in the modern times, it is not so.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.109
If the husband has harmed you, then the women
will go to the courts, she’ll put him in

36:44.109 --> 36:48.500
the jail and she will see that he is punished
nicely.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.500
Why?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
Because he was busy with other women.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.750
Now, what I’m saying, if you think that
you love your husband and that’s why you

36:54.750 --> 36:57.520
are angry that he should have nothing to do
with other women, why should you put him in

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
the jail?

36:58.520 --> 37:01.310
Why should you trouble him and torture him?

37:01.310 --> 37:06.590
So we have to realize that husband and wife
relationship is extremely important for sahaja

37:06.590 --> 37:07.590
yogis.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.950
You are the complements of each other.

37:08.950 --> 37:12.690
If the relationship is not all right, Sahaja
Yoga does not work out.

37:12.690 --> 37:20.029
It is not that a woman becomes so dominant,
but it is the complement, the love between

37:20.029 --> 37:22.799
the two, the beauty of love, and the understanding.

37:22.799 --> 37:27.260
You need not even smile at your husband, you
need not even, when he is going – you see,

37:27.260 --> 37:32.619
in England I have seen or anywhere else I
have seen, people will be all the time kissing

37:32.619 --> 37:36.470
each other and doing all kinds of gestures
to show that they love.

37:36.470 --> 37:37.470
And if you ask them, “Where are you going?”

37:37.470 --> 37:39.769
– Even on an escalator you’ll find them
like that.

37:39.769 --> 37:42.559
And if you ask them where are they going they
will say that, “Just now we are going for

37:42.559 --> 37:43.559
a divorce case."

37:43.559 --> 37:44.559
[Laughter]

37:44.559 --> 37:50.930
The show is not needed, but from the heart,
you must feel that oneness with your husband

37:50.930 --> 37:57.549
and that love for him and the husband must
feel that love; and it’s the only relationship,

37:57.549 --> 37:59.859
it’s the only, believe Me, which is the
most beautiful.

37:59.859 --> 38:05.010
The relationship with your children, you will
understand when they will earn, with your

38:05.010 --> 38:08.299
daughter she will understand when they are
married.

38:08.299 --> 38:11.539
With your parents also, when they are grown
up, you are grown up you have your wife, you’ll

38:11.539 --> 38:15.329
find there will be a – you’ll find their
conceit coming up.

38:15.329 --> 38:22.329
But the relationship with your wife is the
most private and the most treasured relationship

38:22.329 --> 38:26.789
and that’s why people have sung so many
poems about it and so many things.

38:26.789 --> 38:34.700
In Indian language, the – we have a certain
law about even writing.

38:34.700 --> 38:39.540
Whatever is not hitakari is not accepted because
it is called as Sahitya.

38:39.540 --> 38:47.400
Sahitya means Saha Hita, the one which gives
you Hita to your Atma is the only Sahitya.

38:47.400 --> 38:53.690
The literature is Sahitya, whichever is not
is not literature, is trash.

38:53.690 --> 39:00.559
And in Sanskrit language Shringara which is
not with your wife, is not a Shringar, is

39:00.559 --> 39:01.559
ashleela.

39:01.559 --> 39:04.599
It has to be with your wife or to whom you
are engaged to.

39:04.599 --> 39:09.310
And it is such a pure thing, is such a pure
thing.

39:09.310 --> 39:14.279
And if people can understand how to enjoy
that purity, they will become themselves pure

39:14.279 --> 39:18.480
and they will have the best essence of it.

39:18.480 --> 39:22.240
You see, when it comes to buying something,
we want pure silk, we want pure diamond, we

39:22.240 --> 39:23.540
want pure gold.

39:23.540 --> 39:29.380
But when it comes to our love, we want to
have all kinds of mixed-up impurities, perversions.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.730
And then we say, “Oh, I got tired.

39:32.730 --> 39:33.730
I cannot enjoy”.

39:33.730 --> 39:34.750
Because it’s not pure!

39:34.750 --> 39:39.160
The purity of that relationship must be enjoyed.

39:39.160 --> 39:44.320
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in sannyasa,
as I told you and there should be no sannyasa

39:44.320 --> 39:48.640
now, because there are many great souls who
want to be born on this earth and we have

39:48.640 --> 39:50.160
to make arrangements for them.

39:50.160 --> 39:56.380
We have to have people who are happily married,
who respect each other, love each other, so

39:56.380 --> 40:01.280
that the great saints can be born here.

40:01.280 --> 40:09.500
In this relation, I would say a very interesting
talk that I had with a BBC fellow who came

40:09.500 --> 40:10.500
to interview Me.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.990
And he was, as usual, they are very sarcastic
and they think they are very smart.

40:13.990 --> 40:18.000
They did not know they were meeting a smarter
person [laughter].

40:18.000 --> 40:24.690
First he said to Me that, “How is it You
are here and doing so much for us, but why

40:24.690 --> 40:26.890
don’t You go and help Indians who are so
poor?”

40:26.890 --> 40:34.010
I said, “I’m sorry Sir, I’m in England
and I’m on your soil, I shouldn’t say

40:34.010 --> 40:38.270
this, it’s not gracious for Me to say, but
you have asked such a question, I must answer

40:38.270 --> 40:39.270
it.

40:39.270 --> 40:43.529
With full apologies, I must say: who is responsible
for the poverty of India?”

40:43.529 --> 40:44.529
[Laughter]

40:44.529 --> 40:45.630
And he kept quiet.

40:45.630 --> 40:50.309
Then he came out with second question, you
see, very smart fellow.

40:50.309 --> 40:55.130
He said that “But, what do You think of
the population problem of India?

40:55.130 --> 40:57.079
We are so much worried about it.

40:57.079 --> 41:00.299
Why don’t You look after the population
problem of Your India?”

41:00.299 --> 41:03.819
“Of course I’m in England, I would have
never been there, I’m only there because

41:03.819 --> 41:04.950
My husband is there."

41:04.950 --> 41:09.910
But I said, “Really, I’m sorry that this
is in India, but what to do?

41:09.910 --> 41:11.160
There’s no solution for it."

41:11.160 --> 41:13.210
He said, “Are we also responsible for that?”

41:13.210 --> 41:15.720
I said, “I’m sorry to say, very much so."

41:15.720 --> 41:16.720
[Laughter]

41:16.720 --> 41:20.930
He said, “How are we responsible for your
population problem?”

41:20.930 --> 41:25.349
I said, “The trouble is, you see, the people
who are taking birth have to decide, who will

41:25.349 --> 41:26.720
take birth in this England?

41:26.720 --> 41:40.059
[Laughter and applause] There two children
every week are killed by the parents for nothing

41:40.059 --> 41:46.640
at all, where the children are legal, everything
– who, which foolish man will take birth

41:46.640 --> 41:51.660
here [laughter] except for people who are
of a very high grade – spirituality, you

41:51.660 --> 41:56.039
don’t bother about these things [She laughs];
or only the rakshasas who will come and hit

41:56.039 --> 42:00.309
their parents and that’s what they are doing
today.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.880
They are treating you well, the way you are
parents, and you don’t know what to do with

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
them”.

42:03.880 --> 42:08.069
And this is what it is I have to tell you
that unless and until we really respect our

42:08.069 --> 42:13.859
wives and give them proper attention and proper
help, the discipline of this country is not

42:13.859 --> 42:14.859
going to improve.

42:14.859 --> 42:19.170
It is she who disciplines the children, is
important to give her a complete sense of

42:19.170 --> 42:20.400
security.

42:20.400 --> 42:26.839
And the conceit of man has to go away, that
he thinks he’s very important, he’s not.

42:26.839 --> 42:31.670
It is both, if they are together, then the
whole unit is important, you can’t live

42:31.670 --> 42:33.769
with one eye, you have to have both the eyes.

42:33.769 --> 42:38.660
If one eye thinks he is more important, that
means one eye should disappear to see what

42:38.660 --> 42:40.140
happens without [laughter].

42:40.140 --> 42:46.759
After these, we come to another center, which
is extremely important in Sahaja Yoga called

42:46.759 --> 42:50.460
as Vishuddhi chakra, which is placed behind
this part.

42:50.460 --> 42:53.390
Now it is not an exact position in every human
being.

42:53.390 --> 42:58.280
It’s little lower, higher, so one should
not say that this is at this point.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.480
Because we have to understand, this I’m
talking about the living process.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.960
You can put dead things at the exact position,
at the exact date.

43:05.960 --> 43:11.980
But can you say that the tree will grow in
this form, can you say before the tree is

43:11.980 --> 43:12.980
grown?

43:12.980 --> 43:13.980
It will take its own form.

43:13.980 --> 43:15.760
Can you say the roots will grow like that?

43:15.760 --> 43:20.050
Can you say so many, exactly so many flowers
will be there?

43:20.050 --> 43:22.339
Or exactly so many flowers will become fruits?

43:22.339 --> 43:23.339
You cannot say.

43:23.339 --> 43:27.940
Can you say at this time, at this hour, at
this moment, the flower is going to become

43:27.940 --> 43:29.420
the fruit?

43:29.420 --> 43:39.000
So, in the same way, you cannot say exactly
about Sahaja Yoga that where is this particular

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
center is placed.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.160
Is above that.

43:41.160 --> 43:45.170
You have to feel it, the vibrations, and you
can make it out that in some person it’s

43:45.170 --> 43:47.230
slightly higher, in some person it is lower.

43:47.230 --> 43:52.690
But why it is so important is this center
is that this denotes our real evolution into

43:52.690 --> 43:53.690
a human being.

43:53.690 --> 43:59.579
When the man raised his head up like that,
this center developed into us by which we

43:59.579 --> 44:03.380
developed this ego and superego within us.

44:03.380 --> 44:09.109
How this has happened is another big lecture
[She laughs] for which I would request you

44:09.109 --> 44:14.730
to read something on “Advent” or something
like that where it is little bit explained,

44:14.730 --> 44:21.130
how the awareness of man when he raised his
head like this that his ego started developing,

44:21.130 --> 44:27.089
and when he raised it like that it started
dominating its superego or its mana.

44:27.089 --> 44:34.700
This development within human beings is so
important because at this time, here, resides

44:34.700 --> 44:36.509
Shri Krishna.

44:36.509 --> 44:40.130
Shri Krishna is sampurna.

44:40.130 --> 44:46.460
It’s called as sixteen-petalled, sampurna,
complete incarnation.

44:46.460 --> 44:51.690
And sixteen petals are expressed as sixteen
sub-plexuses in cervical plexus.

44:51.690 --> 44:56.680
The cervical plexus looks after the gross
side of the face and the nose and the eyes

44:56.680 --> 45:03.200
and the ears and the throat.

45:03.200 --> 45:10.339
And – but the subtler side of this center
is very important, which is the left side,

45:10.339 --> 45:12.130
is the sub-conscious side.

45:12.130 --> 45:20.400
And in the left side is the person who feels
very guilty or a person who has not proper

45:20.400 --> 45:25.779
understanding of pure relationships of other
women or other men.

45:25.779 --> 45:30.109
Such a person develops this, in his left side.

45:30.109 --> 45:34.890
Now one may say that what’s wrong in all
these perverted relationships with others,

45:34.890 --> 45:36.380
and what goes wrong with us.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.930
You see, in the West specially, people believe
that you can have any kind of relationship

45:39.930 --> 45:43.390
with anyone, no age, nothing, and they quite
boast of it.

45:43.390 --> 45:47.280
I mean, it’s such a funny thing sometimes,
when I first went there, I had no idea that

45:47.280 --> 45:50.420
they were that extent they were mad.

45:50.420 --> 45:54.359
Because the first thing, in those days, when
I reached there was, the first thing on the

45:54.359 --> 45:59.890
page was love letter by an eighty-year-old
lady to an eighteen-year-old boy [laughter].

45:59.890 --> 46:04.420
And it was written, every his love letter
was there.

46:04.420 --> 46:09.420
And this love letter became such a headache
to Me, I could not understand how could these

46:09.420 --> 46:16.720
people think of such horrible things and write
such letters and publish them in the papers.

46:16.720 --> 46:21.359
And this kind of madness, if you have, if
you do not have the sense of purity about

46:21.359 --> 46:24.029
the relationship with others, you develop
this left Vishuddhi.

46:24.029 --> 46:27.330
With the left Vishuddhi, you develop lots
of problems.

46:27.330 --> 46:33.670
With your tobacco and smoking also you develop
sometimes left Vishuddhi and also right Vishuddhi.

46:33.670 --> 46:40.609
When left Vishuddhi is developed too much,
then you will find a man when he speaks, he

46:40.609 --> 46:47.400
stammers, his face is always going into contortions,
his body is doing like this, noses, you will

46:47.400 --> 46:48.400
find all the Americans do like that.

46:48.400 --> 46:52.859
Like this they will be moving [laughter],
there will be nervousness on the face and

46:52.859 --> 46:54.309
they would not be normal people.

46:54.309 --> 46:56.970
The thing is their left Vishuddhi is in a
problem.

46:56.970 --> 47:03.560
As we say the pishani, this forehead is absolutely
wrinkled up and they have big, big furrows

47:03.560 --> 47:05.009
at a very young age.

47:05.009 --> 47:10.859
Because I was amazed that some woman who was
only thirty years of age, half of My age,

47:10.859 --> 47:15.089
had such furrows and I thought she was an
old lady, I was very respectful to her, I

47:15.089 --> 47:18.539
got up, gave her My seat and all that and
I was standing up.

47:18.539 --> 47:19.539
[Laughter]

47:19.539 --> 47:22.140
And after some time, she said, “Thank You
very much, very kind of You” and all that

47:22.140 --> 47:25.799
and she asked Me – somehow I asked her,
“What are you doing?”

47:25.799 --> 47:27.490
She said, “I’m still studying, doing PhD."

47:27.490 --> 47:28.510
I said ,”What?

47:28.510 --> 47:29.520
[Laughter] Still studying?

47:29.520 --> 47:30.540
What’s your age?”

47:30.540 --> 47:31.550
She said, “Thirty."

47:31.550 --> 47:32.570
I said, “Really?

47:32.570 --> 47:35.410
Will you please get up?

47:35.410 --> 47:37.500
I have to sit down."

47:37.500 --> 47:40.119
[Laughter and applause, She laughs]

47:40.119 --> 47:49.940
I mean, there the criteria of health is to
be just like mosquitoes, you see, the trouble

47:49.940 --> 47:51.869
is they have to be like mosquitoes.

47:51.869 --> 47:57.740
And as it is, they must remain very thin just
like as we call in Hindi, haddimarka.

47:57.740 --> 48:03.730
And on top of that they wear high heels, you
see, and walk just like, what you call, like

48:03.730 --> 48:06.690
spiders [laughter] you see, from here to there,
and you don’t know where they’ll put their

48:06.690 --> 48:07.809
foot onto you [laughter].

48:07.809 --> 48:10.430
And that is regarded as a beauty there.

48:10.430 --> 48:17.390
And so surprising that at a very young age
they start looking so very old that this mistake

48:17.390 --> 48:19.490
can be done by many of us.

48:19.490 --> 48:24.299
Moreover, the another problem comes of left
Vishuddhi, when people do not have proper

48:24.299 --> 48:26.519
sense of womanhood and manhood.

48:26.519 --> 48:32.019
Is very common in England and other countries,
Western countries, like America is much worse,

48:32.019 --> 48:34.319
you cannot make out a man from a woman.

48:34.319 --> 48:42.069
You see, the women dress up just like horses,
they walk like horses [laughter], I mean,

48:42.069 --> 48:45.781
the whole thing is so funny that, you see,
this is big problem for us how to address!

48:45.781 --> 48:51.920
And sometimes it happens like this, that in
a meeting, I forget all the time that this

48:51.920 --> 48:53.849
is a man, I always go on saying “She."

48:53.849 --> 48:54.849
Then he: “He”.

48:54.849 --> 48:55.980
Then they say, “No, this is a man."

48:55.980 --> 48:58.970
I remember then this is a man, it’s such
a problem!

48:58.970 --> 49:06.069
One day, we were going by car, My husband
and Myself we asked ourselves, “Do you think

49:06.069 --> 49:08.260
the person who is going in the other car is
a man or a woman?”

49:08.260 --> 49:09.369
I said, “Now”…

49:09.369 --> 49:12.150
Then our car went ahead, still we looked back,
he said, “I can’t say."

49:12.150 --> 49:14.059
I said, “I can’t say."

49:14.059 --> 49:15.059
[She laughs]

49:15.059 --> 49:20.430
So, I asked our driver, who is an Englishman,
he looked back he said, “Madam, we are sorry,

49:20.430 --> 49:24.299
I’m also sorry, I’m a foreigner, I don’t
know."

49:24.299 --> 49:25.299
[Laughter]

49:25.299 --> 49:31.119
So this kind of perverted attitude, to behave
like this – you see, you are a man, behave

49:31.119 --> 49:34.460
like a man, if you are a woman, behave like
a woman.

49:34.460 --> 49:40.630
If you start behaving like a man, or a woman
behaving like a man and a man behaving like

49:40.630 --> 49:44.700
a woman, you see, you must understand your
muscles are made the way you are.

49:44.700 --> 49:47.750
For example, a man can do lot of work which
women cannot do.

49:47.750 --> 49:52.200
There is no need to be like Russian women
who are doing the, what you call, road-rollers,

49:52.200 --> 49:54.450
they are driving or whatever it is.

49:54.450 --> 50:00.170
You see, they say that Russian women can do
this, but I tell you Russians, I do not want

50:00.170 --> 50:07.249
to say much, but only thing I know that when
they shake hands, you know all your hand goes

50:07.249 --> 50:08.249
out.

50:08.249 --> 50:11.839
[Laughter, She laughs] Fall out [unclear].

50:11.839 --> 50:16.579
That’s all I know, I know from the shake
hands, you see, we have sometimes to shake

50:16.579 --> 50:17.579
hands with many people.

50:17.579 --> 50:20.349
I mean, Australians also are quite capable
[laughter].

50:20.349 --> 50:27.470
When Australians shake your hands, you can
be sure that, at least, if not much, but at

50:27.470 --> 50:32.390
least some ounces are lost.

50:32.390 --> 50:33.390
[Laughter]

50:33.390 --> 50:38.790
Now, this is the thing is that men have to
be men and women have to be women.

50:38.790 --> 50:43.910
When the women become very arrogant and become
very aggressive, then men also to overpower

50:43.910 --> 50:48.339
them become even more, and a sort of a competition
starts, and then they become, first become

50:48.339 --> 50:53.760
like donkeys, then become like horses, then
they will become like mares, then become like

50:53.760 --> 50:57.259
lions, then tigers and you get lost among
them, you don’t know what’s the matter.

50:57.259 --> 51:01.259
You see any film, anything you find nothing
but fighting going on between husband and

51:01.259 --> 51:04.999
wife, as if they are married just to fight,
they had no place to fight, so they are married.

51:04.999 --> 51:09.160
All the time this kind of a struggle, and
this kind of a competition that goes about,

51:09.160 --> 51:12.860
gives you a very bad Vishuddhi.

51:12.860 --> 51:16.859
And that if men are smoking, “What’s wrong
if we smoke?”

51:16.859 --> 51:17.859
“What’s wrong?”

51:17.859 --> 51:19.269
This is a very common thing.

51:19.269 --> 51:22.740
And now, another madness is the liberation
of women has started.

51:22.740 --> 51:25.999
God knows what is going to happen to these
women, what sort of left Vishuddhi they’ll

51:25.999 --> 51:26.999
be having.

51:26.999 --> 51:32.860
They’ll be having a head just like this,
they might have a cancer in this part, maybe,

51:32.860 --> 51:36.410
and they might have a trouble because they
are doing something so unnatural, which is

51:36.410 --> 51:38.099
not suitable to them.

51:38.099 --> 51:43.910
Is possible also in our Indian life, we can
get cancer of our left Vishuddhi.

51:43.910 --> 51:50.789
How do you get cancer of the left Vishuddhi
in Indian life is by taking the mantras, by

51:50.789 --> 51:53.509
taking the name of God for hours together.

51:53.509 --> 51:58.359
For example, if you start singing the song
is all right.

51:58.359 --> 52:02.109
But if you go on saying Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram,
Ram, Ram, morning till evening, you might

52:02.109 --> 52:03.359
develop a cancer.

52:03.359 --> 52:09.529
I had a patient who came to see Me who had
a cancer of the left side.

52:09.529 --> 52:10.529
I asked him, “What do you do?

52:10.529 --> 52:11.779
How did you get this?”.

52:11.779 --> 52:15.119
He told me that he is working for a firm,
which supplies people to chant God’s name.

52:15.119 --> 52:16.119
I said, “What?”

52:16.119 --> 52:23.710
He said, “Yes, there is a firm which has
people trained how to chant God’s name and

52:23.710 --> 52:25.339
they are supplied to all the Marwadis.

52:25.339 --> 52:31.160
Whenever they have a program, they put up
these people there who go on chanting these

52:31.160 --> 52:33.400
names for hours together."

52:33.400 --> 52:34.400
[Hindi]

52:34.400 --> 52:40.109
They go on chanting this name all the time
and this chanting has created a problem for

52:40.109 --> 52:43.920
that man, because he had a job just “Ram,
Ram, Ram, Ram”, I don’t know, whatever

52:43.920 --> 52:48.799
it is, and they sit down there and they go
on chanting these, the money is paid for them.

52:48.799 --> 52:51.819
And also, you see, in this country we have
all funny types of institutions.

52:51.819 --> 52:56.299
It’s nice to laugh at the Western people,
but if we see ourselves, you’ll be amazed

52:56.299 --> 53:00.769
that we have people here in this country who
go for crying also.

53:00.769 --> 53:07.030
If somebody’s dead and there are few people
to cry, they have people on hire, to cry [laughter].

53:07.030 --> 53:14.059
And they cry so loudly, I mean, they have
given a special – I did not know but then

53:14.059 --> 53:18.079
we had a friend who was our neighbour and
he said the best crying people are in this

53:18.079 --> 53:19.880
particular agency [laughter].

53:19.880 --> 53:21.720
And if you call them, they’ll be very good.

53:21.720 --> 53:26.380
Then also we have people who are all the time
shouting slogans, you see, this country is

53:26.380 --> 53:30.480
known for slogans, you won’t find better
sloganish people than Indians are.

53:30.480 --> 53:35.299
And the slogans they have is such a, such
a business, they make business out of, that’s

53:35.299 --> 53:37.730
typically Indian is to make business out of
everything.

53:37.730 --> 53:41.519
So the slogan now, all right, “We’ll supply
slogan people.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.150
You want these slogans, all right, we’ll
give you."

53:44.150 --> 53:49.079
Now in Delhi, perhaps, you do not know, I
know this because I was with Lal Bahadur Shastri,

53:49.079 --> 53:54.369
with My husband and [She laughs] I’ve seen
this, that one day people came to shout for

53:54.369 --> 53:58.400
something with the slogans, you see, near
his place there was a roundabout, and where

53:58.400 --> 54:00.569
people came and started shouting slogans.

54:00.569 --> 54:05.940
And when they started shouting slogans, they
were supposed to represent a particular party.

54:05.940 --> 54:09.730
And they had other banners in their hands,
they had other caps and they were shouting

54:09.730 --> 54:13.119
something else, while they were supposed to
represent something.

54:13.119 --> 54:18.910
So, people asked them, “Are you shouting
for them?

54:18.910 --> 54:24.640
We have paid you for this [laughter, She laughs],
why are you shouting for our opposite party?”.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.059
So they said that, “No, no, we were – must
be a mistake, you see, they just informed

54:28.059 --> 54:33.740
us this, and we have sets of caps and sets
of slogans and sets of banners.

54:33.740 --> 54:37.839
So, they gave us this, we came here, what
to do now?

54:37.839 --> 54:39.799
Whatever they have given us, you go and change
it and we’ll start shouting for another

54:39.799 --> 54:40.799
one."

54:40.799 --> 54:41.799
[Laughter]

54:41.799 --> 54:46.920
So all this kind of shouting, too much talking
or keeping quiet unnecessarily – that is

54:46.920 --> 54:48.390
very common in India to talk.

54:48.390 --> 54:52.710
We talk a bit too much and when we talk too
much also we can catch on the right Vishuddhi

54:52.710 --> 54:53.809
very badly.

54:53.809 --> 54:58.069
While in England they won’t talk much, they
just don’t talk, you see, they just stare

54:58.069 --> 55:02.519
at you with your eyes, you see [laughter],
and you can be quite frightened the way they

55:02.519 --> 55:03.519
look at you.

55:03.519 --> 55:07.609
They don’t believe in talking much, but
they believe in drinking much more [laughter].

55:07.609 --> 55:14.900
And I have seen that the people do not realize
what a strain it is for your throat to talk.

55:14.900 --> 55:20.049
Actually I’ve seen it Myself, I have to
talk such a lot every day, I mean if there

55:20.049 --> 55:24.630
is one center which really gives Me trouble
is My throat, because I have to speak, unless

55:24.630 --> 55:26.920
and until I speak, people are not very happy.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.970
For example, today was one day, I never wanted
to speak, you know what’s the matter with

55:30.970 --> 55:34.210
Me that I’m so full of vibrations I didn’t
want to speak.

55:34.210 --> 55:36.890
But without speech, Indians won’t be happy,
I thought, “I’d better speak."

55:36.890 --> 55:38.230
And same with the other people.

55:38.230 --> 55:42.720
They would love to hear Me talk, talk, talk.

55:42.720 --> 55:47.749
And when we do that, we catch on our Vishuddhi,
we have problems on our Vishuddhi and it’s

55:47.749 --> 55:54.739
rather difficult, difficult to cure a throat
where this strain is there of talking.

55:54.739 --> 56:01.369
All our leaders have to do the same and we
have so many leaders that I think we can patent

56:01.369 --> 56:05.359
some sort of a medicine for their over–talking
[laughter].

56:05.359 --> 56:12.190
Now, after that we have a very, very important
center here, of which you all know, is Agnya

56:12.190 --> 56:13.190
Chakra.

56:13.190 --> 56:17.680
And this center is very important because
this center is placed between the pituitary

56:17.680 --> 56:21.059
and the pineal body, is a very subtle center.

56:21.059 --> 56:27.089
And this center controls both your ego and
superego, so that it controls your thought.

56:27.089 --> 56:31.390
A person whose this center is out of gear,
loses power over his thoughts.

56:31.390 --> 56:39.520
A person who is possessed, will be all the
time talking, he cannot stop.

56:39.520 --> 56:44.390
I have seen in Paris, when you get into a
bus, you see, some old people will come up

56:44.390 --> 56:47.670
and they’ll be talking all the time, they
are all the time talking.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.140
I asked, “What are they talking?”

56:49.140 --> 56:54.390
So My disciple told Me there, Marie, she said:
“Mother, they are talking about the last

56:54.390 --> 56:55.390
war."

56:55.390 --> 56:56.390
I said, “What?”.

56:56.390 --> 56:57.390
“Yes”.

56:57.390 --> 56:58.390
And I said: ”People don’t say anything?”

56:58.390 --> 57:02.240
At least in Indian buses I have not seen,
every bus stop there are three or four people

57:02.240 --> 57:05.910
coming and talking loudly and they are regarded
as mad people, they get down, again they start

57:05.910 --> 57:06.910
talking.

57:06.910 --> 57:14.631
This kind of a disease can come in a person
who is hit by a possession on the right or

57:14.631 --> 57:18.180
on the left hand side, but is more with the
Agnya.

57:18.180 --> 57:26.019
If you are hit at the back, it’s a possession
from outside, but if you are hit in the front,

57:26.019 --> 57:28.880
it is a possession from inside, is auto-hypnosis.

57:28.880 --> 57:33.849
For a man who is egoistical, you might get
a very bad Agnya here.

57:33.849 --> 57:38.829
And such a bad Agnya, just like a balloon
it grows, and you feel you should be away

57:38.829 --> 57:40.580
from that person as soon as possible.

57:40.580 --> 57:44.830
There are people who develop their ego with
all kinds of misidentifications.

57:44.830 --> 57:50.540
For example, if somebody gets a promotion,
or if he gets little more money than others,

57:50.540 --> 57:56.700
or has a little better life than the others,
he develops this special type of a ego.

57:56.700 --> 58:03.269
Ego-oriented people are normally grow taller
and superego people become dwarfs.

58:03.269 --> 58:07.819
But ego-oriented people also have a special
type of a nose, you see, very straight nose

58:07.819 --> 58:09.849
if they are born with the ego.

58:09.849 --> 58:14.739
Now for such people it is important to see
their ego and watch it and laugh at it, make

58:14.739 --> 58:18.109
a fun out of it and then only they can get
rid of it.

58:18.109 --> 58:22.730
After realization, ego starts troubling you,
you can feel the pain of ego here.

58:22.730 --> 58:25.950
Then you come to Me, “Mother, I’m catching
on my right Agnya.

58:25.950 --> 58:28.260
Please take it away, please take it away."

58:28.260 --> 58:31.680
Ego is more a cultural problem also.

58:31.680 --> 58:38.499
In a culture where it is competition and is
very struggling, and all the suggestions come

58:38.499 --> 58:43.579
to you that you have to stand first, you have
to be a unique personality, you start developing

58:43.579 --> 58:49.650
your ego, because your action line moves very
fast; by that, by that Kriya Shakti, you create

58:49.650 --> 58:51.329
ego within you.

58:51.329 --> 58:56.940
People pamper you, that by this your ego will
be all right, but you do not know, they say,

58:56.940 --> 58:58.369
“Oh you’ll look very nice."

58:58.369 --> 58:59.369
It’s pampering.

58:59.369 --> 59:03.249
It’s the pampering of your ego from your
childhood, the whole society works it out,

59:03.249 --> 59:07.390
by which you think, “Oh, I must be unique
person, I should be something special.

59:07.390 --> 59:09.210
I should be something great."

59:09.210 --> 59:16.080
Any uniqueness is against God’s laws, it’s
malignancy.

59:16.080 --> 59:20.080
If such a cell can become malignant, he may
start eating up all.

59:20.080 --> 59:22.880
What happened to Hitler was nothing but he
became malignant.

59:22.880 --> 59:27.329
He could not see through how he was destroying
others.

59:27.329 --> 59:31.589
The thing is, when you have ego, you destroy
others, you are not harmed and you cannot

59:31.589 --> 59:32.589
see it.

59:32.589 --> 59:37.430
The people who have superego or a mana or
which we call the possessions of the left

59:37.430 --> 59:41.970
side, such people, do not destroy others but
they are destroyed themselves.

59:41.970 --> 59:47.490
So the ego in front and ego at the back is
only felt after realization and can only be

59:47.490 --> 59:49.230
corrected after realization.

59:49.230 --> 59:56.000
The back ego you might feel as madness, or
lunacy, or some sort of a pain in the body,

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.740
the whole body gets pain, it moves here, it
comes here, goes there, is definitely it’s

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.859
a possession.

01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:07.549
But the right ego, very people, very few people
are aware of it because it doesn’t give

01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:10.069
trouble to you, it troubles others.

01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:15.839
Now this is also a curse of, I would say,
so-called advancement and development and

01:00:15.839 --> 01:00:19.150
sophistication, is a curse of that.

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:23.510
So, if you go to the right too much, you develop
your ego, you go too much to the left, you

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:24.510
develop your superego.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:28.470
The best thing is for you to be in dharma,
to be in the center, to be moderate; to be

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:32.220
moderate with yourself, don’t try to show
off.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.590
Do not think you have to be unique.

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:38.319
You need not, who is bothered about you?

01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:39.980
It is you who should respect yourself.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.369
It’s not the others.

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:45.410
If supposing, you have a big car or anything,
nobody respects you, on the contrary they

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:50.329
must be saying, “This must be a black marketeer
who has got a big car."

01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:54.319
But ego can develop in a very subtle way when
people talk of their comforts.

01:00:54.319 --> 01:01:00.089
When we talk [of] our comforts, we always
say that we must have our comforts, we must

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:01.230
be comfortable.

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:06.299
This is a very, very subtle way, and a secret
way we develop our ego.

01:01:06.299 --> 01:01:11.589
Bernard Shaw was saying that “After all,
what is the difference between me and an ordinary

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:13.569
coolie, an ordinary laborer?

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:15.220
It’s just the same.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.930
Why should I have more comfort and he should
have less comfort?”

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:25.769
Of course, one can understand also that a
man who is doing work as a laborer does not

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:30.920
have to use his brain too much so he thinks
he can put up with little exertion.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:37.599
While the man who is sitting on the chair
is not used to the exertions, or you can say

01:01:37.599 --> 01:01:39.160
the hard way of life, so he finds it difficult.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.329
But it is such a vicious circle that when
you do this brain activity you develop your

01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:48.299
ego, then you want more comfort, and then
you want to do more mental activity, then

01:01:48.299 --> 01:01:49.755
you want more comfort and it’s a very vicious
circle.

01:01:49.755 --> 01:01:56.130
When you try to break through with that, I
mean, I must say the Western young people

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.400
are doing it because they have accepted hippyism.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.229
Now hippyism is a reaction of that ego.

01:02:01.229 --> 01:02:04.450
They say, “No, we live in a very spartan
way.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.450
We want to have uncomfortable.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.450
We must rough it out."

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:10.740
This is a very good idea, but when they are
doing it, they have taken to another thing,

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.809
horrible thing like drugs to go to superego.

01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:19.400
When you get your realization, you start seeing
this ego so clearly – ego, superego both

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.119
so clearly and you know how to take them out.

01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:27.019
You know how to balance yourself, how to reduce
the pressure of ego or superego and you know

01:02:27.019 --> 01:02:32.410
how to establish your attention in the limbic
area.

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:34.809
Now the last of all is the limbic area.

01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:41.289
I must tell you that this really subtle center
is governed by Lord Jesus Christ.

01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:47.440
Beyond is the limbic area, is the area which
is the Kingdom of God within us.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.130
Here when you enter, you have no thoughts,
you are without thoughts.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:54.580
But still the Kundalini has to pierce, you
are to be born again.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.559
In the limbic area, all the seven centers
are there.

01:02:57.559 --> 01:03:02.749
I mean, there are so many centers we have
got that all the brain cells can be called

01:03:02.749 --> 01:03:08.380
as centers, but specially these seven centers
can be easily located in your limbic area.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:14.380
Now you have seen that when you are realized,
even if you put your fingers into your ears,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.749
you can hear the minutest of notes and music,
because you start hearing through this.

01:03:19.749 --> 01:03:23.509
Limbic area is a very important thing, but
I think the medical science doesn’t know

01:03:23.509 --> 01:03:24.650
much about it.

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:31.130
After realization you know the Sahasrara,
what it is, how it works out and how the deity

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:35.420
at Sahasrara gives you realization, how it
works it out.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:39.920
It’s a important thing that you must get
realization before I talk to you about Sahasrar.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.470
In all the ancient books, nothing has been
written about Sahasrar.

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:48.609
Nobody has written anything much about [it],
except that it has this color, there are many

01:03:48.609 --> 01:03:52.920
petals, but not much has been described about
Sahasrar because it is left to My lot to explain

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.640
to you what Sahasrara is.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.900
These are all the centers we have tried to
cover in a very short time, whatever it is,

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:08.119
in a very fast way I should say, but to digest
it, you must get the book, we have got “Advent”,

01:04:08.119 --> 01:04:10.940
and other books, go through it, read it, understand
it.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.240
It’s a regular knowledge; it’s the absolute
knowledge which you should have.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:22.839
Now, tomorrow [hindi] – tomorrow we have
a program here, and that’s very important

01:04:22.839 --> 01:04:26.829
because this I told you what we have got,
what are the centers are, how the Kundalini

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:27.829
is.

01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:31.309
Tomorrow we – I will tell you what is to
be done after realization.

01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:36.140
It’s very important, you must all come here
and get your realization established, we are

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:40.060
going to work more on realization than on
all this knowledge.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:45.739
You see, you become all –being all intellectuals,
you always want to know the engineering of

01:04:45.739 --> 01:04:46.739
it.

01:04:46.739 --> 01:04:49.029
But the engineering is not so important as
the happening.

01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:52.999
You see, I may tell you the whole engineering
about electricity and all that, but if there

01:04:52.999 --> 01:04:55.200
is no light here, it has no meaning.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:05:03.420
So one has to realize that the engineering
is a headache without the light.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.920
It’s better to know that you are the Spirit.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.700
Tomorrow, for a short time, I’ll tell you
what is the Spirit.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.499
And then I will tell you what is to be done
after Realization.

01:05:09.499 --> 01:05:10.859
May God bless you all.

01:05:10.859 --> 01:05:15.039
Thank you for waiting for Me.

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:16.039
[Applause.

01:05:16.039 --> 01:05:19.910
Yogis: “Jai Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!

01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:20.910
Jai!”]

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:27.559
You may help Me more by using your right hand
to give yourself a balance, put your left

01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:28.059
hand towards …
