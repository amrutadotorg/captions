00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.690
Today we have decided to have a Hamsa Puja in Germany.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.790
We have never yet

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.570
paid much attention to this center of Hamsa,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.250
which is, I think, very important for the Western world,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.730
rather than for the Indian or the Eastern.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.130
The reason is, at the Hamsa chakra,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.710
part of the Ida and Pingala

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.690
come out and manifest.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.010
Means, the expression

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.110
of Ida and Pingala is given through the Hamsa chakra.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.270
So this Hamsa chakra is the one

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.910
that, as if has not gone

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.690
up to the Agya,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.730
but is holding on certain threads

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.430
or certain parts of the Ida and Pingala.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.310
And they start flowing through your nose,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.150
expressing through your eyes, from your mouth

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.430
and from your forehead.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.010
So you know that Vishuddhi chakra

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.790
has got sixteen petals,

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.390
which look after the eyes,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.390
nose, throat, tongue, teeth.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.850
But the expression part

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.470
comes through the Hamsa chakra, of all
these. So

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.870
it's a very, very important thing

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.590
in a Western mind

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.330
to understand Hamsa chakra.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.530
There's a beautiful couplet about this in Sanskrit:

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.090
"Hansa kshveta ha, baka ha kshveta
ha.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.570
Ko bhedo hansa bakayo ho.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.730
Neera-ksheera vivek e tu.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.190
Hansa ha hansaksh, baka ha baka
ha."

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:00.790
Meaning: "The crane and the swan, both are white.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.810
And what makes the difference between the two?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.870
If you mix the water and the milk together,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.390
the hansa [swan, ed.] will just suck in the milk.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.690
So it can discriminate between the water and the milk.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.690
While the bakha, means the crane, cannot."

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.150
The very significant thing for Sahaja yogis to understand.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.510
Discretion is to be understood

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.530
very deeply within ourselves.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.910
And how we develop discretion

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.750
is very important in Sahaja yoga.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.570
But before we go to that, let us see,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:59.350
how this discretion plays a part, very much,

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.430
in the manifestation of our expressions out.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.330
We are the people, in the West, who always try

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.910
to express ourselves outside.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.610
It's very important how you look.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.490
It's very important where you look.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.450
What you look, what you see.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.090
It's very important that

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.610
your appearance should be good.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.930
Very particular, they spend lots of time in improving

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.830
their appearances. This is the minimum.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:56.030
Then they have a method by which we call "the medias".

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.910
The country speaks or manifests through the medias.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.530
And the medias have to have a training.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.730
Every country has it's specialty,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.730
one better than the other. And when you see all of them,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.890
you find that they lack discretion completely.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:22.450
Also in our speech,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.990
in our expression of literature,

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.170
expression of poetry,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:38.370
expression of our relationships with others,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:44.030
any kind of expression requires discretion,

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.570
which is a deep-seated knowledge or wisdom.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:02.790
If in the West people were not so much outside,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.110
they would have been much better off, I think.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.690
If, supposing, in England,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.810
people don't become punks,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.230
then others will laugh at them. And they'll think

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.470
that, "This man has no money to become a punk."

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.550
So kind of a fashion that sets in,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.130
in a society of that kind, which has no discretion

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.650
and which is very outward.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.110
Fashions won't work out in countries, where they are

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.890
deeply rooted into traditions

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.310
and into proper understanding of life.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.530
Of course, the countries which have been very ancient,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.690
have been traditionally trying to improve themselves

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.810
with "error and trial" and "error and trial" methods,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.930
have developed much better discretion.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:11.630
Much better understanding. But the countries which are

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.630
not gone through all that ordeal, have not worked out,

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.470
have not gone through that discipline, lack in discretion.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.650
And that's why many of the people,

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:30.230
though they are of very deep seeking,

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.410
have gone astray.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.670
If they had discretion, they would not have gone astray,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.830
they would not have gone to wrong places, but the discretion

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.930
was missing.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.970
So it comes to the discretion, how to use

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.470
your Ida nadi and Pingala nadi.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.970
And discretion to understand what is good and what is bad.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.250
Now let us see the Ida nadi.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.190
Ida nadi is very important,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.210
because the discretion in this can only come

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.950
through traditional understanding.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:18.130
Ida Nadi starts from the Ganesha's point, Mooladhara.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.510
So first we miss the biggest support,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.550
the biggest help, the biggest nourishment

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.650
of holiness and auspiciousness at Mooladhara,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.590
if we have no discretion.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.570
We always take to thing, which is detrimental to our growth,

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.410
and also which may destroy us,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.210
not only us but the whole country.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.330
We like people who are destructive,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.330
when there is no discretion. Discretion means

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.630
that you must choose the things which are good for you,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.550
which are benevolent to you, which are good for the collective,

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.470
which are good for your ascent.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.250
On the contrary, the people who have no discretion

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:15.790
fall into the traps of wrong type of people, like Freud.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.230
I mean to an Indian, Freud... nobody can believe that

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.030
you can go into such a nonsensical idea.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.070
But people accepted Freud

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.670
more than they could accept Christ.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.470
Because the discretion was completely missing.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.410
If they had that traditional discretion in them,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.970
they would have been saved. This [type?] traditional discretion

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.270
is the thing that comes through Ida nadi.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.010
Now, that's what they people call it, as "conditioning".

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.470
And they say that, "Conditioning is very bad. And people

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.570
should not take to conditioning. And one should be free

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.470
from conditioning." Which is absolutely
a wrong idea.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:03.810
In that also, there has to be discretion.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.370
What conditioning is good and what is not good

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.610
has to be taken.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:16.850
Now, because there is no discretion about conditioning also,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.130
outright discarding all traditions, all that is

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:26.150
coming to us through our experiences of our forefathers,

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.950
everything is discarded. The history is discarded.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.910
And we say, "Oh, no, we are beyond it. We feel free."

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.370
Like I was surprised, yesterday in the plane
somebody told me,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.310
"I feel very free when I have no clothes upon myself."

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.290
I mean, if the clothes can imprison you,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.430
then what happens to the real prisons, what will they

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.550
be for you?

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.730
But that sort of a funny idea

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:03.090
comes into the head of people and they think that,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:08.310
"We can justify all this stupidity that we follow,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.050
because we lack discretion."

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.250
Intelligence cannot give you discretion.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.250
It cannot give you discretion as far as

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.970
the conditioning is concerned.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.170
For a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand,

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.390
how you develop your discretion.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.590
Yesterday only, I gave a very beautiful talk

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.990
to the ladies of Paris or, I should say, ladies of France,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.770
regarding the discretion of women.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.490
The discretion of the Ida nadi is intuition.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.610
If you develop that discretion within you

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.350
through your meditative powers,

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.350
you develop intuition.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.730
And intuition is nothing but is the help of the Ganas,

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.290
which are surrounding you.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.690
If you learn to take help from the Ganas,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.510
you can become very intuitive and

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.890
without much intelligence of yours, you can say the right thing.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.670
The whole of Sahaja yoga, I would say,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:31.070
fifty percent at least out of that, is based on intuition.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.750
For that, you have to develop a proper sense of Shri Ganesh.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:42.310
Shri Ganesh in it's right sense you have to understand.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.890
From there it starts, because he is Ganapati. He is the one,

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.750
who is the master, is the chief of all the Ganas.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.390
So the Ganas give you the intuition.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.570
For example,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.890
say, I have to go somewhere.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.810
And then I..., what I say is

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.970
that, "No, I won't be able to go there tomorrow."

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.150
And I won't go, somehow. And people think,

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:18.290
"Mother, how do You know?" I know,

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:22.350
because the Ganas are there, and what they say is the truth.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.930
They know all about it.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:30.590
Or anything I say about someone comes true.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.170
So they start asking me, "How is it Mother,

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.610
You have come to know about it?" I live
on intuition.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.430
Like I have to catch a plane, I know by intuition what's going

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.830
to happen. This part has to develop by worshiping Shri Ganesh.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.250
So imagine, Shri Ganesha also rules

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.650
a part of the Hamsa chakra.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.450
So when we say Ham and Sa, these two are

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:06.930
actually the bija mantras of the Agya.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.770
But when the Agya touches the Hamsa, it starts here.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.470
That's why at the base, at the root of it, is the Hamsa.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.130
And here the Ham, Ham means
"I am".

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.930
If you are discrete, you will not take to fashions.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:28.590
You'll not take to stupid ideas. You have your own personality.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.890
You are a Sahaja yogi. You don't listen to people,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.090
who are non-Sahaja yogis.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:40.170
That is the Ham part:

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.930
"I am". Not the ego part.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.630
But the Ham - to understand that, "I'm a Yogi

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.850
and I know so many things, which normally people don't know,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.910
and so I have nothing to do with them.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.590
I've not to take any lessons from them.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.670
They are not to teach me anything.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.750
There's nothing that they know, I know much more."

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.710
To be aware of your Self is Ham.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:19.150
So that comes from the right side, I would say.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.050
The discretion of right side is Ham

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.010
and the discretion of left side is Sa.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:31.230
Sa means "You", means:

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.330
"You are The One."

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.770
In your case you know, who is the "You".

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:45.230
But for every human being "You" is the Divine.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.010
"You are The One." This comes

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.490
from the left side - is Sa.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.210
So the word "Hamsa" is made of two types of discretion,

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.690
where to see "I am" and where to see "You are".

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.570
On these two balances - as they have shown here beautifully -

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.550
the Moon and the Sun.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.790
In the center is the cross,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.870
which gives you the balance, which gives you the dharma.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.070
How all these things are connected, one after another,

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.190
layers after layers; you can see how

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.010
dharma is connected with discretion.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.810
Now there are people who are

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.050
suddenly enticed by some sort of a ritual.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.330
For example I've seen some Sahaja yogis,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.830
they come to the Puja and they are giving bandhan to them, like mad.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.610
On the way, they'll go, they'll give bandhan. Anywhere they go,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.010
they'll give bandhan, like mad.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.550
That's just conditioning. That's not discretion,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.550
that's not Sahaja yoga.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.190
It is to be seen - "Is it to be given bandhan or not?"

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.550
In the presence of Mother there is bandhan,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.950
what is there to give bandhan to yourself?

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.970
The people, when I'm talking, are giving
bandhan,

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:19.690
raising their Kundalini. They're all mad people, I think.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.070
In the same way, there are people;

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.210
Yesterday I heard there's one kind of a music record,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.290
is played everywhere in the ashrams,

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.190
because they can all jump like on a camel.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:37.370
It's a music for the camels, you see.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.510
Now, this record everybody appreciates. Why?

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.810
Because they can jump like a camel.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:47.310
Once you start jumping like a camel, human beings can't give up.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.930
They form habits. So they like that particular music.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.070
They'll go on jumping like a camel, because now they have become

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.130
camels, they have to behave like camels. Now if there's something,

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.390
some music, which is like a horse,

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.970
like the trot maybe, maybe gallop, anything.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.130
Now, once they listen to it, suddenly they start following that

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.170
rhythm. Now they become the horse, which is galloping.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:18.090
Now the horse is galloping, they become

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.410
horses and they only like that galloping music.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:28.890
So on and so forth. Could be a donkey, could be anything.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:34.070
We are not animals, we are human beings and we are.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.330
Hum - "We are".

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.710
We are Sahaja yogis, we are not dominated by any

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.890
particular type of

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:52.650
rhythm or particular type of music.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.050
Every variety we can appreciate and understand,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.690
as long as it is dharmic.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.840
As long as it is balancing.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.310
As long as it is auspicious and holy.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:12.610
So you can see on the Hamsa how many things are judged.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.330
I think, the whole of Sahaja yoga stands

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.450
on the balance of Hamsa.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.850
There are people who are very

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:33.130
astute, means very honest.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.830
But this honesty can go into a ridiculous limit.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.430
Or else , there are people,

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.030
who are very hard working.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:51.410
This can also go to the ridiculous limit.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.830
So these qualities, which are supposed to be good,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.010
cannot be righteous.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.810
The righteousness is discretion.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.630
Glorified.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.730
If you have discretion,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.850
then you glorify

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:26.070
that discretion into righteousness.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:30.990
Like, we can say now, Christ. We can take Christ.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:36.590
Christ was such a discretion.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:43.330
When Mary Magdalene was stoned,

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.650
He had nothing to do with prostitutes, I mean,

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.970
it's nothing to do at all, no relationship.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.330
But He could see in discretion that these people had no business

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.890
to stone her. He stood up there,

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.330
in His own courage, and he said that,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.170
"Those who are not committed any sin can

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:07.110
throw the stone at [My/Me?]."

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.230
This is the power of His discretion,

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:15.470
that people just felt that discretion within themselves.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.230
And they felt that, "In discretion

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.530
this man is a holy man

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:26.310
and we cannot throw stones at Him".

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:29.450
If you are discrete as Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.790
you will make others discrete also.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:37.510
Others will have to be discrete and to understand.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:42.970
And this "Neera-Ksheera Vivek" is the differentiation

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.630
between the water [neera, ed.] and the milk [ksheera, ed.].

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.090
The bad and the good can come to you if you develop

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.250
that discretion part.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:01.390
In Sahaja yoga, at every stage, you'll find people falter,

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.810
also with the right side indiscretion.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.890
And the right side indiscretion comes from the ego

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.510
manifestation of people.

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.930
This ego is, as I said, is Ham.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.650
This ego doesn't work, when it has to work.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.970
For example, I find some people

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.650
went for a marriage in the church.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.710
Of course, that's wrong for Sahaja yogis. We don't believe in any

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:34.750
human religions, you know that. All right,

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.490
you went to the church, is all right.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.750
But they sent a lady to London

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.290
to buy "Laura Ashley" dresses.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:52.690
To buy. And I think, also, maybe, some men must be

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:58.070
wearing tailcoats to do the wedding.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.950
Where is that ego lost?

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:06.110
That ego that "you are the Sahaja yogi" was completely lost.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.190
I think, they all went for hairdressing,

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.190
all kinds of things they did, and they all wanted to go there

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.730
as old Christians,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.330
walking to the church next to the graves

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.550
of stupid bishops.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.990
It's not only here, India is much worse.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.170
As far as religion is concerned, the left side,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:37.230
they are very, very conditioned people, and there they

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.490
fail to understand, what is discretion.

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.410
For example, we had Gyanadeva. He was such a great

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.910
incarnation and He didn't even have shoes on His Feet!

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:55.810
And these days, they are taking out a big procession of palanquin,

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:00.550
so-called shoes in it - of Shri Gyanadeva -

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.430
and thousands and thousands of people singing praise.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.470
Just imagine.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:11.110
Who can tell them that, "Gyanadeva had no shoes!

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.650
What shoes are you carrying in the palanquin?"

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.150
And whatever village they go, or whatever city they go,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.110
they are fed with sumptuous food;

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.250
everybody falls at their feet, "The saints have come

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.930
with a palanquin - " ...and the shoes never belonged

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.230
to Gyanadeva in it! So this madness goes on.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.410
Now, you see all these things happening around you,

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.570
in every country, in every religion, in every

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.070
stupid area you see all this happening.

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.410
But you just join hands!

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.870
You become one with it!

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:01.330
And then it becomes so difficult

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.150
to understand, what has happened to you.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:10.930
Now, this Ego, when used properly,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.390
then it's discretion.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.990
Now also people have another very horrid, horrid conditioning,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.770
apart on the religion - is of the countries:

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.310
"I belong to India", "I belong to Germany",

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.490
"I belong to England." Everything is wretched.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.790
I mean, to say something like that means

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.790
you are not yet grown up to the Sahasrara land.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.370
Those who start becoming

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.590
some nationality

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.730
do not know that your nationality is transformed.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.430
Actually don't need any passports.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:03.150
In the area where the Divine reigns,

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.870
no passport is needed. It's written large on your faces.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.530
But still inside this deep conditioning is there

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:15.730
that, "I belong to this country, my country is
very great,

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.790
your country is not good."

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.110
But when it comes to discretion is to think

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.110
that, "All right, I was born in Germany

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:29.150
and Germany has made lots of mistakes.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:35.150
Let me work it out, so that I get back all my German people

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:40.450
into the area where resides peace, joy and happiness."

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:46.590
There is, this conditioning is used in discretion.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:53.690
In everything you will find there are two sides.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.250
Which way you move is your discretion.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:04.530
For example, there are people who have a conditioning

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:08.390
of a particular, say, a religion.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:13.650
Supposing they belong to the Jew religion,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.950
and have come to Sahaja yoga. Or they belong to Christianity

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.450
and have come to Sahaja yoga.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.030
So now, what is the discretion?

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.330
As soon as another Jew person comes, or a Christian person

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.390
comes in, they'll just get into a fraternity of bhoots there.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.110
And they all become great friends. Because "She's Jew, I'm Jew,

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:41.510
my father is Jew, my mother is Jew, my this thing...

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.930
Same with Christians, same with other communities,

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.870
same with any other nationality.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:54.090
Now, what is the discretion, when you see?

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.630
The best thing, discretion at that point, is to see,

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.130
what are the faults of these so-called "human religions",

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.410
which are formed after the death of

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.910
the promoters, or we can say the incarnations,

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.790
or the prophets who started them. This is first discretion.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:20.630
The second discretion is to read

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:27.610
those scriptures and find out, what is so special

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.950
that these incarnations have said. For I would say,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.610
if there is a Muslim, he should go to Koran and see,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:40.410
what's written in Koran as far as Sahaja yoga is concerned.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.430
If it's a Christian, let him go to the Bible and find out

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.710
whatever is written there as far as

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.790
Sahaja yoga is concerned, because Sahaja yoga is the Truth.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.490
And what Truth is written has to be found.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:01.170
If such a thing is developed, then you can go

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.650
further, if you are brave enough,

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.890
and can be courageous, to go and tell the people

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.010
that, "See, what is this nonsense you are following?

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.970
It's not written, it's not done.

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.230
Whatever is written, this is the essence of the whole thing."

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.490
That's the third stage, where you have to use your discretion

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:27.490
as far as a particular religion, nationality is concerned.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:31.870
Now when I am, say, in the

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:35.090
West, I have to discuss the West.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.130
When I am in India, you must hear Me!

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.090
You don't understand the language - this is good for you.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.250
You would lose all respect for Indians.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.750
I give them left and right!

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.470
And tell them what's wrong with them. But here

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.690
it is important that much is wrong

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.310
with us in the West.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.070
So the discretion is to see, what's gone wrong with us.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:07.130
Where are we wrong. Have you got any courage or not.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:13.210
For example, ladies don't have courage to wear a sari outside.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:17.130
Why? Sometimes - doesn't matter.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.630
When Indians can wear your dresses, you can wear saris also.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:25.010
Or a man won't wear Indian dresses outside.

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:28.230
Is a little Hum is needed.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:31.570
They enjoy it, but they won't wear.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:36.910
They'll wear the same funny holey pants.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.510
They can wear the punky stuff, but they can't wear

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.850
something that is sensible, is good to wear.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.690
It's something that must give you the

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:57.470
idea that we are different people.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.510
Now, this red mark is very important, because

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.450
then you don't catch any bhoots. And has to be worn.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.890
In the Bible is written that, "There will be a mark on their heads."

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:12.950
But because there are so many other stupid people like Hare Rama

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.290
Hare Krishna - I don't think they wear any marks -

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:19.970
we are frightened of the society how to wear a mark.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:25.090
But supposing they say that, "You go about with a dishevelled hair",

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.570
we'll do it. Because that's allowed in the society.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:32.110
We are the people, we are not to be afraid of any society.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.370
We have to come out of it, and we have to teach them.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.670
Whatever is good we are going to do, whether you like it or not.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:42.390
That's the sign of a saint. If you have seen any saint,

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:46.990
anywhere, they've gone all out

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.350
to say whatever is right and whatever is to be done

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:54.630
and whatever is to be followed. That's the sign of a saint.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:57.930
Otherwise, if a saint sometimes gets dissolved

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:01.810
in the society, sometimes in Sahaja yoga, sometimes here,

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.390
then what's the use of such saints? Tell me any saint,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.530
whom you know, who has not fought the society.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:12.710
Who has not pointed out the mistakes of the society,

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:18.130
in a very loud manner, without any fear.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.090
Have you known any saint like that? For Sahaja yogis

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.810
it is very important to have that courage within themselves.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:31.470
If you develop your discretion, then it works out.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:36.330
On the ego side, what kind of

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.590
a discretion you develop and how.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.990
On the right side are all the Devas, all the deities

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.970
sitting around you.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:51.130
You have to understand these deities.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.890
You have to know what They are going to do. Supposing, now

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.410
you are lost on the way.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.290
So, you should not think like all other people,

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.390
"Oh, I'm lost in the way, how will I go there,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.390
what will I do?" After all, you are going for some nonsensical work.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.510
Doesn't matter. You must think,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.770
"Why? Hanumana, He must have brought me here for some purpose,

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.370
let's be on the lookout." Accept it.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:25.130
Accept the situation.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.810
When you accept the situation, you are playing into the hands of the

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:32.290
deities and they are guiding you. Your deities are working it out.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:35.470
Accept it.

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:41.290
And this acceptance will give you

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:45.050
a wonderful discretion over to your ego.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:50.470
Whatever goes wrong - "It's all right, we accept it."

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.210
And above all - the vibrations part,

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.850
which you have to see. If you do something,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:05.010
if vibrations are going down,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:08.050
then of course, "I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.330
To me vibrations and my ascent

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.090
is the most important thing."

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.330
So to develop the discretion on the right hand side,

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.310
you have to know your goal, your destination.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.050
You must know on what path you are standing and where

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.110
you are brought, where are you today.

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:31.630
You are not like other people.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.990
If that kind of a discretion you develop

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:40.170
within yourself, through pure intelligence.

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.350
For that you need pure intelligence.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.910
And pure intelligence in a hamsa [swan, ed.] is that

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:53.170
it glides on the water.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.370
It shrugs [off] the water.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:00.570
It doesn't allow anything to overpower it.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:06.230
It's in the water, beautifully beautifying the lakes,

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:11.430
also not allowing the lake to

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.830
dissolve them, or to overpower them, or to cover them.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.650
This is the part where they are Ham.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.950
If they want, they can dive down. If they don't want,

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:29.350
they will not. They're gliding on the ocean.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.190
Ocean of the Samsara, of this Bhavasagara.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.290
And they are not going to be drowned into it. That is the

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:39.410
Ham part of it, which you should have, the discretion.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:43.330
On the one side, you should accept

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:47.290
things, when they come to you.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:52.290
The best among these was Shri Krishna,

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.350
I would say, who had real discretion.

00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:00.170
But, after all, He was Shri Krishna.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.950
But His methods were so interesting of discretion,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.650
that it's enjoyable to know about

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:14.270
how He destroyed so many rakshasas.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.890
Every time He did not use His Sudarshan chakra,

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.210
He used his discretion. Like there was a rakshasa,

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:27.350
who was trying to overpower the Pandavas,

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:32.750
who was trying to overpower the people, who were good.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.610
Shri Krishna

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.210
said, "Now, what to do with this horrible fellow?"

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.710
And this fellow had

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:48.230
boons from Brahmadeva and from Mahadeva and everyone.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.410
So Shri Krishna is the center, after all,

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.030
so He wanted to organize

00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.270
a proper destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.310
So what he did, that

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.550
there was a great right-sided saint

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:15.270
meditating, and he had taken a boon

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.390
that, "Nobody should disturb me.

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:21.870
At least the one who disturbs me for the first time,

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:26.830
I should have power to destroy, if I look at that person."

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:32.150
And this one was meditating in a cave.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.990
Shri Krishna very beautifully ran away

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.170
from the battlefield. His name is Ranchordas.

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:45.570
It's little... little bit derogatory [PEOPLE?] to say to somebody

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.770
that, "The one, who ran out of the battlefield."

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.810
So Shri Krishna ran out of the battlefield.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:57.110
But there was no other way out to kill this horrible fellow.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:02.170
And he went, and he was covering Himself with a shawl.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.210
He went into that cave and

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.850
covered that saint with His shawl.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.190
After Shri Krishna was running [away from] this horrible

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.090
rakshasa to kill him,

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.770
Shri Krishna went and hid Himself.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.250
When this rakshasa came near the cave,

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:29.330
he saw the shawl covering this saint.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.530
He said, "Oh, so now you are tired and sleeping here,

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.650
running away from the field! Get up now!"

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:41.310
As soon as he said this, this saint got up and looked at him.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:45.870
And he was completely burnt away.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.050
So, if Shri Krishna is the Virata at His Feet;

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:02.990
or if Shri Krishna is Vitthala on His head,

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:08.430
in between the two resides Hamsa chakra.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:16.210
The discretion is very beautifully described

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:20.150
in the life of Shri Krishna.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:24.010
We can call Him that he had a naughty way of

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:27.370
using his discretion.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:33.370
He has done so many things like that.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:38.010
But they create a drama. They create His Leela.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.170
Because He was Leela. That's why he could

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:45.970
use His discretion to create a drama or a play.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.470
So on one side we have the help of Shri Krishna

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:55.170
to give us the discretion, and on the other side we have Christ.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:58.330
In between is placed this Hamsa.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.290
So we have two great incarnations within us,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:07.570
who are the embodiment of discretion.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:11.650
So one side is Shri Krishna,

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.930
who is the one,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.770
who looks after the conditioning side of it.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.790
And on the other side is Christ, who starts

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.950
looking after the ego side of it.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.750
The One who says on the cross, "Oh, God, forgive them,

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.270
because they do not know. Oh, Father, forgive them,

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.670
for they do not know, what they are doing." Is the same One,

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:39.830
who takes a hunter in his hand and hits people, starts beating them,

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.570
because they are making money in the name of God.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:47.570
See the discretion. That's Jesus.

00:43:48.310 --> 00:43:53.090
Same Shri Krishna, who with his Sudarshan chakra

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:59.350
can kill thousands and thousands of rakshasas,

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.290
becomes the driver of Arjuna.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:09.250
The contrast of Their behavior

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:14.970
is the beautiful saga of Their discretion.

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.310
Now, for a Sahaja yogi it is important to understand

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:22.530
that they have to work out their discretion

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.670
in a manner that they develop their intuition.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:31.090
I would say the first thought could be the intuition,

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:36.690
could be the intuition. "Could be that this is intuition."

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.050
Try, experiment.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.810
But going to the extremes of everything is wrong in Sahaja yoga,

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:51.590
you have to do everything in moderation.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.730
Like, I told them to see everything through vibrations.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:01.250
So they will put their hands, I don't know, to everything.

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.370
"Should I buy this sari or not?"

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:10.770
Even go beyond that: "Should I buy this

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.950
face powder or not?"

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.590
It's so ridiculous.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.690
Is so bad, that ultimately you find you have become a bhoot

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.850
and you are telling everybody that your vibrations are bad.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.310
Because your vibrations are bad.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.790
Your attention is bad. Putting your attention

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.190
to nonsensical thing

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.830
makes your vibrations absolutely disappear.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.410
So, with discretion

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:52.130
you must have common sense.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.830
Practical sense.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.410
I've seen people suddenly talking to anybody

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.690
about Sahaja yoga. No, it's not practical.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.210
Sahaja yoga is a precious diamond, you cannot give it

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.390
to every person. I've seen people at the airport

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:17.870
raising Kundalini of everyone. No, it's not meant.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.830
They have to come to Sahaja yoga. They have to ask for it,

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:26.590
they have to beg for it, then only they can get their Realization.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:34.090
We don't want quantity, we want quality.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:40.590
All My lectures, if you see in that, I've been insisting

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.450
on the quality of Sahaja yogis

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:47.670
and the quality of the seekers.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.530
But when we start thinking of getting a majority

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.850
for a vote for Shri Mataji -

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:02.530
I have to say I'm not standing for any election.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:07.350
Whether you elect me or not, I'm elected.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:16.470
You don't have to do that. I don't need many people for that.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:21.570
And when you fail in discretion, you find

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.190
some problems develop.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:29.570
Now, it is for you to find out, what indiscrete things

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:33.070
you have done, where have you gone wrong,

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:37.070
in which way have you done a mistake.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.030
It is for you to find out, then rectify it.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.090
Otherwise in Sahaja yoga there should be no problems,

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.130
there should be no ordeals,

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:53.470
there should be all joy and joy and joy.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:56.690
But the discretion should be to find out,

00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:01.450
what are your weaknesses,

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:04.790
where have you done wrong, what's gone wrong,

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:10.570
where, in what part and how we have failed.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.050
Sometimes people think, "Oh, we did a lot at that time,

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:18.270
now we can't do it." Then you have failed.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:21.470
Like I heard that people are saying, "Now we have come here,

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.530
so we'll not go to Guru Puja." It's wrong.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:29.030
Very wrong. You have to come to Guru Puja, no question.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:34.830
Guru Puja is the one puja you cannot miss.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:38.750
Even if you miss Sahasrara is alright, but Guru Puja is

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.990
very important.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:49.070
At any cost you have to come for Guru Puja.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.530
I know I chose a place which is Andorra,

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.790
but it's not Himalayas!

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:04.830
Now the Sahaja yoga is so comfortable that we want

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:08.290
that there should be no change of flights.

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.690
Directly we'll sit on a hansa (swan, ed.) and we can [DO RIGHT?].

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:14.970
You will, you'll see that. But if you

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:19.690
develop a habit of thinking, "Oh, it would be difficult..."

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.890
then it will be.

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:26.630
But as Mother has said it, "It is going to be the easiest,

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:28.730
everything is going to work out."

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.090
Once you think like that, it will work out.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.570
Everything will work out, but first there shoul'd be

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.070
pure desire to do it.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:46.450
Whenever such ideas come into your head, again,

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.670
use your discretion.

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:56.270
We go to Guru Puja for our own health.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.530
Every Guru Puja, if you remember,

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.190
you have come up very much higher.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:07.310
Every Guru Puja has helped you.

00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:11.710
Of course you say that, "Maharastra tour, that's very good."

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.590
I agree, it is - Maharastra tour helps you a lot.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:19.270
But that's for thirty days, so intensive.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.350
Guru Puja is only one day.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:27.130
How many pujas you have in Maharashtra? At least eight to nine,

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:31.630
sometimes even ten. That's why.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:36.450
Naturally it has to be much more effective.

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.850
But Guru Puja itself is extremely effective.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:44.090
Indians have been asking Me, "Mother, once, at least once more,

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.710
give us the Guru Puja.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.190
We'll do anything to have Guru Puja,

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.630
please come." This time they wanted to have Guru Puja. Imagine!

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.110
You could not have attended Guru Puja in India.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:03.270
But Andorra, I have a special purpose.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.350
I have a special purpose. So please understand.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:12.470
I am not a purposeless personality.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.770
Gradually you'll learn how I fulfill the purpose.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:26.470
Yours, Mine and that of Sahaja yoga.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:31.370
Together. How I work it out beautifully

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:36.110
you will understand, and

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.090
I hope one day you also develop all those beautiful

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:43.070
ways and methods of discretion, by which

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:47.410
you just do the right thing and never the wrong thing!

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:54.830
Now, for the treatment of Hamsa chakra, which is

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:58.930
more on the physical side - it's outside, that's why it has to be

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:02.150
much more on the physical side also.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.890
So either we have used the ghee, and all that you know very well,

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.310
to put the Hamsa chakra alright.

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:15.130
Also, for Hamsa chakra it's important

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.590
not to kiss people.

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:21.970
I think kissing must be given up.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.110
Because with kissing you do allow

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.130
the germs of another person. In Sahaja yoga it's alright.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.370
But once I say that, that doesn't mean you go all crazy

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:35.490
with the kissing. No, not proper. If in India you go and kiss

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:40.230
somebody, he'll just be stunned. He'll not know, what is happening.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.850
The more you start expressing your love by all these gestures,

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:49.070
the less it is inside.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:54.690
The more you give expression, now for example,

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:59.410
there's a method of expressing "thank you."

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.110
And you go on saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you."

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.050
It's just a lip-service.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:09.970
But many people in many countries don't say "thank you" at all.

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:14.510
But they are very grateful, inside.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:19.450
The gratefulness inside creates the depth that is necessary.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:24.150
So to do it superficially, anything, too much,

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:27.690
has to be avoided in your discretion.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:37.030
But avoiding extremes,

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:43.450
avoiding too much outward expression,

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:47.490
again, can create another indiscretion like the English,

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:52.110
they don't speak, they just don't speak.

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.710
You travel with them every day for twenty-five miles,

00:53:56.910 --> 00:54:00.170
sitting together; they will not say who you are.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:02.570
They'll know each and everything about you,

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.990
but they'll just keep quiet.

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.910
They are not supposed to speak

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.730
- it's artificial. So the second point

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:17.450
we have to come to - we are not to be artificial.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:22.050
It's alright, if somebody feels like, just out of just spontaneity

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:26.970
wants to love me, and hug me, I don't mind.

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:30.110
Because it's not artificial, it just comes. Children are most

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:34.670
spontaneous, they not artificial.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:38.650
They are not at all artificial. In the same way we have to be

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:42.130
very natural about everything. It's alright,

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:45.910
while talking to each other, if the men hit the men a little bit,

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:49.790
doesn't matter. They have not insulted, it's a love,

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.790
expression of love, is alright. But should be spontaneous,

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.710
should not be artificial. We should not take to artificiality

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.990
in Sahaja yoga. At all, by any chance.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:03.790
But wearing clothes is not artificiality.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:08.270
To be decent is not artificiality.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:12.070
To be dignified is not artificiality.

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:15.870
Artificiality is that what you don't feel inside,

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.990
is to say out.

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:24.230
That is artificiality and for Sahaja yogi, he feels

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.470
he has that bashfulness, he has that shyness,

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:31.430
he has that protocol and he respects his body.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.550
Out of respect of the body he doesn't want to do something

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.750
that will insult his body.

00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:43.530
And that's how if you understand how far to go

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.850
and how far to stop.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:50.750
Then there is another way

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:54.430
of indiscretion in Sahaja yoga, which I have seen. Is that

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:59.570
people start using Me in many purposes, like that.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.630
Like supposing, now, somebody's writing a poem.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:07.810
So he'll come to Me, he'll say, "Please correct my poem."

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:11.950
I'll correct one poem, two poems, three poems, ten poems.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.370
Then he will lose the capacity to produce poems.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:20.310
You should not use Me

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:24.190
for your own purpose in that manner.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.710
But in any case you are using Me.

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:31.810
But with the understanding that, "Mother is all the time with me

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.290
and is helping me," there's no need

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.990
to come forward and jump on My time and to take My time

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.390
and to bother Me so that I should feel, "O God,

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:46.470
when will I get rid of this?" Or others have a thing, "Mother,

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:50.650
You must come to my house, You must take my child,

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.410
You must meet my husband, he might be a drunkard."

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:58.670
So taking attention to what you call "yours"

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.870
is also indiscretion.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.130
Instead of that, you put your attention to Me.

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:09.670
Instead of taking My attention to you.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.970
It's a very delicate line,

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.590
as if we are walking on a sword.

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:20.910
It's a very, very delicate line of discretion.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:24.950
But once you know

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.530
as a state within yourself, you are discrete.

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:32.270
You cannot be indiscrete even if you want to be.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:37.330
And that is what is the ascent part. So once

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:40.490
you come out of this chakra

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:45.270
and pass through your Agya, you enter into Sahasrara,

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.910
where you have to be discrete.

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.850
Whatever then comes out from there - blessed,

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:57.450
whatever expression comes out, blessed, from the Sahasrara,

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:01.630
is all discrete and beautiful.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.510
Some people have a habit of dominating Me also.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:09.350
Like I'm talking, they'll talk in between.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.310
I am saying something, they will come forward.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:18.210
Then I play tricks. I'm good at playing tricks.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.410
But I'm very discrete, it's alright. My discretion

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.070
plays the tricks. Because if I am direct, you won't like it.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.910
So better be discrete and play tricks.

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:35.590
In everything that we do, discretion expresses itself.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:39.610
And if you are a solid Sahaja yogi or a Sahaja yogini,

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:43.090
your discretion is evident and

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:47.250
everybody sees it and knows it, that it is there.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:52.030
So for all of you it is important to develop your discretion today,

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:58.330
and to ask me to reside in your Hamsa chakra,

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:02.250
so that you are all the time stationed

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:05.210
in the power of discretion.

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:09.010
With discretion we have evolved to human state.

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:14.350
And to go further, we have to develop our innate discretion,

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:18.610
which I think is the essence of all the religions,

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:22.530
of all the adventures we have had,

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:25.870
of all the lives which we have known,

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:29.730
is the discretion around which everything moves.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:33.330
May God bless you.
