WEBVTT

10:58.927 --> 11:01.857
Please be seated.

11:32.352 --> 11:37.865
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

11:41.062 --> 11:44.469
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

11:58.638 --> 12:10.326
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

12:10.527 --> 12:23.327
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

12:23.528 --> 12:34.231
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

12:34.432 --> 12:38.207
of the Mother and Christ.

12:53.622 --> 12:58.852
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

12:59.053 --> 13:05.418
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

13:12.030 --> 13:16.010
And when they could not explain it,

13:16.211 --> 13:23.970
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

13:33.935 --> 13:37.134
Even before Christ, they used to have

13:37.335 --> 13:41.718
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

13:41.919 --> 13:48.909
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

14:03.527 --> 14:10.670
to worship what they call Yahovah.

14:15.764 --> 14:22.658
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

14:29.507 --> 14:35.482
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

14:37.506 --> 14:42.235
She incarnated before also.

14:44.095 --> 14:48.853
She incarnated as Sita,

14:50.364 --> 14:56.352
and then She incarnated as Radha,

14:56.671 --> 15:01.979
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

15:03.429 --> 15:07.267
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

15:07.468 --> 15:12.593
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

15:20.927 --> 15:26.536
He was the son of Radha.

15:27.050 --> 15:32.820
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

15:35.130 --> 15:44.596
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

15:47.528 --> 15:52.079
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

15:52.280 --> 16:01.335
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

16:10.855 --> 16:14.983
All the description about Jesus Christ

16:15.184 --> 16:22.699
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

16:31.697 --> 16:39.213
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

16:39.414 --> 16:41.826
with immaculate conception,

16:42.035 --> 16:48.120
which She had done before also, as Radha.

17:03.943 --> 17:14.681
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

17:20.773 --> 17:27.738
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

17:36.836 --> 17:40.905
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

17:41.106 --> 17:47.018
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

17:55.463 --> 18:00.142
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

18:03.876 --> 18:15.971
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

18:22.456 --> 18:31.476
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

18:31.677 --> 18:36.501
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

18:36.702 --> 18:42.919
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

18:57.776 --> 19:05.269
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

19:12.286 --> 19:21.174
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

19:27.253 --> 19:34.648
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

19:38.229 --> 19:44.078
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

19:45.769 --> 19:50.378
because He is just vibrations.

19:53.193 --> 20:01.017
So when you do puja to Me,

20:01.218 --> 20:07.542
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

20:18.578 --> 20:22.134
If they had done puja to Christ -

20:22.335 --> 20:30.048
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

20:36.668 --> 20:44.460
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

20:44.661 --> 20:53.884
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

21:03.443 --> 21:09.605
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

21:16.089 --> 21:24.835
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

21:33.292 --> 21:38.254
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

21:42.515 --> 21:47.968
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

21:48.169 --> 21:53.420
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

21:57.697 --> 22:01.199
which is the swayambhu,

22:02.051 --> 22:05.855
is created by the Mother Earth.

22:06.879 --> 22:13.315
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

22:18.999 --> 22:26.211
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

22:34.507 --> 22:43.076
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

22:48.172 --> 22:53.699
So I went to see that place

22:53.900 --> 23:01.476
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

23:01.677 --> 23:06.173
about say, five inches, at the most.

23:12.956 --> 23:17.136
And the face was just like Mine,

23:18.834 --> 23:22.244
exactly like Mine.

23:22.445 --> 23:29.474
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

23:29.675 --> 23:38.263
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

23:50.230 --> 23:52.804
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

23:53.005 --> 23:58.784
and they started following under a rock,

24:03.592 --> 24:10.295
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

24:14.478 --> 24:16.324
And in that light they walked,

24:16.525 --> 24:19.710
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

24:19.911 --> 24:25.884
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

24:38.395 --> 24:44.793
So they worship that statue in that place.

24:48.435 --> 24:54.438
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

24:58.579 --> 25:02.397
as I give you vibrations,

25:02.598 --> 25:05.990
but not so much

25:06.403 --> 25:09.558
as I give you.

25:10.233 --> 25:13.776
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

25:13.977 --> 25:17.916
who might be giving you vibrations.

25:21.382 --> 25:25.550
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

25:25.751 --> 25:29.307
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

25:29.508 --> 25:33.955
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

25:44.269 --> 25:47.464
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

25:47.665 --> 25:52.342
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

26:00.353 --> 26:07.453
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

26:13.790 --> 26:18.520
and there are many sweet water wells there.

26:20.985 --> 26:24.255
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

26:24.456 --> 26:28.030
many people took photograph.

26:31.869 --> 26:38.096
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

26:40.249 --> 26:45.457
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

26:45.658 --> 26:55.450
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

26:55.672 --> 27:01.254
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

27:14.686 --> 27:19.703
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

27:19.904 --> 27:24.868
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

27:34.302 --> 27:37.755
Same is the puja.

27:38.096 --> 27:45.453
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

27:48.661 --> 27:56.863
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

28:03.512 --> 28:10.249
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

28:18.307 --> 28:20.841
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

28:21.042 --> 28:29.950
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

28:37.391 --> 28:45.786
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

28:49.686 --> 28:53.445
what powers He gives you.

28:54.044 --> 28:56.261
When you praise those qualities,

28:56.462 --> 29:03.338
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

29:14.048 --> 29:17.805
This is how the Divine works,

29:19.588 --> 29:24.670
as if you get charged with those qualities.

29:28.677 --> 29:34.981
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

29:38.845 --> 29:46.485
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

29:51.455 --> 29:55.279
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

29:55.480 --> 30:00.578
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

30:05.627 --> 30:08.292
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

30:08.492 --> 30:11.851
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

30:12.052 --> 30:16.422
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

30:30.093 --> 30:37.445
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

30:48.030 --> 30:51.736
It could not happen earlier,

30:53.644 --> 31:01.478
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

31:07.583 --> 31:13.435
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

31:13.636 --> 31:16.597
that I look like you, I behave like you,

31:16.798 --> 31:18.684
I have made Myself exactly like you -

31:18.885 --> 31:23.001
very difficult to make, but I have.

31:44.351 --> 31:48.361
And this body has to bear lots of things

31:48.562 --> 31:58.299
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

32:09.076 --> 32:12.425
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

32:12.626 --> 32:16.404
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

32:16.605 --> 32:20.641
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

32:20.842 --> 32:26.169
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

32:26.370 --> 32:29.809
and moving very fast.

32:42.524 --> 32:46.658
Now I have to bear it.

32:46.859 --> 32:51.968
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

32:58.754 --> 33:04.593
Because He is very direct,

33:06.921 --> 33:13.490
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

33:20.652 --> 33:25.843
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

33:26.044 --> 33:34.098
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

33:48.315 --> 33:52.613
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

33:52.822 --> 33:57.320
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

33:57.536 --> 34:01.971
so I take time to take them out.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.067
So all these things are very symbolic,

34:20.268 --> 34:25.280
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

34:30.858 --> 34:36.291
And that symbol actually acts.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.567
For example if you give somebody a flower,

34:42.768 --> 34:47.574
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

34:47.775 --> 34:52.228
and gratitude comes in.

35:00.609 --> 35:06.047
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

35:06.248 --> 35:14.540
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

35:26.945 --> 35:31.425
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

35:31.626 --> 35:34.638
and of their blessings on you.

35:34.839 --> 35:39.645
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

35:48.439 --> 35:52.476
That is how the Divine acts.

35:55.703 --> 36:04.536
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.884
Now we are doing puja at this time,

36:12.085 --> 36:16.164
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

36:16.365 --> 36:23.708
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

36:38.362 --> 36:42.210
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

36:42.411 --> 36:45.105
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

36:45.306 --> 36:50.378
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

36:50.579 --> 36:53.588
Now they are getting the same blessings,

36:53.789 --> 36:55.535
though you are doing the puja

36:55.736 --> 37:00.515
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

37:18.388 --> 37:26.376
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

37:26.577 --> 37:29.960
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

37:30.161 --> 37:34.484
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

37:34.685 --> 37:39.629
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

37:58.478 --> 38:01.921
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

38:02.122 --> 38:07.714
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

38:16.677 --> 38:19.916
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

38:20.117 --> 38:25.630
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

38:37.106 --> 38:44.578
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

38:50.536 --> 38:54.867
So you should be very relaxed about it.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.921
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

39:02.954 --> 39:05.997
May God bless you all.

39:10.239 --> 39:14.330
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

39:14.531 --> 39:17.456
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

39:17.657 --> 39:20.901
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

39:21.102 --> 39:23.034
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

39:23.235 --> 39:26.623
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

39:27.992 --> 39:31.906
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.942
The children have to wash the Feet

39:37.143 --> 39:41.660
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.

39:41.861 --> 39:44.123
Yogi: Yes. In Spanish, Mother?
Shri Mataji: In Spanish.

39:44.324 --> 39:47.461
Yogi Yes.
Yogi 2: OK. Pujari?

39:47.662 --> 39:50.430
Shri Mataji: Now see the description
of Shri Ganesha

39:50.630 --> 39:53.305
which was written thousands of years back.

39:53.506 --> 39:58.563
It’s translated and exactly the same
of that of Christ.

39:58.764 --> 40:05.852
We have little added to it about Christ
in the end, but it’s the same.

40:18.154 --> 40:22.031
First the boys must wash and the girls
must paint.

40:22.232 --> 40:25.190
Yogi: OK.

40:27.607 --> 40:30.683
Shri Mataji: So she – they are unmarried
girls.

40:30.884 --> 40:37.531
Unmarried women and unmarried girls
should do it, paint.

40:37.732 --> 40:41.366
First let them wash. First let the boys
wash –

40:41.567 --> 40:44.434
just tell, first let the boys wash,

40:44.635 --> 40:50.249
and then the unmarried women, unmarried
girls should paint,

40:50.450 --> 40:53.311
and then the married women should give
the ornaments.

40:53.512 --> 40:55.422
Now, can you bring it from the… Warren:
She is going to help with the washing,

40:55.622 --> 40:57.770
for children to wash.
Shri Mataji: All right.

40:57.971 --> 41:01.912
So now, can you get the ornaments also?

41:21.338 --> 41:25.708
So first of all you get the water together,

41:25.908 --> 41:29.914
now this one [container of water from Feet]
is to be brought here.

41:34.438 --> 41:37.986
Yes. Can I have this kumkum?

41:38.187 --> 41:42.124
Swastika should be made on that. Swastika
should be made.

41:42.325 --> 41:46.258
Then other things also, My necklaces-
and all that.

41:46.459 --> 41:51.559
No, no, the bangles are – and necklaces
I gave you

41:58.036 --> 42:00.605
Yes.

42:08.759 --> 42:13.909
Just correct, correct, correct. It’s
the other way round it is. Yes.

42:14.110 --> 42:17.475
No, it’s not that.

42:20.678 --> 42:24.914
Once this is made, just take it to go
through.

42:29.056 --> 42:33.296
Yogini: Excuse me.
Shri Mataji: You take a cloth.

42:36.660 --> 42:40.509
And bangles are there?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

42:40.710 --> 42:44.817
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, it goes like that.

42:47.980 --> 42:51.681
Just if you can wipe it, it’s all right.

42:52.922 --> 42:57.289
You can just yes, wipe it, I’ll tell you.

43:11.894 --> 43:14.466
All right.

43:30.074 --> 43:36.498
This was the correct swastika. And
the other way is the Hitler’s swastika.

43:36.699 --> 43:40.157
Can I have the towel? I’ll have the towel.

43:40.358 --> 43:43.137
[Warren: “Yes”.
Yogi: “It’s the same, Mother”

43:43.338 --> 43:49.140
Warren (aside): “Did she respect the form?”.
Yogi: “It is the same”.]

43:49.418 --> 43:50.876
You may keep it in a plate.

43:51.085 --> 43:55.775
Warren: Yes, I’m just going to get it,
Mother, I’ll get another plate.

43:55.976 --> 43:58.655
Shri Mataji: And the bangles?
Warren: Yes.

43:58.856 --> 44:03.279
Shri Mataji: Just give Me that, Albert.

44:07.936 --> 44:11.315
What is it, are you giving these bangles?
Warren: Done the same that the…

44:11.516 --> 44:14.362
Shri Mataji: What’s it?
Warren: Yes, done the same

44:14.563 --> 44:17.527
that the swastika is the same, is the one
that was used by Hitler,

44:17.738 --> 44:20.150
he just turned it on the side.
Shri Mataji: No, no.

44:20.351 --> 44:24.487
You see, what happened in the beginning
he was using the other way round.

44:24.688 --> 44:27.841
Then what happened, they used – that’s
your Mother’s trick –

44:28.042 --> 44:30.772
they used the stencil in the other way
round,

44:30.973 --> 44:36.833
so the thing, swastika, turned round and
they lost. You don’t know this?

44:37.034 --> 44:41.718
To begin with, they started an upside-down
thing, you see, the other one,

44:41.919 --> 44:45.279
to begin with. They started using the other
way.

44:45.480 --> 44:49.506
But then the stencil was used in the other
way round. You see?

44:49.707 --> 44:54.702
You know, the whole thing turned and
they kept to this.

44:54.903 --> 44:59.797
That’s how they lost. You don’t know this?

44:59.998 --> 45:05.537
Yogi: No. Shri Mataji: Just tell her, this
is the trick I’ve played.

45:05.743 --> 45:08.349
[Yogi: “They’d made the stencil the wrong
way”]

45:08.550 --> 45:11.632
You see, the other way, they used
the stencil.

45:11.833 --> 45:13.011
[Yogi: “Yes. And so it came out this way”]

45:13.212 --> 45:16.021
You see, first they started using
the stencil on one side,

45:16.222 --> 45:21.113
and then they started using it the other
side, and that’s how they lost.

45:21.325 --> 45:24.322
Yogi: And it came out this way.
Shri Mataji: No,no, if you make a stencil

45:24.523 --> 45:29.811
like this, you see, first the other way
round it was, you see,

45:30.012 --> 45:33.435
and then if you turn it the other way
round, then you come this way,

45:33.636 --> 45:35.645
it came this way. Yogi: Yes. It was on
the flags at the start this way, Mother.

45:35.846 --> 45:38.034
Shri Mataji: No, this is the second
swastika.

45:38.235 --> 45:43.365
The first swastika was the other way round.

45:44.461 --> 45:47.219
That’s how they got it.

45:48.847 --> 45:52.437
They used the stencils, you see, to make
the swastika first.

45:52.638 --> 45:54.409
So first one was the other way round.

45:54.610 --> 45:58.944
But then the stencils were spoiled or maybe
whatever it is, so they turned it round.

45:59.145 --> 46:04.465
When they turned it round this swastika
started coming, they didn’t know.

46:08.494 --> 46:13.778
One stands for destruction, another stands
for construction.

46:14.549 --> 46:18.660
Explain to them, so they’ll understand.
All right.

46:38.224 --> 46:40.708
You follow the point?
[Yogi: “Yes, Shri Mataji”]

46:40.909 --> 46:44.393
That’s how they lost.

47:07.246 --> 47:12.371
They took their advice to begin with from
the lamas,

47:12.572 --> 47:16.455
and lamas told them to use the swastika
the other way round.

47:16.656 --> 47:21.596
But then the mistake was that they drew
for them,

47:21.797 --> 47:25.599
and then they turned the stencil, they
didn’t realize

47:25.800 --> 47:30.861
that they have turned the stencil, so it is
coming the other way round.

47:32.910 --> 47:35.587
They were their gurus.

47:44.738 --> 47:48.452
So it’s all right, doesn’t matter, as long
as we know how to do it, that’s all.

47:48.653 --> 47:51.904
Nothing to worry.

47:56.571 --> 47:59.643
Yogi: It’s time to wash Your feet now,
Mother?

47:59.844 --> 48:04.117
Shri Mataji: Now you have to wash My feet,
the children have to.

48:05.601 --> 48:08.931
(Aside to a Sahaja Yogini: “Be careful”).

48:28.937 --> 48:32.806
Just to pour water, that’s all.

48:35.941 --> 48:37.915
Next time also remember

48:38.116 --> 48:43.363
we’ll have to give them the pots for this,
for washing My Feet, all right?

48:43.564 --> 48:50.082
For them. Warren? They haven’t got them.
Yogi: Yes, Mother, I’ve noted that.

48:51.837 --> 48:55.946
Shri Mataji: Rub it with both the hands.

48:57.193 --> 49:01.026
All right, this and this. Yes.

49:04.197 --> 49:08.825
Two persons can do at a time, two of you
would be [better].

49:09.405 --> 49:12.001
Will be better. Two, two, ha. Now you
two do it.

49:12.202 --> 49:17.090
With both the hands. With both the hands.

49:17.291 --> 49:21.043
Tell them to do it with both the hands.

49:24.187 --> 49:27.335
Use this hand also.

49:27.987 --> 49:32.387
[A yogi starts talking in Spanish about
the qualities of Shri Ganesha]

49:40.803 --> 49:45.646
Shri Mataji: Loudly, I should hear.

49:59.759 --> 50:02.724
Shri Mataji: Let Javier otherwise read it.
If he wants.

50:02.925 --> 50:05.711
Javier, you can read it. His voice is
not too low.

50:05.912 --> 50:09.843
All right so? Everybody should hear what
he is saying.

50:10.044 --> 50:12.863
Or read it…

50:15.150 --> 50:17.830
(To the children) Yes, good now, you do it.
Now.

50:18.031 --> 50:21.317
Let them, both of them.

50:37.823 --> 50:40.488
Good.

50:44.671 --> 50:49.412
All right, good. Let them do it.

52:05.871 --> 52:08.101
Yes, yes.

52:08.304 --> 52:13.454
Give Me a towel, towel. Towel.

52:30.586 --> 52:34.603
Wipe it. Yes, you do it.

52:39.929 --> 52:43.439
Yes. With force.

54:35.808 --> 54:41.619
Javier (In Spanish from the prayer):
Tu eres Brahman, Vishnu, Rudra…

54:41.820 --> 54:45.800
Shri Mataji: The essence. Essence
of Brahma, Vishnu –

54:46.001 --> 54:52.054
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Rudra is,
is Shri Ganesha.

54:52.255 --> 54:55.890
The essence, the power. Is Christ.

54:57.652 --> 55:03.834
Essence. Jesus.

55:05.522 --> 55:08.923
Javier (In Spanish from the prayer):
… Tu eres Indra, Agni…

55:09.124 --> 55:17.546
Shri Mataji: Indra is the God of… the king
of the Gods, all the Gods.

55:19.810 --> 55:23.351
Agni is fire.

55:25.066 --> 55:28.634
Javier: … Vayu… Shri Mataji: Vayu is air.
All the five elements,

55:28.835 --> 55:32.138
this means all the five elements.

55:33.527 --> 55:38.611
Vayu means air, but with the Agni, Vayu…

55:38.818 --> 55:45.361
Javier: Indra, Vayu… Tu eres el sol,
the sun and the moon.

56:29.559 --> 56:36.339
Shri Mataji: One minute. You come along –
those who are not yet married ladies.

56:39.173 --> 56:42.601
And the boys can go back.

56:56.672 --> 57:01.206
Come. All unmarried?

57:12.380 --> 57:15.313
Put a little water. All right.

57:17.592 --> 57:20.579
More water,

57:46.212 --> 57:50.561
little more water. Little.

01:00:51.224 --> 01:00:54.066
You take out the…

01:02:36.605 --> 01:02:39.684
Be careful.

01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:11.815
May God bless you.

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:16.304
Now. If we start the… [Yogi: “108 names
of the Devi?”] –

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:22.738
Eh? We can just start the Devi stotra

01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:25.777
is all right, because they have started
with the Devi.

01:03:25.978 --> 01:03:28.804
Yogi: The 108 names or…

01:03:40.765 --> 01:03:44.213
Shri Mataji: This side also. Here.

01:03:55.657 --> 01:04:01.398
Only now - married women have to come
after this.

01:04:10.673 --> 01:04:19.276
Just you say one name, you say: “Shri
Mata”, then you say the translation.

01:04:32.629 --> 01:04:33.997
Now you must verify,

01:04:34.198 --> 01:04:37.844
you see, these are the qualities they are
describing of your Mother.

01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:43.229
Now you try to, try to verify it also.

01:04:45.073 --> 01:04:50.196
And these names were written also thousands
of years back.

01:04:55.235 --> 01:05:01.436
These are thousand names, we have chosen
only 108.

01:11:34.417 --> 01:11:38.841
Again, again.

01:12:06.899 --> 01:12:10.562
Yogi: Nishkàla. Javier: (translates into
Spanish) Indivisible, completa.

01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:14.582
Shri Mataji: Nìsh-kalà (She corrects
the accents). Yogi: Nìsh-kalà.

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:28.806
Shri Mataji: (To one of the ladies)
Complete.

01:12:33.965 --> 01:12:39.375
Full. Complete toe.

01:13:36.595 --> 01:13:42.953
Now. The married ladies now.

01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:49.788
Now the married ladies come in – then you
can start it.

01:14:30.886 --> 01:14:35.070
Bangles, did you take bangles?

01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:06.429
There are no bangles as such. Sorry.
It’s all right.

01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:32.051
Doesn’t matter. Good. All right. Give it
away.

01:16:16.077 --> 01:16:19.497
Yes, yes, now. Yes, yes. Yes. Good.

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:37.462
Yogi: Nirmama.
Javier: No es egoista.

01:16:37.663 --> 01:16:44.800
Shri Mataji: Nirdwanda. Nirdwanda.
Yogi: Nirdwanda.

01:18:08.027 --> 01:18:10.608
Shri Mataji: Mirror you [can have]. Mirror.

01:18:10.809 --> 01:18:14.070
Mirror you can have.

01:18:27.293 --> 01:18:30.293
Family.
[Yogini: “Yes”]

01:19:17.618 --> 01:19:21.125
(To the young boy bringing the Mangala
Sutra) Hold it.

01:19:24.933 --> 01:19:28.746
He’s very nice. It’s correct, now, it’s
correct, that’s right.

01:19:28.947 --> 01:19:33.924
Should be in this way.

01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:39.245
Thank you.

01:20:18.935 --> 01:20:23.055
(Aside to the lady who is putting the
anklet) Other way round, other way.

01:21:51.812 --> 01:21:56.694
Warren? They are missing here all
the (toe rings)

01:21:58.555 --> 01:22:04.196
for other toes. All they were there
in France.

01:22:04.397 --> 01:22:06.955
Warren: They were in France, Mother, but
they went back to London…

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:10.155
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. It’s all right,
let’s see.

01:22:10.356 --> 01:22:14.055
We’ll have to get separate ones for them.
For every…

01:22:14.256 --> 01:22:16.930
(Warren: “For some reason they held them
separately in the…”)

01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:20.544
All right, then it’s all right.

01:22:23.846 --> 01:22:27.084
Yes. You’ll give it. That’s right.

01:23:06.373 --> 01:23:12.639
Yogi: The sari. Javier: Sari.
Yogini: Sari… Yogi: I gave it.

01:23:21.358 --> 01:23:25.106
Shri Mataji: Just keep it. Just keep it.

01:23:32.886 --> 01:23:35.825
Towel.

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:52.539
Now. I’ll take water. Water to drink.
Water.

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:14.260
That’s all. That’s all.

01:25:00.851 --> 01:25:04.807
Hold it. Hold it.

01:25:20.095 --> 01:25:25.304
Honey. Now honey.

01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:21.158
It’s all right.

01:28:46.815 --> 01:28:52.572
Sugar, sugar.

01:28:54.759 --> 01:28:58.133
Sugar.

01:29:18.641 --> 01:29:21.404
Water.

01:29:36.382 --> 01:29:40.074
Sugar, sugar.

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:43.578
Sugar, sugar.

01:30:00.106 --> 01:30:03.202
Water, water.

01:30:17.489 --> 01:30:22.094
Saffron, saffron is there.

01:30:48.745 --> 01:30:52.016
Some water.

01:31:47.618 --> 01:31:51.205
Now. Clean one…

01:32:17.267 --> 01:32:21.092
Scent. Scent.

01:32:43.832 --> 01:32:47.215
Scent. On the swastikas.

01:33:45.684 --> 01:33:48.511
Yes, yes. Attar.

01:33:55.972 --> 01:33:57.466
They’ll have… good.

01:33:57.667 --> 01:34:05.016
(To a girl) Please put it to all of them
like this. Yes.

01:34:20.179 --> 01:34:21.610
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: On the wrist.

01:34:21.811 --> 01:34:23.444
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:34:23.645 --> 01:34:26.852
Girl: All the women?
Shri Mataji: To all of them.

01:34:30.769 --> 01:34:32.787
I told her to put to all of them
the Chandan gandha.

01:34:32.988 --> 01:34:35.687
Did she understand that?
[Yogi: “Yes”]

01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:43.679
Now. Ah, with flowers.

01:35:08.938 --> 01:35:13.083
Sari, sari. So…

01:35:23.032 --> 01:35:26.025
Warren? Warren?

01:35:26.226 --> 01:35:28.952
There’s no blouse with it?

01:35:29.153 --> 01:35:33.033
Half, half, put it half way.

01:35:33.257 --> 01:35:36.704
[Yogi: “There is a blouse”]
There’s a blouse, where is it?

01:35:54.914 --> 01:35:59.600
Maricruz, Maricruz.

01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:27.693
There, good… Leave it there. Yes, good,
leave it there. Tell her to leave it.

01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:44.588
Now. Every lady has to take a fruit and
the rice - hello?

01:36:44.789 --> 01:36:49.504
Every lady has to take a fruit in the hand,
and -

01:36:49.809 --> 01:36:54.604
a fruit in the hand and some rice and put
it here.

01:36:54.805 --> 01:36:59.204
See, I’ll take it a little. Where is
the cloth?

01:36:59.907 --> 01:37:03.867
There’s a cloth there. That’s it.

01:37:11.021 --> 01:37:15.311
Now you tell them. To catch one fruit
in the hand.

01:37:15.512 --> 01:37:18.655
Yogi: Before the sari, Mother?
Shri Mataji: No, sari is all right.

01:37:18.856 --> 01:37:23.527
Keep it like that. Now fruit is there.
Now, take the fruit.

01:37:23.728 --> 01:37:28.339
You see, will be confusion, that’s why
to say one by one.

01:37:29.168 --> 01:37:32.422
Keep it. Keep it.
[Yogi: “After the sari”]

01:37:33.244 --> 01:37:36.641
See, take the akshata (rice).

01:37:46.702 --> 01:37:52.263
Yes. Now you hold it. You hold the sari.
Hold it.

01:37:56.419 --> 01:37:59.930
Like that. Yes. Yes, take one side.

01:38:58.596 --> 01:39:02.605
Yes, she has all…

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.220
All right, now.

01:39:15.135 --> 01:39:22.527
If this you can remove, then we can go
ahead, well, with flowers.

01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:26.861
Just remove these, one by one.

01:39:27.067 --> 01:39:31.898
It’s dangerous. Just remove those
(candles)…

01:39:59.951 --> 01:40:03.108
You better have the sari now.

01:40:03.309 --> 01:40:06.699
But they have got something for the hands?

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:12.077
Flowers for the hands, they have any?

01:40:12.278 --> 01:40:14.892
No? Just flowers, ask them,

01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:19.808
otherwise they might be disappointed,
if they have made.

01:40:25.016 --> 01:40:27.302
Garland?
[Yogi: “There is a big garland”]

01:40:27.503 --> 01:40:30.925
All right. Now. You put this.

01:40:33.993 --> 01:40:37.368
The other way round. Yes.

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:14.889
Put the flowers around… And some garland.

01:41:35.511 --> 01:41:41.294
Yes. Exactly, when you have finished.

01:41:43.671 --> 01:41:47.316
Yes. Now the garland has to be put.
Oh, you got that?

01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:51.937
Yes, that’s what I’ve asked. That’s
beautiful.

01:41:52.138 --> 01:41:58.849
So I’ll wear the garland first and then
the… All right.

01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:04.071
(The crown) tie it up more.

01:43:08.918 --> 01:43:13.532
Tighter, still. Now, still tighter.

01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:31.908
Should be tighter as it is. It’s all right?

01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:35.538
Now I’ll have.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:57.600
Some photographs, if some people want
to take?

01:44:00.247 --> 01:44:04.726
Cloth there, in the corner.

01:44:29.126 --> 01:44:32.174
Make it neat, so the whole thing comes out,

01:44:32.375 --> 01:44:35.123
and now you can put the lights and
everything,

01:44:35.324 --> 01:44:38.132
so you get a full picture of the puja –

01:44:38.333 --> 01:44:42.930
remove that towel and make…

01:48:43.254 --> 01:48:45.507
Shri Mataji: Now, can you little bit do
it neat

01:48:45.708 --> 01:48:48.898
and then we’ll have the Aarti.

01:48:54.948 --> 01:48:58.479
What is there?
[Prasad is offered to Shri Mataji]

01:50:12.076 --> 01:50:15.512
Sahaja Yogi 1: Thank you, Shri Mataji.
Sahaja Yogi 2: Aarti.

01:58:19.197 --> 01:58:24.118
Yogi: Bolo Shri Bhagavati Mataji

01:58:24.319 --> 01:58:30.680
Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

01:59:00.198 --> 01:59:04.128
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
May God bless you all.

01:59:04.329 --> 01:59:07.417
May God bless you all.

01:59:08.982 --> 01:59:11.700
May God bless you.

01:59:12.941 --> 01:59:17.628
It’s very good, everybody has very good
Kundalini.

01:59:17.851 --> 01:59:20.741
May God bless you.

01:59:26.828 --> 01:59:29.759
That’s good.

01:59:55.223 --> 01:59:58.326
May God bless you.

02:00:02.478 --> 02:00:08.363
Except for Vishuddhi, all other chakras are
all right –

02:00:10.552 --> 02:00:12.402
for which you have to say Allah Hu Akbar.

02:00:12.603 --> 02:00:17.165
Say it now, sixteen times.
Yogi: Sixteen times.

02:00:18.977 --> 02:00:22.988
Warren: We should stand. Shri Mataji:
Sixteen times, to open the Vishuddhi.

02:01:25.574 --> 02:01:28.948
All right.

02:01:42.813 --> 02:01:45.322
Good.

02:01:47.017 --> 02:01:51.244
Give yourselves a bandhan. One.

02:01:51.466 --> 02:01:54.048
Slowly.

02:01:55.746 --> 02:01:58.179
Two.

02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:02.870
Three.

02:02:03.214 --> 02:02:06.050
Four.

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:09.523
Five.

02:02:09.737 --> 02:02:13.689
Six. And seven.

02:02:13.890 --> 02:02:17.103
Now raise your Kundalini.

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:24.586
Tie it up. One. Again.

02:02:26.417 --> 02:02:31.114
Tie it up. Again.

02:02:31.315 --> 02:02:36.586
Now tie it up three times. Fix it up on top
of your heads.

02:02:36.786 --> 02:02:43.627
One – two – three.

02:02:43.828 --> 02:02:48.401
Very clear, today it’s very clear.

02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:51.312
Ah!

02:02:52.595 --> 02:02:55.453
Can you see?

02:02:57.464 --> 02:03:00.170
Feeling?

02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:06.488
All right. May God bless you.

02:03:16.111 --> 02:03:20.074
Warren, I can wash My Feet in the room
or not?

02:03:24.509 --> 02:03:28.542
You have to take out these things here.
(Warren: “The ladies”.)

02:03:30.125 --> 02:03:34.031
Or we can go in the room and take it out.

02:03:34.232 --> 02:03:38.646
It’s all right. (Yogi: “All right”)
… Yes.

02:03:48.567 --> 02:03:51.318
Warren: It’s vibrations on the gold.

02:03:51.519 --> 02:03:54.503
Shri Mataji: Ah!

02:03:55.675 --> 02:03:59.831
This was - are they given by the English,
I think.

02:04:00.032 --> 02:04:03.253
All right, yes. [Warren: “Yes”]

02:04:14.898 --> 02:04:17.929
Take it closer first, then it will become
good.

02:04:18.130 --> 02:04:21.962
Bring it closer (not clearly audible)…
Warren: Take it closer.

02:04:28.643 --> 02:04:32.028
Other Sahaja Yogi: Mother, we have some
presents.

02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:35.816
Shri Mataji: Presents? Oh, have you?
Sahaja Yogi: Can I bring?

02:04:36.017 --> 02:04:38.990
Shri Mataji: All right.

02:04:41.424 --> 02:04:45.496
But not too many, you have given Me
those presents today.

02:05:03.097 --> 02:05:07.471
Warren? This also goes... now, thank you.

02:05:09.054 --> 02:05:12.335
While this is, this one is Mine, and this
one is –

02:05:12.536 --> 02:05:17.124
or you can keep it in your bag (necklace).

02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:25.671
[Yogi: “Can I help, Mother?”]

02:06:03.605 --> 02:06:06.456
This one also (bracelet).

02:06:22.777 --> 02:06:28.487
It’s all right. Please, be seated.

02:06:32.571 --> 02:06:34.620
Yogi: This is the collective present from
Spanish people, Shri Mataji.

02:06:34.821 --> 02:06:36.031
Shri Mataji: From where?
Sahaja Yogi: Collective present.

02:06:36.231 --> 02:06:38.488
Shri Mataji From Spanish?
[Yogi: “Yes”.]

02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:41.380
Thank you very much.

02:06:42.011 --> 02:06:43.933
[Yogi: “May I help You, Shri Mataji?”.]
Beautiful rose you have made.

02:06:44.134 --> 02:06:47.696
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes, decoration.

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:50.400
May I help You, Shri Mataji?
Shri Mataji: Yes, I am not very good

02:06:50.601 --> 02:06:56.882
at it, thank you. Only I can open
Kundalini.

02:07:32.588 --> 02:07:38.343
It’s beautiful, this is Toledo work, yes!

02:07:41.533 --> 02:07:47.902
Beautiful, beautiful.

02:07:48.103 --> 02:07:49.788
Chakras is,

02:07:49.989 --> 02:08:01.965
this is the what you call the birds flying,
like the Holy Ghost.

02:08:02.166 --> 02:08:06.270
Thank you very much, very beautiful,
very beautiful.

02:08:06.471 --> 02:08:10.912
You must write it down here from
Spanish people.

02:08:11.113 --> 02:08:13.158
And date, because you know, so many
presents,

02:08:13.359 --> 02:08:17.680
and they’ll be all going in the personal
archives.

02:08:23.905 --> 02:08:29.534
Yes, so. So the progeny can see what
you people have given the Mother.

02:08:39.237 --> 02:08:42.230
Oh, thank you very much.

02:08:54.048 --> 02:08:57.412
So their engagement is now announced

02:08:57.613 --> 02:09:04.124
and they’ll be getting married in
Ganapatipule, both of them. Fernando …

02:09:33.051 --> 02:09:35.883
May God bless you.

02:09:50.924 --> 02:09:53.688
Take this.

02:10:00.547 --> 02:10:03.857
I’ve tried to (open the package).

02:10:27.525 --> 02:10:35.675
Oh beautiful, it’s very beautiful.

02:10:40.202 --> 02:10:46.468
Nice, isn’t it? Beautiful. Thank you
very much, thank you.

02:10:47.855 --> 02:10:51.715
I hope you have written your name there,
somewhere.

02:10:51.916 --> 02:10:55.042
Inside the box could be,

02:10:56.219 --> 02:11:01.415
inside the box, both of you.

02:11:01.676 --> 02:11:06.952
You should have given Me the present
after the marriage, not before.

02:11:11.769 --> 02:11:14.356
As it is.

02:11:20.766 --> 02:11:27.583
I would like to know the list of people who
want to get married and their photographs –

02:11:27.784 --> 02:11:32.160
would be a good idea if you can send it
to us earlier,

02:11:32.361 --> 02:11:35.501
before we go to India.

02:11:48.035 --> 02:11:50.787
I mean, we have a form,

02:11:50.988 --> 02:11:54.961
and you can get those forms from England,

02:11:55.162 --> 02:11:58.141
and they are to be filled in with
a photograph,

02:11:58.342 --> 02:12:03.358
so that we get some time to see for
ourselves, because from all over the world –

02:12:03.559 --> 02:12:08.985
see heights, and also qualifications, and
aptitudes and everything.

02:12:09.186 --> 02:12:13.115
So that we can match better.

02:12:13.345 --> 02:12:17.929
All right. Thank you. Thank you very much
for a very nice puja.

02:12:18.130 --> 02:12:22.649
May God bless you all. Thank you for all
that you have done

02:12:22.850 --> 02:12:27.704
for Sahaja Yoga, and all that you have
done to look after Me.

02:12:27.905 --> 02:12:30.758
A little translate.

02:12:41.066 --> 02:12:44.153
And to look after Me.

02:12:46.022 --> 02:12:48.697
May God bless you.

02:12:53.889 --> 02:12:56.788
Now look after the new people, with care.

02:12:56.989 --> 02:13:01.386
It’s very delicate, with care.

02:13:07.665 --> 02:13:13.193
It’s very delicate, with care.
Then your knowledge.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.558
May God bless you.

02:13:28.651 --> 02:13:32.297
Very good puja today, very good puja
I must say, very good.

02:14:17.570 --> 02:14:21.009
Beautiful.

02:14:27.898 --> 02:14:32.694
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

02:14:34.928 --> 02:14:37.213
Very good puja I must say, very important.
