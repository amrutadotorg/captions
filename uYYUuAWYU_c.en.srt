1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:26,560
I 

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:35,420
bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,040
The other day I talked to you about the experience
of truth.

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,730
That the truth has to be felt through your
central nervous system.

5
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:56,850
If anything has to happen to your evolution
you have to feel it through your central nervous

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:09,490
system otherwise it is just a projection of
your mind which forms it and you are surprised

7
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,790
at yourself.

8
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:26,630
Like we call somebody as a friend and one
day we find there is no friendship.

9
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,270
Maybe one day the friend will try to murder
you or you may try to murder that person.

10
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,450
You just don't understand what happened to
that love.

11
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:49,790
Same thing about all our projections, we find
it has no basis, it's so superficial.

12
00:01:49,790 --> 00:02:00,270
When we realise that all is so superficial,
it has no basis, we just get frustrated and

13
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,259
we start thinking, what is all this, we are
playing games.

14
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,500
One can't be sincere.

15
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,360
What has happened to us?

16
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,180
Why are we so frivolous?

17
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,670
Why are we so superficial?

18
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:27,160
We may start taking interest in things which
look superficially very great, but ultimately

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:40,470
we find that it doesn't have any depth in
it and suddenly to our horror we discover

20
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,709
that everything seems to be relative in this
world, nothing is absolute.

21
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,320
So the experience of the truth has to be absolute.

22
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:04,640
Means everybody should feel that way, if not
then it is something poetical because each

23
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,780
poet sees the reality in a different way,
describes in a different way.

24
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,290
But if he is a truthful poet he keeps the
essence at least the same.

25
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:28,239
But when we say we have to feel the truth,
by everyone in an absolute manner, what does

26
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,720
that mean?

27
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:44,049
That means when we get our self realisation,
when we think we have got a new awareness

28
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:57,239
of collective consciousness, that means we
are unconnected with the whole, with the absolute,

29
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:05,680
then everyone of us who is like that should
feel the same way.

30
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:16,620
For example there's a person who is sick and
you get ten children who are realised souls,

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:27,180
that means we say are realised souls, now
tie their eyes so that they cannot see at

32
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,440
all and ask them what centres are catching
in this person.

33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,870
All of them will raise the same finger.

34
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,930
This is the finger that is catching.

35
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,560
And if you ask that person relative to that
finger, have you got this trouble, he'll say

36
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,290
yes, but how do you know?

37
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,710
How do these children know?

38
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,000
So the truth is felt by everyone the same.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,070
Then it is absolute.

40
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:12,080
If somebody sees a blue colour, if somebody
sees a red colour then it is not the truth.

41
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:22,789
And you'll be amazed when you become self
realised, if you meet people who are self

42
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,480
realised, you'll be amazed they will say the
same thing in a different way in a different

43
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,840
, but they say the same.

44
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:44,670
It is very amazing that people who were in
India, who were in Lebanon, who were in China,

45
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,840
who were in England had nothing to do with
each other, had no communication what so ever

46
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,020
and they say the same thing.

47
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:06,680
So down within us there is something that
is absolute that tells us about absolute.

48
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,350
So the second experience should be of absoluteness.

49
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:26,960
The Divine power that is all pervading, if
it is truthful, if it is real, then all of

50
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:35,920
us who are feeling that power through this
realisation should receive the same message

51
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:44,020
as
this is the second proof of and you put this

52
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:56,730
test to anyone who says that this is self
realisation.

53
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:07,060
This is a very, very important thing for you
to understand that truth has to be one, it

54
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:14,430
has to be absolute and if you can establish
your report with the absolute you cannot have

55
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,250
any other information but the truth.

56
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:33,500
So as you ascend in Sahaja Yoga you start
learning that what ever messages you are getting

57
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:43,520
is the truth, that all these messages that
you are receiving you can your self perceive

58
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,319
them, can feel them, nobody has to tell you.

59
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,759
Even a child can sense it.

60
00:07:51,759 --> 00:08:03,930
So you move one step forward into a world
call faith, which is the faith of experience.

61
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:12,419
You call say this now, how do you know it
is not artificial?

62
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,349
It is real because you have experience of
the artificial; and the real and now when

63
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:27,259
you feel it you can say with faith "yes it
is real".

64
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:43,839
In the same way reality can only be accepted
if you go through the experience of truth

65
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,930
and then have faith.

66
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,800
Human mind is a very wonderful mind.

67
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:07,040
English word mind doesn't explain much though
what mind is but in Sahaja Yoga it has been

68
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,220
very clearly explained what human mind creates.

69
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:24,690
Here you see very clearly that on top of the
head there, you see a lotus.

70
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,370
You can say how can there be a lotus on top
of the head Mother, this sounds very poetic

71
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:45,070
and something fantastic and even fantasy of
course I wish everybody had that lotus blooming.

72
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:51,900
But very few have it but still they have no
doubt.

73
00:09:51,900 --> 00:10:00,871
Now this one, when you see the lotus, before
that if you see the brain in Sahaja Yoga is

74
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,410
just shown as a hollow thing.

75
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,730
There's nothing like brain tissue and all
that.

76
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:31,209
But there are two, one is blue the other is
yellow [somebody show John, somebody], two

77
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:36,779
balloon like structures in the brain.

78
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:49,480
Now when the first balloon only existed, when
we were just animals our brain was flat, so

79
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,490
was the Himalayas.

80
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,630
Himalayas represents our brain in the gross
life.

81
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:03,680
So the Himalaya was also flat and our brain
was also flat.

82
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:20,020
Then man started hitting with branches when
the animals attacked them, they (learned)

83
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:30,899
how to hit back and another line started which
we call as the sun line but we see another

84
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:44,060
side started developing and the brain got
transformed into a new formation of a triangular

85
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
thing.

86
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:52,850
This triangular brain, now is like a pyramid
I've seen and sometimes I find it swollen

87
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:04,370
very much more on one side ....
So all our problems started from that point

88
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:11,030
where we decided that we can do it.

89
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,360
We..............................

90
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,490
and then we started doing it that way.

91
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:26,080
This yellow stuff which we call as ego started
pushing the superego in such a manner that

92
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,740
the brain became a prism like structure.

93
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,160
But is was important this prism.

94
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,579
The Himalayas also developed a triangular
structure.

95
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:53,100
It was very important that it should have
happened in the human brain,

96
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,660
that we had developed this ego within ourselves.

97
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:09,200
We could have avoided it if we had not committed
the mistake at the stage of Adam and Eve,

98
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:17,660
but we did commit,
and that short circuit got elongated and our

99
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:28,470
evolution started going on a different line
where we wanted to find out ourselves what

100
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:37,680
is the truth.

101
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:54,000
So a journey started and started moving so
fast that they remain in the state of a balloon

102
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,709
, nothing else but a balloon exists.

103
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:06,620
So we became nothing but balloons floating
superficially.

104
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:18,339
The balance was lost completely and the whole
problem has started with this balloon, that

105
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:28,600
we have put in the effort, we can find , we
can discover this.

106
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:43,250
Like one scientist was forced by a King 
that he should try to create gold out of perfume,

107
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:51,709
poor fellow he tried his level best he could
not, but as a result he found out how to make

108
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:56,149
beautiful china.

109
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:03,350
That's exactly what has happened to human
beings, in the search of truth we have discovered

110
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,519
everything else but the truth.

111
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:18,560
Because truth you cannot discover, as I told
you the other day it is a state that one has

112
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:34,750
to achieve, one has to achieve to receive
the truth, to know the truth

113
00:15:34,750 --> 00:16:23,851
So some people felt that truth is what we
have found, like blind people, what ever they

114
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:29,120
have found out they called it as truth.

115
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:43,860
Even in India, where people have a great sense
of meditation, people committed mistakes and

116
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:57,959
what they found is the movement on the right
hand side and they said yes, there is all

117
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:07,050
pervading power and that is formless.

118
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:22,819
The left hand people found while praying to
God that there are forms so they talked of

119
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,459
the forms.

120
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:34,891
Some talked of the formless and some talked
of the form.

121
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:46,080
The right sided people being the worshippers
of the Goddess of learning wrote down everything

122
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,770
as Vedas [most ancient Hindu scriptures] but
in the very beginning of Vedas, Vedas means

123
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,600
to know, and to know means to evolve to become
self realised.

124
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:08,520
It is not when I talk to you what you know,
is not, the knowledge is which is expressed,

125
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,650
manifested on your central nervous system.

126
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,230
The truth.

127
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:27,770
So they wrote down what they found, that we
have to first excite or initiate the nature.

128
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:38,410
So they wrote all those things, now that has
become an authentic writing, big for intellectuals,

129
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,850
that to after many, many years
people they knew it by heart.

130
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:56,070
Authentically you might say that Vedas came
only about 800 or something like that, all

131
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:08,880
that writing, if you go by that you'll be
lost into another wild goose chase and those

132
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,650
who read only Vedas can never find that what
is supposed to be known.

133
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:22,730
In the first chapter or the first verse of
the Vedas that by reading this book if you

134
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:29,340
do not get the knowledge no good reading Vedas.

135
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:37,750
But there are books & books & books, libraries
& libraries & libraries, all the wild goose

136
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,880
chase.

137
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:53,890
Many of the systems follow, was the system
of fearing the God, then finding out the forms

138
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,440
of God, worshipping God as form.

139
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,190
The incarnations came on this earth and people
worshipped them, like Christ.

140
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,010
Now there is a challenge on Christ, these
intellectuals will challenge everything because

141
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,870
they challenge everything through the intellect.

142
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,740
The trouble is that they think they are the
wisest.

143
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,240
Such wise people they have time for, is impossible.

144
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,580
You have to be a little humble.

145
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:33,470
So the intellectual as usual challenge and
the others who just believe without intellectuals

146
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:46,000
were the people who just believed into things
without knowing.

147
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,929
Who had just faith, as our emotional songs
are, are.

148
00:20:54,929 --> 00:21:03,170
All these extreme movements on both the sides
created two different types of people, one

149
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:12,679
who we can call as intellectuals and another
as

150
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:23,580
They did not create self realised people because
ego makes a person so superficial and so stupid

151
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,200
that he cannot grasp, it's beyond him.

152
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,340
He is so stupid.

153
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,190
He cannot grasp the truth.

154
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:38,190
Is a barrier, is a projection outside, he
is a concave personality, is a convex personality.

155
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,280
Brain is convex.

156
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:51,200
And the other one is so concave, is so conditioned
that you cannot compete.

157
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,620
That's how the quality of seekers came on
this earth, who are seeking truth.

158
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:11,960
Now we should also know that God must be worried
about his creation, he must be worried about

159
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:23,309
the people who are crated by him, who became
human beings, who are seekers, special category.

160
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:31,340
What hypocrites, you cannot tell people, you
cannot help them but those who are real seekers.

161
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:42,020
There are many real seekers and he must be
worried about all these seekers and he must

162
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:50,730
have arranged something for them and that
is how Christ came on this earth . He came

163
00:22:50,730 --> 00:23:03,570
on this earth to guide and tell us that you
can find the truth by your second birth.

164
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,470
You are to be born again.

165
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,700
You are to be born again, then there are people
who just believe that I am born again, you

166
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,970
see self opinionated, I'm alright!

167
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,980
I've found it!

168
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:22,620
Stupid people, they just believe, certify
themselves they have found it.

169
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:35,080
They just give themselves a certificate, oh
I've found it, but who is the loser?

170
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,720
It's not God.

171
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:48,000
He can reveal himself to you if you want to
know him, through your evolution, through

172
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,220
your effortlessness.

173
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:10,120
But as you have seen Patanjali for the real
seekers but people took out of Patanjali also

174
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:20,030
what they tell them is the physical exercise,
I mean just imagine, it is like a person who

175
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:28,669
has been invited to dinner to do dish-washing,
it's that stupid.

176
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:39,120
And that book, even today thank God, despite
all the intellectuals attacks and all nonsense,

177
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:49,890
he just talked of the formless not of the
form so much but he does say that you have

178
00:24:49,890 --> 00:25:05,970
to neutralise your effort too, you have to
neutralise your thought which are and in the

179
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:13,460
absence of that thought only the Kundalini
will rise.

180
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:39,130
Now a vicious circle is created, even when
we say we fight with that thought

181
00:25:39,130 --> 00:26:05,409
a thought in the mind
so something has to happen 

182
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:15,900
and that is what happens
but is all done by God Almighty within us,

183
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,660
that he has made these beautiful chakras.

184
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:32,340
They are made from different elements, the
essence of different elements and all incarnations

185
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,559
of our ascent are placed there to guide those
subtle centres.

186
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:51,370
Is already within us, we may not know about
it but they exist within us and ultimately

187
00:26:51,370 --> 00:27:00,452
the residual, they call it, the residual power,
that is Kundalini; it is residual because

188
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:11,840
it has created everything but has not manifested
itself, is the pure desire to know the truth,

189
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:18,980
pure desire to know the Divine, to become
the Divine, is still sleeping.

190
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:34,340
When these chakras are in proper shape it
spontaneously rises just like a seed sprouts,

191
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:43,059
you don't have to do anything to reduce your
efforts and your thoughts.

192
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:50,049
Your thoughts are created and they disappear
again they come up and disappear, there's

193
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:58,659
a little gap in between and that gap widens
by the ascent of Kundalini and you become

194
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:01,779
thoughtless without any effort.

195
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:07,299
With effort you cannot, that's the point.

196
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:11,529
This mechanism exists within us.

197
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:18,120
Now if something happens here say for example
this is working out, then we go into the mechanism

198
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,940
of this and try to find out how this is working
out.

199
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:34,580
Now if you want to see, you can see the rising
of the Kundalini, you can see the breaking

200
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:42,059
of the Kundalini, you can feel the cool breeze
coming out of you.

201
00:28:42,059 --> 00:29:05,429
Now how it happens
it is the cool breeze that emits on top of

202
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:14,899
your head, is the first sign that your Kundalini
awakened and then when you start feeling it

203
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:24,080
all around now you are in connection with
the all pervading power.

204
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,140
Before that we are denying the truth.

205
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:36,929
It's all done by God, by his grace, he's made
it all so beautiful, so very, very beautiful,

206
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,899
we don't do a thing, we don't have to do a
thing, but that is the point, we cannot do,

207
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,090
that we don't have to do anything about it.

208
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:53,309
Always they ask me, then what must we do,
I said you don't do anything, that's the point.

209
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:57,240
Is it too much to accept?

210
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,790
But how do we become human beings from monkeys
do we

211
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:12,120
for anything . How does a seed sprout?

212
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,190
By itself spontaneously.

213
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:24,470
In the same way your evolution has to take
place spontaneously.

214
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:35,650
And every time somebody has to lead, somebody
has to go forward, somebody has to be bold,

215
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:41,500
somebody has to conquer.

216
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:49,010
Maybe somebody else would have been better
for this job, as I said, I would be very happy

217
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,014
to retire but that's what it is, it's true.

218
00:30:52,014 --> 00:31:01,080
I have to do this job, it is a thankless job
no doubt but I have to do it, so what can

219
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,490
I do about it?

220
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:09,410
That should not upset you.

221
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:20,560
That upsets people but I don't do anything
actually, it is a myth like the sun shines,

222
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,289
it doesn't do anything does it?

223
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:29,659
But when the sun shines the leaves become
green, just happens, I mean the sun doesn't

224
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:35,350
take any credit or doesn't say that the trees
must offer God their goodness or something

225
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
to him.

226
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:43,110
They are not angry with the sun are you?

227
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,720
Because it tans our body.

228
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,830
Do you?

229
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:57,210
In the same way it's somebody's nature to
do that, and somebody's nature is to ascend

230
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,529
and to rise
people who achieve it, don't you think so?

231
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:06,740
So there is nothing to feel unhappy about.

232
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:16,200
This is another problem which I told you last
time, that in the west it is a really big

233
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,890
hurdle for people.

234
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:25,659
You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in any
effort, you cannot do anything about it, it

235
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,610
has to work out otherwise we cannot guarantee
that.

236
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:33,640
If it is there it will work out, if it is
not there it will not work out.

237
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:44,130
If the desire is pure it will work out and
then you have to work it out to keep it there.

238
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:55,520
So by reading about it you may never understand,
there are so many people who did

239
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:05,460
so many people who did Gita , so many people
in India who know by heart the whole of Gita,

240
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:19,320
the meaning, everything but they have sickness,
they've ill feelings, they're unhappy or ego

241
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,650
oriented, something wrong, somewhere.

242
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:32,850
Nothing wrong with the scriptures, we have
forgotten it is said you are to be born again.

243
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,529
So the third experience should be of transformation.

244
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:50,730
If it cannot bring out the virtue in you,
if it cannot give you the strength of your

245
00:33:50,730 --> 00:34:02,840
spirit, if it cannot transform you then it
is not self realisation.

246
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:08,270
But transformation can be taken like this
that people can just change the colour of

247
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:14,129
their clothes and say we are transformed,
now we have taken a sanyasa, also can be like

248
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:23,970
that, all such self opinionated people.

249
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:33,859
It's not that, it's no opinion, is to be in
that state is important, to be in that state

250
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:40,070
that's the truth and that's the truth you
should ask for, nothing else.

251
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:51,149
Are you transformed by it and the first transformation
you feel, before you change your temperament,

252
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:57,050
before you change your habit, before you take
anything is that your central nervous system

253
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,190
acquires a new dimension of collective consciousness.

254
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,859
Acquires!

255
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:07,090
You get it.

256
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,190
And you can verify it.

257
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:18,440
But human beings still think they have a right
to no Mother no much, I don't believe in it.

258
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:26,380
It's alright, who are you, I mean don't believe
in yourself.

259
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:33,130
So the first thing that should happen in this
experience of transformation or evolution

260
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:44,360
is that you become, again I say become, become,
become collectively conscious, by which you

261
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:51,320
know your chakras and you know the chakras
of others, you know the subtle problems you

262
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,770
have, the subtle diseases you have, the hidden
problems you have.

263
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:03,410
The whole life which was abnormal comes to
normal you see because you can see abnormal.

264
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:08,340
Supposing I am standing on the edge of this
and there is no light, I cannot see, I may

265
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,450
fall down.

266
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,220
I am about to fall down I cannot see but then
is light, I see.

267
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,220
So why not get into balance.

268
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,150
That is enlightenment.

269
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:26,410
If enlightenment doesn't give you the vision
of wisdom it is not enlightenment at all.

270
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,790
You drink, you smoke, you see all kinds of
things, you have temper everything exists

271
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:37,860
and you say oh God I am a very religious person
and the second thing that comes to you is

272
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:52,640
some sort of . So your virtue, your virtue
must shine and that's the time is today according

273
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,349
to the Shalivan calendar this is the true
faith.

274
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:09,830
This is the yuga when there is, is the age
when there is perfection means where you get

275
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:15,780
in contact, actual, with actuality.

276
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:28,760
That means you actualise it and that is the
time, today, that has come called as Krita

277
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,940
yuga.

278
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:40,700
That means all pervading power is actualised
and we feel the manifestation of that power

279
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,619
very, very clearly, on your central nervous
system.

280
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:49,930
Because what ever is evolved within you, you
feel on your central nervous system.

281
00:37:49,930 --> 00:38:00,619
So this new breakthrough is to be seen through
and not to be just accepted, not to have blind

282
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:05,060
faith, nothing of that kind.

283
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:18,210
Then once you come to a certain state then
the subject gets deeper and deeper and much

284
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:23,849
more intense, but first that state has to
be established.

285
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:32,210
Many people have complained to me that Mother
Sahaja Yogis who are are rather secretive,

286
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:43,170
there are no secrets, no secrets but as a
boy enters say maybe the first class or the

287
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,520
first he cannot understand what areas to be
discussed.

288
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:56,780
So he might feel this fellow is trying to
hide something in his books.

289
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:04,700
One has to grow to bear that truth also to
bear that truth he has to develop that power

290
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:12,990
within ourselves and that state we have to
achieve.

291
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:27,119
I requested last time all the people of England
especially, because in the map of the Divine,

292
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:37,820
England represents the heart and the responsibility
of heart is the maximum and if they don't

293
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:46,040
pay attention to their heart the world will
have a heart attack.

294
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:54,810
So how important it is that we should seek
our ascent as seekers.

295
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,920
Of course I don't say, you don't do this,
you don't do that, nothing of the kind, that

296
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,290
is not to be said anymore.

297
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,500
Just first get your realisation then you look
after your self I don't have to tell you.

298
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,490
Then you get your light you yourself will
see that you will not put your hand into the

299
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,860
crocodiles mouth there, are you?

300
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,740
But first you must see the crocodile, because
if I tell you the crocodile in the darkness,

301
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:27,970
you say let me try even if you, that's how
it works.

302
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,200
It's so beautiful.

303
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:41,200
There's a very beautiful thing to achieve
that's what we say is the Kingdom of God,

304
00:40:41,200 --> 00:42:29,250
that's what we say that 

305
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:46,170
is 

306
00:42:46,170 --> 00:43:32,060
that resides within us, that joy, that fills
the whole world as bliss, with complete auspiciousness

307
00:43:32,060 --> 00:45:00,339
of God's being can be ours if 

308
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:51,560
we decide to be there, if we want we can go
through, no one, it is 

309
00:45:51,560 --> 00:47:01,060
you 

310
00:47:01,060 --> 00:48:38,329
who 

311
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:58,270
has 

312
00:48:58,270 --> 00:51:10,930
to choose it 

313
00:51:10,930 --> 01:03:52,740
in your own freedom only you can achieve your
complete freedom.

314
01:03:52,740 --> 01:05:57,609
May 

315
01:05:57,609 --> 01:13:01,620
God Bless You.
