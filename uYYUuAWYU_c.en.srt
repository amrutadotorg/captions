00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,892
1984-0702 The Experience of Truth (Part II), Hampstead, England

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,892
The other day I talked to you about the experience of truth.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,892
That the truth has to be felt through your central nervous system.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,892
If anything has to happen to your evolution you have to feel it through your central nervous

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,892
system otherwise it is just a projection of your mind which forms it and you are surprised

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:25,892
at yourself. Like we call somebody as a friend and one day we find there is no friendship.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,892
Maybe one day the friend will try to murder you or you may try to murder that person.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:48,892
You just don't understand what happened to that love. Same thing about all our projections, we find it has no basis, it's so superficial.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,892
When we realise that all is so superficial, it has no basis, we just get frustrated and

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,892
we start thinking, what is all this, we are playing games.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,892
One can't be sincere. What has happened to us?

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,892
Why are we so frivolous? Why are we so superficial?

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,892
We may start taking interest in things which look superficially very great, but ultimately

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:39,892
we find that it doesn't have any depth in it and suddenly to our horror we discover

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,892
that everything seems to be relative in this world, nothing is absolute.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,892
So the experience of the truth has to be absolute.

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,892
Means everybody should feel that way, if not then it is something poetical because each

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,892
poet sees the reality in a different way, describes in a different way.

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,892
But if he is a truthful poet he keeps the essence at least the same.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,892
But when we say we have to feel the truth, by everyone in an absolute manner, what does

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:43,892
that mean? That means when we get our self realisation, when we think we have got a new awareness

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,892
of collective consciousness, that means we are unconnected with the whole, with the absolute,

28
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,892
then everyone of us who is like that should feel the same way.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,892
For example there's a person who is sick and you get ten children who are realised souls,

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,892
that means we say are realised souls, now tie their eyes so that they cannot see at

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,892
all and ask them what centres are catching in this person.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,892
All of them will raise the same finger.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,892
This is the finger that is catching. And if you ask that person relative to that finger, have you got this trouble, he'll say

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,892
yes, but how do you know? How do these children know?

35
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,892
So the truth is felt by everyone the same.

36
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,892
Then it is absolute. If somebody sees a blue colour, if somebody sees a red colour then it is not the truth.

37
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,892
And you'll be amazed when you become self realised, if you meet people who are self

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,892
realised, you'll be amazed they will say the same thing in a different way in a different , but they say the same.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:43,892
It is very amazing that people who were in India, who were in Lebanon, who were in China,

40
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,892
who were in England had nothing to do with each other, had no communication what so ever

41
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,892
and they say the same thing.

42
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,892
So down within us there is something that is absolute that tells us about absolute.

43
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,892
So the second experience should be of absoluteness.

44
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:25,892
The Divine power that is all pervading, if it is truthful, if it is real, then all of

45
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,892
us who are feeling that power through this realisation should receive the same message

46
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,892
as this is the second proof of and you put this

47
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,892
test to anyone who says that this is self realisation.

48
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:06,892
This is a very, very important thing for you to understand that truth has to be one, it

49
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,892
has to be absolute and if you can establish your report with the absolute you cannot have

50
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:32,892
any other information but the truth. So as you ascend in Sahaja Yoga you start learning that what ever messages you are getting

51
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,892
is the truth, that all these messages that you are receiving you can your self perceive

52
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,892
them, can feel them, nobody has to tell you. Even a child can sense it.

53
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,892
So you move one step forward into a world call faith, which is the faith of experience.

54
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,892
You call say this now, how do you know it is not artificial?

55
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,892
It is real because you have experience of the artificial; and the real and now when

56
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,892
you feel it you can say with faith "yes it is real".

57
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:42,892
In the same way reality can only be accepted if you go through the experience of truth

58
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,892
and then have faith.

59
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,892
Human mind is a very wonderful mind.

60
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:06,892
English word mind doesn't explain much though what mind is but in Sahaja Yoga it has been

61
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:23,892
very clearly explained what human mind creates. Here you see very clearly that on top of the head there, you see a lotus.

62
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,892
You can say how can there be a lotus on top of the head Mother, this sounds very poetic

63
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:44,892
and something fantastic and even fantasy of course I wish everybody had that lotus blooming.

64
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,892
But very few have it but still they have no doubt.

65
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,892
Now this one, when you see the lotus, before that if you see the brain in Sahaja Yoga is

66
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,892
just shown as a hollow thing. There's nothing like brain tissue and all that.

67
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:30,892
But there are two, one is blue the other is yellow [somebody show John, somebody], two

68
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,892
balloon like structures in the brain.

69
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:48,892
Now when the first balloon only existed, when we were just animals our brain was flat, so

70
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,892
was the Himalayas. Himalayas represents our brain in the gross life.

71
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,892
So the Himalaya was also flat and our brain was also flat.

72
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:19,892
Then man started hitting with branches when the animals attacked them, they (learned)

73
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,892
how to hit back and another line started which we call as the sun line but we see another

74
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:43,892
side started developing and the brain got transformed into a new formation of a triangular

75
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,892
thing. This triangular brain, now is like a pyramid I've seen and sometimes I find it swollen

76
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,892
very much more on one side .... So all our problems started from that point

77
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,892
where we decided that we can do it.

78
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,892
We.............................. and then we started doing it that way.

79
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,892
This yellow stuff which we call as ego started pushing the superego in such a manner that

80
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,892
the brain became a prism like structure. But is was important this prism.

81
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,892
The Himalayas also developed a triangular structure.

82
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,892
It was very important that it should have happened in the human brain,

83
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:08,892
that we had developed this ego within ourselves. We could have avoided it if we had not committed the mistake at the stage of Adam and Eve,

84
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,892
but we did commit, and that short circuit got elongated and our

85
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,892
evolution started going on a different line where we wanted to find out ourselves what

86
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,892
is the truth.

87
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:53,892
So a journey started and started moving so fast that they remain in the state of a balloon

88
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:05,892
, nothing else but a balloon exists. So we became nothing but balloons floating superficially.

89
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:17,892
The balance was lost completely and the whole problem has started with this balloon, that

90
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,892
we have put in the effort, we can find , we can discover this.

91
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:42,892
Like one scientist was forced by a King that he should try to create gold out of perfume,

92
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,892
poor fellow he tried his level best he could not, but as a result he found out how to make

93
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,892
beautiful china. That's exactly what has happened to human beings, in the search of truth we have discovered

94
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,892
everything else but the truth.

95
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,892
Because truth you cannot discover, as I told you the other day it is a state that one has

96
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:33,892
to achieve, one has to achieve to receive the truth, to know the truth

97
00:15:34,000 --> 00:16:22,892
So some people felt that truth is what we have found, like blind people, what ever they

98
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,892
have found out they called it as truth.

99
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:42,892
Even in India, where people have a great sense of meditation, people committed mistakes and

100
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:56,892
what they found is the movement on the right hand side and they said yes, there is all

101
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,892
pervading power and that is formless.

102
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:21,892
The left hand people found while praying to God that there are forms so they talked of

103
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:33,892
the forms. Some talked of the formless and some talked of the form.

104
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,892
The right sided people being the worshippers of the Goddess of learning wrote down everything

105
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,892
as Vedas [most ancient Hindu scriptures] but in the very beginning of Vedas, Vedas means

106
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:07,892
to know, and to know means to evolve to become self realised. It is not when I talk to you what you know, is not, the knowledge is which is expressed,

107
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,892
manifested on your central nervous system. The truth.

108
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:26,892
So they wrote down what they found, that we have to first excite or initiate the nature.

109
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:37,892
So they wrote all those things, now that has become an authentic writing, big for intellectuals,

110
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,892
that to after many, many years people they knew it by heart.

111
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:55,892
Authentically you might say that Vedas came only about 800 or something like that, all

112
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:07,892
that writing, if you go by that you'll be lost into another wild goose chase and those

113
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,892
who read only Vedas can never find that what is supposed to be known.

114
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,892
In the first chapter or the first verse of the Vedas that by reading this book if you

115
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,892
do not get the knowledge no good reading Vedas.

116
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,892
But there are books & books & books, libraries & libraries & libraries, all the wild goose

117
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:52,892
chase. Many of the systems follow, was the system of fearing the God, then finding out the forms

118
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,892
of God, worshipping God as form.

119
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,892
The incarnations came on this earth and people worshipped them, like Christ.

120
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,892
Now there is a challenge on Christ, these intellectuals will challenge everything because they challenge everything through the intellect.

121
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,892
The trouble is that they think they are the wisest. Such wise people they have time for, is impossible.

122
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,892
You have to be a little humble.

123
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,892
So the intellectual as usual challenge and the others who just believe without intellectuals

124
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:45,892
were the people who just believed into things without knowing.

125
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,892
Who had just faith, as our emotional songs are, are.

126
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,892
All these extreme movements on both the sides created two different types of people, one

127
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:11,892
who we can call as intellectuals and another as

128
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:22,892
They did not create self realised people because ego makes a person so superficial and so stupid

129
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,892
that he cannot grasp, it's beyond him. He is so stupid. He cannot grasp the truth.

130
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,892
Is a barrier, is a projection outside, he is a concave personality, is a convex personality.

131
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:50,892
Brain is convex. And the other one is so concave, is so conditioned that you cannot compete.

132
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,892
That's how the quality of seekers came on this earth, who are seeking truth.

133
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:10,892
Now we should also know that God must be worried about his creation, he must be worried about

134
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:22,892
the people who are crated by him, who became human beings, who are seekers, special category.

135
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,892
What hypocrites, you cannot tell people, you cannot help them but those who are real seekers.

136
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:41,892
There are many real seekers and he must be worried about all these seekers and he must

137
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,892
have arranged something for them and that is how Christ came on this earth . He came

138
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:02,892
on this earth to guide and tell us that you can find the truth by your second birth.

139
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,892
You are to be born again. You are to be born again, then there are people who just believe that I am born again, you

140
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,892
see self opinionated, I'm alright! I've found it! Stupid people, they just believe, certify themselves they have found it.

141
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:34,892
They just give themselves a certificate, oh I've found it, but who is the loser?

142
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:47,892
It's not God. He can reveal himself to you if you want to know him, through your evolution, through

143
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:56,892
your effortlessness.

144
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:09,892
But as you have seen Patanjali for the real seekers but people took out of Patanjali also

145
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,892
what they tell them is the physical exercise, I mean just imagine, it is like a person who

146
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,892
has been invited to dinner to do dish-washing, it's that stupid.

147
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:38,892
And that book, even today thank God, despite all the intellectuals attacks and all nonsense,

148
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,892
he just talked of the formless not of the form so much but he does say that you have

149
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:04,892
to neutralise your effort too, you have to neutralise your thought which are and in the

150
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,892
absence of that thought only the Kundalini will rise.

151
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:38,892
Now a vicious circle is created, even when we say we fight with that thought

152
00:25:39,000 --> 00:26:04,892
a thought in the mind so something has to happen

153
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:14,892
and that is what happens but is all done by God Almighty within us,

154
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:31,892
that he has made these beautiful chakras. They are made from different elements, the essence of different elements and all incarnations

155
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,892
of our ascent are placed there to guide those subtle centres.

156
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:50,892
Is already within us, we may not know about it but they exist within us and ultimately

157
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,892
the residual, they call it, the residual power, that is Kundalini; it is residual because

158
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,892
it has created everything but has not manifested itself, is the pure desire to know the truth,

159
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,892
pure desire to know the Divine, to become the Divine, is still sleeping.

160
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:33,892
When these chakras are in proper shape it spontaneously rises just like a seed sprouts,

161
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,892
you don't have to do anything to reduce your efforts and your thoughts.

162
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,892
Your thoughts are created and they disappear again they come up and disappear, there's

163
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,892
a little gap in between and that gap widens by the ascent of Kundalini and you become

164
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,892
thoughtless without any effort. With effort you cannot, that's the point.

165
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,892
This mechanism exists within us. Now if something happens here say for example this is working out, then we go into the mechanism

166
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,892
of this and try to find out how this is working out.

167
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:33,892
Now if you want to see, you can see the rising of the Kundalini, you can see the breaking

168
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,892
of the Kundalini, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of you.

169
00:28:42,000 --> 00:29:04,892
Now how it happens it is the cool breeze that emits on top of

170
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,892
your head, is the first sign that your Kundalini awakened and then when you start feeling it

171
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,892
all around now you are in connection with the all pervading power.

172
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,892
Before that we are denying the truth.

173
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,892
It's all done by God, by his grace, he's made it all so beautiful, so very, very beautiful,

174
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,892
we don't do a thing, we don't have to do a thing, but that is the point, we cannot do,

175
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:52,892
that we don't have to do anything about it. Always they ask me, then what must we do, I said you don't do anything, that's the point.

176
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:03,892
Is it too much to accept? But how do we become human beings from monkeys do we

177
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,892
for anything . How does a seed sprout?

178
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:23,892
By itself spontaneously. In the same way your evolution has to take place spontaneously.

179
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:34,892
And every time somebody has to lead, somebody has to go forward, somebody has to be bold,

180
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,892
somebody has to conquer.

181
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,892
Maybe somebody else would have been better for this job, as I said, I would be very happy

182
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:00,892
to retire but that's what it is, it's true. I have to do this job, it is a thankless job no doubt but I have to do it, so what can

183
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,892
I do about it? That should not upset you.

184
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:19,892
That upsets people but I don't do anything actually, it is a myth like the sun shines,

185
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,892
it doesn't do anything does it? But when the sun shines the leaves become green, just happens, I mean the sun doesn't

186
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,892
take any credit or doesn't say that the trees must offer God their goodness or something

187
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,892
to him. They are not angry with the sun are you?

188
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:56,892
Because it tans our body. Do you? In the same way it's somebody's nature to do that, and somebody's nature is to ascend

189
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,892
and to rise people who achieve it, don't you think so?

190
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:15,892
So there is nothing to feel unhappy about. This is another problem which I told you last time, that in the west it is a really big

191
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,892
hurdle for people. You cannot pay for it, you cannot put in any effort, you cannot do anything about it, it

192
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:32,892
has to work out otherwise we cannot guarantee that. If it is there it will work out, if it is not there it will not work out.

193
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:43,892
If the desire is pure it will work out and then you have to work it out to keep it there.

194
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:54,892
So by reading about it you may never understand, there are so many people who did

195
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:04,892
so many people who did Gita , so many people in India who know by heart the whole of Gita,

196
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:18,892
the meaning, everything but they have sickness, they've ill feelings, they're unhappy or ego

197
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:31,892
oriented, something wrong, somewhere. Nothing wrong with the scriptures, we have forgotten it is said you are to be born again.

198
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,892
So the third experience should be of transformation.

199
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:49,892
If it cannot bring out the virtue in you, if it cannot give you the strength of your

200
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:01,892
spirit, if it cannot transform you then it is not self realisation.

201
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,892
But transformation can be taken like this that people can just change the colour of

202
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,892
their clothes and say we are transformed, now we have taken a sanyasa, also can be like

203
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:22,892
that, all such self opinionated people.

204
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,892
It's not that, it's no opinion, is to be in that state is important, to be in that state

205
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,892
that's the truth and that's the truth you should ask for, nothing else.

206
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,892
Are you transformed by it and the first transformation you feel, before you change your temperament,

207
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,892
before you change your habit, before you take anything is that your central nervous system

208
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,892
acquires a new dimension of collective consciousness. Acquires!

209
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,892
You get it. And you can verify it.

210
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,892
But human beings still think they have a right to no Mother no much, I don't believe in it.

211
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,892
It's alright, who are you, I mean don't believe in yourself.

212
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,892
So the first thing that should happen in this experience of transformation or evolution

213
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:43,892
is that you become, again I say become, become, become collectively conscious, by which you

214
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,892
know your chakras and you know the chakras of others, you know the subtle problems you

215
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,892
have, the subtle diseases you have, the hidden problems you have.

216
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,892
The whole life which was abnormal comes to normal you see because you can see abnormal.

217
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,892
Supposing I am standing on the edge of this and there is no light, I cannot see, I may fall down.

218
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,892
I am about to fall down I cannot see but then is light, I see. So why not get into balance.

219
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,892
That is enlightenment. If enlightenment doesn't give you the vision of wisdom it is not enlightenment at all.

220
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,892
You drink, you smoke, you see all kinds of things, you have temper everything exists

221
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,892
and you say oh God I am a very religious person and the second thing that comes to you is

222
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:51,892
some sort of . So your virtue, your virtue must shine and that's the time is today according

223
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,892
to the Shalivan calendar this is the true faith.

224
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,892
This is the yuga when there is, is the age when there is perfection means where you get

225
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,892
in contact, actual, with actuality.

226
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:27,892
That means you actualise it and that is the time, today, that has come called as Krita

227
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:39,892
yuga. That means all pervading power is actualised and we feel the manifestation of that power

228
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,892
very, very clearly, on your central nervous system. Because what ever is evolved within you, you feel on your central nervous system.

229
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:59,892
So this new breakthrough is to be seen through and not to be just accepted, not to have blind

230
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:17,892
faith, nothing of that kind. Then once you come to a certain state then the subject gets deeper and deeper and much

231
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,892
more intense, but first that state has to be established.

232
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:31,892
Many people have complained to me that Mother Sahaja Yogis who are are rather secretive,

233
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:42,892
there are no secrets, no secrets but as a boy enters say maybe the first class or the

234
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,892
first he cannot understand what areas to be discussed.

235
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,892
So he might feel this fellow is trying to hide something in his books.

236
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,892
One has to grow to bear that truth also to bear that truth he has to develop that power

237
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,892
within ourselves and that state we have to achieve.

238
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:26,892
I requested last time all the people of England especially, because in the map of the Divine,

239
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:36,892
England represents the heart and the responsibility of heart is the maximum and if they don't

240
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,892
pay attention to their heart the world will have a heart attack.

241
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,892
So how important it is that we should seek our ascent as seekers.

242
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,892
Of course I don't say, you don't do this, you don't do that, nothing of the kind, that

243
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,892
is not to be said anymore.

244
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,892
Just first get your realisation then you look after your self I don't have to tell you. Then you get your light you yourself will see that you will not put your hand into the

245
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,892
crocodiles mouth there, are you? But first you must see the crocodile, because if I tell you the crocodile in the darkness,

246
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,892
you say let me try even if you, that's how it works.

247
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:39,892
It’s so beautiful. There’s a very beautiful thing to achieve that’s what we say is the Kingdom of God,

248
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:50,892
that’s what we say that peace that is that resides within us, that joy,

249
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:03,892
that fills the whole world as bliss, complete auspiciousness of God’s being can be ours

250
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,892
if we decide to be there, nobody can force you. No one can.

251
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:23,892
It is you who has to choose it in your own freedom only you can achieve your complete freedom.

252
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,892
May God Bless You.

253
00:41:26,000 --> 00:42:14,892
H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

254
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:27,892
Question: Shri Mataji. What is the … [some words ambiguous] Is there a thing that is ego? Is there such a thing that has ego and where does it come from?

255
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:40,892
Shri Mataji: ‘Yeh, there is. Quite a horrible one. Ego is a myth though. But the myth is there.

256
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:49,892
It’s a myth. The myth is that we believe that we do something.

257
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:01,892
I always give a very apt simile for this that some villagers were ask to go by a plane

258
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,892
and they were told not to carry to much luggage. So they got into the plane and put the luggage on their heads.

259
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,892
They were ask: ‘Why are you doing this?’ and they said: ‘We are trying to reduce the weight of the plane.

260
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:26,892
In the same way our ego works. And this ego exists though it’s a myth but the myth exists.

261
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,892
When reality comes it disappears like the darkness exists, but when the sun comes it disappears.

262
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:47,892
It comes to us from the idea that we do something. ‘I’, ‘my’, ‘I’. I can do it!

263
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,892
And from the ‚my‘. This is my. Identity, I-ness comes. Now what happens that

264
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:13,892
when we start working doing anything. See, even garbage cleaning, anything, dish washing,

265
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,892
anything that you think is trivial. ‘Oh, what a work I’m doing? Sparking clean I have done.’

266
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,892
I mean anything you do, you feel: ‘Oh, what a work I have done? But what do we do?

267
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:45,892
We convert dead from dead. Like this stage they got some plastic which is dead made into this stage

268
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:55,892
and they’ll think: ‘We made a great job!’ Some dead bricks the brought made this dead hall.

269
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,892
And they will say: ‘We have done a great job!’ What do we do? Do we any living work? Nothing!

270
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:16,892
Do we? We don’t do any living work. That’s another myth. We think we do living work. No, it’s only God.

271
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,892
So when we think we are doing something you must know what you are doing is nothing, you are just transforming from dead to dead.

272
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,892
As a result what happens is also very dangerous. Supposing you get some bhoot

273
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,892
because the tree is dead. Tree has to die otherwise you cannot make a chair.

274
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,892
So the tree dies you make it more dead to make a chair.

275
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,892
By making a chair you sit on the chair and now you cannot sit on the ground, you become dead with the chair.

276
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,892
You cannot sit on the ground you have to carry the chair all around it becomes a dominating feature.

277
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,892
Anywhere you go you have to carry a handy-chair because can’t sit on the ground.

278
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,892
So it gives you something called comfort which is really enslaves you.

279
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:19,892
So what do we do is nothing. We are enslaving ourselves. You just detach yourself from this modern world

280
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,892
and see what slaves we are of so many things we have created.

281
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,892
If the electricity goes off the whole London will topple down.

282
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:41,892
We have become slaves of the matter. Just think of it because the dead has sitting on our heads.

283
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,892
But this idea, ‘we have done this, we have that’, creates a kind of a balloon in our head,

284
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,892
you see here, which is mister ego. Which is the color of the bile.

285
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,892
Such people have the right side working very hard. The right side produces the bile,

286
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:18,892
because is the sunline. We work when the sun is out and as a result of that we develop this ego within ourselves.

287
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,892
So we have ego. But when you become hollow there is nothing like ego.

288
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:37,892
Then He is the Mahat Ahankara. He is the great ego. He does everything. He is the doer, He is the enjoyer.

289
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:50,892
What are we?  We are part and parcel of His being. Just to see, just to feel it.

290
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,892
So to think that we do something is wrong, but if you go on saying: ‘No, I don’t do anything!’ then another thing comes in.

291
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:05,892
That’s called as superego. We move like a pendulum from one to another. Then you say:

292
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,892
‘No, no, no! I’m doing wrong. I should not do like this. It is wrong. Better sit at home.

293
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,892
Become a hippie, smoke some ganja. Finish off life.‘ Don’t do anything!

294
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,892
Do everything that will take you away from work, effortlessness, laziness, lethargic.

295
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,892
Because if you do work you develop ego. So become non-egoistical, but you become superego.

296
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,892
So no escape. So what do you do then? Is a problem! You be in the center.

297
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,892
Just wait, don’t overdo anything. Be in the center, do everything moderation,

298
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,892
the Kundalini rises and you become that which is beyond ego and superego.

299
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,892
You reach that state, here (Shri Mataji puts Her right hand over Her head). That’s what you have to become,

300
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,892
which is your right. Which you should get. For that you have become a human being.

301
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,892
Why shouldn’t you have it? For that also is ego: ‘Why should I have?’ ‚All right, don‘t have it!‘

302
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:16,892
The best part of it: Ego makes you stupid, really stupid. This really makes you stupid.

303
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:24,892
Best thing is to see an egoistical man. You’ll feel like laughing because he looks like a … [ambiguous; sounds like ‘bafoo’].

304
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,892
It can be very dangerous also. Like the ego of Hitler – very destructive.

305
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,892
So the egoistical man destroys others and the superego-man destroys himself.

306
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,892
He is all the time thinking: ‘I’m so bad. I’m no good. I’m good for nothing.’

307
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,892
Both are just the same in My eyes. Is again the mental projections. You are the spirit.

308
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,892
You are neither ego nor superego but you are the spirit. Any other question?

309
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,892


310
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:18,892
Question: Is there such a thing like evil? Shri Mataji: Evil? Of course, there is! Evil is there.

311
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,892
Who has told you there is no evil? Evil exists.

312
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,892
There are people who are hurt by evil, who are tortured by evil. We see that every day.

313
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:44,892
There are crooks. I don’t know how many varieties of evil there are.

314
00:50:45,000 --> 00:51:03,892
Evil exists. Is not only ignorance. But in the ignorance the harmful, destructive, sinister ideas that you grow.

315
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:17,892
That is evil. That darkness is not so difficult but in the darkness the thorns that we grow within ourselves.

316
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,892
Evil is there. We have to fight it. We are in the shackles of evil no doubt

317
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,892
and evil comes as an attack, unholy attack. You had evil,

318
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:33,892
say Bauhaus (note: school of modern architecture, founded 1919), I would say were evil people, who attacked you.

319
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:45,892
Your architecture was destroyed, all your beauty was destroyed, everything was destroyed, now what do you have? These pigeon holes?

320
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,892
And now people become mad in this pigeon hole.

321
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,892
It was an unholy attack, see it, so clear. How can you say that there was no evil?

322
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,892
It comes as aggression, it comes as any ideas of disparities.

323
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:24,892
Also it could be very sly and sinister like our gurus have done. It’s very sinister, it comes in the garb of divine,

324
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:37,892
talks of God and kills you within. Gives you diseases, gives you problems – that’s evil,

325
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:47,892
that’s evil! To pronounce that you are divine when you are sinister.

326
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,892
When you are not a realized soul, is evil.

327
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:08,892
Sometimes I feel in modern times evil is more powerful than the desire of man to rise above it.

328
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,892
The desire has to grow stronger. Then what is this? What are the powers of Satan?

329
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:23,892
Then nothing! They can be finished but if you want to vote for satanic law – have it!

330
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,892
It’s your desire, it’s your decision.

331
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,892
You have to decide now, the time has come, the moment has come for you decide what do you want.

332
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,892
It is very painful but it exists. Those who tell you there is no evil,

333
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:50,892
don’t believe that people, they must be the most sinisterly activating people.

334
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:00,892
Take it from Me, those who say like that.

335
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,892
I don’t want to be … [ambiguous, sounds like ‘skid’].

336
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:15,892
There are vultures, there are hooks and there are birds

337
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:33,892
which are hurt, which are tortured, which live in fear. It exists. What to do?

338
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,892
You have to just decide. Is for human beings to decide.

339
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,892
You can see that clearly when you have your realization, very clearly. Any question.

340
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,000
End
