00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.139
[UNCLEAR]

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.239
See born with you is the right achieve is yoga

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.740
This is yoga is the union

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.289
with the all-pervading

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.789
Divine love

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.590
so first

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.510
you have to

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.510
Take it as a hypothesis

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
But keep your mind open

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.090
If it exists there is a power

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.079
Which has come to us this knowledge has come to us from ancient times [UNCLEAR], and it stays

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.950
Right from Markendaya, Adi sankaracharya

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.770
Then we had 13th-century Dnyaneshwara

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.449
who described [UNCLEAR]

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.219
then we had Kabira, Janaka

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.519
Namadeva all of them all these saints sung the Sahaj Samadhi

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.540
He needs awareness the Samadhi mean where it is united with all pervading power

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880
This is our heritage

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.239
This cannot come from British. They're still primitive as far as

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.860
our spiritual life is concerned

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.909
It's so primitive that recently there was a big quarrel

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.119
Whether the women

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.350
should

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.789
Become the priest or not. I mean in India women is regarded as Sakthi

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.330
So I mean as far as the spirituality is concerned

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.149
They do not have much ideas

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.420
Now this is our heritage

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.719
from ancient times it has been with us

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
we had three types of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.290
you can say

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.949
Search by people

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.859
Three institutions you can say or three types of people were searching the truth, perhaps our country is so good that

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.130
We can live in a forest

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.049
See in India if you have to go out of the house takes half an hour to dress up yourself

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.399
we have to always fight with nature. Our country so congenial

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.749
The people could live in the forest they don't have to worry about all these outside things

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.909
And so this knowledge was you can say

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.589
One of three types first one by which they went into research

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.739
of all the creation

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.289
why these creation is done I mean all the material side of it, so that's how we had

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.539
Since now all the idea about all the Antariksha means all the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.069
Heavenly bodies that we call as [UNCLEAR] all these things they knew. the astrology has come from India

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.089
So they knew about the stars this is that everything

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.849
apart from that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.310
they wanted to

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.190
make the matter to work out

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.069
And hence he would do those of [UNCLEAR] all that

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:03.309
Because they wanted to utilize the matter as science. Just like science, but this time was different

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.708
Now people won't believe you saying we had vimanas and all that, but we have this worse

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.829
People won't believe, we are supposed to be most primitive people according to them, but we had all these sciences

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.079
gradually built-up by people because they wanted to excite through Mantras

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.419
those matters

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.789
there are words like Anu, Renu. Renu is the molecule and

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.919
Anu means Atom

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.720
so we had all these words within us we knew all these things

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.739
[UNCLEAR] in a way

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.019
This what one side they use Vedas. by using the Vedas it written that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.439
by reading this if you do not

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.110
get [Vidita?] Vidita is the word

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.640
Vidita means what?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.169
Vidita doesn't mean know through your brain it means you should know on your central nervous system

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.629
As you can see me and feel me in the same way you should be able to feel this all-pervading power

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.510
that is Vidita

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.780
another word

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.780
Bodha like Buddha. Bodha

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.289
both is the same that you should know it on your central nervous system that is Bodha

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.570
so this Vidha and Bodha

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.280
These things you should have if you are [UNCLEAR] you should get that

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.570
other [UNCLEAR]

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.780
So what was the thing is that scientists must be realised souls? They should be evolved souls?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.940
this was the thing

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.360
That came another type of worship they call it as left side worship is Bakthi

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.759
Because see people were not bother so much of Material things in India

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.660
So they were all searching

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:29.720
So they thought there is some higher power it works. We saw the saints and Saints told them that you make Bakthi

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.310
Bakthi a lot, by which you will keep your life [UNCLEAR]

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:43.370
These days Bakthi have no meaning because in the mouth to say something and do something else it's different in those days, they use to do Bakthi

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.359
By that we used to remember what they're supposed to

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.910
What is should be the lifestyle? What is good for you? What is bad for you?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.550
so this Bakthi started

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.280
But there was another third

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.590
this was called as [Nath?]

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.020
first one was right side another was left side, and this is in the center

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.779
And you'll be surprised, that in this Maharastra of yours this [UNCLEAR]

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.580
And [UNCLEAR]

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.670
they believed

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.680
In awakening that is residual power called Kundalani

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.660
By which they could transform themselves

00:07:54.719 --> 00:08:00.049
So this knowledge was mostly in Sanskrit language. 6th century Adi shankaracharya talked about it

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.210
But all in Sanskrit

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:13.639
general public did not [know?]

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.819
But also, there's a tradition at one guru will have only one disciple only one

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.580
Till the [crunch?] it

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:32.208
now this Guru nanaka came much later, but before that Janaka had only one disciple.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:48.200
His name was Nachiketa[UNCLEAR] then in the first century Gyneswara tremendous personality at the age of 20 what he has written

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.360
I mean I tell you people who anything about spirituality really can get lost tremendous

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.940
Now this Gyneswara asked permission from his Guru to his brother

00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:03.469
You should allow me at-least to write it

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.919
Gyneswari at least to write it

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.789
Tell them what it is in a way that I am not going to work it out

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:13.459
But let me tell the masses

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.849
So he wrote it Gyneswari the sixth chapter

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.660
six are there about Kundalini

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:26.509
But because you see [UNCLEAR] those who were in charge of religion?

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:33.979
could not accept it because they do it mean to so they said sixth chapter is [UNCLEAR] means to be abandon

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.470
not to be written

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.510
The whole thing went into another darkness

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:50.269
Because see in a moment fundamental said they need want something really come out

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.240
they didn't know what to do

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.370
All right

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.839
Then came after 16th century was full of saints

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:07.379
not only Maharastra everywhere

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:10.199
even in Punjab you know that

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:13.709
Guru nanak, Kabira

00:10:14.199 --> 00:10:18.959
[UNCLEAR] so many all over at the time of Shivaji there was

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.619
she all full of it and

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:26.878
they were talked about Kundalani. They asked

00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:33.160
[UNCLEAR]

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.969
How much time do you think Kundalini to rise?

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.269
So he said tatkSaNam that moment but the

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.110
there should be a person who is giver and  person who take it that moment

00:10:47.589 --> 00:10:54.089
So in that authority he should not go to that  modern writers about Kundalini these are our authorities

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:59.039
But as it is very few people got realisation

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:04.319
Kabira as throughout written about nothing

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:07.029
he says Surathi Kundalini called Surathi

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:11.368
can you imagine human beings how they are

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:14.429
Surathi is the name of

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:17.338
[Tabba?]

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.689
In Bihar where he they called Shruti tabbaa?

00:11:24.369 --> 00:11:26.369
She works in

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:33.629
then Kabira not only Kabira [UNCLEAR] he went from Maharastra to Punjab and Guru nanak respected him

00:11:39.429 --> 00:11:41.429
and he has written

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:45.209
Such a big book in Punjabi

00:11:46.179 --> 00:11:48.179
[UNCLEAR]

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:54.689
many of his poems are in [UNCLEAR] and also of

00:11:55.419 --> 00:11:58.349
[UNCLEAR]

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:01.619
[UNCLEAR]

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:07.559
Because Guru nanaka thought best is to collect all the verses from all these

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.230
saints and group them together

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.739
Not to write anything else, but what they said so keep it pure

00:12:14.529 --> 00:12:16.889
And that's how Namadeva

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.579
who try really learn Punjabi language, and he wrote all these things in Punjabi

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:31.380
That is how it came, but they all have talked about right Guru Nanak said Sahaja samadhi. so that is how it came

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.000
Sahaj samadhi lavo

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.659
we can say Sahaj means something spontaneous or easy

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:39.959
I have told you the meaning of the word Sahaj

00:12:44.589 --> 00:12:47.549
But everything is even it is in the book

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.230
I've seen that

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.420
People think by reading book you can get that sense

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.120
like this if you have headache

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:05.549
then I write down prescription take Anacin then you go on reading take Anacin take Anacin then headache won't go it will be worse even

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.370
It's like this so all these books you see has put limitations in [UNCLEAR]

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.879
But I've seen people who go on reading akhand ramayan akhand geeta part they go on reading

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.860
they go on akhand

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.270
What they have said, they have not seen in it

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.839
Nanaka Said [UNCLEAR] why are you going to the jungle

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.309
He says it is in with in you why are you going to Jungles?

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.969
So all the Saints had to suffer in a way

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.570
because nobody understood

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.739
See the bond has to be established nobody understood

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:05.529
So this Kundalini awakening

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:13.059
It's a residual power within us as you know we have three autonomous nervous system within us

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:20.409
One is left side Other is right side sympathetic and in the center we have parasympathetic nervous system

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.059
And whatever we have achieved in our evolutionary process as human being

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.969
Is Expressed by our central nervous system?

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:33.380
Alright

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:39.010
Like see if you want to take this dog to a dirty he can go we have

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.010
We have conception of beauty

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.700
We can see beauty we can understand colors he does not

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.299
So in evolutionary process whatever we have achieved is expressed in our central nervous system

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:07.309
Now it should be treated as hypothesis to begin with to see because you should not take it for granted at all

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.579
Now this Kundalini resides in the triangular bone

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.820
Which is called as sacrum

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.239
That means that the greek knew it's a sacred bone

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.539
It's a greek word sacred in greek word

00:15:27.329 --> 00:15:28.620
is

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.620
at the base of the

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.740
spinal chord there is a bone triangular

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.100
is lies with that

00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:40.578
And about that are six centers

00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:45.319
below that is one center

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:53.690
below that is the center

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:57.289
Which we call as Mooladhar

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.399
Because Kundalini is the Mool means a root

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.760
because is the support of root. Mooladhar

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:12.259
Now in the medical terminology and understand

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.550
that

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.990
the center of looks after on the physical side

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.890
Our pelvic plexus

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:32.990
Which deals or which functions or all of our excretion including sex

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.230
now this is

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.080
to be understood very clearly that it is like below the Kundalini

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.160
So sex does not play any part in rising its a very important point

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:19.390
Okay, people have

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.249
perverted the whole thing. I don't know all kinds of things that they have done

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.810
and they said that to the sex energy which has to increase

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.070
There's nothing like sex energy It's like any other energy

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.809
But only thing with that

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.130
this Energy is

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.580
used for a particular purpose of excretion or

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.870
communication

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:54.810
Of your desires or whatever it is, but it had nothing to do either ascending ascent of the Kundalini nothing to do

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.880
on the contrary

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.160
when the Kundalini awakened

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.400
this center absolutely stops

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.920
no excretion of any

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.490
You will be surprised sometimes I have program for 10 hours

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
11 hours I won't go to bathroom

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.430
It just stops

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:30.060
That's why Christ have said you have to become a children to enter it to the Kingdom because this is the innocence

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.969
Now this going little further

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.590
is that

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.270
on the center

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.770
is placed

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.770
the deity of Shri Ganesha

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.640
it has great meaning

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.200
What is Shri Ganesha how this is placed there all that suff we will learn

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.340
but I told this scientist in America

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.719
that this center is made of carbon atom

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.889
Carbon atom has got four leaves?

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.290
if you see

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.210
this center

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.329
has a carbon atom

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.899
you make the model out of carbon atom

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.050
Then you watch if you see this one, how many are you trained?

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.790
the

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.380
Scientist is here

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:40.660
So if you see it from right side on the left side what you see of that atom is Swastika

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.900
clearly

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.130
see

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.330
just show them they are journalist

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.469
[UNCLEAR]

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.760
So you see from left side the right side you see Swastika

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.320
Then you should go see them see from the left side to the right side you see Omkara

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.530
If you see from down upward then you see alpha and omega

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.840
Alpha and Omega

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.719
see now this I stated in one of my lectures these people immediately jumped on to it

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:53.290
They took a atom of carbon took the model made it how about the scientists cleaner now?

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.759
He's made this out of that beautifully made, but first they made huge myth?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:00.690
 

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.699
and what Christ has said I am the alpha and omega

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:14.859
In these symbols alpha Omega which we use in our mathematics are ancient

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.340
so Christ is

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.950
incarnation of

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.190
the Ganesha.. it a scientific proof

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.450
[UNCLEAR]

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.290
[UNCLEAR]

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:56.280
So Ganesha is an eternal child

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.369
That's why he has got trunk of elephant

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.359
Innocence is our innocence

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.740
so when the Kundalini rises

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.030
And she's awaken, she can be awaken

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.800
somehow I

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.570
Must say that

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.570
this Modern Sahaja yoga

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:31.499
Only thing if I discovered anything is this that?

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.350
amass awakening of the Kundalini amass

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.440
thousands can get it

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.780
That's all I will serve nothing much

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.750
This is very ancient science they used to do to one person two person

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.420
now it can be done amass

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.120
in Russia

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:59.340
We always have program in a big stadium 16000 minimum people

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:07.739
Practically everybody is released Russians are the best. I don't know what Communism has turned

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:15.209
They are not at all idioit. They're not American style

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.880
very straight forward and very introspective

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.310
Think he'll be stupid choices that democracy side you'll see

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.359
in America even a lock has to be different tiles

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.120
has to be different

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.220
door of the

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.010
car is differently handle is different

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:45.459
I mean if you get into their bathroom everything has to be different the choices are so maddening

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.730
And there are all the time busy. What should we do something more to show that wear something different

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.000
whole energy wasted these people

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:00.309
He provided for all material things because that make them a little lethargically careless

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:08.889
but on the whole there were not bothered about politics they didn't have to worry who coming to Chief Minister nothing

00:24:08.889 --> 00:24:10.730
so

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.730
see their attention was

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.539
introspective

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:19.809
And the whole thing are always be because if you see Dostoyevsky? or any one of the items

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.720
You have read Crime and punishment

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.590
You can see how introspective even the hero was

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:30.559
so wonderful knwoledge

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:36.788
These people that they even the hero introspect before falling in love why I'm falling in love

00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:43.148
What is the thing but it's wonderful so these people are very introspective and so in Russia it has become extremely

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.409
Extremely successful, but all other your gurus and all of them

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.380
And they have a sense also, I think

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.740
what is truth and what is not

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.009
Moreover if anybody who asks for money

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:09.200
They don't like they understand you can't sell spirituality they don't like

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.200
how you can't sell spirituality

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.729
Not in India even we don't understand this of course American's understand this

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.150
The more you charge the better it is

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.259
They would say like this is a these gurus are very good they have sale

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.239
It's all shopping its marketting

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.100
But they understood and we have now

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.610
200 doctors in Russia practising Sahaja yoga

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.680
and the scientists

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.560
300 of them invited

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:56.970
And when I talk about science, they said no more science we had enough we have reached the last end of it

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.670
We don't want anything of you you tell us about gods law

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.589
Divine laws please don't talk about science

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.489
They also he come like this is somebody here, but was working really well

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.850
So what happens when the Kundalini awakens?

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.980
it passes through

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:34.500
Six centers as I told you the first is establish is innocence. That's the support

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.890
Then it rises through six centers

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:48.209
now on the physical side we suffer because our centers are out of real

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.110
extreme living

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:05.579
So Kundalini what she does, these are the centers so the left and right sympathetic

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.159
they combine and form a center like this in the spinal chord

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.750
spinal chord

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:15.929
and what happens if you start thinking too much on right side because you are very futuristic planning time

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:20.519
Journalist use later like that and so we start would be more towards the right

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.480
All right those are very emotional type they go towards left

00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:31.979
Sometimes something can happen they just break and things like cancer [UNCLEAR] what you got?

00:27:32.769 --> 00:27:36.479
Psychosomatic diseases can be caused this kind of imbalance left

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.510
not that even if you are on the right or on the left if you go too far you might get those

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:45.449
Psychosomatic which are supposed to be incurable

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.900
Now this Kundalini what she does is she goes here and passes through here

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.190
just like we put the beats into threads

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.990
Into what you call threads in that it goes on threading all over

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.650
So she integrates our center

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.820
Let's see

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.820
Normally if you want to do something

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:35.350
You decide to do something, but really your intelligence will say no. Oh, maybe you're attention may not be there

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.460
and then you become an integrated personality

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.150
Whatever you do

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.520
With your heart with your brain

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.420
Complete integration. There's no problem

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:57.849
First is that but what is the outward manifestation is that

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:06.130
once she crosses over first dilatation of the pupils takes place isn't it kind of a

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.400
in

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.389
little shine in the eyes comes

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:26.539
And then it pierces through here, which is that fontanel bone area which in our language we call it Talu?

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.960
In Sanskrit its Talu

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.010
this thing suddenly opens out and it comes out and

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.710
That energy becomes one with the subtle energies all pervading power

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.760
So now first we have to accept one is that first truth is

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.559
That there is all-pervading power which does all the living work

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:11.240
We never questioned who does living work. How do we grow how does the seed becomes a tree we never questioned

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.910
accept it look at our eyes what a camera

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:23.479
Look at our brain what a computer?We never bother question from where do we get this is done by this all-pervading divine

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.530
second truth is

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.090
That you are not this body mind intellect  you're not because it's my intellect

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.180
You say my heart my body

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.540
What is yourself?

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.240
is the Spirit

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.939
So you are the Spirit the rest is my this my that. My mother my sister my house my body my eyes

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:58.069
So who is this my  - who is this I obviously saw through in this Spirit so this spirit

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.590
you have to become

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:08.120
So far your attention is on the body your attention is on your eyes and everything

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:10.790
then what happens as

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.400
if you watch a house from outside

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.050
the beginning and

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.580
Then they will go inside after inside you watch

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:27.589
So the whole awareness becomes very different

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:36.319
this we call Turiya in Sanskrit we call it as a Fourth dimension. We live in Three dimension. This is the fourth dimension we get

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.079
the fourth Dimension, what do we get in that dimension is?

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.460
firstly

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.069
you stand in your present

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:59.000
Now for Example you can think of the future or the past but in the present I say now be in the present you can't

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:06.919
So what happens you become thoughtlessly aware you're aware, but absolutely no thought

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:10.160
because thoughts come to

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.540
you

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.490
from the past

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.490
or from the future

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.910
In between these thoughts there is a little space

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.719
so when this Kundalini rises she

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.510
Makes that space, and that's the space is the present [UNCLEAR]

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:37.729
And spiritual life you grow only in the present because that's truth

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.030
You see the past is finished the future doesn't exist

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:48.469
But in the present in the reality now is sitting me to be if the reality just number is it you don't know what will

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.809
Happen in the future, or what her past finished

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.610
So first in your dimension you become thoughtlessly aware

00:32:58.049 --> 00:33:01.129
but the second thing that happens to very wonderful

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.190
That you start feeling

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.880
This all-pervading power on your fingertips

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.120
as very gently cool breeze on your finger tips

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.910
 

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:27.739
Adi sankaracharya has called Salilam Satyam even Christ has said cool breeze of the holy ghost

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Kundalini is the reflection

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.700
of

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.819
Adi Shakti or holy ghost in human beings

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.850
as a result of that you're all these

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:54.930
sympathetically system

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:59.389
You have an ending to the sympathetic nervous system the Left-hand side seven five

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.680
six and seven

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.680
five six and seven

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.989
So the left side is emotional side right side is your physical and mental side

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:18.469
we will give you the books so it is easy for you know then you can start feeling

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.939
Not only is power, but he start feeling others

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:30.019
Americans they called it Vibes  they don't know what they mean by Vibes very good vibes actually vibes

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:33.570
1972

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:40.640
Mr.. Charlie said mother you get all these things listed or something as for. He said, they're writing down all your thing that

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.220
is very good idea nothing wrong

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:50.329
Awakening has to be done now first of all the main thing

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.890
That has to be done if you just take my words and write it down. What is that?

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.910
I don't want to become the monopoly of that. It's very good [UNCLEAR]

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:01.759
The result of that okay now

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.320
feel the centers of

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.009
yourself so it's the self-knowledge and

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.560
You can feel

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.930
Center of others

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.300
on your finger tips

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:22.160
Can feel what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you. You don't have to tell anything you just know that this is wrong

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.630
now

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.630
somehow if I know

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.900
how to correct this centers you can be cured

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:37.340
But all this is is mental physical emotion all of them are due to this

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:44.719
And also spiritual problems, but if you put wrong gurus this that you get spiritual problems

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:49.790
False people

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.410
So a new dimension in your awareness comes

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.059
called as collective consciousness collective

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:09.030
Samuhik chetana

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.710
So now who is other

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:20.159
I Can feel you I can feel them and every eight so with them you become part and parcel of the whole

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.119
and then another great thing at the side

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.149
all your fingertips you can feel absolute truth

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:37.019
absolute truth which cannot be challenged

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.220
Absolute

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.190
Say you have ten children

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.459
they are realised soul and tie up their eyes

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.219
Ask them. What's the matter of this lady

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.089
they raise one finder. you ask the lady have you got throat trouble?

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.390
Is how you know?

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.790
because this finger is not right

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:07.439
Everybody will say the same. I'm in a program

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.870
one man came why everybody's asking what is your relationship with your father? What is really?

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.579
Why we bother with my father I said its the center you are catching on your heart

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.390
That's what they ask

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.329
Everybody asking they feeling it

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.720
So everybody feels the same

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:34.289
And you want to know about anybody say about Christ. Was he a son of God? Just put your hands like this. suddenly it flows!

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:43.199
But somebody is a thieves. or false man you put your hands

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.840
just even if he's not in here you get burnings you get these little

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:57.599
Things and he gets all you might even get sometimes you blisters so you become enlighten now imagine how fantastic

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:08.069
This is outside and inside you can completely transformed

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.979
We have people were supposed to be

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:34.360
Like burning fire as far as the temper was concern they become now like himalayas suddenly

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:43.659
People have changed apart from the health we of course

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.160
We have definitely seen

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.920
So many people world of blood cancer as ordinary cancer heart cancer so many. I mean there's so many them

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.820
Rahul? - really when asked he had a massive heart attack

00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:03.610
And he got cured with Sahaja yoga you won't believe he went to houston and doctor shouted him

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.190
So it is like that so many people have been cured

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.159
but it's far anybody's power which cures

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.159
It's your own this within you its your own power

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.080
as a result of that power

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:31.150
Which is actually is your own mother everybody has individual Kundalini own  mother and she gives you the new birth

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.120
She looks after you... so this Kundalini will not only cure your incurable disease so many have been cured that you won't believe that now we have doctor in every country practising Sahaja yoga.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.470
Third one

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.549
Third &amp; Fourth  both came from TM

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.529
Transmitting disease, but they developed

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:14.420
issues homesexual even after getting cured they went back to same habit. so they got it back

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:23.899
One fellow we still have who survived for 8 years for healthy is doing very well. He is in Australia

00:41:25.289 --> 00:41:29.929
The trouble with that age differences is they have no will power

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:41.850
see what you call center hearth means they are so insecure so insecure

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:48.569
That you see after getting cure also you have keep to certain [matya?]

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.540
you have to be

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.450
But they don't then then indulge into homosexuality

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.630
or

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.310
Outside will show we are like martyr

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.070
inside they are very weak

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.230
So it happens like that

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.369
If they really want live they can if they really want to work it out they can

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.479
But with Sahaja yoga you can never get AIDS that's one thing guaranteed

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.650
Because all your priority changes

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:32.790
in Sahaja Yoga the doctors are now

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.540
really nobody goes to any doctor

00:42:40.359 --> 00:42:46.049
He knows all these things, but the doctors are finished as far as sahaja yogi's are concerned

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.340
So at the most they might get some cold or something at most

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.389
But they are so healthy

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.260
They are so energetic that

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.929
You can't imagine how a person could be like that

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.100
[UNCLEAR]

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:17.219
she get too much cold and rash and all those what you call allergy and and all

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:24.330
Now is such a dynamic felow today he will be in Germany tomorrow in Japan he is so

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:28.590
So healthy and so happy and so relaxed

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.970
become absolutely a relaxed person

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.899
It's balanced balanced very much and above all compassion very compassionate. Now all these Sahaja yogis

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.450
they are swimming in ocean of Joy but what their headache is that mother why not have more people remain in ocean of Joy. I'm all the time travelling I went to south America I'm 70 years I'm travelling all over

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:16.950
all the time but what I'm going to do If people want to come I have to do this but if but people want to come I will have to but people they don't want to come what can I do? so this is trouble they so anxious more to come and they are running up and down all over the world they are running here to there. they are trying to find more people. Even in Maharastra we goto villages bringing people. so it a country wide propagation.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:20.250
But you see actually got detached about it that you don't worry about your health

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.419
you don't worry about your age  you don't even think of it

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.150
you feel very Young and all the time the active over this just don't feel for it

00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:40.200
There is no group like young, old. We all enjoyed together. Whatever maybe there is a small boy

00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:48.998
adult that doesn't exist. also that doesn't exist in religion as far as the outside religion nothing, for example we worship Rama

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.410
We worship Shri Krishna

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:56.049
Also, be worship Mohammad Saheb because he was Dattatreya. They don't know but we know

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.410
He was Dattatreya

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:07.239
And Fathima we worship because she came as Sita latter on, so we worship we know that

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.680
It's not just

00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:13.579
Sarva Dharma Sambhav

00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:19.629
Even Gandhiji was not like this the way these people work. Gandhiji in his prayers

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:24.039
I was with him from my child actually I helped him in writing his

00:46:25.339 --> 00:46:30.909
Sequels of [UNCLEAR] all about Kundalini we wrote. He was a realised soul

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:38.470
But we were fighting for freedom that time and he said without freedom what is the use of Spirituality

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:46.930
so Gandhiji

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:58.059
if he was living today he would have definitely helped me a lot. Even Lal bahadur shastri was a realised soul

00:47:01.009 --> 00:47:03.009
we are very unfortunate. we lost them

00:47:11.539 --> 00:47:13.539
Gurbachan?

00:47:15.169 --> 00:47:20.408
Gurbachan is realised soul? yes, he was a realised soul.

00:47:28.789 --> 00:47:30.789
But his wife you know you see?!. He is very high level person. Very good person. He has done his job.No doubt.

00:47:37.669 --> 00:47:39.669
so now this, I was tell you about

00:47:46.269 --> 00:47:48.269
Mohammed?

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.460
Gandhiji?

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.089
he was a realized soul, no doubt! and he

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:59.879
He was the one who believed in Sarva Dharma Sambhav

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.389
In his Sarva Dharma Sambhav

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.810
He made everyone worship

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.120
everyone

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.460
like Muslim

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.550
Maybe a congress man or anybody used to come to Ashram

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.879
He had to say the Mantras of Shri Ganesha

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.240
He have to take a Mantras of Vishnu

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.890
Saraswathi

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.319
You see it starts with the first of all

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:32.190
whatever in my my heart [UNCLEAR] resides the Spirit

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:37.829
See with the Spirit then he starts with Ganesh and every deity then he goes to the

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.849
Quran and you have to say the quranic and then you have to say also this

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.790
from the another

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.520
Farsi

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.290
Yes

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.290
all that matters

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.870
So you have to worship to all of them

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:04.050
He followed [UNCLEAR] said see if you just say Sambav means you don't worship why don't you worship?

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.000
Everybody should worship to follow them because they are different

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.420
They are not politicians or anything

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:18.119
They are not religious Christ has said those who are not against us, are with us.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.619
Even Mohammed saheb said also there have been 1 lac of Nabis

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:27.210
He respected Christ mother more than all Deity

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.710
Christ father

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.990
He says she's a holy woman

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.949
but Paul is the one who ruined Christianity

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.570
so much, we said

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.200
Human beings are very good ruining everything sublime or somehow or other they manage it.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.960
if you see through a essence of christ

00:49:56.670 --> 00:50:01.309
As I told you now, alpha and omega, Christ resides in our Agnya chakra

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.340
on the six center. Christ very important

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.159
yeah, on the optic chiasm.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:28.260
There is on one side is the pituitary and the another side is

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:30.250
the

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.250
pineal body

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.550
pituitary looks after our Ego

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.450
of the whole of up down working

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:43.949
And the pineal body towards our conditionings

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:54.270
In Chinese its Yin, Yang

00:50:56.230 --> 00:51:03.360
So one is Ego and another is Super ego

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.410
psychological terminology

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:13.139
So one is the ego and another is the conditioning so these two balloons go up like this gradually

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:16.950
so when they cover us we are cut off

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:23.429
as children Beyond one, but we don't feel but we are one, but when the Kundalini connect us

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:31.529
then only you can feel it. Now you see for example this instrument or whatever you have to put it to the mains otherwise it doesn't work

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.940
So you can call this as Kundalini

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:39.480
Which is in a coil?

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:44.100
And some other threads come up open Sahastrara and conects

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.280
It's subtle very subtle

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.150
How do we live?

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.700
we live in three Dimensions

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.430
like I

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.900
Am here, and I'm looking at the mirror

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:18.409
So I'm the one who is observing my reflection is what I'm observing

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:25.040
There is a action of observance, so there is the observer

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:31.070
observed and also the observance, which is the Kriya

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.419
activity that we live in this three

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.679
But supposing you become the mirror

00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.880
suppose

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.920
Then all these things drop out

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:54.590
This is what is called witness state where you just watch,

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.890
the whole thing is Drama

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:03.859
But when we are not realised we get lost in the drama

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:17.090
[HINDI]

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:19.090
[HINDI]

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:23.390
[HINDI]

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.910
[HINDI]

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:28.740
so we become

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.860
Ourselves means we know ourselves

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.650
we don't have to take the mirror, we know ourself

00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:38.750
to know yourself is the only point

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.899
And this is our heritage

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:57.289
this is the import point we Indian must understand. when they come you know they come and touch our mother land and say Namaskar

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:04.489
Some of them kiss these foreigners

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.999
the respect! Because they know what it is. I send them to Devagudu Thukaram place

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.470
and

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.850
other Sahaja yogis told me that mother they are rolling on the ground

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:22.669
so I said what were you doing, they said mother all over mother earth this vibrations coming out. so we are rolling on-it.
