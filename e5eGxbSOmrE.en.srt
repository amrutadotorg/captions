00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,230
[UNCLEAR]

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,168
Presenter: Okay, so as Niger said, I
will tell you about the Medical aspects of

3
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:17,867
Sahaja yoga and as we heard Sahaja yoga is a
spiritual method but it has been associated

4
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:23,374
with health benefits. So, I will tell you
of the effect of the working on the brain,

5
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:28,110
on your health and on diseases - mental
and physical diseases.

6
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:36,336
First of all, what is meditation? And Niger has
already explained, more or less, what
meditation is.

7
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:41,793
I would just say a few more words. So, if
you read Oxford dictionary, it says that,

8
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:48,278
meditation is thinking in silence. Now first
of all, you cannot think aloud and secondly,

9
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:54,237
thinking is, of course, the exact opposite of what
meditation is, as originally conceived in the East.

10
00:00:54,608 --> 00:01:00,428
So meditation - Patanjali was one of the first
to talk about meditation and he said that,

11
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:05,176
"Meditation is the cessation of thinking."
It's the stopping of your thoughts,

12
00:01:05,176 --> 00:01:10,613
it's the control of your thoughts, the
control of your attention. In the West, we

13
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:16,530
we know there are three states of consciousness
- the sleeping, dreaming and thinking

14
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,977
but in the East - and we think that thinking
is the higher state of consciousness -

15
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:25,663
but in the East, it's very common knowledge
that there's another state of consciousness.

16
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:29,544
It's called the fourth state of consciousness
- Turiya awastha - and the fourth

17
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:34,611
state of consciousness is the state of
thoughtless awareness - mental silence,

18
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:41,425
where you learn to stop your thinking and
this process of stopping your thinking has

19
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:47,786
amazing benefits, at the subjective level
but also objectively and you feel, when

20
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:53,995
your thoughts are stopped, you feel a
happy, you feel joy and depending on the

21
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:59,309
intensity, you can feel Absolute Bliss. So,
there's several subjective correlates what you

22
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:05,680
feel when you meditate, which are listed here
and which, however, have health implications.

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,129
And as I said before, in the West, we are
not really interested in spiritual things

24
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,548
but we are very much interested in our health
and in fact, we're obsessed with our health.

25
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:19,344
And it's the health benefits, which have actually
attracted all the interest in Western Science.

26
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:23,763
So, over the last years, there has been a
lot of studies on meditation because people

27
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:29,838
have realized meditation, actually, leads
to better health. And, so what you feel when

28
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:35,547
you meditate, you feel an overwhelming
calmness and there is a calmness which

29
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:41,751
goes much more beyond normal relaxation
because when we relax, you relax the body

30
00:02:41,751 --> 00:02:46,153
and if you lie in the sofa, you may be
relaxed but, if you worry about the future,

31
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:51,455
you're not really relaxed. So, when you're
thoughtless, you don't just relax the body

32
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:56,550
you also relax the mind and your brain and
you cannot do it with any other way, you

33
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,432
can only do it by stopping to think,
stopping to worry about the future,

34
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:06,457
stopping to ruminate about the past and
be in the present. So, this overwhelming

35
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:13,277
feeling of peace within, calmness, is associated
with stress relief and I'll show you later, how.

36
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:19,817
When you're mentally silent, you have a
better mental balance and this is because,

37
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:24,364
if you think about it, all mental disorders
are actually characterized by thought disorder,

38
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:29,125
thought problems. If you have Schizophrenia,
you have paranoid thoughts. If you're, Obsessive

39
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,533
Compulsive, you have obsessive thoughts.
If you're ADHD, you have racing thoughts

40
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:38,589
and if you're depressed, you have negative
thoughts which ruminate, which you ruminate about.

41
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,861
So, it has also been shown, that all
disorders, all mental disorders, they have

42
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:48,910
more mental clutter. This has been shown
over recent years and meditation, of course,

43
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,450
is a reduction of their mental clutter because,
that's what it is, you stop your thinking, so

44
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,160
you have no mental clutter or you have less
mental clutter. So therefore, mental silence

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,417
is a state of super mental balance more
than normal people have, so because if you

46
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:07,960
meditate and you have less mental clutter
than a normal person, you're super healthy

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,955
and super balanced mentally. When you don't
have any thoughts, you're much more
concentrated

48
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:18,725
and and you're much more alert because
you're pure consciousness without the content,

49
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:23,210
[UNCLEAR] the thought and emotions and if you
go through life, the whole day you throw out

50
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,242
your thoughts and your emotions into the
world and you don't really see reality as

51
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:31,924
it really is because you constantly, you 
have the intermediation of your thoughts

52
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:37,881
and your emotions. So, when you have no
thoughts, you much more, you absorb reality

53
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:42,066
as it really is. So for example, if you're
now listening to me, you may be thinking

54
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:46,191
of the dinner later and you may have to
inhibit your thoughts in order to actually

55
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:51,254
listen or attend. If you have no thoughts,
you absorb information much quicker.

56
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:55,641
And it has been shown, that children who
meditate, have better attention at school

57
00:04:55,641 --> 00:05:00,460
same with this, who meditate for long time,
have better attention and it has been

58
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,278
associated with better productivity at 
work because of your more concentrate and

59
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:10,636
have no mental clutter, you're actually more
focused. Another very interesting feature,

60
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:14,830
which I've said before, when you have no
thoughts, you feel happy, you feel bliss,

61
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:22,535
you feel joy and this of course, if you 
have these positive emotions through your

62
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:27,110
meditation because it's so peaceful and
so pleasant a state of mental silence,

63
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,977
then you carry this over into daily life
and this leads to more positive emotions

64
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:38,540
and positive emotions, of course, protect you
against depression, anxiety, effective disorders

65
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,393
and is, of course, very good for you
and you have less negative thinking.

66
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,612
Last but absolutely not least - to me this
is the most important aspect of meditation

67
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:55,676
- you achieve a state of emotional detachment,
you enter witness state, where actually go

68
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:59,909
beyond your thoughts because you're no
longer thinking and you no longer having

69
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:04,843
your emotions but you see them from a
stepping back witness state but we call it

70
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:09,573
in Psychology a Meta cognitive awareness,
where you're beyond your thoughts and you

71
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:14,651
can observe them and that's, I think, the
most important thing of meditation,

72
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:19,530
most important aspect and if you remember,
Buddha went out to find meditation because

73
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:24,320
He realized that a lot of suffering in the
world and how do you deal with the suffering?

74
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,860
You cannot control the life events; We
all have negative life events. You know,

75
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,873
your parents will die eventually, people
you love may die, you may have a divorce

76
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:37,591
Whatever happens to you, you cannot really
control those life events but what you can

77
00:06:37,591 --> 00:06:42,350
control is, how you actually deal with those
life events and how you perceive them.

78
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,478
You can control your state of mind and
your thoughts and your emotions and that

79
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,764
we do via meditation and that's the only
way. Only through meditation you can

80
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:57,663
actually enter a witness state which makes
you emotionally more resilient and I think

81
00:06:57,663 --> 00:07:02,116
this is the most important aspect of
meditation because who wouldn't want to be

82
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:07,180
happy and stay through life in a, sort of,
serene, happy, joyful way without being

83
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,751
carried away on a roller coaster of emotions
constantly depending on what happens to you.

84
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:19,872
So, I think, this is crucial and of course, the
state of meditation, of thoughtless awareness,

85
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:25,966
you may have seen and it has been described
in all mystical traditions of all cultures.

86
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:32,233
Here just a few names - Nirvana, Sahaj
Samadhi, Satori, Yoga - which means union,

87
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:39,830
Zen, Tao and in the West we had our own
meditation, our own tradition of mental silence,

88
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,893
which were the Christian Gnostics and
'gno' which means, of course, knowledge -

89
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:48,388
which means the knowledge of your Self and
your Self - you're not just this thoughts

90
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:52,921
and these emotions but you're different
thing, you're actually a spiritual person,

91
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:59,508
which can go beyond the thoughts and
emotions. So, the claims I would try to

92
00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:05,352
prove to you today and show you medical
evidence, is that meditation, in fact, has
an effect on

93
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:10,724
the body because mental silence reduces
stress and it activates the Para Sympathetic

94
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:16,306
Nervous System, which restores bodily
functions. I will show you that meditation

95
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:21,996
has an effect on the brain and mental
silence is a different state of consciousness,

96
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:27,716
you activate different areas of the brain
of deep attention, of positive emotions

97
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:34,848
and thus you release happy chemicals which
make you joyful. Now, meditation is a

98
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,628
good way to prevent illness because mental
silence leads to better physical and

99
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:44,752
mental health and lastly, I will show you
that you can use it as a therapy. So, if

100
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:49,827
you have any mental or physical problems,
you can actually solve them with meditation.

101
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:58,754
So, what happens in the body? And first
of all, we have already seen a bit of a

102
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:04,472
explanation of the chakra chart over here
and what you will see here - we'll just stop

103
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:10,190
this for a moment - this is the Central
Nervous System here. The Central Nervous System,

104
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,305
this is the spinal cord, this is the brain
and the limbic area of the brain is quite

105
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:18,532
important because I will talk about it later,
lies within the brain in the middle and

106
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:24,135
this is the center of emotion and motivation.
So this is the Central Nervous System.

107
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:29,736
What you will see next, is actually the Autonomic
Nervous System, which is also depicted here.

108
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:37,327
This is the Central channel, this is the Left
and the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

109
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:44,291
So these aren't just some sort of fancy lines
but these are actually, they correspond to

110
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:49,325
Medical System and in any Medicine book
you can read after Autonomic Nervous System

111
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:54,520
consists of the Left and Right Sympathetic
Nervous System and the Para Sympathetic

112
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,379
Nervous System and I will explain later a bit
more what it is. Sorry, let's watch the movie.

113
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:10,429
So, this is the Left and Right Sympathetic
Nervous System and the middle channel is,

114
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:15,180
corresponds to the Para Sympathetic
Nervous System and the Spiritual Energy

115
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,610
we have inside, when we meditate, actually
passes through all these nerve plexuses,

116
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:26,445
so this is the Solar Plexus, this is the
Cervical Plexus and it enters the Limbic

117
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:31,662
area of the brain and when it enters the limbic
area of the brain, we become thoughtless.

118
00:10:35,372 --> 00:10:42,362
All these different chakras, they
correspond to the nerve plexusus
and to the endocrine system.

119
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,360
So, the Sympathetic Nervous System and the
Para Sympathetic Nervous System are very

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,385
important and they need to be in balance.
So in daily life, you are either in this,

121
00:10:56,385 --> 00:11:00,442
what is called a, fight or flight mode,
you activate the Right or Left Sympathetic

122
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,178
Nervous System - one is important for
action, one is important for inhibition -

123
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:10,176
and in the night when you sleep, you activate
the Para Sympathetic Nervous System.

124
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:14,918
So, this system relaxes and restores all
the bodily functions, while the other one

125
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:19,588
is important for daily activities. Now,
they have to be in balance. So if you think,

126
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:23,710
you can survive with 4 hours of sleep
a day, then you're sadly mistaken,

127
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,113
you pay it later with your health for this
habit because it is important that your

128
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:35,410
body gets restored. So, the Sympathetic 
Nervous System is activated in daily activities

129
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,660
and the more stressed you are, the more it
is activated. So what it does, it supplies

130
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:46,261
a maximum blood to all the muscles for
the daily activities, the stress hormones

131
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:53,210
are increased, there is more, the lungs the
passages are dilated, you have increased

132
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,550
heart rate and, if you're constantly
stressed, it may actually affect your heart

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:04,501
and during the rest, when you activate the
Para Sympathetic Nervous System, then the

134
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:10,195
opposite happens and you have a decreased
heart rate, more blood is given to all the

135
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:14,940
organs, which restores all the bodily
functions which you have wasted in the day

136
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,845
and there is decreased activity of stress
hormones and the digestion is stimulated.

137
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,890
So, what research has shown, that meditation
activates the Para Sympathetic Nervous System

138
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,484
more than rest. So that means, you enter
a state of hyper-rest, which is better than sleep

139
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:40,638
and this has been shown in many, by many
studies conducted in India and in Australia.

140
00:12:40,878 --> 00:12:46,218
So what happens is, there is a decrease
in heart rate, there is a decrease in the

141
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:51,478
breathing rate, there is a decrease
in pulse rate, in blood pressure,

142
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:56,699
in Oxygen metabolism - and this is anti-
ageing - and there's a decrease in other

143
00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:01,997
Physiological parameters of stress. And I'll
show you a few examples. So, this is the

144
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:08,898
Blood Pressure in people who have - the
control is the red line - so, these people

145
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:14,050
doing 20 minutes rest, nothing really
happens. These are people, who have

146
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:19,987
meditated for four weeks, so after 20 minutes
of meditation only, the blood pressure goes down

147
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:25,276
and those who meditated for 8 weeks, have
a stronger effect and those who meditated

148
00:13:25,276 --> 00:13:30,169
for 12 weeks, have a really strong health. So in
other words, if you have High Blood Pressure,

149
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:37,810
you can reduce it by meditation. This is
the heart rate. Again, the controls and again,

150
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,847
the more practiced the people are in
meditation, the more the heart rate goes down.

151
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,134
This is, of course, very good, it protects
your heart, if you constantly have a

152
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:51,155
reduction in heart rate on a daily basis.
That's very good for you and, of course,

153
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:58,189
all the other measures as well. This is a study
by Dr. Chung from Philadelphia University and she

154
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:03,879
took people who had Hypertension and she
gave them one week of intensive meditation.

155
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,968
They had to meditate in a Meditation hospital
everyday for, I don't know, 8 hours or so

156
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:17,154
and the blood pressure, the High Blood Pressure
went down significantly in the meditators

157
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:21,970
but not in the controls, who were getting
normal treatment in a normal hospital.

158
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:27,525
So meditation is far better and only after
one week you can reduce your Hypertension,

159
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:35,377
which is quite impressive. So in conclusion,
the state of mental silence reduces Sympathetic

160
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:40,803
activity and what that means, it enhances
Para Sympathetic activity, which restores

161
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:45,501
and restores all your bodily functions
and de-stresses the body.

162
00:14:46,743 --> 00:14:50,873
Now another very curious phenomena,
which if you may have noticed,

163
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:54,242
if you meditated with us for a while,
and if you knew, you

164
00:14:54,242 --> 00:14:58,441
will feel it at the end when we have the
meditation. When you achieve the state of

165
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:04,293
mental silence, you feel a cool breeze on
the hands and on top of the fontanel area

166
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:10,194
and the fontanel is called fontanel because
it comes out like a fountain. So, this cool breeze

167
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:14,340
is described in the Bible, for example, it's
called a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and

168
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:19,356
Holy Ghost of course, means your own Spiritual
energy and studies have actually shown that

169
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:23,673
this isn't just something you imagine
because sometimes people say, when we ask

170
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:27,127
you, "Do you feel cool breeze?" you know
they think that they have to say, yes to

171
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:31,233
please you. They think, you sort of,
suggesting it and that's why they feel it.

172
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:36,110
This is not true. Studies have shown this
is people during the rest period and in

173
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,753
the rest period the temperature of the hand
actually goes up a little bit, that's normal

174
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:46,087
but in meditation the temperature goes
down significantly and this has been shown

175
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:52,089
on the hands and on the top of the heads and
some people I feel it on the feet for example also.

176
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:59,321
I think, it can also be on the feet. So in
conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation activates

177
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:03,786
the Para Sympathetic Nervous System
and this restores your bodily functions.

178
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:11,132
Now, what about the brain? And, of course,
the brain is important because if you can show

179
00:16:11,132 --> 00:16:16,032
that meditation leads to different activation
of the brain, then you have proof that it's

180
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:20,483
not just thinking but it's something else.
Then you prove you're actually, in fact,

181
00:16:20,483 --> 00:16:25,715
entering an altered state of consciousness
and that's crucially important. So, there

182
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:32,778
have been several brain imaging studies.
This is a study done by Simon Guluchekin

183
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:38,888
from Washington University and what he
showed is that, when people meditate, there is

184
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:45,463
an activity, a very slow wave of activity coming
from the limbic system called Theta activity.

185
00:16:46,717 --> 00:16:54,027
This activity is there when you are in deep
focused attention and has been associated

186
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:59,645
with creativity and this activity was sort
of focused on the Frontal and Parietal areas,

187
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:04,669
which are areas of deep attention. The
next study was a study using MI, which is

188
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:11,282
a better result study and which I was in Boston
and this was done by Dr. Sakeo Eknumbis,

189
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:18,910
so he used this MI scanner. To input people
in this scanner, they had to meditate for,

190
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:25,970
I think, about 20 minutes and in the initial stages
of meditation, the meditators activated the

191
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,714
same regions you've seen before, so the
right Frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.

192
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:36,428
So this is a special, is a key area for deep
attention and also for inhibition because

193
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:40,559
when you start to meditate, you inhibit
your thoughts, so you activate this area

194
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,041
for inhibition but what is interesting is, it
was in both sides of the hemispheres but

195
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:51,828
as they went deeper into meditation, the
activation became progressively more reduced

196
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:56,366
and then, as they go into a deep state of
meditation, there's hardly any activity left

197
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,861
in the brain - they have just have a little bit
activity here on the right of the Frontal lobe,

198
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:06,477
which is this area of deep attention. So,
in other words, in meditation, you achieve

199
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:16,339
a state of deep attention, of concentrated relaxed
activity, which is mediating deep concentration.

200
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:24,863
What they also measured then, the effect of SP
pulse, stop having thoughts they feel joy,

201
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:30,174
they feel bliss and as they feel more and
more bliss, again they get this Theta activity

202
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:34,405
which comes from the limbic system and it
focused over the Left Frontal lobe, which

203
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:39,295
is the key area of positive emotions. So,
essentially what the studies are showing,

204
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:44,824
that, in fact when you meditate, you activate
areas of attention and of positive emotions

205
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:51,957
and this is of course, the objective correlate
of this Sanskrit denomination of meditation,

206
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:57,099
which is Sat Chit Ananda, which means,
being pure attention and pure joy.

207
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:03,508
And just to show you here the limbic system.
The limbic system consists of seven nuclei,

208
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:08,159
which is also interesting because we have
seven chakras and this is the limbic system

209
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,404
deep in the brain. So, this is what you
activate when you are in meditation and it

210
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:22,313
gives you joy and happiness. Another very
important thing Dr. Simon Guluchegik found is

211
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:27,833
that, when people meditate there is less
mental clutter and this slide which is there

212
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:33,349
just so that but essentially this is showing
chaotic complexity - in the brain you have

213
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,818
sort of, complex chaotic firing but, if 
you have less chaotic firing, it means you

214
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:42,798
have less mental clutter and this chaotic
firing, as I said before, the mental clutter

215
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,051
is increased in people with Schizophrenia,
depression, autism, ADHD. And these are

216
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:52,250
normal people during rest and these are
meditators - so the meditators have

217
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,864
significantly less mental clutter and that
is very important because it means, they

218
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,341
have better mental balance.

219
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:06,523
This is not, a Sahaja yoga meditation but
some people found that people who practice

220
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:12,283
some Buddhism, have not just, what I showed
you before, was the activation of the brain

221
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:16,505
this is the structure of the brain, so this
has a long time affect on the structure

222
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:22,967
of the brain, so a long time Buddhist meditators
have Sacra Cortex, in the same region we've

223
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:27,460
seen before, which are activated, which
are these attention areas, especially this

224
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,652
here Right Frontal region and further more
but it's very important, they have normally,

225
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:39,176
the thickness of this cortex reduces for
rest of your age. Now these are the normals

226
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:44,163
but in the meditators this process is
delayed. So this suggests that, meditation

227
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:50,087
is anti-ageing and actually, leads to a
delay of the normal ageing process of

228
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:55,500
those attention regions. And of course, if you
think about it, meditation is attention training.

229
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,468
If you sit for half an hour and you actually
concentrate and try to inhibit your thoughts.

230
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:09,544
So, what happens at the chemical level
in the brain? And I think, this becomes

231
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:14,890
very exciting. We have in the brain, so
called, opioid receptors and they're called

232
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:22,247
opioid receptors because opium binds to them,
morphine binds to them and these opioids

233
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:28,150
you can also release from within and a
better endorphins they're attached to these

234
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,275
opioid receptors and better endorphins are
released when you're in love or when you do

235
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:37,974
sports but they're also released through
meditation. And this is very interesting

236
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:45,775
because this could explain why actually
people, get, of course feel the joy and

237
00:21:45,775 --> 00:21:49,380
the happiness, apart from the activation
of the limbic system, which I've shown before

238
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,199
but it also, you release happy chemicals
in the brain. What is interesting as well,

239
00:21:55,199 --> 00:22:01,506
is those opioids of course, those better
endorphins, they enhance the immune system

240
00:22:01,506 --> 00:22:06,728
and they have shown to slow down cancer
cells. So, this could explain, why some people

241
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:12,287
can be cured with meditation from severe
diseases, like cancer because if you

242
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:16,972
have a continuous release of better Endorphins,
which strengthen your immune system, slow down

243
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:22,957
cancer cells, then this can easily explain
it and therefore this is not a miracle cure

244
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:30,084
but is actually, can be explained. Other
studies have shown that meditation releases

245
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:36,454
Dopamine. This is also released through
Cocaine or Amphetamines, so this is

246
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:41,365
another drug, which is important, another
substance, which is important for feeling pleasure.

247
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:47,064
So this explains, why people who meditate,
actually, get addicted to meditation because you

248
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:54,401
get this constant high in your brain without paying
all the side effects of drugs, so you can actually

249
00:22:54,401 --> 00:23:02,275
achieve a state of pleasant, sort of, joy
continuously. And other meditations have

250
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:06,754
shown that they increase in Serotonin;
This is a drug, which is typically allowed

251
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:11,232
in depression, so this could explain why
meditators are less likely to be depressed.

252
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:16,435
Melatonin, which is important for sleep
and also strengthens immune system,

253
00:23:16,435 --> 00:23:21,800
so again, this could again explain why people
when they meditate, they find you can sleep

254
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:29,213
far easier and again it can enhance your
immune system. And GABA, which is important

255
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:33,347
for cognitive functions like attention and
there is a decrease in stress hormones.

256
00:23:39,436 --> 00:23:45,976
So, the last study I want to tell you about
on the brain, is actually a study which

257
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:51,624
was the very first to prove that meditators
are more detached. And I like to study a lot

258
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:56,163
because this is the only one actually tried
to prove this point; And this was done again

259
00:23:56,163 --> 00:24:00,561
by Dr. Simon Guluchekin from Washington
University. What he did, he showed

260
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:05,135
meditators and non-meditators a really
horrible movie, which is called Funny Games

261
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:11,217
by Michael Hanake. If you've seen that movie,
it's, it's - I have not been able to watch it

262
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:17,764
but it's actually a, it's supposed to show
cruel and to show the violence in our society.

263
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:24,830
So it's a video of two, movie of two psychopathic
teenagers, which go into a house and
they kill everybody.

264
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,340
They start by the dog, then the woman, then
the kids and then the father. So, this movie

265
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:36,990
is really quite terrible and they show this
movie to this poor people and as you can see,

266
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,526
the blue are the controls, the red are the
meditators and at the subjective
psychological level,

267
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:50,008
so this out the negative emotions, so the
controls have far more negative emotions,

268
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:55,484
so they felt more disgust, more anxiety,
more sadness, more happiness after watching

269
00:24:55,484 --> 00:25:00,006
the movie and the red ones are the
meditators, so they had much less

270
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:06,101
negative emotions than the non-meditators.
Then he measured on the skin. When you're

271
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:10,952
stressed, you have more sweat on the skin, so
you can measure the level of stress level at the

272
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:17,488
body and at the skin level, the meditators
had significantly less skin response than

273
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:22,057
the controls, so at both the levels, the
meditators also were less affected by this

274
00:25:22,057 --> 00:25:27,920
negative movie. Lastly, he measured the
brain and this is the gamma activity.

275
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:35,058
Gamma activity is released when you have
very intense emotions. So during the rest,

276
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:39,368
the meditators and the controls didn't
differ but after the movie, the controls

277
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:44,073
have this high gamma activity. There's
really high gamma activity, so they were

278
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:48,743
really stressed out at the brain level by
the movie while the meditators kept their

279
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:53,708
cool as well at the brain level. So in other
words, the meditators kept their cool

280
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:58,301
at the psychological level, they were less
affected at the body level and less

281
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:02,987
affected at the brain level. And this, I
think, is absolutely crucial because this

282
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:09,405
is sort of proof that meditation makes me
more detached and more able to cope with

283
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:16,105
stress and negative events. And as I said before,
this is important because it improves your

284
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:24,602
emotional resilience. So, in conclusion,
the state of mental silence is associated

285
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:30,435
with relaxed brain activity of deep
attention and positive emotions, it increases

286
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:35,614
happy chemicals which stabilize your mood
and your effort and it makes people more

287
00:26:35,614 --> 00:26:40,739
more detached at the psychological, at
the brain and at the body level.

288
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:48,919
Now, what about the effect on your health?
This is a very interesting study by

289
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,748
Dr. Ramesh Manocha from Australia and he
test the 350 Sahaja yoga meditators and he

290
00:26:55,748 --> 00:27:01,125
compared them to a group of people, a mixed
group who practiced all sorts of meditation -

291
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:06,857
Hatha yoga, Mindfulness meditation and
so on and the Australian normal and the

292
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:11,497
normal consisted of thousands of people.
What he found is, the Sahaja yoga meditators

293
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:16,801
were better in their general health, in their
social function and in their mental health.

294
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,842
They weren't better in the physical function
but that's because Sahaja yoga is not a sport.

295
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:28,553
Then he tested, what is it what makes them
better? So he tested, is it the hours they meditate,

296
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:33,955
is it the amount of mantras they say, is
it how many meetings they attend and

297
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:41,592
nothing was related to the benefits other
than one thing and that was the frequency

298
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:46,992
of their mental silence. So this is what 
works. And here you see the national average.

299
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:53,362
Here you see people who meditate but they
only become thoughtless less than once per

300
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:57,969
month - they have no benefit. Here are the
ones who are thoughtless once or twice

301
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:03,243
per month - no benefit but here are the
ones who are once or twice thoughtless and

302
00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:07,743
you see they are significantly better in their
mental health than the National average.

303
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:12,936
Here the ones, who are once or twice
per day mentally thoughtless - they are

304
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:17,005
also much better and the ones who are
thoughtless several times per day,

305
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:22,568
they are, just have an amazing mental health,
as you can see here. So, in conclusion, is

306
00:28:22,568 --> 00:28:27,764
the state of mental silence which works,
nothing else. But what this means also,

307
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:32,434
that means, if you meditate, you need to
find a meditation which teaches you to

308
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:37,819
achieve the state of mental silence. So
for example, Mindfulness meditation may be

309
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:43,283
very nice but it's not teaching you to empty
your mind, it's not, we're doing mind emptiness;

310
00:28:43,283 --> 00:28:49,259
Mindfulness is mind fullness - you concentrate
on your thoughts but you really need to have,

311
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:54,192
you need to practice the meditation which teaches
you to achieve the state of mental silence

312
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:59,546
otherwise you have no health benefits. We
found exactly the same on general health.

313
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:03,703
So this is physical and mental health, so
exactly the same. This is the average,

314
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:10,003
these are people who are thoughtless several
times per day, a significant improvement of

315
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:16,485
their general health and so on. And then
here, if you say and if you meditate for

316
00:29:16,485 --> 00:29:20,186
years, you never go thoughtless, you
may also not have benefits. So you only

317
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:27,619
have to try a bit harder to get there.
Then he measured exactly the same on a

318
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:32,186
questionnaire, which picks up anxiety and
depression in the population and what he

319
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:37,269
found is the yogis were significantly
less distressed on this questionnaire, so

320
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:42,151
they're far less likely to be anxious and
depressed and again the benefits were

321
00:29:42,151 --> 00:29:47,341
associated with the frequency of the thoughtless
awareness. So here you can see those, who are

322
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:53,062
several times per day thoughtless - they
are in very low risker degrees - so these

323
00:29:53,062 --> 00:30:00,455
people will never become depressed or
anxious and then it goes down so, the less

324
00:30:00,455 --> 00:30:04,526
often you achieve thoughtless awareness,
the less protected you are against

325
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:11,969
depression and anxiety. This is a study
by Simon Guluchekin, where he looked at

326
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:18,171
the personality of yogis versus personality
of non-yogis, he found that the meditators are

327
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:24,492
significantly less depressed, significantly
less neurotic, have less paranoid thoughts,

328
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:30,065
less anxious and less difficulties in
identifying and expressing emotions;

329
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:36,893
So these are the long term effects. So, in
conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation has a

330
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:41,571
significant effect on your health but the
benefits are associated with the state of

331
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:46,310
mental silence. So that's the key thing
and that's what you should be aiming for -

332
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:53,735
the more often the better. Now, what are
the effects on the illness and of course,

333
00:30:53,735 --> 00:31:00,266
we've seen that in meditation you have
less mental clutter, so obviously your, it

334
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:05,293
seems logical that meditators should have better
mental health and this is exactly what has

335
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:10,571
been found. This is a study by Dr. Arthur
Morgan, in Exeter University.

336
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:16,182
He took a group of people with depression
and he gave them Sahaja yoga meditation

337
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:21,785
nothing or the treatment you get and
energies called cognitive behavior therapy

338
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:25,944
and this treatment is supposed to work
but in this study it didn't work but

339
00:31:25,944 --> 00:31:30,490
Sahaja yoga meditation worked significantly
better, as you can see and that was only

340
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,815
significant improvement, so the depressed
people became significantly less anxious

341
00:31:35,815 --> 00:31:41,325
after six weeks of Sahaja yoga meditation,
less depressed and they have less

342
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:50,063
general mental illness. This is a study on
anxiety by Dr. Chung from Philadelphia University

343
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:57,663
and she gave sixty-six Sahaja yoga meditators
and controls. They had, she gave the meditators

344
00:31:57,663 --> 00:32:03,339
very intensive one week treatment in the
meditation hospital and as you can see,

345
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:08,371
the meditators significantly improved in
their anxiety while the controls got their

346
00:32:08,371 --> 00:32:13,197
normal hospital treatment and they actually
became worse and the difference was, of course,

347
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:18,675
highly significant. So, meditation was much
better than the traditional hospital treatment,

348
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:24,603
which actually made them worse. This is a
study on work stress and as you know,

349
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:28,459
we're all quite stressed at work and it's
a big problem; Work stress is associated

350
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:34,178
with a lot of health problems. In this
study, Dr. Ramesh Manocha from Australia,

351
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:41,498
he tested people. He gave them 8 weeks
of Sahaja yoga meditation or he gave them

352
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:47,128
relaxation response and relaxation response
is something which is used in TM. So, as you

353
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:52,054
can see the relaxation response have no
effect, so it didn't make them better but

354
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:57,476
Sahaja yoga meditation made these people
were stressed at work, significantly better,

355
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:02,690
so the stress symptoms became significantly
better, so these are all improvements, of course.

356
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,428
The depression became significantly better
and the anxiety being quite insignificant

357
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:10,952
but as you can see, they're also better,
in the anxiety.

358
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:18,311
This is a study on ADHD, Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, so these are children,

359
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:23,853
who are restless, impulsive and have problems
with attention. So of course we thought that,

360
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:29,106
meditation would be quick because it makes
them calmer and it improves attention and

361
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:35,079
we've seen it enhances attention areas.
And in practice this what happens, so

362
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:40,568
these people got 6 weeks, they were children,
they got 6 weeks of Sahaja yoga meditation

363
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:45,840
together with their parents and they improved
significantly in their ADHD symptoms.

364
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,546
What is interesting, that the effect was
similar to that of stimular medication.

365
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:55,905
Hyperactive children normally get Ritalin and
it improves the symptoms but it has side effects,

366
00:33:55,905 --> 00:34:01,382
so it affects the sleep, it affects the
growth and of course, if you can have an

367
00:34:01,382 --> 00:34:06,473
improvement without any side effects through
meditation, then that's better, specially

368
00:34:06,473 --> 00:34:12,828
in a child which has still has a developing
brain. And they all improved although most

369
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:17,421
of them even stopped their Ritalin, their
medication. Although they stopped or

370
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:20,839
reduced the medication, they
still improved significantly.

371
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:28,069
This is a study on drug consumption. This
is done by Dr. Wolfen Hackell from Austria

372
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:34,691
so he tested people who entered meditation
and he followed them up for a year and

373
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:40,010
asked them questions about their drug use.
What is quite interesting is, that after

374
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:46,626
only one week almost 60% of drug users
stopped their drug consumption; This is really

375
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,647
remarkable because they were partly, some
of them were Heroin abusers, Cocaine,

376
00:34:51,282 --> 00:34:58,383
Amphetamines and what they found that
after a year only 7% still took their drugs

377
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:04,368
and, you know, I work in a mental hospital
I insist there is no drug, there is no

378
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:09,094
treatment which works as well as this. So,
this is really quite remarkable,

379
00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:11,748
you don't find this anywhere else.

380
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:19,769
So what about physical illness? I've shown
you before that meditation enhances the

381
00:35:19,769 --> 00:35:24,144
Para Sympathetic Nervous System which
restores your bodily functions and of course,

382
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:29,620
this should have an effect on your physical
body and this is exactly what has been shown.

383
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,052
Again this is a study by Dr. Chung, which
I've shown you before, where people with

384
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:38,318
Hypertension significantly improved
with one week of intensive meditation.

385
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,630
There have been several studies in India
who've shown that people improved with Epilepsy

386
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:50,176
and Epilepsy is quite a severe disease -
you have epileptic attacks quite frequently

387
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:57,355
and you have to take quite severe drugs
with severe side effects. In these studies

388
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:02,507
what all of them showed that the number
of epileptic attacks can be significantly

389
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:08,973
reduced with meditation. So this is after
3 months and this is after 6 months.

390
00:36:12,207 --> 00:36:18,257
This is a study by Dr. Ramesh Manocha,
from Australia and he found that meditation

391
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:24,666
has a significant effect on asthma. These
people meditated for 2 months, two times weekly -

392
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:30,152
and the asthma you can measure in a objective
way - they had a significant reduction

393
00:36:30,152 --> 00:36:38,002
of the asthma in the cases of the severity
of the asthma. What is interesting about

394
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:42,862
this study is that after 2 months they
stopped the treatment and meditation and

395
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:47,491
then he followed them up after another
month and what happens is, after the month

396
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:51,726
when they stopped the meditation they all went
back to the same severity of asthma they

397
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:57,558
had before. So what it means is, if you use
meditation to cure any of your illnesses

398
00:36:57,558 --> 00:37:02,271
or diseases, you have to do it for life. You
have to do it regularly and you can't just

399
00:37:02,271 --> 00:37:08,334
stop when you notice your some health benefits
because they will come back. So meditation

400
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:13,910
really, is a discipline for life and I think
that's the reason why, few people use it because

401
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,923
you have to do it regularly and for ever, if you
want to have the benefits and some people

402
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:24,449
find it easier to, you know, to take a pill
than to actually sit down 15 minutes in

403
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:29,982
the morning 15 minutes in the evening and
get yourself disciplined and go into meditation.

404
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:38,059
But as you see, it's as effective as drugs.
This is a study on menopause and again

405
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:43,386
there was a significant reduction of the hot
flushes in women in the menopause phase.

406
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,807
What is interesting that the effect was
similar to Hormone Replacement Therapy and

407
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:53,008
Hormone Replacement Therapy has been
associated with increased Cancer risk. So again,

408
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:57,031
if you can avoid the Cancer risk, it's
better to use meditation.

409
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:03,539
So in conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation
has a significant

410
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:06,689
beneficial effect on your mental
and your physical health.

411
00:38:09,315 --> 00:38:15,235
So to conclude, I've shown you that Sahaja
yoga meditation has a significant effect

412
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:20,216
on the body because it activates the Para
Sympathetic Nervous System and restores

413
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:25,644
your bodily functions. It has an affect on the
brain. It's a different state of consciousness -

414
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:30,813
you activate areas of attention, you activate
the Limbic areas which give you happiness

415
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:36,966
and you release good, happy, more
stabilizing neuro-chemicals in your brain.

416
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:44,848
It prevents disease because it gives you
better mental and physical health. It's a

417
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:49,693
disease therapy, so if you have any illnesses,
you can use it to treat your illnesses through

418
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:54,805
regular meditation and as I said, as I showed
you, it has an effect on a range of mental

419
00:38:54,805 --> 00:39:00,947
illnesses and physical illnesses and there has
never been any negative affect, all the effect

420
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:07,330
was being positive. What is important, as I
said before is, the benefits are associated

421
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:11,282
with the state of mental silence, so it's
the mental silence which works and nothing

422
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:15,898
else, so if you meditate, you have to try
to achieve the state of mental silence

423
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:22,909
as often as possible and that will be associated
with better health at a mental and physical level.

424
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,070
So, I think I've talked enough and what we
will do now is, we'll have a meditation

425
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:36,425
guided by the founder of Sahaja yoga and
if you follow my last slide, we will go

426
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:41,417
exactly there into the Limbic system, which is
here, which is also where the last slide is

427
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:45,408
and that's where we're going now, so
you've heard about all the fantastic things

428
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:49,990
which can happen to you and hopefully you
feel today this mental silence where we're

429
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:55,262
going to go now, which is the Kingdom of God
within, the Paradise within, which you can have.

430
00:39:56,105 --> 00:40:01,265
Here we go. And if you want to know more,
they are a fewer pages where you can read

431
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:07,956
a bit more about this yoga. [UNCLEAR]
[APPLAUSE] Well done!
