WEBVTT

02:19.920 --> 02:25.800
Today we are going to have the Puja of Shri Krishna.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.320
In Shri Krishna’s life,

02:39.600 --> 02:45.320
the River Yamuna has played a very great role.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.960
The Yamuna River is a very deep river

02:51.200 --> 02:54.320
and the water has a blue color,

02:54.520 --> 02:58.280
which they say Shri Krishna also had,

03:02.840 --> 03:07.840
while the River Ganges flows faster

03:08.120 --> 03:12.120
and much shallower than this river.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.360
Next year maybe we might go to Allahabad,

03:16.560 --> 03:21.400
might be able to see the two rivers meet.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.920
The whole of Haryana

03:28.200 --> 03:32.720
has been a very, very historical, mythological place.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.480
You must have known about it

03:35.680 --> 03:41.680
that Pandavas and Kauravas fought in Kurukshetra

03:41.920 --> 03:46.600
and also all this area has been

03:46.800 --> 03:52.080
used since long for meditation.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.320
Markandeya, whose name you have heard many a times,

03:56.520 --> 03:59.800
meditated in this area.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.920
First, he was in Maharashtra,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.800
where you have seen the Sapta Shringhi.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.040
And after that, he came down here and meditated

04:11.280 --> 04:15.320
and wrote his treatise.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.280
Everywhere you find a place of a pir.

04:20.520 --> 04:27.360
Also they are realized souls who have been respected till today.

04:28.400 --> 04:34.760
To begin with, we have to say that this is the

04:36.280 --> 04:40.640
area of great spirituality,

04:40.880 --> 04:44.640
because Shri Krishna lived here.

04:44.880 --> 04:49.920
And, in those days there were no cars,

04:50.120 --> 04:51.920
not this transport.

04:52.120 --> 04:56.520
So he has vibrated all this land so beautifully.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.960
Very fond of playing near the River Yamuna.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.920
Of course, his childhood was not spent here.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.240
But later on when he became the king

05:08.440 --> 05:12.880
he used to visit this place many a times.

05:17.040 --> 05:22.360
We have to understand his character in a very special way.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.600
First, we had the incarnation of Shri Rama.

05:28.160 --> 05:34.200
The Vishnu, as you know, took the birth of

05:34.440 --> 05:36.080
Shri Rama.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.680
But Shri Rama forgot his divinity.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.440
He was made to forget his divinity,

05:43.640 --> 05:48.200
and he lived like an ordinary person,

05:49.400 --> 05:53.040
became a king

05:53.240 --> 05:57.720
like Socrates has described, the benevolent king.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.440
And he had to also sacrifice his wife.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.120
That’s very symbolic, no doubt.

06:09.360 --> 06:15.440
The other part of north India we’ll be able to see his

06:16.520 --> 06:20.080
vibrated areas where he moved.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.840
But Maharashtra he went without shoes,

06:25.040 --> 06:28.440
walked and walked and walked.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.680
Thus, this whole country is really vibrated by great saints

06:34.880 --> 06:39.480
and by great incarnations.

06:43.720 --> 06:50.000
Shri Krishna’s one side was that he was like a child,

06:50.680 --> 06:55.240
and he wanted to

06:55.440 --> 07:00.480
create an atmosphere of mirth, of joy,

07:00.760 --> 07:04.320
because at the time of Shri Rama,

07:04.520 --> 07:08.880
after him the religion was taken very seriously

07:09.120 --> 07:15.600
and people started doing very serious type of religion.

07:17.080 --> 07:23.600
The same incarnation again reappeared, Shri Krishna.

07:23.800 --> 07:28.560
And Shri Krishna wanted to show that

07:28.840 --> 07:35.320
spirituality is not serious; it’s “Leela”.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.080
It’s a game that you have to play.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.760
And in his lifetime he showed.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.240
People don’t understand him at all,

07:45.440 --> 07:50.440
because from Shri Rama’s concept he cannot condescend,

07:50.640 --> 07:54.360
to come down to the, sometimes,

07:54.560 --> 08:00.840
to the level of Shri Krishna which was, I think, was much higher.

08:01.360 --> 08:06.120
Because he had to show that all this,

08:06.320 --> 08:11.000
all this world, is just a joke, is Maya,

08:11.200 --> 08:15.520
and beyond that is joy.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.480
His whole style was very interesting.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.920
That time they couldn’t have such beautiful pendals,

08:24.200 --> 08:27.240
they couldn’t have so many disciples,

08:27.440 --> 08:30.720
so he tried on his own style.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.080
And his style was, when he was a child,

08:34.760 --> 08:39.720
there were many milk maid whom they called “gopis”.

08:39.920 --> 08:45.640
They would be taking their bath in the River Yamuna, not here.

08:46.280 --> 08:52.800
He would just break their water pitcher

08:53.160 --> 08:56.800
and the water would flow on their back.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.000
This Yamuna River was vibrated by Radhaji.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.840
Radha: “Ra” means energy; “Dha” means the one who sustains.

09:06.040 --> 09:09.520
Radha - Dhara iti sada - Radha.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.120
And he

09:13.920 --> 09:16.960
didn’t know how to tell them about Kundalini.

09:17.160 --> 09:22.360
So he used to throw stones, small stones,

09:22.560 --> 09:28.520
at those pitchers and the water would flow down their backbone,

09:28.760 --> 09:34.200
thus giving them the blessings of the Kundalini.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.200
His style was extremely, extremely

09:41.400 --> 09:44.280
simple, playful, mirthful,

09:44.480 --> 09:49.360
and nobody understood why he was doing all these things.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.680
Also, when he was a very small child,

09:52.880 --> 09:55.200
there were ladies who were taking their baths.

09:55.400 --> 10:00.840
So he was trying to raise their Kundalini and he hid their clothes;

10:01.040 --> 10:02.920
he vibrated them.

10:03.120 --> 10:09.280
So, many people don’t understand a little child; he’s so innocent.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.520
And he was teasing them, and tried to show

10:13.720 --> 10:16.640
that life is nothing but joy.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.040
And he then he gave them those clothes.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.760
Later on, he grew up.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.200
Then he became the king of Dwarika.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.440
In our country there are very westernized intellectuals,

10:41.640 --> 10:45.480
and they try to say that there were two Shri Krishnas.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.600
I mean, they want to analyze everything

10:47.800 --> 10:50.040
without understanding spirituality,

10:50.240 --> 10:54.120
what is the subtle thing behind it.

10:55.000 --> 11:00.200
There was, he had sixteen thousand wives, as they say.

11:00.640 --> 11:06.400
They were his powers. You see, for men - I am a Mother.

11:06.600 --> 11:11.120
I can have thousands of children: boys, girls, men, women.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.480
Nobody can say anything about my character.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.000
But for men it is very difficult.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.200
So he got all his powers born as women

11:22.480 --> 11:24.520
who were married to some king.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.160
Not married; actually he had abducted those women

11:29.360 --> 11:31.440
and put them in jail.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.480
So he saved them from there,

11:34.680 --> 11:39.000
brought them out, and married them.

11:39.200 --> 11:45.360
Now the, if you see the accent is on marriage.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.600
He married these women with sixteen thousand powers.

11:50.800 --> 11:55.320
As you know, he is sixteen petals and one thousand

11:55.520 --> 12:01.080
of the Sahasrara is sixteen thousand powers which he married.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.880
Then he had five wives, for which also people have objections.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.440
Only Krishna can do like that.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.680
Five wives are the five elements.

12:10.880 --> 12:15.240
The essence of them, the essence of them, the causal of them,

12:15.440 --> 12:20.480
came as his wives and he married them.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.320
But he was such a detached soul.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.120
There’s lot of stories about his detachment.

12:31.560 --> 12:37.240
There was one great rishi,

12:37.440 --> 12:39.640
meaning a saint or sage,

12:39.840 --> 12:42.880
who had arrived on the other side of the River Yamuna.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.320
This was in Dwarika.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.720
And, there was no Yamuna River,

12:47.920 --> 12:53.840
but there was also, there was Narmada and Tapti,

12:54.200 --> 12:58.640
and they wanted to go and serve the sage.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.160
So when they went near the river,

13:01.360 --> 13:04.560
they found the river was all flooded.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.960
So they went back to Shri Krishna and said,

13:07.200 --> 13:10.240
“See, we are going to worship the sage

13:10.440 --> 13:14.200
and the river is all flooded.”

13:17.600 --> 13:21.120
So he said, “All right, you go and tell the river a truth.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.960
By that truth it will go down.”

13:23.160 --> 13:24.640
“What’s the truth?”

13:24.840 --> 13:29.840
“That Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya, is a celibate person.”

13:30.080 --> 13:32.960
He had five wives.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.600
They said, “How can we say this?”

13:34.800 --> 13:38.040
"This is the truth” he said. “You go and tell him. Tell the river,

13:38.240 --> 13:39.960
and river will understand the truth.

13:40.160 --> 13:43.720
The power of truth will put down the floods.”

13:43.960 --> 13:49.800
So they went and they said that, “Shri Krishna is a Brahmacharya,”

13:50.000 --> 13:53.480
and the river went down.  And they were surprised.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.520
“How it can happen? This fellow is our husband,

13:56.720 --> 14:01.680
and how can he say that he is a Brahmacharya?”

14:02.280 --> 14:06.240
So they served the sage, served him well,

14:06.440 --> 14:09.920
gave him food,

14:10.440 --> 14:13.480
looked after him, and

14:13.760 --> 14:19.000
when they came back they again saw the river was again in floods.

14:19.200 --> 14:23.080
So they were quite worried how to cross the river now.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.720
So then went back to the sage and informed the sage

14:27.920 --> 14:31.680
that, “See, we have to go back and there the river is

14:31.880 --> 14:36.960
in speed and we don’t know how to cross over.”

14:37.160 --> 14:42.440
He said, “It’s very easy. If you want to go, it’s very easy.”

14:42.640 --> 14:45.640
They said, “How?”

14:45.840 --> 14:47.160
“How did you come?”

14:47.360 --> 14:51.080
They said, “We told, Krishna told us like this to tell

14:51.280 --> 14:54.680
that the river is celibate,

14:54.880 --> 14:57.920
that, that, ‘I am celibate. I am celibate.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.440
And the river, she’s also – Narmada is also a celibate river.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.440
So the river went down.”

15:07.200 --> 15:10.840
“All right, then you go and tell the river now

15:11.080 --> 15:15.600
that I didn’t eat any food. Nothing I ate.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.720
I am just fasting.”

15:17.960 --> 15:20.400
They said, “This fellow ate like a glutton,

15:20.600 --> 15:22.960
and telling us a lie like this,

15:23.160 --> 15:27.640
and how are we to believe this man?”

15:27.840 --> 15:34.040
So, they went to the river and to the river they said that,

15:34.240 --> 15:38.640
“This sage didn’t eat any food - he is on a fast -

15:38.840 --> 15:43.400
and please go down.” And the river went down.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.320
So they were surprised, how this fellow has eaten everything

15:47.520 --> 15:50.280
and despite that, when we told it, it’s a big lie.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.640
This river has listened to this lie.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.280
So they crossed over.

15:58.480 --> 16:04.440
The point is, those people who are at that level,

16:04.640 --> 16:09.440
even when they eat they don’t eat.

16:10.400 --> 16:15.320
Even they are married, they are celibate. It’s a state.

16:15.520 --> 16:19.840
It’s a state in which you are completely detached,

16:20.360 --> 16:22.040
absolutely detached.

16:22.240 --> 16:28.160
You don’t feel the attachment of the work you are doing,

16:28.360 --> 16:31.760
or the life you are leading.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.480
I cannot say how one should become detached.

16:35.680 --> 16:39.520
Of course, with the Kundalini working out and

16:39.720 --> 16:42.240
you meditating, all that, and

16:42.440 --> 16:45.000
fixing the Kundalini properly, it will work out.

16:45.280 --> 16:49.520
You will be amazed how you will become detached about things

16:49.760 --> 16:53.640
and how you can manage

16:54.640 --> 16:57.080
things without feeling that you are doing it,

16:57.280 --> 17:03.200
how you can work out so many things without feeling even tired.

17:03.400 --> 17:08.520
It’s, it's a state. And that is the state one has to achieve.

17:08.720 --> 17:13.240
Now for that, whether you are at that stage or not,

17:13.440 --> 17:15.400
first thing you must notice how many times

17:15.600 --> 17:20.920
I use the word, “‘I”, “me”.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.440
How many times I said,

17:22.640 --> 17:28.520
“I saw this, I enjoyed this, I this, I that?”

17:29.040 --> 17:35.000
Or, “This is my child. This is my house,” something like that.

17:37.200 --> 17:42.120
When you start using “I” too much,

17:42.320 --> 17:46.160
then you are not detached.

17:46.720 --> 17:51.080
Try to introspect. How many times I say,

17:51.280 --> 17:55.760
“I have got this.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.680
work to be done I’ve got to do this.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.000
I must furnish this. I must achieve this.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.120
This is the goal of my life.”?

18:06.320 --> 18:11.080
These are all words of illusion.

18:11.280 --> 18:17.000
Once you get detached, it’s a state, again I say. I won’t say that,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.280
“By standing on your head you will become detached,”

18:19.480 --> 18:24.160
or anything like that. It’s a state into which one has to grow.

18:24.360 --> 18:29.440
So Shri Krishna’s message, all his life, was complete detachment.

18:29.640 --> 18:36.280
Even when he went with Arjuna for a war,

18:36.520 --> 18:41.120
he said, “I will be just the driver of your chariot.

18:41.320 --> 18:47.040
But I will not raise any weapons. I will not fight.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.760
I will be just your charioteer,

18:51.960 --> 18:57.160
and if you agree to that condition, I’ll be there.”

18:58.040 --> 19:03.600
Actually, when Arjuna had a question,

19:03.800 --> 19:07.200
“How can I kill? These are my relations, these are my gurus,

19:07.400 --> 19:12.480
these are my, my close people, my friends.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.280
How can I kill them?”

19:15.480 --> 19:19.000
And he became very depressed.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.360
When he became depressed, Krishna said,

19:22.560 --> 19:25.960
that “Do you know they are already dead?

19:26.160 --> 19:29.760
Anything that is born has to die.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.040
So, you have to kill them.”

19:34.280 --> 19:37.680
Now people can say that Krishna was preaching violence.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.680
No, not that.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.520
But what he said at those people

19:42.720 --> 19:44.320
who are adharmies [GW: adharmics?],

19:44.520 --> 19:48.240
who have no sense of dharma, who have been so cruel,

19:48.440 --> 19:54.760
who have been very much against the tradition of dharma,

19:55.360 --> 19:58.200
they have to be killed.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.120
Whether you kill them or not, they are already dead

20:01.320 --> 20:04.560
because they have committed so many sins.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.040
They are already dead.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.600
So you should not think that you are killing,

20:09.800 --> 20:13.880
but it’s a Divine

20:14.080 --> 20:18.080
which is going to kill them, so-called killing.

20:18.280 --> 20:20.760
And so the war started.

20:20.960 --> 20:26.320
In the Gita also people have very less understanding

20:26.520 --> 20:30.600
as to what he wanted to communicate.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.480
The first thing, I mean the war is on

20:33.680 --> 20:39.400
and he’s talking about philosophy, you can imagine the detachment.

20:43.080 --> 20:49.280
The first thing he told him that, “You should take to Gyana.”

20:49.560 --> 20:53.040
“Gyana” means “bodh”.

20:53.480 --> 21:00.160
Bodh, as you know, is only possible through enlightenment.

21:00.680 --> 21:05.760
So he said, “You should take to Gyana, to bodh,

21:05.960 --> 21:08.680
which is enlightenment.”

21:08.880 --> 21:10.480
But people don’t understand Gyana.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.280
They think that by reading books, by reading all kinds of,

21:14.480 --> 21:18.240
there are so many criticisms of Gita reading all that,

21:18.440 --> 21:22.480
or understanding about Gita.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.120
There are many in this country

21:24.320 --> 21:26.480
who are giving lectures on Shri Krishna;

21:26.680 --> 21:30.880
in their own lives they are horrible.

21:31.480 --> 21:35.280
So, the first thing he told,,

21:35.480 --> 21:40.680
the best thing to be done that is the only thing to be done.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.120
He was a, not a businessman.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.920
A businessman will tell you first something that is not so good,

21:49.160 --> 21:52.720
then better, better, better raising you slowly.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.560
But he said, outright,

21:54.760 --> 21:57.320
that that is the point by which you become Stitapragya,

21:57.520 --> 22:02.240
means Sahaja yogi. He said clearly.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.800
But Arjuna said then, “If it is so,

22:05.000 --> 22:10.520
why do you want me to go on war, to do this karma?”

22:12.600 --> 22:15.000
That is also very much misunderstood.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.320
Only after Realization you can understand

22:17.520 --> 22:21.680
what he meant by doing karma.

22:22.200 --> 22:28.240
He has said it very clear that,

22:29.240 --> 22:32.920
“You do your work, karmas, your whatever you have to do,

22:33.120 --> 22:38.240
your action, and put it at My lotus feet,”

22:38.640 --> 22:40.840
which is an impossible situation.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.160
As long as you have

22:43.360 --> 22:47.440
the sense that you are doing something - Aham-bhava -

22:47.640 --> 22:51.000
that due to ego, you might call it,

22:51.200 --> 22:54.840
as long as you have this feeling within you,

22:55.120 --> 22:57.000
or maybe

22:57.200 --> 23:02.120
when there is still that “I” is existing within you,

23:02.320 --> 23:05.680
you may say that, “I’m putting it at the lotus feet of God,”

23:05.880 --> 23:08.320
but you don’t.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.680
Because Shri Krishna knew,

23:10.880 --> 23:13.120
after Arjuna asked the question,

23:13.320 --> 23:15.360
that human nature is not straightforward.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.160
They won’t understand in a straightforward way.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.440
So he was diplomatically. He told him,

23:21.640 --> 23:25.160
“All right, put everything at my feet, which you cannot do.”

23:25.400 --> 23:27.640
So people tried that.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.960
Ages they have tried and they found out it doesn’t work out that way

23:32.200 --> 23:35.160
"Whatever we do, we feel responsible for it.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.400
So why should we think

23:38.600 --> 23:43.000
that we are putting at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna?

23:43.400 --> 23:47.240
For example, some people who were murderers they would say,

23:47.440 --> 23:48.720
“All right, we have murdered all right,

23:48.920 --> 23:52.520
but we have put it at the lotus feet of God.”

23:52.920 --> 23:58.840
This kind of a delusion happened.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.440
I mean, there were horrible people in this country

24:02.640 --> 24:07.400
who used to kill

24:07.800 --> 24:11.880
travelers in the name of Goddess.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.080
All these misunderstandings,

24:15.280 --> 24:19.400
which shooted them, they started doing it.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.680
So, he said that,

24:23.880 --> 24:28.080
“Your karma should be at My lotus feet.”

24:28.280 --> 24:32.840
It’s only possible after your Realization,

24:33.200 --> 24:36.480
when you really feel you are not doing anything.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.320
You ask Sahaja yogi to give Realization to somebody.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.040
He tells Me, "It’s not going. It’s not working.”

24:43.240 --> 24:47.560
He talks like a third person. He becomes a third person.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.440
He never thinks that he’s doing it.

24:51.640 --> 24:58.200
He is raising the Kundalini himself with his own hand.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.800
He doesn’t say, “I am doing it.”

25:01.000 --> 25:06.760
Or he’ll just say, “Doesn’t work out, Mother, doesn’t work out.”

25:07.040 --> 25:09.960
What’s the matter? He would just say,

25:10.160 --> 25:12.440
“This chakra is there. This problem is there,”

25:12.640 --> 25:16.640
but he would never say that, “I am doing it.”

25:16.840 --> 25:20.040
So, this karma, this action,

25:20.240 --> 25:25.280
becomes akarma, means “non-action”.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.280
Though you are acting, doing everything,

25:28.480 --> 25:32.760
still you don’t feel you are doing anything.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.600
That’s why he said,

25:35.800 --> 25:38.880
“Normally people would not take to Self-realization.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.520
So better to give them this condition,

25:41.720 --> 25:47.040
that whatever you do you put at the lotus feet of God.”

25:47.840 --> 25:51.920
Then, he asked about Bhakti.

25:59.760 --> 26:05.720
So, for Bhakti he said, “All right, very clever, you know.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.600
I am not that clever as he was.

26:08.800 --> 26:13.040
I am telling you everything straightforward.”

26:13.240 --> 26:16.600
Because he knew human beings are too clever,

26:16.800 --> 26:20.680
and if they are to be convinced, they cannot be convinced

26:20.880 --> 26:23.880
just by telling them straightforward things.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.600
And so he says, “All right,

26:26.800 --> 26:32.680
whatever flower, water,

26:32.920 --> 26:35.600
fruit, you give it to me, I’ll accept.”

26:35.840 --> 26:39.720
That’s the Bhakti part. But,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.000
this is now the trick.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.720
The Bhakti

26:47.720 --> 26:53.160
is to be done when there is not the other, Ananya.

26:53.800 --> 26:58.840
Ananya means there’s nobody else, you and Me.

26:59.920 --> 27:03.400
That means you should be connected to Me.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.760
Then only you can do Bhakti.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.440
But nobody understand, nobody understand the meaning of word,

27:09.640 --> 27:11.800
“Ananya”, or they don’t want to understand.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.280
Ananya means where there is not the other,

27:16.600 --> 27:19.520
means you are a Self-realized soul.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.920
That’s the Bhakti I will accept.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.200
When I get these Hari Rama people suffering from

27:26.400 --> 27:28.000
all kinds of troubles and they say,

27:28.200 --> 27:34.000
“Mother, how is it we are suffering from Shri Krishna’s troubles?”

27:34.240 --> 27:38.440
So I tell them, “You have no connection with Shri Krishna.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.400
You are not connected. Supposing this is not connected,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.560
this won’t work.

27:44.800 --> 27:50.160
And there’s a protocol. Shri Krishna is an incarnation.

27:50.360 --> 27:53.040
Even if you have to meet the Chief Minister here

27:53.240 --> 27:56.360
and you go on calling his name, you’ll be arrested.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.440
But he’s Almighty.

27:59.640 --> 28:03.400
How can you take his name so cheaply,

28:03.600 --> 28:08.880
as if he belongs to you or he is in your pocket?”

28:09.080 --> 28:12.120
So, there’s a protocol.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.960
But they were told

28:14.160 --> 28:19.440
that, “You must take the name of Shri Krishna

28:19.640 --> 28:22.680
or of Shri Ram or the name of God.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.600
Just pray to God that you should not forget God.”

28:25.800 --> 28:29.360
That’s the reason. But this not the way.

28:29.560 --> 28:33.520
Like mad, people are going on with it.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.200
That’s how the Kundalini gets spoiled.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.320
I have seen they have Vishuddhi problems

28:39.520 --> 28:42.200
and they never feel in their hands anything.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.240
They’ll go on telling you, “Mother, we don’t feel this or that.”

28:45.440 --> 28:51.480
They are Shri Krishna Bhaktas. So, their Bhakti is also wrong.

28:51.760 --> 28:56.440
But Shri Krishna, whatever is told  you have to understand it,

28:56.640 --> 29:01.440
written in small lines, what he is trying to say.

29:01.680 --> 29:06.720
His mischiefs, his childlike

29:07.120 --> 29:09.320
pranks he used to play,

29:09.520 --> 29:11.880
all were so sweet and beautiful.

29:12.080 --> 29:16.160
To create a feeling from the innocence, respect.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.320
I mean, an Indian if he sees a child

29:18.560 --> 29:22.200
he develops a kind of a feeling which is called vatsalya,

29:22.400 --> 29:25.560
the feeling of great love and affection

29:25.800 --> 29:28.120
and protection for children.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.600
But in the West I am surprised the way they are under attack.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.680
Children are so much under attack.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.120
I don’t know why are they doing it.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.200
There’s no feeling of vatsalya at all.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.120
It’s something so cruel.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
I don’t know if they are possessed,

29:44.520 --> 29:50.120
or there’s kind of a influence of their previous lives,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.440
or whatever it is. It’s very common with them.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.320
The way they attack innocence - small children.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.600
Impossible to understand how can human beings do that.

30:01.800 --> 30:07.520
So, Shri Krishna’s childlike behavior - so beautiful

30:07.720 --> 30:10.960
that that makes you feel that love

30:11.160 --> 30:16.600
and affection, protection, for the little child.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.400
I have to tell about Shri Krishnas sister - I was going to tell,

30:20.600 --> 30:25.400
but She thougt, I might forget.

30:28.720 --> 30:33.600
Shri Krishna had a sister, as you know - Vishnumaya -

30:33.920 --> 30:37.560
and she’s the electricity.

30:38.600 --> 30:44.800
We have seen in Cabella, in Canada,

30:45.080 --> 30:48.840
the miracles of Vishnumaya.

30:49.360 --> 30:53.040
When I went to Canada,

30:54.080 --> 30:57.360
it was said by the aboriginal people

30:57.560 --> 30:59.720
that when the Holy Mother will come,

30:59.920 --> 31:04.120
the whole sky will become red with lightning.

31:04.360 --> 31:08.600
And, the lightning started, next day.

31:08.800 --> 31:13.240
Even before it was daytime, I saw the sky red like this,

31:13.480 --> 31:16.720
completely red. So many people saw it.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.320
But, there were sixteen thousand lightnings,

31:21.520 --> 31:25.080
sixteen thousand lightnings. It was in the newspaper up there.

31:25.280 --> 31:28.160
It was going on, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, the whole night.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.640
And I said “Now I’ll go and sit in the bathroom so it will stop.”

31:31.840 --> 31:37.600
And then it stopped. Otherwise it was going on like that.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.960
How he was connected with the Pandavas.

31:49.160 --> 31:53.640
Draupadi was also his sister.

31:53.840 --> 31:57.560
So Vishnumaya was born as Draupadi.

31:57.760 --> 32:02.520
Also, his mother was there, Yeshoda.

32:02.720 --> 32:08.920
And when Radhaji was the Mahalakshmi,

32:09.200 --> 32:15.600
Mother Mary, and she gave birth to

32:16.400 --> 32:20.520
Shri Ganesha. That was Lord Jesus Christ.

32:20.840 --> 32:25.560
In India, nobody would doubt the,

32:25.760 --> 32:29.000
the Immaculate Conception. Nobody would doubt.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.120
But, for others it is too much

32:31.320 --> 32:36.160
to believe in the Immaculate Conception.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.560
Or they are all arguing and saying all kinds of nonsensical things.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.240
Because Ganesha was created like that,

32:43.440 --> 32:49.760
and also Christ could be created like that.

32:50.920 --> 32:56.520
[Hindi: Iski koi zaroorat nahi hai – hai kya? ]

33:08.640 --> 33:13.320
So Radha, she was Mother Mary.

33:13.560 --> 33:19.640
And it is surprising if you read the Devi Mahatmya

33:19.840 --> 33:23.440
in that it’s clearly written who was Christ,

33:23.680 --> 33:27.640
that He was the support.

33:27.840 --> 33:32.800
He was called as Mahavishnu. He was the support.

33:33.000 --> 33:37.640
That’s the Mooladhara. He was the support of the universe.

33:37.840 --> 33:41.160
All these were all related people,

33:41.360 --> 33:42.840
but we are stupidly fighting

33:43.040 --> 33:48.520
because we do not have the knowledge of reality.

33:52.280 --> 33:58.320
So, Radhaji wanted to give him the name Yeshoda.

33:58.520 --> 34:03.320
So he called him Yesu. In Hebrew it is Yesu.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.960
Also in India Yeshoda is called as Jasodha.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.200
Many people called him Jeshua.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.160
That’s how he became Jesus.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.800
You can verify what I am saying on your vibrations.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.360
So, they are all related to each other,

34:23.120 --> 34:27.160
and greatest thing is

34:27.360 --> 34:31.000
they are divine people.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.440
We cannot understand that, we cannot analyze that,

34:34.720 --> 34:37.040
we cannot pass remarks about Him.

34:37.240 --> 34:40.680
It is a sign of human arrogance,

34:40.880 --> 34:43.440
because his knowledge is so limited,

34:43.640 --> 34:46.400
and with that limited knowledge he want to

34:46.600 --> 34:49.240
talk about divinity which is beyond

34:49.440 --> 34:53.040
the brains, beyond human intelligence.

34:53.240 --> 34:58.960
So only thing we can do is to be humble and to be surrendered.

34:59.160 --> 35:03.400
That’s how Islam came, which means surrender.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.080
Where are they surrendering, God knows?

35:06.280 --> 35:09.720
Or Christians, where are they following Christ?

35:09.920 --> 35:12.440
Hindus, where are they following the principle

35:12.640 --> 35:16.040
that everybody has the spirit in their heart?

35:16.240 --> 35:21.080
How can you have caste system if everybody has the spirit?

35:21.280 --> 35:24.320
Now, thank God, so many people in the whole world

35:24.520 --> 35:28.400
have become Sahaja Yogis. We are transcended

35:28.600 --> 35:34.840
all these artificial barriers in our divine life.

35:35.040 --> 35:39.320
How can Divine divide people?

35:39.520 --> 35:42.720
Some higher, some lower, cannot be.

35:42.920 --> 35:45.720
Only thing is, you have to achieve that state

35:45.920 --> 35:49.840
in which you see the whole world as a drama,

35:50.040 --> 35:51.520
as Shri Krishna has said

35:51.720 --> 35:56.520
and you are the witness, the sakshi of all that.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.320
I had to tell all the story about Shri Krishna because

35:59.520 --> 36:04.200
this River Yamuna reminds Me of all those beautiful things He did.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.040
And also I was happy yesterday, they way you’re dancing,

36:08.240 --> 36:12.200
the way you’re enjoying, which is very, very significant.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.280
And the one’s who did this before,

36:14.520 --> 36:17.880
were not saints. They were ordinary people

36:18.080 --> 36:21.760
whom Shri Krishna wanted to hold hand.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.080
They’re called raas. „Ra“ means energy. „Sa“ means with.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.960
They all were holding hands,

36:28.160 --> 36:32.120
so with the energy of Radhaji

36:32.320 --> 36:36.200
everybody was getting enlightened.

36:36.440 --> 36:42.760
All these things, as in all religions,

36:42.960 --> 36:46.800
have lost their own meaning, have lost their own form

36:47.000 --> 36:50.440
and they have become very corrupt.

36:50.640 --> 36:57.160
This is because it’s a mental attitude.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.600
If you have a mental attitude, it has its own limitations

37:04.800 --> 37:08.160
and after some time, there’s always a decline

37:08.360 --> 37:14.320
of all these mental

37:15.720 --> 37:18.520
adventures that you take

37:18.720 --> 37:21.760
because there’s no strength of truth in it.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.320
That’s how you find decline in arts,

37:25.880 --> 37:29.160
in music, in everything, there’s a decline coming.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.400
But now you people have found the Truth,

37:32.600 --> 37:38.440
so please try and understand that

37:38.640 --> 37:42.680
the Truth is the one which is eternal

37:42.880 --> 37:45.280
and the Truth is Love.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.320
Truth is Divine Love

37:48.520 --> 37:52.440
and this Divine Love has no consequences.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.640
It doesn’t blame anything, doesn’t want anything,

37:54.840 --> 37:56.520
it just wants to love.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.440
And when you see this All-Pervading Power being kind-

38:00.640 --> 38:04.360
everybody here has had some sort of a miracle

38:04.560 --> 38:08.800
and most of them have told Me so many miracles that

38:09.000 --> 38:12.040
"Mother, this happened, that happened, that happened."

38:12.240 --> 38:18.320
It’s all done by this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

38:18.520 --> 38:23.760
And also to convince you it is doing so many things interesting

38:23.960 --> 38:29.160
of showing

38:29.440 --> 38:32.560
different types of my photographs, this and that,

38:32.800 --> 38:35.560
but the best was this time in Navaratri.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.840
I mean, my photograph I saw a background

38:39.040 --> 38:41.440
which was rather very different,

38:41.640 --> 38:45.240
like something round was there and there was a curtain

38:45.440 --> 38:49.520
and somebody peeking through that, like the sun peeping out.

38:49.720 --> 38:53.120
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised

38:53.320 --> 38:55.880
the whole scene was behind Me there.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.840
So it was before it was even made or conceived.

39:00.040 --> 39:05.720
It was seen there in Navaratri Puja.

39:05.920 --> 39:09.800
That means all these things also that you are conceiving

39:10.000 --> 39:13.240
are suggested by the Divine.

39:13.440 --> 39:16.080
Otherwise, how can it be possible that

39:16.280 --> 39:19.520
one month before we got that kind of a photograph,

39:19.720 --> 39:22.640
which I was wondering, how can that be behind Me?

39:22.840 --> 39:26.760
And that was there when we went to Moscow everybody saw this.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.720
It’s very surprising. So all kinds of tricks He’s playing.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.680
Even when I’m not there, He shows that I’m there

39:33.880 --> 39:36.520
and it’s working out in so many ways

39:36.760 --> 39:41.560
that one has to understand that what we think is miracle

39:41.760 --> 39:45.840
is a play of this All-Pervading Power.

39:46.040 --> 39:51.200
I hope you have enjoyed your stay here

39:51.880 --> 39:56.960
and we have still a big tour to go on.

39:58.600 --> 40:03.680
I hope more people are coming now, so

40:03.960 --> 40:08.200
you are all comfortable here.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.480
After realization, actually I have seen

40:11.680 --> 40:14.440
people don’t care for physical comforts.

40:14.640 --> 40:18.200
They just care for the comforts of the spirit.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.960
People are very deep and you have met the people of India.

40:24.160 --> 40:28.120
They’re also very deep people, very good humble people.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.400
We are all part and parcel of One Body

40:32.600 --> 40:36.760
and that’s what one has to remember.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.640
I hope you’re all right, all of you and tomorrow,

40:40.840 --> 40:43.840
you don’t know, it’s a very, very cold place they say. Let’s see.

40:44.080 --> 40:48.120
As the sun has come here, maybe the same sun will help us there.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.520
May God bless you.
