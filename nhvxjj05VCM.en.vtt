THE ASPECTS OF VISHUDDHI CHAKRA (PART 2)

00:00:28.297 --> 00:00:33.117
But in the center when you rise -
the Kundalini rises -

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:38.703
most of the people have their Vishuddhi
caught up, most of the people.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.309
So they have to either see that they are
not guilty

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.278
or they have to see that there is no
shouting - nothing -

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:50.434
they are not aggressive in their shouts. 
And, plus, they have to see

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:55.059
that they are completely in balance
with themselves.

00:00:55.276 --> 00:01:01.144
So they are in the central path by which
they become sweet, kind and nice.

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.362
So for us it is important to understand

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:09.156
that our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear,
first of all

00:01:09.357 --> 00:01:12.841
we must have a beautiful heart,
a very clean heart.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:18.213
And find out what's wrong with you,
get it corrected -

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:25.545
which can be done by anyone - and see
that you just have

00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.606
a full idea about yourself, about your
Vishuddhi.

00:01:30.807 --> 00:01:34.239
And that's only possible, only - again
it's a vicious circle -

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.817
if you have a good Vishuddhi.

00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:39.887
If you don't have a good Vishuddhi
you can never see yourself

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:44.215
because at the Vishuddhi point only
you become the witness.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.450
You are just a witness when you are
at a Vishuddhi point.

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:51.137
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi
a witness.

00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:54.567
If you have achieved the witness nature

00:01:54.768 --> 00:01:58.748
then you can see in your Vishuddhi
what's wrong with you,

00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:03.475
what's wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything,

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:08.340
and you will end up here only, thinking:
"Oh, this is the one that is wrong."

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:15.669
Now the main problem before us today
is something else.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:30.192
Is that we all have to ascend, and ascend
with an equal strength.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:39.887
There’s a story about some birds who
were caught in a net,

00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:45.301
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:50.945
Everybody tried to get out. But nobody
individually could work it out.

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:55.851
So they all decided to fly together,
“One, two, three, and go!”,

00:02:56.052 --> 00:03:04.095
and they took all that net with them. And
they said, then they requested the rats

00:03:04.296 --> 00:03:12.976
that “Please come and cut our net”,
and they were freed.

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:19.656
So if it can happen between the rats and
the birds, why not between us?

00:03:19.857 --> 00:03:27.376
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed in
the collectivity how we could be helpful

00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:33.046
and joyous with each other. Now say
something is wrong

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:37.593
with your mother, father, sister,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

00:03:37.794 --> 00:03:42.507
After all you have the Ocean of Joy here
with the collectivity,

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:45.919
and your problems can be solved
if collectively,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.100
if you want to solve your problem.

00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:56.179
So we have to depend on the collectivity.
Very much to be one with the collective.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.663
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:08.374
the joy itself draws you together. Meeting
each other is such a joyous thing.

00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:13.178
We have had so many experiences of that,
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.084
how happy they were to find Sahaja Yogis
somewhere

00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:22.679
out of the blue, and how they felt happy.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:32.701
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.093
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:42.450
Once you start enjoying each other…

00:04:43.352 --> 00:04:46.982
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all
should be stuck together

00:04:47.183 --> 00:04:54.052
with some glue or something, or we all
become like Gibraltar,

00:04:54.253 --> 00:04:57.631
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean
that.

00:04:57.832 --> 00:05:04.167
It means wherever you are, you are
connected. That is collectivity.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.428
But if you are not connected and you are
just glued together,

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:15.545
it’s very inconvenient to live under
such circumstances.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:20.998
I think, people don’t even understand
the meaning of collectivity -

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:28.307
where there’s not the other, Ananya.
Where there’s not the other,

00:05:28.508 --> 00:05:31.971
there’s no other personality.

00:05:33.695 --> 00:05:36.828
These personalities

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:45.378
are separated from you because
of left and right. Or could be both.

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:54.393
But you are yourself fully when you are
absolutely detached

00:05:54.594 --> 00:06:02.190
and your Kundalini is dancing – you are
alone and never alone.

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:15.588
This oneness with the whole gives you

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.281
all the security that you want, all the joy
you want.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:30.102
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening
means "collectivity".

00:06:30.825 --> 00:06:41.227
Unless and until you want pure collectivity
in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:07:02.284
Now this chakra is - it is, you know,
placed between the two eyebrows.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:08.676
Now, two eyes represent the left
and the right side.

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:20.888
So this center is very much guided
by our eyes,

00:07:21.097 --> 00:07:31.293
by our ears, by our nose, tongue,
teeth, throat.

00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:38.853
Is a very important center because
the Vishuddhi,

00:07:39.054 --> 00:07:47.163
which has to look after sixteen petals, 
which sixteen petals which look after

00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:54.353
all these ear, nose, throat, different,
different organs within us,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.884
also it has to communicate with the Virat.

00:08:00.116 --> 00:08:06.405
So it has to pass through this center
of Hamsa Chakra.

00:08:12.315 --> 00:08:22.215
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal center

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:30.489
which expresses auspiciousness
in our awareness.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:37.224
That means if this center is alert
and awakened,

00:08:37.425 --> 00:08:42.982
then we immediately know what is
auspicious and what is not auspicious.

00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:48.529
Or we can call it - we get the Divine
Discretion.

00:08:49.706 --> 00:09:02.923
I think it is a part of the genetics that
people have discretion

00:09:03.174 --> 00:09:11.509
between good and bad, destructive
and constructive.

00:09:22.174 --> 00:09:25.675
Virat is the ultimate,

00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:30.646
the complete development of the Vishuddhi
chakra is Virat.

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:38.441
And as you know the chakra is here,
here at this point.

00:09:38.642 --> 00:09:44.129
If this chakra is not all right, you are
not collective.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.582
You behave in a manner that is
not collective.

00:09:48.783 --> 00:09:55.722
You cannot communicate with other
Sahaja yogis.

00:09:55.923 --> 00:10:05.105
You cannot be friendly, loving
and one with other Sahaja yogis,

00:10:05.328 --> 00:10:10.847
unless and until this center here,
Vishuddhi, is all right.

00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:14.097
And it is part of Ekadasha.

00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:18.055
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadasha
Rudra.

00:10:20.922 --> 00:10:28.535
The discretion power becomes so beautiful
of the Hamsa Chakra,

00:10:28.736 --> 00:10:33.144
because they are all connected,
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:37.800
They are all connected centers.

00:10:38.274 --> 00:10:46.223
It’s not only that the Virata improves,
but Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:52.131
So now what happens that you jump
into collectivity.

00:10:53.643 --> 00:10:59.299
And the love and the affection
and the understanding

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:08.763
that you have for each other is remarkable,
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

00:11:08.964 --> 00:11:15.497
So all that happens, absolutely happens
in your brain.

00:11:15.698 --> 00:11:26.065
That’s how your brain, which is the one
which receives all the information

00:11:26.266 --> 00:11:29.942
and creates all the information,

00:11:30.143 --> 00:11:37.200
creates all the mental projections becomes
a new vehicle

00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:44.010
to create a dimension which goes higher,
not declining.

00:11:45.642 --> 00:11:49.393
All of you are part and parcel of that, 
all of you

00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:54.683
are part and parcel of that and all of you 
are important.

00:11:54.884 --> 00:12:01.442
All of you have to support that, all of you
have to raise it. It is very important;

00:12:01.643 --> 00:12:08.299
you all should understand your own
responsibility.

00:12:09.297 --> 00:12:16.403
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,
all the subtleties

00:12:16.604 --> 00:12:23.221
of the brain and the knowledge starts
manifesting and expressing itself.

00:12:23.422 --> 00:12:27.627
But the greatest thing that happens, that
integration takes place in your brain.

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:32.237
It’s not that your heart wants one thing
and your brain wants another thing.

00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:35.979
The integration takes place. And when
that integration takes place

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.722
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:46.502
Even without thinking about it, without
reading about it, you just become dharmic.

00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:48.784
You are not to be told that you have
to be dharmic.

00:12:48.985 --> 00:12:52.792
Innately you become dharmic because
your brain,

00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:57.323
which normally is used for rationality,

00:12:57.524 --> 00:13:04.000
for justifying all that is wrong, becomes
dharmic, becomes divine.

00:13:04.912 --> 00:13:09.892
So this is what one has to realize,
that after realization

00:13:10.093 --> 00:13:13.757
a person gets ideas which are always
constructive.

00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:17.703
And if they are not, then you are not yet
a Sahaja yogi.

00:13:17.904 --> 00:13:23.890
Constructive and dharmic - that is very,
very important for us

00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:29.687
to understand, where is our mind going?
Is it contradicting,

00:13:29.888 --> 00:13:35.322
it is telling something else than
what it is?

00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:40.033
We have to just keep a-watch and you’ll be
amazed to see

00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:44.565
how your brain has changed its ways.

00:13:44.766 --> 00:13:48.627
The upside brain has become normal.

00:13:48.843 --> 00:13:57.799
This you can get very easily if you just
meditate every day

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.024
and see for yourself how the expression
of your Sahastrara

00:14:04.225 --> 00:14:11.030
is penetrating into your being and
is acting in your life.

00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:15.509
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be
manifested

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:22.468
and you don’t have to anymore doubt
yourself, and others will never doubt you.

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:26.217
May God bless you.
