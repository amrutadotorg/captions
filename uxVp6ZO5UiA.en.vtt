00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.480
Shri Mahakali Puja, "Ascent". San Diego (USA), 19 June 1989.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:17.920
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in totality

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.840
is a reflection of Adi Shakti in totality;

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.160
or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.400
She's managing all these three powers.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.960
But Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.160
in the sense that it is the desire of God Almighty.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.160
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all the three powers

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.800
and that's why we can say that when She is in a potential stage

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.760
She is Mahakali and then She divides Herself into two other forces

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.920
as Mahasaraswati

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.680
and the ascending force that we call,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.080
or as a parasympathetic nervous system

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120
expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi force.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.080
So She has actually all these forces in Herself,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.880
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.520
She desires to act and when She wants to act

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.840
Her potential force becomes these two other forces.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.400
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must understand

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.800
that inbuilt within this force within us is desire;

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.040
so we can desire anything, if we want we can desire everything,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.160
we can desire say the joy, we can desire the knowledge,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.440
we can desire to be compassionate and love and we can desire also

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.920
the destruction of those which are negative forces.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.920
But the Mahakali force is the one

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.400
which is working out the constructive force

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600
but in that constructive force only there has to be destruction,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.040
because if you are constructing something and there is destruction

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.240
which is trying to destroy your construction then you have to

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.160
destroy that destructive personality;

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.040
and this is what people sometimes misunderstand

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.680
and they think that Mahakali force is negative force

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.760
or is a force of destruction, it is, but in a very positive way

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.240
and if you understand this part of Mahakali force

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.080
then you will understand that if you have desires

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.520
to construct yourself properly in Sahaja Yoga

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.800
then you should also have the desire to destroy

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.320
whatever is standing against your construction.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.200
So one by one we should see within ourselves what sort of things

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.040
that drag us down and thus they do not give us this desire.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.600
If this desire becomes intense then you start immediately

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.040
seeing what are the forces that are destroying your ascent.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.440
So we have to ascend is the point, our goal is to ascend,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.080
our destination is to ascend; so our desire should be

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.720
that we should ascend and construct our being in such a manner

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.160
that we can receive all the...

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.720
so we should understand that we have to be prepared

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.320
to destroy many things within us,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:36.240
if we have to become great evolved personalities

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.880
As you have seen in evolution itself you had huge big animals

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.440
like mammoth this that and they they could not cope with the evolution

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.560
so they were all destroyed, so many thing were destroyed,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.120
and this destruction is built in within us,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.480
when we ascend we just start seeing that these are the forces

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:10.080
which are destroying us and that our destruction is so much

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
that if we do not desire the destruction of these destructive forces

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.440
we'll be finished.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.080
So at the same time, when we are ascending higher we have to know

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.880
what we have to destroy. For example even in living forces

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.400
when a flower becomes a fruit,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.920
lots of things which were the part of the flower get destroyed,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.680
automatically, but that is done in the will of God

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.000
by His own understanding. So it's absolutely perfect.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.880
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something, we must know

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.600
what we desire, first fix your goal and then relate it to that.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.360
Now there are many deviations in life, like you are going

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.160
to the airport, our attention should be we have to reach the airport

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.360
and whatever are distractions are distractions;

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.000
we should not get lost with it,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.640
if you get lost with those distractions,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.880
then we cannot achieve our goal in time.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.000
So one has to understand first of all that our goal is to ascend

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.680
and for that the distractions are on our way, because of ourselves,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.320
because of ignorance, because of darkness,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.080
because the light is not so much.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.840
The first destroying factor that is within us

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.560
is the Shri Ganesha's power

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.720
and this Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.600
She first planted Shri Ganesha to emit holiness on this Earth,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.160
so the whole thing could be vibrated

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.240
and as you know one aspect of Shri Ganesha is also Omkara,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.480
means this vibratory awareness which flows everywhere.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.280
So these vibrations have four sides in it:

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.560
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.120
auspiciousness through Mahakali power;

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:49.560
then these same vibrations also comfort us through Mahakali power.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:56.240
Vibrations do not give you desires as such, if you see,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.280
they do not give you desires,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:05.240
but they give you proof of your desires being fulfilled.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.360
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this is your desire

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.600
and you give vibrations to that person; so it's a means,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.360
so it is also the action part which is there in those vibrations,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.320
but this action also comes from desire.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.720
If you don't have desire you won't act,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.600
so the desire is so important even to establish your own path,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.520
to establish your forward march, if your desire is poor,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.120
if you're half hearted you can't work it out.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.240
Half hearted people cannot achieve anything in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.520
it's not meant for half hearted people, it's meant for people

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:06.320
who are brave, who have intense desire,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:13.600
who are intelligent and who are auspicious.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:23.000
But in case you do not have intense desire,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.920
then the pure desire doesn't work

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.680
and you do not get your realisation; also after getting realisation

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.040
unless and until you have desire to ascend,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.320
very strong intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.680
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to first of all

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.840
early in the morning, while taking the name of Ganesha,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.440
must say what is my desire, this is my goal,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:58.400
this is what it is, all activity must be surrendered for this work.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:07.000
So now how our desires are curbed, first of all

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.440
through conditionings. We have certain conditionings.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.880
After Sahaja Yoga people become very affectionate,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.840
so immediately even if in the west - where the family is

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.080
not so important, children are not so important,
selfishness is there,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.360
people think about themselves only, they cannot think of others -

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:40.760
even in those countries, it starts developing a kind of a,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:48.600
another cocoon of myness, my child, my house, my home, my family;

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.640
then the attention starts working on that,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:00.880
you become half hearted towards your ascent, because you're ascending

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.200
in a way so called and also you are spreading out.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.880
Then the concern goes to other conditionings we have.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.080
Like the other day I met one fellow he said that "Mother,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.280
I'm a Sahaja Yogi, I know but I can't get over the idea of Christ",

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.640
I said "Who has asked you to get over idea of Christ?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.720
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.480
but understand it in its own comprehensive way

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.080
and see for yourself!".

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.840
But this conditioning is of thoughts. Supposing if you have read

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.400
too many books, if you have gone through...

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.200
supposing you are a born Hindu or a born Christian

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.640
or born Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.320
You were born as a human being, you got this stamp later on

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.120
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.360
These stamps you did not carry when you were born.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.720
Supposing the child was lost, he could be any religion,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.960
so these are not really your innate religions,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.880
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian or anything.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.680
Then you have another conditioning, that you belong to this nation,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.120
that nation, like we have, we have America, this, that, that,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.480
but still these are stamps. You were born in America,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.040
that's why you are an American, anybody who is born in America

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.720
is not different from anybody else.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.440
Only thing according to the climate of a particular place,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.560
you might have your complexion, your height, your face and all that,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.200
but that doesn't mean that innately this is meant for America,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.360
it could be anywhere.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.720
Then all these conditionings within us start acting on our language,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.240
on our styles, on our lives in every way.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.880
Then we start becoming Americans,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.800
so these are the effects of the outside that come in us

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.320
and then we say we the Americans,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:27.680
but if you scratch them inside body's the same, heart is the same,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.320
the blood is the same, everything is the same,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.440
there's nothing different, it's even not skin deep.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.120
But in the brain it has gone that "I am an American".

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.080
Then all these things that are in that society,

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.200
for example in America so many things are allowed so that's alright,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.560
in India many things are allowed, that's alright,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.240
like that we start accepting the society, the norms of the society

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.480
and the conditioning starts.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:13.960
But with all that, this desire is there, the pure desire to ascend.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.280
I think you put these lights little ahead because they are so,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.280
paper there and with my force, light is going behind,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.960
no, no, not that one please, because they are facing that fan,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:44.360
could bring them down here, still quite close to that fan you know,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.680
you can put them anywhere, you can put them here if you want,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.240
you see because my, the air is blowing that way and they are all going that way.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.960
So the desire within us to ascend comes to us

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.640
also as a reaction to all these things,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.680
when we see as Americans what's happening to our country,

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.680
what's happening to the people, what's happening to our surroundings

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.920
and then we get a shock. Oh God! What is this?

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.520
Then we also see this is artificiality, like in England

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.120
you have to wear a tail coat, you have to wear this,

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.640
you have to have this kind of spoon, this kind of a glass, this that

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.720
so reaction builds in; so you start anti-culture,

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.600
anti-culture to get rid of artificiality.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.000
Well the desire behind it is, is to seek the reality.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:07.680
To seek reality then they have hair just like primitive people,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.920
they live like primitive people and the reaction is built in

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.960
behind all that is the same desire, is to ascend.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.200
So this Mahalakshmi power is acting within us,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:28.640
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can say, alright you want to have,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.920
say variety of things, go ahead with it, then you go crazy you see

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.440
what is this going on, why should we be so mad about it.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:54.320
Now they want to have, a, you want to have say, your children,

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.800
your home, your houses; then you just get fed up with it, because

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.080
children become arrogant, they become horrid, they trouble you,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.480
then you say, "Oh God! I'll never have any children any more!"

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.680
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible and husbands horrible,

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.120
then you divorce, you go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.240
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't work out,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.160
nothing seems to work out, you feel so frustrated

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.160
and that action and reaction works on your desires.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.960
So your desires go on changing,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.720
especially when we are wanting to be affluent,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:47.320
people become affluent and then they find the problems of affluence,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.840
so a reaction is built in,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.080
those who witness those problems of the rich,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.520
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.600
So in every way the desire to achieve things works out,

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.000
like some people want to have power, they go into politics,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.600
fight it, get it done and done forever.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.120
So lives after lives it goes on.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.760
Then you are born in modern times when I am here

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:30.600
and now your only strong desire is to become The Spirit - I hope it is.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:39.400
So now all these back things are to be crossed over,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:45.280
they are finished, now what should we do for our realisation,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.480
what action we should take?

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.680
The first action is to develop your Mahakali power,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.480
by one power you destroy all that is nonsensical,

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:08.160
destroy all that is impeding you, troubling you, blocking you,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.480
destroy all that, just I don't want it.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.720
Because I have seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.720
like you have to go to the airport, suddenly you find

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.520
they have fallen into one of the gutters. "What happened?"

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.440
"Mother, we felt like going there", but why?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.800
So keep your attention on that point.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.400
Some people get married, in Sahaja Yoga also,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.880
they have a desire to marry, have children, this thing,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.840
but in that also they get fixed up. Marriage is not the end,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.440
it's just one of the means to be balanced.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:05.200
So we have to have desire that we have to achieve something

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.640
so go on destroying all that is within us, within us is there are

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:19.240
six enemies as they say, is anger, then greed, jealousies, violence,

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.280
all these are within us, so have to destroy these six enemies.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.640
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that she destroys

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.920
all the enemies that stand in your way,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.760
all the rakshasas, all the devils all the negative forces,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.800
she tries to destroy, so that your [path] should be all right;

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.680
but while She is destroying all of them

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.480
if you are sticking on to them, what can She do?

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.560
So your desire should be pure and that you should say that all right:

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.880
"We want to achieve that", and she is working it out for you.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.640
This is the first thing, Her job.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.520
Then the second job is that She comforts,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.600
She gives you comforts, of every kind.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.120
The first comfort She gives you is of your body,

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:18.280
your body becomes comfortable, means all your diseases and

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.200
all your troubles are destroyed. You find that your body becomes

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.560
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.960
and you can work out your realisation.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.920
This is the first thing She does for you: is to give you comfort.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.800
Then she also gives you comfort of the Spirit,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.920
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:54.080
you can live anywhere, you can live in a jungle, you are comfortable;

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.480
if you live in the most busiest place you are comfortable,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.720
so you are comfortable everywhere and that sort of a comfort

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.400
she can establish within you.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.840
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She gives you the joy,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:26.200
joy of every kind, joy that emits from everything, from everyone.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.680
So that is the highest you get when you keep your desire,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.800
the flame of your desire burning, till you reach that state

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.400
of spiritual attainment, then you find that no more desire is left;

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.800
but only one, if it is any, that "let the whole world be realised".

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.840
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy his drinking with others,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.480
like that you become, you are drunk in your joy and

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.760
why not others enjoy, so you work for it.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.720
But human beings, I have seen, they move like a yo-yo,

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.800
they achieve their spiritual attainment they have the joy

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.400
and then they go back to help people, they get caught up with them,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.000
they are not strong enough; because the Mahakali power is not strong.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.320
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.680
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.320
and in that imbalance you lose your will.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.720
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara must be fixed properly.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.320
There are so many ways by which you can fix up your Mooladhara

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.680
and you must fix up your Mooladhara first;

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:02.600
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite moves in the sky,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.880
stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into any direction

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.200
to any height, wherever you go you are quite in charge,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.320
you know how you are moving.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.080
It can bind your attention, everything. So what we say that

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.480
the roots are very important first to be established

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.640
for the growth of your desire upward, like a tree.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.920
So they go hand in hand, Mahakali power and Ganesha's power

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.040
go hand in hand because that's the foundation;

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.240
if it is based on that foundation, desires grow much stronger

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.960
and stronger and effective and they do not deviate.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.640
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you reach that state where

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.600
there's no other desire left but to enjoy, you just enjoy,

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.320
without any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.800
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be enjoyed.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.800
What is there to talk about it? What is there to say about it?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.720
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:35.600
and that should happen everywhere and that's what you are worshipping.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.280
So now I hope you have hundred and eight names of Mahakali,

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.600
and if you have the hundred and eight names of Mahakali

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:49.640
you will see one by one that her these stages are working out for you,

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.360
how manifest that you can see in those names.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.880
So now first we'll have a one Atarva Sheersha

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.480
and then we can have these hundred and eight names.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.920
