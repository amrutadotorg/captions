00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:14.399
Your eyes are very important

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.347
and play a very big part 
in this Swadishthana movement.

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:23.472
Now, those people who move their eyes 
too much here and there.

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:25.965
You see, I don’t know, 
his is the modern style also,

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:29.845
too much to move, everything they must see…
like that they are going on, mad people.

00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.377
I don’t know what is there 
to see like that, you see.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.628
Actually, in former days, when we were young,

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.370
we were told to see the Mother Earth all the time,

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.804
not to raise your eyes higher than that.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:43.003
The reason is the Mother Earth soothes your eyes.

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:45.106
But if you want moving your eyes too much,

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:48.890
the attention is moving, wobbling, all the time.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.813
Now the attention is sustained by liver.

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.543
If your liver is not all right, 
your attention cannot be all right.

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:58.470
So those people who have a habit you see

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.138
– sometimes they’ll see through the back of their eyes,

00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:05.471
or from here – there – they think they are 
doing something great by doing these things –

00:01:05.591 --> 00:01:08.288
such people can never have good livers.

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:11.183
So to keep a good liver, keep your eyes down.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.195
Don’t give them too much work.

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:15.277
We are giving too much work to our eyes

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:19.838
and that’s how it is keeping 
our attention all the time wobbled out,

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:24.795
and if your attention is out, 
then you can never feel happy.

00:01:24.915 --> 00:01:28.476
So the liver sustains the attention

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:34.023
and for you to be best Sahaja yogi is to
put your eyes down, on the Mother Earth.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:38.378
Walk with less raising of your eyes. 
Respect your eyes.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:42.207
You’re not to waste your eyes 
on all the time anybody coming up your…

00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:47.576
I’ve seen even in meditation 
people can’t keep their eyes straight.

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.964
You have to keep your eyes 
all the time in a mood

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:55.034
that you’re enjoying yourself, 
and not enjoying others.

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.760
But you're just enjoying yourself.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.620
You cannot enjoy others, 
you have to enjoy yourself,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.342
to enjoy somebody else’s vibrations.

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:07.498
You can only enjoy others through their 
vibrations, not through their seeing.

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.661
And because of this, once you have 
this kind of a habit,

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.551
then your liver always gets into it.

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:17.870
Then you curse yourself, you do 
all kinds of things… that’s no good.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.231
Just tell yourself, 
“Hold my eyes on the Mother Earth.”

00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.614
She sustains, She takes away 
all your problems and everything.
