1
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:45,636
We close the door, I think it would be good.

2
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:08,253
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

3
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:15,024
and were trying to develop your depth.

4
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:21,919
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

5
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:23,577
But we have to touch that,

6
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:26,067
that's very important,

7
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:30,895
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

8
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:34,487
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

9
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,309
and that's a nice thing.

10
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:40,384
But we have to enjoy our own company also

11
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:44,753
by meditating, going within yourself.

12
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:48,919
Now, "What is the use?"

13
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,507
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

14
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:54,971
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

15
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,966
we are doing so well."

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,546
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

17
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:07,348
of all the things, like all the elements.

18
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:10,070
When you had finished your meditation

19
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,337
you saw how the rain fell down,

20
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,539
how the rain came suddenly.

21
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:17,483
So rain has felt your depth,

22
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,197
or you have felt the depth of rain.

23
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,312
Now you know that if you light one little candle

24
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:27,170
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

25
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:30,122
it acts, it reacts

26
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,919
and it gives you a flame which burns,

27
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:38,003
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

28
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:43,754
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,503
So all elements have got an effect,

30
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:54,170
if a saint wants to have an effect.

31
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:58,253
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

32
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,545
Once you reach your own essences,

33
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:07,170
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

34
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:11,170
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

35
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,420
or you can order them as you like.

36
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:15,503
First they will act,

37
00:03:15,754 --> 00:03:18,003
expressing that they have been touched

38
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:21,754
like today, the rain came pouring down.

39
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,420
Then later on you can command,

40
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,587
and you can ask the rain to come.

41
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:32,670
To work out many things of that kind

42
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,754
we have to be deep people,

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,253
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

44
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:40,754
That is, you know very well

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,670
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,086
and when we go deep into ourselves,

47
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:53,170
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,337
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

49
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,919
When we start moving horizontally,

50
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:06,503
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

51
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:11,837
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

52
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:15,587
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

53
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:20,545
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

54
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:27,754
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,253
and then everybody can hear it.

56
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:36,919
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

57
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:41,420
you find that you have communicated with another person.

58
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:47,919
But that's only the essence of the ether

59
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:51,211
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

60
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,170
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

61
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,503
we can say, by science,

62
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,253
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

63
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,920
gives you all these effects.

64
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,670
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

65
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:09,920
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

66
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,919
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

67
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:15,837
somebody's with the head the light is coming

68
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,337
you have seen all this.

69
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:21,170
This is done also by the same method,

70
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,670
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

71
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,003
She's very active, She works it out,

72
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:29,837
She does all these things.

73
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:33,337
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

74
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:37,503
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

75
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:43,837
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

76
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:47,837
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

77
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:51,919
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

78
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,099
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

79
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:58,151
So all the, all the

80
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,900
all the essences are

81
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:11,378
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

82
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:15,420
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

83
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:19,503
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

84
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,420
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

85
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,754
if you don't keep yourself all right.

86
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,795
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

87
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:31,837
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

88
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:33,754
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

89
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,295
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

90
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:38,754
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

91
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,754
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

92
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,670
also the problem of the city where I am,

93
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,879
also the problem of the country where I am,

94
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:50,253
maybe of the whole universe.

95
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:55,503
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

96
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,587
and I do it quietly.

97
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:59,503
But you must also understand

98
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,920
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

99
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,337
By horizontal movement what happens

100
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:09,170
that you start meditating on a particular subject

101
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,670
which is a very bothersome subject,

102
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,378
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

103
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:20,670
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

104
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,462
If you are that deep,

105
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,670
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

106
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:29,045
you will immediately put an effect on that.

107
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:32,253
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

108
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:35,420
there will be something happening in that direction.

109
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,837
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

110
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:40,670
So we have to meditate,

111
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,086
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

112
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:50,629
so automatically we start solving the problem.

113
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:54,086
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

114
00:07:54,295 --> 00:08:00,170
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

115
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:03,920
to help so many things which are to be helped.

116
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,337
Now you see that people are realizing

117
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:09,795
that the world is in a great mess,

118
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:12,003
and there are lots of problems that have come

119
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:15,003
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

120
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,003
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

121
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,253
We have no time for all this.

122
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,253
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

123
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,253
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

124
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:35,919
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

125
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:40,503
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

126
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,003
means your intelligence must improve,

127
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,587
your temperament must improve,

128
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:48,754
your heart must clear out,

129
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,670
your feelings must be all right.

130
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,503
Then you should, your health should be all right,

131
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:58,670
then your relationship with others should be all right,

132
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,420
your ego should go away,

133
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,337
your superego should go away

134
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,754
all these things are there.

135
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
But this only helps a personality,

136
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,920
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

137
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,378
But now this personality can become an instrument,

138
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,503
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

139
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:20,253
But normally what happens, people are

140
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,253
very much still worried about themselves,

141
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,754
say about their wives, about their children,

142
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:32,003
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

143
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,587
These are not important things, because we have to be those

144
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:40,919
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

145
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:43,670
we have to develop that depth within us.

146
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:45,420
That depth is possible,

147
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,920
and you can really cure many problems of your country

148
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,961
if you could just meditate on them.

149
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,754
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,170
which I had felt were there in Canberra

151
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,670
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

152
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:12,961
All these problems came into My understanding,

153
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,462
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

154
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,837
My working style is different because I have very sharp

155
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,420
and very effective instruments.

156
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,503
But I have to pay attention to it

157
00:10:26,754 --> 00:10:29,253
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

158
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,337
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

159
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:35,919
those deeper feelings within you,

160
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,879
deeper sense within you.

161
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:41,170
But mostly people are very superficial type.

162
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:43,503
They just think about their body,

163
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,503
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

164
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:51,837
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

165
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:58,003
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

166
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:03,503
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

167
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,670
But I think that is not so.

168
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:10,919
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

169
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,253
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

170
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:15,837
It's not true also,

171
00:11:16,003 --> 00:11:20,337
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

172
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,837
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

173
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,919
but the deeper you go into that love,

174
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:30,670
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

175
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:34,503
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

176
00:11:34,754 --> 00:11:37,503
Gradually that quality improves.

177
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,086
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

178
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,754
that house must become auspicious.

179
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,754
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

180
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,670
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

181
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:59,587
anger, passion, lust, greed,

182
00:11:59,837 --> 00:12:01,503
then such a heart won't affect.

183
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,837
But a person who has purified himself,

184
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:08,920
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

185
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,837
the whole change will take place.

186
00:12:13,003 --> 00:12:15,919
The circumstances will change.

187
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,253
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

188
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,211
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

189
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,253
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

190
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,295
as far as the television is concerned

191
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,919
and radio is concerned."

192
00:12:30,086 --> 00:12:34,003
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

193
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,420
But that should happen with you also.

194
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:41,503
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

195
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,587
But you have to be a saint,

196
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:49,712
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

197
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,712
of another person,

198
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,754
and this is what it is lacking:

199
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,961
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

200
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,919
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

201
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:12,420
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

202
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,337
but it should deepen much more.

203
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,670
You should go further and further.

204
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:25,795
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

205
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:29,003
It's the other way round also.

206
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:34,337
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

207
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:38,128
We all must meditate, that is very important

208
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:40,961
meditate sincerely.

209
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,754
Not just because we have to meditate

210
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,045
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

211
00:13:51,253 --> 00:14:00,295
to express our great powers of divine love;

212
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:05,170
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

213
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:09,295
I know you all can do it.

214
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:12,754
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

215
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,545
big education for that, nothing is needed.

216
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:20,837
What is needed is a deep feeling

217
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:27,086
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

218
00:14:27,253 --> 00:14:30,754
The all-destructive forces change their course,

219
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,170
and it is then for the constructive forces.

220
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:43,170
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

221
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:49,170
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

222
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,503
with understanding. All right?

223
00:14:52,712 --> 00:14:56,003
May God bless you.

224
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:04,531
It is much more than our music,

225
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:09,699
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

226
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,945
And now the course has to change.

227
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:16,037
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

228
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:19,887
So may God bless you for that.

229
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,525
Have you got any questions?

230
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:52,469
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

231
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:59,397
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

232
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,111
I see.

233
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:10,272
These chakras are represented outside also

234
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,296
in our body, we can say,

235
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:17,364
that on our feet as you know:

236
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:24,945
you know the Nabhi,

237
00:16:25,057 --> 00:16:28,572
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

238
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,710
– Nabhi is the thumb,

239
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:35,210
and left and right Nabhi.

240
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:41,540
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

241
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:55,587
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

242
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,965
the fourth finger is the Agya,

243
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:04,740
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

244
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:10,619
Now this is the – our basis.

245
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:13,903
Then in the hands they change,

246
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:19,419
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

247
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:23,538
Now in your hand,

248
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,536
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

249
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,833
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

250
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,268
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

251
00:17:36,744 --> 00:17:40,865
And then this is the Nabhi

252
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:45,430
and this is the Vishuddhi

253
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:53,802
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

254
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:58,540
Now, Heart is here

255
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:05,543
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

256
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,662
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

257
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:11,578
But Heart is not in all these things,

258
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:16,723
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

259
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:21,874
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

260
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,164
So we can do like this, is to say:

261
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:30,587
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

262
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,023
and then … sorry!

263
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:39,028
This is the Vishuddhi

264
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,971
this is Swadhishthana

265
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:48,441
this is Heart

266
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,073
and this is Nabhi

267
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:55,350
and this one is

268
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,086
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

269
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:15,095
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

270
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,012
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

271
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,160
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

272
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,747
so you can feel it here.

273
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:31,926
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

274
00:19:32,141 --> 00:19:35,621
because if I tell you something maybe you are

275
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,835
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

276
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:44,588
So this is the Vishuddhi

277
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:50,593
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

278
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:57,195
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

279
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:02,555
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

280
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:07,860
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

281
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:13,263
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

282
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:18,585
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

283
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:27,202
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

284
00:20:27,444 --> 00:20:30,531
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

285
00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:38,153
and this is the Heart and

286
00:20:44,236 --> 00:20:48,744
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

287
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,699
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

288
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,958
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

289
00:20:57,086 --> 00:21:00,030
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

290
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:02,333
these three are important,

291
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:06,759
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

292
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:09,588
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

293
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:13,365
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

294
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,607
so they can be confusing.

295
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,693
But Swadhishthana specially.

296
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:22,577
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

297
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:24,315
I didn’t know how to move.

298
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,053
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

299
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:28,974
– for a while, but they were.

300
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:32,865
So it is indicative of those things.

301
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:42,151
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

302
00:21:42,374 --> 00:21:43,842
Hamsa Chakra?

303
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:48,362
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

304
00:21:48,735 --> 00:21:51,362
where some of the nerves

305
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,063
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

306
00:21:55,339 --> 00:22:02,255
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

307
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,341
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

308
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:13,075
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

309
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:17,123
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

310
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:21,959
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

311
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,935
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

312
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,553
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

313
00:22:32,748 --> 00:22:37,079
This chakra will get easily dried out.

314
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,893
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

315
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:49,055
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

316
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:55,923
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

317
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,150
also this becomes very dry.

318
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:00,795
And it’s very important

319
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:04,380
because if this portion becomes dry,

320
00:23:04,493 --> 00:23:09,255
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

321
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:15,850
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

322
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:19,348
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

323
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,257
the whole body gets dried up.

324
00:23:21,385 --> 00:23:24,583
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

325
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,912
 it can cause you lung cancer.

326
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:31,523
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

327
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,805
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

328
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,956
all the time dry food and dry things.

329
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:45,135
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

330
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,279
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

331
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,954
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

332
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,917
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

333
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:05,013
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

334
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,359
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

335
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:10,967
For that this must not be made dry.

336
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,125
I have told many a times to put some

337
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,395
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

338
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:27,490
keep it with you with a little dropper.

339
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,526
You can put it in the hot water,

340
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:35,762
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

341
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,834
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

342
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,786
It’s for your good.

343
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:50,603
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

344
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,562
– have we any other ritual?

345
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:57,274
We don’t even make a cross!

346
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:04,438
Anything else?

347
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:13,184
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

348
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:21,706
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

349
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,257
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

350
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:34,020
then you become, again come to thought,

351
00:25:34,197 --> 00:25:35,704
again you become thoughtless.

352
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:38,926
That’s a very good stage where you start,

353
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:44,089
and you start growing up into that.

354
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:47,945
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

355
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,720
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

356
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,182
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

357
00:25:54,326 --> 00:25:57,079
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

358
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,119
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

359
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:04,165
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

360
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:06,331
some way he’s hurt

361
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:12,367
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

362
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,814
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

363
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,436
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

364
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:24,848
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

365
00:26:24,957 --> 00:26:27,369
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

366
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:31,676
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

367
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,560
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

368
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:40,812
but from nirvichara I can go to,

369
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:46,999
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

370
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:50,397
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

371
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:55,146
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

372
00:26:55,242 --> 00:27:01,033
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

373
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,874
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

374
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,497
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

375
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,194
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

376
00:27:12,677 --> 00:27:15,629
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

377
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:19,103
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

378
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,317
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

379
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:25,288
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

380
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:28,239
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

381
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:31,670
There are many among you who are like that,

382
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:34,550
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

383
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:40,374
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

384
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:56,656
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

385
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:06,906
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

386
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,793
How can we say?

387
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:16,131
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

388
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:21,142
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

389
00:28:21,476 --> 00:28:24,888
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

390
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:29,180
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

391
00:28:29,656 --> 00:28:31,802
then you are in meditation

392
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,239
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

393
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,073
Just watching is the best way,

394
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:42,937
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

395
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,698
You are seeing them from another world.

396
00:28:44,841 --> 00:28:46,872
Then you will have compassion for them,

397
00:28:47,048 --> 00:28:49,024
you will have pity for them,

398
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:51,820
you may also not like them –

399
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:57,229
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

400
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:10,608
[Yogi: Sometimes...

401
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:15,859
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

402
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,588
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

403
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,481
That is the savikalpa state.

404
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,658
That is you move, you see,

405
00:29:28,821 --> 00:29:31,406
though you are in that state of

406
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:36,272
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

407
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:40,506
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

408
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:43,576
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

409
00:29:43,726 --> 00:29:47,298
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

410
00:29:47,806 --> 00:29:51,353
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

411
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:53,046
 pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

412
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,312
Now from even that state, you see,

413
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:58,847
you can get to that,

414
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:01,009
and that’s what you have to cut out –

415
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:04,128
is to, when you see such a situation

416
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,309
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

417
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:11,035
and come out of it.

418
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:14,260
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

419
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:18,486
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

420
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:25,248
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

421
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:28,827
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

422
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:32,657
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

423
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:48,760
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

424
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,251
No one likes to be told.

425
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:57,268
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

426
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,333
Now come along."

427
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:05,525
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

428
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:25,050
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

429
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,875
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

430
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:30,008
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

431
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:41,418
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

432
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:45,446
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

433
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:48,203
and see things.

434
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,493
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

435
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,918
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

436
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,849
and beyond the supraconscious

437
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,953
there is also collective supraconscious,

438
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:06,964
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

439
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,083
There’s unconscious mind.

440
00:32:09,181 --> 00:32:13,750
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

441
00:32:15,186 --> 00:32:21,543
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

442
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:27,165
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

443
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:32,650
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

444
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:36,804
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

445
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:40,187
is much more conscious of things than you are.

446
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:45,701
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

447
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,028
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

448
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:54,687
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

449
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:58,631
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

450
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:04,833
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

451
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,366
So it’s a different situation with Me.

452
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:12,601
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

453
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,523
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

454
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,826
Like ...

455
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:27,468
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

456
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:32,041
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

457
00:33:32,168 --> 00:33:37,088
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

458
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:42,221
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

459
00:33:43,568 --> 00:33:46,665
just getting all the

460
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:49,676
essence of what I am saying,

461
00:33:50,152 --> 00:33:52,500
and developing and nourishing itself.

462
00:33:52,921 --> 00:33:56,402
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

463
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,731
is something like a

464
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:01,981
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

465
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,565
It may be that it is just like a leaf

466
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:10,582
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

467
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:15,566
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

468
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:21,179
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

469
00:34:21,222 --> 00:34:23,554
Say for example when the electricity comes

470
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:27,330
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

471
00:34:27,553 --> 00:34:33,061
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

472
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,286
So you are conscious of all these.

473
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,169
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

474
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,359
Isn’t it?

475
00:34:40,484 --> 00:34:42,399
So the conscious mind’s

476
00:34:42,577 --> 00:34:45,256
definition cannot be given after realization.

477
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:51,754
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

478
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:55,045
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

479
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,022
who is still not anywhere, just started,

480
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:03,850
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

481
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:10,784
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

482
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:13,413
Out of that also there are categories.

483
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:16,160
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

484
00:35:16,464 --> 00:35:19,290
and a scientist can see something,

485
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:22,121
another poet will see something,

486
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,296
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

487
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:27,681
has got the trend. But

488
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:32,803
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

489
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:37,156
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

490
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:38,887
All right?

491
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:48,805
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

492
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:53,933
 How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

493
00:35:56,923 --> 00:36:00,829
You see, when ego comes up

494
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:07,435
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

495
00:36:11,365 --> 00:36:14,414
We can say when ego comes up,

496
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:18,589
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

497
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:23,394
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

498
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:27,449
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

499
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:32,151
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

500
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:36,601
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

501
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,668
But the spirit is the other way round.

502
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,106
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

503
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:46,392
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

504
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:51,376
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

505
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:55,862
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

506
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:59,013
that egoistical person

507
00:36:59,235 --> 00:37:02,787
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

508
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:09,887
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

509
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,044
It will not like itself.

510
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:17,344
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

511
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:22,258
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

512
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:26,528
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

513
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:30,504
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

514
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,639
Nobody understood it, you see,

515
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:37,868
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

516
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:43,805
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

517
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:46,133
After some time, you see,

518
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:51,901
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

519
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:57,367
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

520
00:37:57,415 --> 00:37:59,304
Why should they leave me alone?”

521
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,332
Then after some time

522
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:05,846
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

523
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:10,693
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

524
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:12,215
I should throw it away.”

525
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:18,844
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

526
00:38:19,137 --> 00:38:22,237
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

527
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,740
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

528
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:30,436
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

529
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:33,580
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

530
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:38,005
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

531
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,039
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

532
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:43,893
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

533
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:48,651
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

534
00:38:48,987 --> 00:38:53,956
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

535
00:38:54,617 --> 00:38:56,662
But you see the ego is,

536
00:38:56,852 --> 00:39:01,158
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

537
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,209
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

538
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:08,477
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

539
00:39:08,695 --> 00:39:15,072
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

540
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:20,024
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

541
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:21,878
Such a joy I had

542
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:27,023
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

543
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:30,704
So this is what it is.

544
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:54,722
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

545
00:39:55,635 --> 00:40:01,409
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

546
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:06,245
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

547
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:12,979
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

548
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:23,996
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

549
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,509
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

550
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:37,359
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

551
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,890
And the fruit developing.

552
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:48,179
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

553
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:51,557
If you cut it horizontally you can see

554
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:55,349
as if you have cut the petals,

555
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:59,209
and if you cut it vertically

556
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:02,236
you can see that around the

557
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,134
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

558
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,291
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

559
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:14,974
and they all have beautiful colors.

560
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:18,442
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

561
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,363
Now the Sahastrara is open

562
00:41:21,634 --> 00:41:23,791
and the lotus is open,

563
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:28,250
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

564
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:31,820
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

565
00:41:32,164 --> 00:41:36,505
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

566
00:41:37,602 --> 00:41:41,130
yellow-covered as we say,

567
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,666
 like a gold cap

568
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:48,250
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

569
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,253
Now the fruit of the lotus

570
00:41:54,975 --> 00:41:57,989
 is later on we see,

571
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:04,741
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

572
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,090
– a dot, it’s a little dot

573
00:42:09,387 --> 00:42:11,672
– and that dot has to then grow.

574
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:14,552
So it’s the second stage starts

575
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:17,597
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

576
00:42:26,475 --> 00:42:32,114
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

577
00:42:32,415 --> 00:42:33,959
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

578
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:42,901
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

579
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:46,912
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

580
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,758
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

581
00:42:53,885 --> 00:42:56,184
I would suggest just now

582
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:59,790
 let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

583
00:43:00,464 --> 00:43:04,537
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

584
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:07,459
 in which one has to pass through later on,

585
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,395
and you would pass gradually

586
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:13,155
when you develop yourself horizontally.

587
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,329
That’s what we have started now,

588
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:20,248
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

589
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:23,744
We should see how we affect

590
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,927
the other person,

591
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:29,999
how we influence the another person.

592
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,701
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

593
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:40,669
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

594
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:46,226
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

595
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:52,504
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

596
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:56,399
But if that person standing next to you, changes

597
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:59,217
the mood and temperament of another person,

598
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,798
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

599
00:44:04,385 --> 00:44:07,008
So let us see how you affect the nature.

600
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:08,554
Flowers

601
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:13,099
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

602
00:44:13,603 --> 00:44:15,174
In the same way

603
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:19,430
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

604
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,602
on the trees, on your friends,

605
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,057
or in the food that you make – everything

606
00:44:26,114 --> 00:44:28,122
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

607
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,206
So we have to see that, how it works out.

608
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:36,246
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

609
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:39,456
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

610
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:41,321
Like Christine, you know Christine,

611
00:44:41,411 --> 00:44:44,086
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

612
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:48,764
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

613
00:44:51,858 --> 00:44:57,213
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

614
00:44:57,384 --> 00:44:59,200
You see, how you are kind,

615
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:03,861
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

616
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:07,658
but your behavior should change another person,

617
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:10,034
transform another person.

618
00:45:10,095 --> 00:45:14,402
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

619
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:47,229
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

620
00:45:47,565 --> 00:45:51,623
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

621
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:54,011
Why not?

622
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:58,661
See the handicap of Kabir.

623
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,581
You have no handicaps.

624
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,073
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

625
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:09,270
look after him and tell him all these things.

626
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:13,548
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

627
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:21,431
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

628
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,692
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

629
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:29,521
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

630
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,914
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

631
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:42,212
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

632
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:48,943
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

633
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:52,108
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

634
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:55,351
because he used to always pass the same way.

635
00:46:55,637 --> 00:47:00,237
And his feet fell on Kabira

636
00:47:00,628 --> 00:47:04,453
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

637
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:10,590
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

638
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,162
He said, “Yes, I have.”

639
00:47:12,237 --> 00:47:16,173
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

640
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:18,414
trained him into something great.

641
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:21,184
You don’t have these handicaps,

642
00:47:21,584 --> 00:47:26,175
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

643
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:29,709
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

644
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:35,950
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

645
00:47:36,632 --> 00:47:42,064
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

646
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:46,600
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

647
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:49,140
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

648
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:53,346
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

649
00:47:53,806 --> 00:47:56,738
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

650
00:47:56,837 --> 00:48:00,543
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

651
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:05,342
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

652
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,065
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

653
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:14,097
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

654
00:48:17,344 --> 00:48:26,539
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

655
00:48:26,936 --> 00:48:38,968
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

656
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:49,059
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

657
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:52,374
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

658
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:54,566
It is like a telescope, you see

659
00:48:54,765 --> 00:49:02,774
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

660
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:04,473
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

661
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:07,775
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

662
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,251
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

663
00:49:11,424 --> 00:49:16,606
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

664
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:19,794
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

665
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:24,511
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

666
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:30,489
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

667
00:49:30,656 --> 00:49:38,857
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

668
00:49:39,102 --> 00:49:40,618
In your dream you saw?

669
00:49:40,804 --> 00:49:44,710
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

670
00:49:44,885 --> 00:49:46,734
In dream if you see is very good,

671
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:51,498
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

672
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:56,520
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

673
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,204
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

674
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,168
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

675
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:13,610
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

676
00:50:13,832 --> 00:50:17,835
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

677
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:22,787
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

678
00:50:22,947 --> 00:50:25,387
Pure attention?

679
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:32,781
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

680
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:37,285
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

681
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:40,126
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

682
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,487
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

683
00:50:57,535 --> 00:51:04,871
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

684
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:09,642
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

685
00:51:09,784 --> 00:51:15,875
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

686
00:51:16,057 --> 00:51:19,559
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

687
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,930
 How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

688
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:29,714
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

689
00:51:29,817 --> 00:51:32,949
 a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

690
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:35,966
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

691
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:38,688
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

692
00:51:38,783 --> 00:51:41,691
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

693
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:44,369
And that thought comes into My mind

694
00:51:44,418 --> 00:51:47,978
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

695
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:49,973
to steal the glass. All right?

696
00:51:50,113 --> 00:51:55,113
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

697
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:01,152
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

698
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:06,321
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

699
00:52:06,477 --> 00:52:11,286
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

700
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:14,703
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

701
00:52:14,826 --> 00:52:18,616
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

702
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:24,009
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

703
00:52:24,092 --> 00:52:29,257
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

704
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:33,850
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

705
00:52:34,253 --> 00:52:38,328
take them with Me somehow,

706
00:52:44,443 --> 00:52:51,803
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

707
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:58,018
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

708
00:52:58,126 --> 00:53:03,269
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

709
00:53:03,996 --> 00:53:06,082
best is to appreciate.

710
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:09,981
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

711
00:53:10,337 --> 00:53:15,854
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

712
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,666
just looking at it.

713
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:24,802
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

714
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:28,949
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

715
00:53:29,037 --> 00:53:34,041
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

716
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,829
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

717
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:43,627
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

718
00:53:43,811 --> 00:53:52,677
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

719
00:53:54,022 --> 00:54:00,299
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

720
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:06,618
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

721
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:11,016
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

722
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:17,418
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

723
00:54:17,606 --> 00:54:22,811
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

724
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,889
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

725
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:29,477
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

726
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:36,662
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

727
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:42,320
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

728
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:47,810
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

729
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,102
and all these boxes were kept.

730
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:53,491
So when they reached the custom

731
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:58,659
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

732
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,967
So they passed on one to them.

733
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,194
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

734
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:11,636
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

735
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:16,865
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

736
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:23,796
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

737
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:27,430
They just were moving like this.

738
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:32,431
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

739
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:36,994
So they had a bliss casualty

740
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,418
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

741
00:55:55,364 --> 00:56:00,447
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

742
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:06,944
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

743
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:11,941
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

744
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:14,730
Your attention changes.

745
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:21,650
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

746
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:23,552
The Aumkara?

747
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:25,703
Is the first sound.

748
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:35,168
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

749
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:39,608
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

750
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:42,343
departed – it made the first sound:

751
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,828
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

752
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:49,541
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

753
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:54,940
and these are the three Powers which are represented

754
00:56:56,646 --> 00:57:00,288
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

755
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:07,611
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

756
00:57:12,927 --> 00:57:15,784
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

757
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:22,139
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

758
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:29,271
This is the one, started already!

759
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:34,752
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

760
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:39,288
all the good people, righteous people,

761
00:57:40,348 --> 00:57:42,507
God-loving people

762
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:48,959
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

763
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:54,048
and reside in the Heavens

764
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,900
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

765
00:58:08,095 --> 00:58:09,095
All right?

766
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:14,301
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

767
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:19,901
Let’s hear the song …

768
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:33,347
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

769
00:58:33,773 --> 00:58:37,272
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

770
00:58:37,943 --> 00:58:41,622
