00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:40.140
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.850
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.924
of Navaratri, and how

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:07.181
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:11.789
It's not that only She has the powers,

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.879
but you all have the powers

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:18.087
and you can all work it out.

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:24.829
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:34.665
With us the Realization is very important,

00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:42.257
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:47.403
Of course Kundalini is a part,

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:52.723
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

00:02:07.804 --> 00:02:12.970
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

00:02:34.176 --> 00:02:42.908
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:47.296
which is a very important point.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:56.338
Now, all these powers are placed in that chakra.

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.440
So, you imagine how many of these powers must be.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:10.484
And Her powers are expressed through

00:03:10.677 --> 00:03:19.520
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:27.545
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:36.412
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.898
- all of them are at work all the time -

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:50.412
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.869
and connected all the time to the Mother

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.656
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:04.132
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:06.819
so, you can imagine it,

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:11.675
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:18.365
When this center becomes weak,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:27.244
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.548
Ganas also are weak,

00:04:31.342 --> 00:04:38.439
and all the powers that could be exercised,

00:04:38.905 --> 00:04:43.658
cannot be done because of this weakness.

00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:50.631
It's a very subtle center

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:54.229
because it is Mother's center;

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:57.857
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

00:04:59.354 --> 00:05:02.449
It's absolutely impossible.

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:07.644
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

00:05:07.859 --> 00:05:09.750
then they start understanding

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.306
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:23.543
In the same way, when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.970
like Ganas, they realize how much

00:05:29.152 --> 00:05:33.976
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.979
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

00:05:39.136 --> 00:05:43.829
So, all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.937
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:51.818
That is Her first and foremost nature

00:05:52.047 --> 00:05:54.632
- is to destroy all the negativity

00:05:54.882 --> 00:06:02.433
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

00:06:06.478 --> 00:06:10.508
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:18.034
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:23.676
then all kinds of physical problems start

00:06:24.062 --> 00:06:27.996
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.435
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

00:06:37.152 --> 00:06:39.633
But some of the diseases

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:44.950
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:51.490
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:57.845
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

00:06:58.141 --> 00:07:04.157
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

00:07:05.745 --> 00:07:09.325
So the sin against the Mother when we do

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.741
- means when we become immoral.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.373
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.111
which are not permitted by dharma.

00:07:24.016 --> 00:07:27.497
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

00:07:28.734 --> 00:07:31.331
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:34.404
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:38.374
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:44.128
So any such things when you try to do,

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:49.503
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:54.565
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:58.991
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

00:07:59.216 --> 00:08:02.935
- immediately the punishment comes in.

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:09.639
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

00:08:09.977 --> 00:08:13.766
the punishment is more delayed,

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:21.524
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

00:08:22.192 --> 00:08:26.663
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:33.057
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

00:08:35.613 --> 00:08:40.599
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

00:08:41.373 --> 00:08:48.563
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

00:08:50.202 --> 00:08:53.493
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:59.017
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

00:09:00.763 --> 00:09:06.239
or is threatened, intimidated,

00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:12.506
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:18.022
As a result, such a person -

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:23.357
The child is talking too much. Can you take away the child from there?

00:09:23.357 --> 00:09:27.504
Where is he? Outside?

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:32.686
Ask them to control the children.

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:35.400
You must control. This is negative child who is talking.

00:09:38.154 --> 00:09:42.168
Who is the child? Whose child it is?

00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:44.898
Who is that?

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:51.784
Please look after your child; it's not normal.

00:09:52.338 --> 00:09:59.279
Normally, children who are all right become very quiet during My speech.

00:10:07.727 --> 00:10:11.144
Now take him- take her out, ask her to take her out.

00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:49.588
So, this Center Heart is to be looked after.

00:10:49.912 --> 00:10:55.763
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

00:10:56.382 --> 00:10:59.174
away from the Mother,

00:11:00.684 --> 00:11:03.756
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:08.065
who gives us courage and bravery.

00:11:08.938 --> 00:11:14.208
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

00:11:15.063 --> 00:11:18.646
also you can be thrown to the left side;

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:23.221
and you can get into all kind of diseases

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.793
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

00:11:29.227 --> 00:11:35.489
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

00:11:36.402 --> 00:11:43.425
into indulgences without any dharma,

00:11:44.326 --> 00:11:52.294
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.300
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

00:11:56.497 --> 00:11:59.058
at the lotus feet of the Mother.

00:12:03.068 --> 00:12:09.723
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.021
the sternum bone starts

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.884
moving like a remote control and informs

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:17.828
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:24.118
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:28.265
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.168
They said, "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:35.289
you can behave the way you want to behave".

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:42.785
All these different types of movements towards the left,

00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:46.317
takes you away from your Mother.

00:12:49.074 --> 00:12:52.146
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

00:12:52.683 --> 00:12:55.369
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

00:12:55.693 --> 00:12:59.431
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:03.511
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

00:13:03.692 --> 00:13:07.081
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:09.263
And this fellow started bleeding.

00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:12.080
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

00:13:12.217 --> 00:13:13.817
I got such strength,

00:13:14.076 --> 00:13:16.684
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:19.327
and I took the dagger from him.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:23.321
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

00:13:23.624 --> 00:13:25.642
And the fellow ran away.

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:30.265
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.289
What I did

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:35.581
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

00:13:35.765 --> 00:13:37.394
I ran after him

00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:40.738
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow".

00:13:40.898 --> 00:13:43.102
They didn't go to the police.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:46.291
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.086
the whole shirt was full of blood.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:53.233
He said, "Nobody would believe". Even the police was shocked.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:55.964
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

00:13:56.079 --> 00:13:57.822
Why didn't you come to the police?"

00:13:57.985 --> 00:14:00.441
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.267
so we thought, better do it ourselves".

00:14:03.497 --> 00:14:04.857
See the courage!

00:14:06.553 --> 00:14:09.561
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.413
and he was all right.

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:15.175
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:18.537
That is the sign of a person

00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:23.052
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:28.296
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.793
And, he is an Indian,

00:14:31.979 --> 00:14:34.152
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.359
I have never fought with anyone.

00:14:36.538 --> 00:14:39.549
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

00:14:39.763 --> 00:14:41.123
But it happened".

00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:44.197
He says, "I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

00:14:44.396 --> 00:14:47.561
and how I did it, I just don't know".

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:49.986
There are many stories like

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:52.707
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:58.971
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

00:15:03.931 --> 00:15:07.558
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

00:15:07.614 --> 00:15:09.716
or of protecting themselves

00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:13.263
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:18.023
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

00:15:18.243 --> 00:15:20.370
but it is happening, every day,

00:15:20.568 --> 00:15:23.678
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:26.735
If you believe in the Goddess,

00:15:27.148 --> 00:15:30.363
then know that She is extremely powerful;

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.783
She is very intelligent;

00:15:32.963 --> 00:15:35.931
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

00:15:36.097 --> 00:15:39.461
out and out, in such a way that

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:42.508
you will not know how you have been protected.

00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:45.188
But  this faith has to be developed.

00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:48.529
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.873
how you have been protected always;

00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:52.962
how you have been helped always;

00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:55.168
how you came out of so many crises.

00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:59.366
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:03.819
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:07.859
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

00:16:08.082 --> 00:16:11.867
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

00:16:12.047 --> 00:16:15.485
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

00:16:15.664 --> 00:16:20.616
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

00:16:20.953 --> 00:16:23.749
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.568
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

00:16:27.732 --> 00:16:33.256
that one should not go about like a zombie,

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:35.173
it doesn't mean that;

00:16:35.437 --> 00:16:38.315
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

00:16:38.534 --> 00:16:40.847
But if you have to do something,

00:16:41.053 --> 00:16:43.545
do it with clear-cut ideas,

00:16:43.808 --> 00:16:47.391
and also without any fear.

00:16:49.344 --> 00:16:52.629
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

00:16:52.885 --> 00:16:56.964
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

00:16:57.162 --> 00:17:01.606
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:04.078
He is fearless.

00:17:04.932 --> 00:17:07.832
Again I say, 'fearless' doesn't mean that

00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:11.325
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

00:17:11.477 --> 00:17:13.917
It means that you are fearless:

00:17:14.115 --> 00:17:17.131
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.396
I mean, this story I told you,

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:21.967
because this was not a protection

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.016
which was from within, like

00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:26.257
Goddess protecting them,

00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:28.496
but actually protected himself.

00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:32.627
So the power had started working through him.

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:36.550
You should allow your mind, your body

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.103
to project these powers.

00:17:39.827 --> 00:17:43.415
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

00:17:44.379 --> 00:17:46.193
and the power is there;

00:17:46.518 --> 00:17:50.926
but your mind which tells you, "No, no, no, this is not so".

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:54.200
There's so many stories,

00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:58.982
so many miracles people have described about this.

00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:03.863
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:06.347
If you have done nothing wrong,

00:18:06.574 --> 00:18:09.767
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

00:18:10.237 --> 00:18:14.352
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

00:18:15.081 --> 00:18:17.910
Remember this and believe in this,

00:18:18.427 --> 00:18:20.427
that, "I am always protected".

00:18:21.264 --> 00:18:23.538
This is something very difficult,

00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:26.574
because perhaps our mind gives ideas,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.629
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?

00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:31.468
This thing, that thing".

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:37.561
So, first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:44.010
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

00:18:45.328 --> 00:18:47.291
Supposing now, take it like this:

00:18:47.474 --> 00:18:49.713
now all Ganas are following you.

00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:57.471
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

00:18:57.849 --> 00:18:59.529
what will others do?

00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:09.203
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.905
This faith also must be developed.

00:19:14.184 --> 00:19:17.080
I have seen people who are sick

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.690
- so they must come and see Me,

00:19:19.904 --> 00:19:23.037
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

00:19:23.216 --> 00:19:26.787
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

00:19:26.963 --> 00:19:30.784
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

00:19:31.063 --> 00:19:33.840
cured others, just with prayer.

00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:39.258
But the faith, when it is not matured,

00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:42.029
then they think I, I should treat them.

00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:44.508
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

00:19:44.654 --> 00:19:46.334
Now I have stopped it.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.286
I used to do once upon a time.

00:19:48.425 --> 00:19:51.055
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:53.489
Not only that you can

00:19:53.646 --> 00:19:55.780
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.649
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:03.085
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

00:20:03.265 --> 00:20:06.062
you can protect yourself; so the whole

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.474
thing becomes like a ...

00:20:08.654 --> 00:20:11.454
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

00:20:13.188 --> 00:20:16.712
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:17.872
all right?

00:20:18.023 --> 00:20:22.392
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

00:20:22.584 --> 00:20:24.118
But when he grows up,

00:20:24.277 --> 00:20:27.344
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

00:20:27.562 --> 00:20:29.843
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

00:20:30.003 --> 00:20:31.927
how many years I have been working.

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:38.216
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

00:20:38.662 --> 00:20:43.376
so that you can yourself do things properly.

00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:50.570
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:55.099
All Her powers She has given you - every.

00:20:55.933 --> 00:21:01.738
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

00:21:03.504 --> 00:21:06.238
You have to be patient like your Mother.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:10.661
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

00:21:11.028 --> 00:21:14.151
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

00:21:14.352 --> 00:21:16.356
I have known many people

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:18.427
who think they are spiritually nothing

00:21:18.585 --> 00:21:21.235
and they have not achieved anything.

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:25.818
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

00:21:26.373 --> 00:21:29.173
that you want to escape your personality.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.238
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:37.468
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

00:21:37.707 --> 00:21:39.387
Nobody can touch you;

00:21:39.612 --> 00:21:43.453
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

00:21:43.592 --> 00:21:45.272
you can support others.

00:21:45.933 --> 00:21:48.671
Whatever are the powers

00:21:48.889 --> 00:21:51.897
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

00:21:52.082 --> 00:21:56.181
all these powers are manifesting in you.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.698
But still you leave it to chance and,

00:22:00.877 --> 00:22:04.397
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:10.599
Now this is one point

00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:15.123
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

00:22:15.362 --> 00:22:20.500
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

00:22:23.714 --> 00:22:27.237
Because it is the Divine power of love,

00:22:27.377 --> 00:22:32.329
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

00:22:32.587 --> 00:22:35.138
But again, when it comes to love,

00:22:35.356 --> 00:22:37.529
they will love their child, love their wife;

00:22:37.688 --> 00:22:39.977
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:40.176 --> 00:22:43.154
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

00:22:43.352 --> 00:22:46.440
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

00:22:46.697 --> 00:22:50.408
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

00:22:50.705 --> 00:22:52.505
But now it is like a glue.

00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:56.371
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:58.731
and the family - very important.

00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:04.380
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.855
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

00:23:08.015 --> 00:23:10.281
But, again I say, the detachment.

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:13.696
The detachment is your power.

00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:18.549
Watch everything with detachment.

00:23:18.748 --> 00:23:20.168
Now don't think that,

00:23:20.288 --> 00:23:23.799
"Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga". No.

00:23:24.038 --> 00:23:27.858
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good". No.

00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:34.366
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

00:23:34.843 --> 00:23:39.188
how many powers you have already got.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.557
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:49.636
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

00:23:49.707 --> 00:23:51.901
No fear of any kind.

00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:55.563
You can have fear if you have some,

00:23:55.763 --> 00:23:57.629
say, lot of money with you.

00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:02.092
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

00:24:02.352 --> 00:24:06.609
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:09.236
afraid of big thieves coming around.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:13.683
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:18.425
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

00:24:19.298 --> 00:24:25.162
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:28.812
Who can steal your Self-realization?

00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:36.643
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

00:24:37.357 --> 00:24:42.230
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:47.845
And who can steal your love?

00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:52.976
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

00:24:53.334 --> 00:24:57.083
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

00:24:57.298 --> 00:24:59.965
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

00:25:01.924 --> 00:25:07.876
then only you feel all these things,

00:25:08.056 --> 00:25:10.189
which one feels in the darkness.

00:25:16.258 --> 00:25:21.312
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.796
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

00:25:26.053 --> 00:25:27.797
watching everything.

00:25:29.087 --> 00:25:31.087
You have tremendous patience;

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:35.416
tremendous patience.

00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:38.422
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

00:25:38.621 --> 00:25:41.458
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

00:25:41.698 --> 00:25:45.459
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

00:25:46.395 --> 00:25:53.517
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

00:25:53.878 --> 00:25:56.776
that you start becoming younger and younger.

00:25:56.978 --> 00:25:59.157
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

00:25:59.336 --> 00:26:01.716
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:04.635
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

00:26:04.794 --> 00:26:07.492
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

00:26:07.749 --> 00:26:12.602
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:15.827
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

00:26:16.027 --> 00:26:20.187
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

00:26:24.439 --> 00:26:27.843
So then, what happens to you

00:26:28.082 --> 00:26:31.931
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

00:26:32.783 --> 00:26:35.475
Because your Mother is there always.

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:39.959
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

00:26:40.097 --> 00:26:42.271
always protecting us:

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:46.121
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.891
All the property She has given us; so what,

00:26:49.547 --> 00:26:51.613
what is there to be afraid of?

00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:58.038
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

00:26:58.217 --> 00:27:00.153
but an enlightened faith.

00:27:00.297 --> 00:27:03.303
Now the difference is, in blind faith

00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:05.542
you have faith but no powers.

00:27:06.062 --> 00:27:09.710
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:18.541
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:20.894
- first in your dharma.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.070
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

00:27:25.964 --> 00:27:32.719
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

00:27:32.932 --> 00:27:35.106
and it works, it clicks.

00:27:35.642 --> 00:27:38.285
Once you don't have any fear,

00:27:38.425 --> 00:27:41.091
the whole picture will be clear to you,

00:27:41.472 --> 00:27:43.605
because you become a visionary:

00:27:44.337 --> 00:27:46.804
what we call in Sanskrit 'drishtas'.

00:27:47.036 --> 00:27:51.142
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

00:27:51.611 --> 00:27:55.539
How could William Blake predict our future?

00:27:55.777 --> 00:27:57.109
How could

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:01.549
Gyaneshwara, wrote about 'Pasayadan',

00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:04.148
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

00:28:04.293 --> 00:28:07.514
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:10.570
and do this, you are that, now you've got it".

00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:13.607
He is trying to assure people all the time.

00:28:14.419 --> 00:28:19.240
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:21.456
How could it happen?

00:28:21.686 --> 00:28:25.071
It happens only when people are

00:28:25.368 --> 00:28:27.682
in enlightened faith.

00:28:31.067 --> 00:28:34.709
In enlightened faith your Mother

00:28:34.987 --> 00:28:39.522
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:41.139
of discretion.

00:28:41.362 --> 00:28:44.296
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

00:28:44.962 --> 00:28:47.493
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

00:28:47.632 --> 00:28:52.255
and You know nobody has looked after him, this, that.

00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:55.501
He is very well educated, very moneyed person, this, that".

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.961
I said, "All right, show Me the photograph".

00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:01.167
I saw the photograph. I said, "No

00:29:01.723 --> 00:29:04.323
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

00:29:04.521 --> 00:29:07.100
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

00:29:07.438 --> 00:29:10.038
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:13.263
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

00:29:13.481 --> 00:29:16.945
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

00:29:17.001 --> 00:29:20.464
Immediately I said, "It's wrong".

00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:24.949
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

00:29:25.187 --> 00:29:27.639
Nigerians have written letter to him,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.646
that, "You put thirty-five

00:29:31.512 --> 00:29:34.976
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

00:29:35.332 --> 00:29:39.669
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

00:29:39.828 --> 00:29:42.561
and then you can have one third of that".

00:29:43.876 --> 00:29:46.507
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

00:29:46.804 --> 00:29:52.180
Keep out of it". So he said, "Why?" "It's a scam".

00:29:53.094 --> 00:29:56.498
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.376
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

00:29:59.674 --> 00:30:02.682
I said, "You can feel the vibrations, so hot!

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.320
So, it is a scam".

00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:11.066
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

00:30:11.185 --> 00:30:14.808
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

00:30:14.987 --> 00:30:17.464
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:20.790
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it".

00:30:20.968 --> 00:30:22.368
He thought:

00:30:22.508 --> 00:30:24.308
"Why Mother is saying so?"

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:26.806
I said, "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

00:30:26.905 --> 00:30:29.167
All right. We have. Don't take these things".

00:30:30.338 --> 00:30:34.345
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.036
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

00:30:38.255 --> 00:30:43.295
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

00:30:43.605 --> 00:30:44.981
I said, "What happened?"

00:30:45.101 --> 00:30:47.977
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there".

00:30:48.097 --> 00:30:52.580
I said, "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

00:30:52.819 --> 00:30:56.767
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

00:30:57.778 --> 00:31:00.120
that he is going to give you so much money,

00:31:00.379 --> 00:31:03.981
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad".

00:31:05.589 --> 00:31:14.021
In this way, you can gradually experience.

00:31:14.676 --> 00:31:18.857
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

00:31:19.512 --> 00:31:23.023
and have faith in that experience.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.174
What were you? What have you become now?

00:31:28.512 --> 00:31:31.648
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

00:31:31.866 --> 00:31:37.025
- of the Mother's attention on you.

00:31:38.136 --> 00:31:43.366
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:45.365
you become powerful...

00:31:46.699 --> 00:31:50.252
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:58.730
But if you become really a evolved, matured

00:31:59.827 --> 00:32:04.371
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

00:32:05.996 --> 00:32:08.267
There's a fisherman in India,

00:32:24.418 --> 00:32:26.096
who is

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:30.373
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.056
So one day, he was going on a boat

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:38.945
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:39.996 --> 00:32:42.825
And when he came out of his hut, he found

00:32:43.124 --> 00:32:45.484
huge big clouds, black ones,

00:32:45.703 --> 00:32:48.170
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

00:32:48.897 --> 00:32:50.697
Just he stood on the shore

00:32:51.237 --> 00:32:53.034
and told Vishnumaya,

00:32:53.214 --> 00:32:56.286
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.385
I am going for the work of Mother,

00:32:58.589 --> 00:33:01.853
and dare not trouble me on the way". Just told it.

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:04.362
The people who were with him, told me that

00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:07.141
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.010
They got into the boat. They did the program,

00:33:10.128 --> 00:33:15.288
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

00:33:16.579 --> 00:33:22.570
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

00:33:24.625 --> 00:33:27.791
For which you don't even have to say anything.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.106
The powers are so great that they act.

00:33:31.344 --> 00:33:35.264
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

00:33:35.443 --> 00:33:38.309
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

00:33:38.473 --> 00:33:43.175
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

00:33:43.552 --> 00:33:46.143
could have been very cold.

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:53.675
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

00:33:54.747 --> 00:33:58.099
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

00:33:58.247 --> 00:34:02.226
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:05.770
pull all these pillars down.

00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:10.592
As soon as they started saying My 'Jai', it stopped.

00:34:10.977 --> 00:34:13.510
Now, this experience should make you;

00:34:13.892 --> 00:34:16.293
there was no need for you to pull the...

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:22.424
these pillars, but you had to just sing My 'Jai', that's all.

00:34:22.661 --> 00:34:24.616
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:26.419
all of you that thing.

00:34:26.572 --> 00:34:28.825
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

00:34:28.939 --> 00:34:31.385
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try".

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.832
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:39.879
These ordeals if they are not there,

00:34:42.319 --> 00:34:45.307
these ordeals if they do not come,

00:34:45.451 --> 00:34:48.502
then you will not supersede them;

00:34:48.661 --> 00:34:50.982
and if you will not supersede them,

00:34:51.141 --> 00:34:53.675
you will not know what is your faith.

00:34:54.236 --> 00:34:57.529
A person who is standing on the shore

00:34:57.827 --> 00:34:59.989
will say, "I don't know how to swim".

00:35:00.149 --> 00:35:03.196
But supposing you made him jump into the water

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:07.462
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

00:35:08.516 --> 00:35:11.460
Because you do not know what you have become.

00:35:12.762 --> 00:35:15.096
You do not know that you can swim.

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.349
You do not know that you can also save others.

00:35:18.441 --> 00:35:19.961
You are still busy

00:35:20.107 --> 00:35:22.667
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

00:35:23.723 --> 00:35:28.063
But if you just know what you have become,

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:36.829
then you are going to completely change.

00:35:37.624 --> 00:35:44.202
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:46.452
will cover the whole sky.

00:35:47.953 --> 00:35:51.127
But this power that is within you,

00:35:51.576 --> 00:35:53.256
will not give you ego.

00:35:54.155 --> 00:35:57.055
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:01.704
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:04.511
and extremely loving and compassionate.

00:36:04.692 --> 00:36:08.980
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

00:36:09.236 --> 00:36:13.930
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

00:36:14.367 --> 00:36:18.454
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

00:36:18.633 --> 00:36:20.433
it's a psychological fact,

00:36:20.815 --> 00:36:23.109
becomes a very nice person;

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.679
it's a psychological fact.

00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:31.258
So now if you realize what you are now,

00:36:31.678 --> 00:36:33.336
what you have become.

00:36:33.554 --> 00:36:36.423
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

00:36:36.582 --> 00:36:38.209
powerful Puja in a way:

00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:45.276
because it manifests, opens out

00:36:45.851 --> 00:36:50.011
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

00:36:50.157 --> 00:36:55.010
and since morning I have been just

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.744
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

00:36:59.903 --> 00:37:03.176
waterfall of vibrations.

00:37:03.355 --> 00:37:06.549
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:10.617
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

00:37:10.796 --> 00:37:12.434
That's why I closed My eyes,

00:37:12.593 --> 00:37:15.073
because all the time there will be something else

00:37:15.232 --> 00:37:17.732
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

00:37:17.812 --> 00:37:19.412
I'll close My eyes.

00:37:19.854 --> 00:37:25.486
But now you are the light. You are the light.

00:37:26.903 --> 00:37:30.844
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

00:37:32.412 --> 00:37:34.878
Because, it can remove the darkness.

00:37:35.606 --> 00:37:39.062
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

00:37:39.892 --> 00:37:44.018
and you live with very small, very small

00:37:44.312 --> 00:37:46.803
ideas about yourself.

00:37:47.636 --> 00:37:52.310
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.093
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

00:37:57.669 --> 00:38:00.402
What is your decoration is your humility,

00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:05.160
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

00:38:05.438 --> 00:38:07.505
and the way you handle people.

00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:10.648
You will be amazed, I also tell people

00:38:10.808 --> 00:38:14.637
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

00:38:14.816 --> 00:38:17.414
no doubt; but in a way

00:38:17.696 --> 00:38:20.263
that the person understands it is for the

00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:22.221
benevolence of that person.

00:38:22.673 --> 00:38:29.919
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

00:38:29.979 --> 00:38:36.209
everything changes; the whole face changes;

00:38:37.717 --> 00:38:39.832
the whole movement changes.

00:38:40.011 --> 00:38:42.011
The style of talking changes,

00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:48.065
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

00:38:50.804 --> 00:38:57.054
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

00:38:59.976 --> 00:39:06.331
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

00:39:13.018 --> 00:39:16.768
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

00:39:18.534 --> 00:39:22.533
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

00:39:22.693 --> 00:39:25.493
really from the heart they had to detach.

00:39:25.788 --> 00:39:29.677
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

00:39:30.193 --> 00:39:32.197
and live on ordinary food.

00:39:32.633 --> 00:39:36.038
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

00:39:36.195 --> 00:39:38.250
Christ suffered so much.

00:39:38.588 --> 00:39:41.564
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

00:39:41.783 --> 00:39:46.219
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

00:39:46.814 --> 00:39:49.348
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.174
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

00:39:54.334 --> 00:39:57.508
enjoyment, music, everything.

00:40:00.612 --> 00:40:07.819
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

00:40:08.394 --> 00:40:12.845
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

00:40:13.837 --> 00:40:20.396
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:22.628
with which he is living.

00:40:22.831 --> 00:40:24.731
All kinds of myths there are.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.814
Some people have myths, "We are very poor".

00:40:26.936 --> 00:40:28.579
Some have myths, "We are very rich".

00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:32.687
Some have this thing that, "We are very unhappy".

00:40:32.866 --> 00:40:35.616
Some have that, "We are very happy".

00:40:35.795 --> 00:40:37.795
All kinds of myths these are.

00:40:38.473 --> 00:40:41.449
These are all myths.

00:40:42.243 --> 00:40:46.044
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.766
complete emptiness. That is joy.

00:40:51.878 --> 00:40:54.568
This emptiness is filled with joy.

00:40:55.005 --> 00:40:56.605
Complete emptiness.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:59.750
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

00:40:59.973 --> 00:41:03.779
And this emptiness from within is actually,

00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:09.097
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

00:41:09.454 --> 00:41:12.144
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

00:41:12.323 --> 00:41:14.123
what can you pour into it?

00:41:15.637 --> 00:41:17.437
What can you give into it?

00:41:18.137 --> 00:41:21.521
So if you are completely empty within,

00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:25.429
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:28.769
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

00:41:29.608 --> 00:41:33.390
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

00:41:33.629 --> 00:41:37.430
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:41.341
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

00:41:43.076 --> 00:41:44.783
you do not look forward to it.

00:41:44.922 --> 00:41:47.754
It is there, all the time.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:53.191
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

00:41:53.648 --> 00:41:55.981
As you know, the Devi's things are

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.996
so very deep and subtle:

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:07.171
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

00:42:07.509 --> 00:42:10.901
Her bhaktas with love;

00:42:11.556 --> 00:42:14.155
how She fought demons

00:42:14.731 --> 00:42:16.411
and also negativity.

00:42:16.961 --> 00:42:20.722
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:24.594
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

00:42:25.227 --> 00:42:28.481
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:30.972
all the time attacking you.

00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:34.972
Even if you kill those demons,

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.285
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

00:42:38.572 --> 00:42:41.063
They should be actually killed when they,

00:42:41.242 --> 00:42:46.055
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:50.420
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:55.154
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:58.499
So these negativities, which come

00:42:58.796 --> 00:43:02.228
from wrong type of following you have had,

00:43:02.387 --> 00:43:04.372
from wrong books you have been reading,

00:43:04.517 --> 00:43:06.370
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

00:43:06.515 --> 00:43:09.715
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:13.590
In that case also, forgive that person.

00:43:13.888 --> 00:43:16.507
That person may improve, but you may continue

00:43:16.712 --> 00:43:20.744
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

00:43:24.544 --> 00:43:30.448
So the quality is of compassion and love,

00:43:31.201 --> 00:43:33.734
fearlessness and courage

00:43:36.393 --> 00:43:39.777
and the complete emptiness.

00:43:40.691 --> 00:43:44.869
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

00:43:45.167 --> 00:43:48.420
what you have to achieve, how many people

00:43:48.639 --> 00:43:50.436
you have to gather,

00:43:50.635 --> 00:43:54.305
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

00:43:54.429 --> 00:43:58.384
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

00:43:58.643 --> 00:44:00.817
and you will not hanker, "Oh my God!"

00:44:00.973 --> 00:44:04.318
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

00:44:04.468 --> 00:44:06.310
It is good for us in a way,

00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:10.541
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:18.286
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

00:44:19.317 --> 00:44:23.662
But we must definitely take over the people

00:44:23.862 --> 00:44:27.175
who are genuinely good.

00:44:27.541 --> 00:44:29.854
One thing more I would like to tell you,

00:44:30.092 --> 00:44:33.913
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:34.132 --> 00:44:37.643
In one shot they will go away.

00:44:37.981 --> 00:44:41.195
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

00:44:41.373 --> 00:44:44.381
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

00:44:44.561 --> 00:44:49.620
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

00:44:49.818 --> 00:44:54.274
And I see, I go late always to any program,

00:44:54.731 --> 00:44:57.581
so those who are useless just disappear.

00:44:57.741 --> 00:45:00.888
And some of them disappear half-way through,

00:45:01.105 --> 00:45:03.614
because nothing goes into their head, really,

00:45:03.813 --> 00:45:06.949
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

00:45:07.443 --> 00:45:11.347
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

00:45:11.502 --> 00:45:14.549
and they get, all of them, Realization.

00:45:14.768 --> 00:45:16.923
In Sanskrit, they call it 'shayen'

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:21.625
- means 'selection'. This is a natural selection that takes place,

00:45:21.823 --> 00:45:27.319
and how people go away and how they come back

00:45:27.696 --> 00:45:30.783
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:36.676
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

00:45:36.855 --> 00:45:38.354
You should not get upset.

00:45:38.494 --> 00:45:41.630
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:43.783
and not so much from Switzerland,

00:45:43.903 --> 00:45:47.783
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

00:45:49.847 --> 00:45:55.581
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

00:45:56.375 --> 00:46:01.851
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:02.213 --> 00:46:05.796
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

00:46:05.937 --> 00:46:08.804
or from some African land, it's all right.

00:46:10.441 --> 00:46:13.897
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

00:46:14.943 --> 00:46:19.003
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

00:46:19.174 --> 00:46:21.174
So this attachment, in a way,

00:46:21.313 --> 00:46:24.471
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

00:46:24.718 --> 00:46:26.456
because you want to have company.

00:46:26.615 --> 00:46:31.099
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

00:46:31.396 --> 00:46:34.384
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.678
- difficult. So you want to have company.

00:46:36.807 --> 00:46:39.347
So you want to have more and more and more.

00:46:39.467 --> 00:46:40.676
But doesn't matter.

00:46:40.856 --> 00:46:43.056
As many as there are sufficient,

00:46:43.056 --> 00:46:45.969
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:49.483
But when we want to share our love,

00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:53.570
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

00:46:53.709 --> 00:46:55.943
but because we cannot share.

00:46:56.142 --> 00:47:00.022
That time a new personality rises,

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:05.479
and this new personality is the one which works.

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:08.624
I mean we are not giving you any money;

00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.718
there are no awards for you.

00:47:10.927 --> 00:47:13.793
There's no way there's much encouragement,

00:47:13.963 --> 00:47:17.070
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

00:47:17.256 --> 00:47:18.776
nothing of the kind.

00:47:18.935 --> 00:47:21.852
Can you imagine in any organization

00:47:21.971 --> 00:47:25.344
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

00:47:25.523 --> 00:47:29.284
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

00:47:30.197 --> 00:47:32.776
also they give you promotions;

00:47:32.955 --> 00:47:36.598
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

00:47:36.856 --> 00:47:39.427
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:40.043 --> 00:47:43.051
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:43.396 --> 00:47:45.729
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:46.491 --> 00:47:49.024
Only thing is that you want to share.

00:47:50.232 --> 00:47:51.659
You can't help it,

00:47:51.858 --> 00:47:53.858
it's like a drunkard you see.

00:47:54.022 --> 00:47:55.629
If he has a bottle,

00:47:55.748 --> 00:47:59.012
he must have at least one person to share with him,

00:47:59.479 --> 00:48:06.383
because he thinks that it would be sinful,

00:48:06.567 --> 00:48:09.633
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

00:48:09.733 --> 00:48:12.000
So it would be half-half divided.

00:48:21.023 --> 00:48:29.447
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

00:48:30.003 --> 00:48:34.082
It is because you are collective;

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:37.206
you have become collective, that's why.

00:48:38.031 --> 00:48:42.039
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

00:48:42.257 --> 00:48:45.065
You become a very noble person, you see?

00:48:45.245 --> 00:48:47.201
Like, of course drunkards do that,

00:48:47.383 --> 00:48:51.232
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:54.974
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

00:48:56.264 --> 00:49:00.926
But you think that, "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

00:49:01.105 --> 00:49:02.385
why not others?

00:49:03.687 --> 00:49:07.846
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

00:49:08.124 --> 00:49:12.163
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

00:49:12.283 --> 00:49:16.846
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

00:49:17.481 --> 00:49:20.944
I mean, no words can describe My joy

00:49:21.184 --> 00:49:24.574
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

00:49:24.774 --> 00:49:28.674
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

00:49:28.833 --> 00:49:34.726
and I was really very much amazed and touched

00:49:35.123 --> 00:49:41.960
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

00:49:43.071 --> 00:49:47.634
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

00:49:48.389 --> 00:49:51.686
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:56.431
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:00.201
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.393
The 'New Age' people talk of is here, no doubt.

00:50:04.564 --> 00:50:09.298
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

00:50:09.596 --> 00:50:12.796
But what is the 'new' now is the new collectivity,

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:17.552
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:23.484
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

00:50:23.793 --> 00:50:26.602
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:26.762 --> 00:50:29.273
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:33.261
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.267
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:36.416 --> 00:50:42.162
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

00:50:42.301 --> 00:50:46.071
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:49.257
the collectivity is prospering.

00:50:49.893 --> 00:50:53.722
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.940
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

00:50:56.201 --> 00:50:58.268
You want to have other people.

00:50:58.623 --> 00:51:03.992
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:09.408
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:11.016 --> 00:51:15.828
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

00:51:16.001 --> 00:51:18.309
- Australia has been always a problem -

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:20.841
they are making money out of this;

00:51:20.937 --> 00:51:23.016
so I just don't know what to say,

00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:25.841
because this is, I can't understand.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.119
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

00:51:30.258 --> 00:51:35.277
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:41.270
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

00:51:41.866 --> 00:51:43.999
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

00:51:44.306 --> 00:51:49.326
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

00:51:49.683 --> 00:51:52.711
That's what I have to request you tonight.

00:51:53.406 --> 00:51:57.671
You have all the power flowing in you,

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:02.048
you have the light which is enlightened,

00:52:02.207 --> 00:52:04.389
but you must expand.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.151
Expand it more and more and more,

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.564
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

00:52:11.842 --> 00:52:15.413
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:18.612
and also I am the whole sky".

00:52:21.707 --> 00:52:26.390
This is what is your personality.

00:52:26.707 --> 00:52:29.186
May God bless you all.
