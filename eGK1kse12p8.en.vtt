00:07.420 --> 00:12.020
The second point is your attention
should have that gravity.

00:13.536 --> 00:16.692
Your attention is very important.

00:17.006 --> 00:20.022
A person who is easily disturbed

00:21.430 --> 00:24.555
is not a deep person.

00:27.356 --> 00:30.875
Or easily taken to something, like say emotions.

00:34.203 --> 00:40.853
Or easily to some other, say, intellectual pursuit.

00:43.596 --> 00:46.850
As gurus there will be temptations for you

00:52.696 --> 00:54.556
People will be challenging your state.

00:54.636 --> 00:59.400
A person comes out with a very
big intellectual ‘truth’ or something,

01:00.690 --> 01:02.743
then immediately you feel challenged about it

01:02.823 --> 01:06.388
and you will say, “All right let me handle the situation.”

01:06.527 --> 01:10.059
Handle it at the Sahaja Yoga point, on your gravity.

01:10.185 --> 01:12.936
Just sit down on your gravity and see for yourself.

01:13.017 --> 01:15.608
Immediately you will know how to handle the situation.

01:15.689 --> 01:20.158
You need not talk to that person,
you’ll handle the situation all right:

01:21.136 --> 01:25.151
not on [the] intellectual level but on your gravity.

01:26.202 --> 01:30.384
If the attention has the gravity, it pulls down

01:30.464 --> 01:33.224
the ego and the superego of other people.

01:40.236 --> 01:44.250
Then you will not be frustrated or frantic.

01:47.236 --> 01:49.423
also, if you can

01:50.503 --> 01:53.333
start from the outside it may work out with human beings;

01:55.622 --> 01:59.521
Like study your behaviour how you behave towards others.

01:59.603 --> 02:03.075
Or study your attention how it behaves towards

02:03.290 --> 02:05.290
outside:

02:07.997 --> 02:10.439
what attracts your attention,

02:13.257 --> 02:17.903
what attracts your attention. Study your attention.

02:21.650 --> 02:26.680
By that study you will be able to fix your attention

02:31.110 --> 02:34.024
in its maryada, in its boundaries.

02:34.176 --> 02:36.249
Once you put the boundaries to

02:36.330 --> 02:39.488
the attention then the depth starts developing.

02:39.650 --> 02:42.442
The person who has no boundaries can never have depth,

02:42.523 --> 02:45.292
he will be spreading just like that, always;

02:45.440 --> 02:47.041
no depth at all.

02:47.150 --> 02:51.467
So you have to put boundaries by understanding your attention,

02:51.890 --> 02:56.466
that, “No not more than that.” “All right not more than that.”

02:57.546 --> 03:02.560
Like some people in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,
they get interested in a patient,

03:03.470 --> 03:06.299
then for them that patient becomes important.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.880
Or get interested in some person that he must get Realisation:

03:09.960 --> 03:13.363
“my mother,” “my father,” “my, my” .

03:14.750 --> 03:19.230
And all the time they are talking about it: “my jobs,”

03:20.062 --> 03:24.175
“my clothes,” some sort of a ‘my’.

03:27.604 --> 03:29.793
And they don’t know how to draw the line.

03:29.873 --> 03:33.627
You must know where to draw the line, is maryadas.

03:36.996 --> 03:39.503
Otherwise the whole thing will fritter away.

03:39.583 --> 03:44.345
You will become a frivolous person.
There won’t be any gravity in you.

03:49.712 --> 03:55.268
So you must know how far to go with a person
when you are dealing as a guru,

03:56.769 --> 03:58.769
then you are a master.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.880
But if you do not know where to draw the line,

04:01.960 --> 04:06.967
you may be crossing the line and getting into his clutches.

04:12.530 --> 04:20.064
So the best way to handle the situation
is to get into thoughtless awareness,

04:22.293 --> 04:27.612
again and again and again and again, and you establish that clearly.

04:30.010 --> 04:33.312
Now, some of them complain to me that it’s not an easy thing to do.

04:33.393 --> 04:39.190
It’s the easiest thing to do, if you give up all other

04:39.456 --> 04:42.922
useless things that you are doing.

04:49.540 --> 04:55.683
And then gravity will give you the wisdom
to do the right thing at the right time.
