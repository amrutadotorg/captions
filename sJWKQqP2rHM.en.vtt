WEBVTT

29:13.998 --> 29:17.908
I have been telling them that

29:18.472 --> 29:22.565
the style of Indian knowledge

29:22.590 --> 29:25.818
is very different from the Western mind.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.789
In the West, you see, if you say something,

29:29.814 --> 29:34.730
then they want to have an experimental approval.

29:34.947 --> 29:41.041
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

29:41.066 --> 29:46.189
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

29:46.214 --> 29:47.986
They will even judge Christ.

29:48.011 --> 29:51.582
They would even judge Moses.

29:51.607 --> 29:53.359
They would judge everybody

29:53.384 --> 29:58.409
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

29:59.305 --> 30:02.756
And they write books after books against them

30:03.741 --> 30:09.558
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

30:09.583 --> 30:13.189
have said out of their
minds or something.

30:14.001 --> 30:18.406
It is never accepted normally

30:18.470 --> 30:22.647
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

30:22.672 --> 30:29.395
So, now according to Indian style of

30:29.943 --> 30:35.549
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

30:35.574 --> 30:37.983
or great Muni or a great...

30:38.039 --> 30:41.670
you can call a saint has
said something,

30:42.099 --> 30:47.990
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

30:49.323 --> 30:52.100
because you are not equally the same.

30:52.125 --> 30:58.470
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

30:58.762 --> 31:02.833
and you have no business to judge him or to say

31:02.858 --> 31:07.235
this is not true, that is not true.

31:08.066 --> 31:10.328
You accept it

31:10.489 --> 31:15.504
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

31:16.131 --> 31:19.405
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

31:19.901 --> 31:26.045
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

31:26.070 --> 31:31.011
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

31:31.584 --> 31:34.101
So the approach is different.

31:34.288 --> 31:37.955
In one way if you start going through science,

31:38.043 --> 31:41.941
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

31:41.966 --> 31:44.815
and moreover your growth is stunted.

31:45.104 --> 31:50.667
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

31:51.177 --> 31:54.681
through believing in what they have said.

31:54.706 --> 31:57.706
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

31:58.198 --> 32:01.245
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

32:01.638 --> 32:05.103
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

32:05.159 --> 32:09.605
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

32:09.700 --> 32:11.967
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

32:11.992 --> 32:16.699
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.901
So accept it.

32:19.329 --> 32:23.147
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

32:23.218 --> 32:26.269
and in that analysis you get lost.

32:27.004 --> 32:32.292
So once you are a realized soul of that level

32:32.649 --> 32:37.546
and then you grow into your fullness

32:37.919 --> 32:40.014
what we call sampurna --

32:40.364 --> 32:44.249
then only you will know whether whatever they have

32:44.274 --> 32:48.381
said is true or not and then you can find out.

32:48.814 --> 32:54.033
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

32:55.594 --> 33:01.380
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

33:01.405 --> 33:05.780
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

33:05.780 --> 33:08.694
Only through vibrations you can do.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.130
But going beyond that, I am saying,

33:13.130 --> 33:16.753
beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

33:17.700 --> 33:21.180
and what are they made of.

33:35.548 --> 33:41.185
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

33:41.852 --> 33:45.674
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

33:46.373 --> 33:50.648
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

33:50.674 --> 33:54.077
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

33:54.665 --> 34:00.164
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

34:00.515 --> 34:03.971
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

34:03.996 --> 34:07.586
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

34:07.611 --> 34:15.876
you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

34:16.745 --> 34:19.314
A connection is established.

34:19.834 --> 34:25.689
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

34:27.007 --> 34:29.455
then what happens?

34:30.479 --> 34:33.851
The subtle part we should understand.

34:34.094 --> 34:40.857
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

34:40.952 --> 34:45.490
these vibrations gradually start breaking into

34:45.521 --> 34:49.752
the subtler form of which they are made.

34:50.170 --> 34:55.767
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

34:55.792 --> 35:00.211
as it is said that "Word is God."

35:01.084 --> 35:04.252
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

35:04.277 --> 35:06.325
Now what is this Word?

35:06.350 --> 35:14.947
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

35:15.145 --> 35:17.114
We can call it like that.

35:17.276 --> 35:21.788
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

35:21.836 --> 35:25.899
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

35:30.984 --> 35:35.560
or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

35:35.679 --> 35:44.912
and then it becomes the Bindu means
one small dot, you can see

35:45.459 --> 35:48.048
and then from this dot...

35:48.148 --> 35:53.534
you see, all these five elements
start coming one after another.

35:53.828 --> 35:59.818
The first element that comes out is light...

36:01.318 --> 36:07.141
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

36:07.517 --> 36:12.530
So the essence of the first element is light.

36:15.197 --> 36:18.274
We call it Tej, Tejas.

36:18.379 --> 36:22.636
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

36:23.026 --> 36:28.427
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

36:28.554 --> 36:31.652
and you see the light everywhere.

36:31.780 --> 36:36.843
So the first element which is light

36:36.924 --> 36:45.994
and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

36:46.019 --> 36:53.287
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

36:53.602 --> 37:00.006
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

37:00.308 --> 37:04.975
For example a person who gets realization has a face

37:05.000 --> 37:09.311
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

37:09.336 --> 37:14.946
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

37:15.016 --> 37:18.870
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

37:18.981 --> 37:22.511
Radiance starts expressing itself

37:22.543 --> 37:28.349
and with that radiance people get impressed

37:28.374 --> 37:34.828
and they start thinking something special about
this personality which has a radiance.

37:34.853 --> 37:38.973
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

37:38.998 --> 37:42.362
many a times you find lots of light around.

37:42.387 --> 37:50.711
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

37:50.748 --> 37:53.438
because the light becomes subtler.

37:53.723 --> 37:57.134
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

37:57.206 --> 38:02.231
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

38:02.256 --> 38:11.792
then it gives radiance and so this is the
subtle growth within you that takes place.

38:11.962 --> 38:14.757
Your faces also start shining.

38:14.782 --> 38:23.758
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

38:24.368 --> 38:31.974
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

38:32.304 --> 38:36.719
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

38:37.488 --> 38:43.416
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

38:43.441 --> 38:48.831
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

38:49.069 --> 38:53.848
So the air that we have which is gross air,

38:53.873 --> 38:58.801
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

38:58.865 --> 39:03.358
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

39:03.442 --> 39:10.802
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

39:10.850 --> 39:16.735
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

39:16.760 --> 39:20.709
which is a part and parcel of our making.

39:20.815 --> 39:28.858
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.555
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

39:35.580 --> 39:40.142
It is not only that you get vibrations
but you get the cool breeze

39:40.167 --> 39:45.230
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

39:48.231 --> 39:51.087
Then comes the Water.

39:51.642 --> 39:54.098
We are also made of water.

39:54.215 --> 39:59.245
What is the subtle of water is...

40:03.579 --> 40:07.678
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

40:07.703 --> 40:12.836
especially but they call it...

40:12.884 --> 40:19.403
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

40:20.490 --> 40:23.366
The skin becomes soft.

40:24.985 --> 40:31.989
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

40:33.823 --> 40:38.249
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

40:38.906 --> 40:48.966
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

40:49.335 --> 40:54.076
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

40:54.192 --> 40:57.399
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

40:57.563 --> 41:06.101
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

41:06.126 --> 41:17.059
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

41:17.084 --> 41:28.549
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

41:28.700 --> 41:35.810
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

41:36.105 --> 41:44.056
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

41:44.179 --> 41:50.304
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

41:50.381 --> 41:57.661
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

41:58.512 --> 42:05.273
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

42:05.665 --> 42:10.125
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

42:10.150 --> 42:15.140
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.701
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

42:17.726 --> 42:20.776
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

42:20.801 --> 42:25.211
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

42:25.558 --> 42:33.048
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

42:33.335 --> 42:38.310
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

42:38.335 --> 42:44.252
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

42:44.506 --> 42:46.897
It is very important to understand.

42:46.922 --> 42:51.148
Also if you are doing something wrong,

42:51.197 --> 42:55.875
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

42:55.900 --> 43:01.070
and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

43:01.532 --> 43:08.180
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

43:08.437 --> 43:14.877
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

43:15.027 --> 43:22.495
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

43:22.805 --> 43:26.791
For example, the water which you touch,

43:26.824 --> 43:32.720
water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

43:32.745 --> 43:34.888
the water becomes vibrated.

43:34.913 --> 43:35.913
Means What?

43:36.228 --> 43:40.630
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

43:40.655 --> 43:45.219
curing power also comes in that water.

43:45.434 --> 43:49.925
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

43:49.950 --> 43:54.230
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

43:56.524 --> 44:03.195
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

44:03.756 --> 44:08.764
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

44:08.789 --> 44:11.914
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

44:11.939 --> 44:13.855
They have shown clearly.

44:14.093 --> 44:18.733
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

44:18.995 --> 44:25.103
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

44:25.128 --> 44:27.665
They can become very big like that,

44:27.690 --> 44:32.169
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

44:32.194 --> 44:33.367
I am doing nothing.

44:33.392 --> 44:35.970
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

44:35.995 --> 44:41.528
You see now there this principle of
the Mother Earth works...

44:41.553 --> 44:45.320
the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

44:45.471 --> 44:52.760
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

44:52.977 --> 44:57.885
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

44:58.354 --> 45:04.082
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

45:04.107 --> 45:09.321
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

45:09.346 --> 45:13.710
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

45:13.735 --> 45:18.093
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

45:18.118 --> 45:21.290
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

45:21.315 --> 45:26.715
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

45:26.740 --> 45:30.353
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

45:30.378 --> 45:34.315
come into us. One of them is gravity.

45:34.628 --> 45:40.302
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

45:40.310 --> 45:43.278
but in the spiritual sense.

45:43.303 --> 45:46.343
Such a person attracts others.

45:46.665 --> 45:54.504
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

45:54.803 --> 45:57.952
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

45:57.977 --> 46:03.800
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

46:03.825 --> 46:08.005
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

46:08.030 --> 46:12.760
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

46:12.761 --> 46:20.263
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

46:20.288 --> 46:24.645
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

46:24.670 --> 46:29.207
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

46:29.232 --> 46:32.884
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

46:32.909 --> 46:36.172
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

46:36.197 --> 46:41.529
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

46:41.554 --> 46:45.248
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

46:45.273 --> 46:48.862
Up to a point, he tolerates.
In the same way,

46:48.887 --> 46:54.638
we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

46:55.043 --> 47:00.604
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

47:00.629 --> 47:05.839
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

47:05.864 --> 47:12.800
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

47:13.184 --> 47:20.291
it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

47:20.316 --> 47:26.525
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

47:27.276 --> 47:29.555
Look at them, how do they look like?

47:29.580 --> 47:33.218
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

47:33.243 --> 47:40.794
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

47:40.935 --> 47:42.968
So, that is artificial.

47:42.993 --> 47:50.280
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

47:50.305 --> 47:56.780
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

47:56.805 --> 48:03.702
the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

48:03.727 --> 48:09.050
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

48:09.075 --> 48:12.331
to understand what you are, what you have got.

48:12.356 --> 48:17.950
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

48:17.975 --> 48:25.599
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

48:25.624 --> 48:30.421
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

48:30.446 --> 48:32.154
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

48:32.179 --> 48:34.699
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

48:34.724 --> 48:41.057
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

48:41.082 --> 48:47.755
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

48:47.755 --> 48:52.182
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

48:52.207 --> 48:54.842
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

48:55.024 --> 48:59.672
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

48:59.706 --> 49:04.114
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

49:04.139 --> 49:08.161
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

49:08.186 --> 49:11.186
I am here to give you self-realization

49:11.211 --> 49:17.299
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
you must accept as a challenge,

49:17.339 --> 49:21.828
take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

49:21.853 --> 49:24.189
and how you will get the results!

49:24.214 --> 49:29.322
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

49:29.347 --> 49:31.991
It also means that you get spontaneity.

49:32.016 --> 49:34.335
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.086
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

49:38.111 --> 49:39.964
and they work it out.

49:39.989 --> 49:44.637
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

49:44.662 --> 49:47.329
but you need not worry about them just now.

49:47.354 --> 49:51.545
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

49:51.570 --> 49:56.664
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

49:56.751 --> 50:04.135
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

50:05.448 --> 50:12.600
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

50:12.625 --> 50:14.489
Just  comes in.

50:14.514 --> 50:16.373
Everything works out.

50:16.570 --> 50:22.391
But whatever works out is for your good,
is for your growth,

50:22.416 --> 50:25.916
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

50:25.941 --> 50:31.140
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

50:31.149 --> 50:38.079
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

50:38.104 --> 50:44.691
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

50:44.807 --> 50:47.092
and you can do wonders.

50:47.156 --> 50:52.576
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

50:52.600 --> 50:55.347
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

50:55.372 --> 50:57.542
Only understand and locate.

50:57.567 --> 51:00.947
Thank you very much.
