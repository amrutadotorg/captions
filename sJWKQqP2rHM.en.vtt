00:29:13.998 --> 00:29:17.908
I have been telling them that

00:29:18.472 --> 00:29:22.565
the style of Indian knowledge

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.818
is very different from the Western mind.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.789
In the West, you see, if you say something,

00:29:29.814 --> 00:29:34.730
then they want to have an experimental approval.

00:29:34.947 --> 00:29:41.041
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

00:29:41.066 --> 00:29:46.189
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

00:29:46.214 --> 00:29:47.986
They will even judge Christ.

00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:51.582
They would even judge Moses.

00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:53.359
They would judge everybody

00:29:53.384 --> 00:29:58.409
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

00:29:59.305 --> 00:30:02.756
And they write books after books against them

00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:09.558
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

00:30:09.583 --> 00:30:13.189
have said out of their
minds or something.

00:30:14.001 --> 00:30:18.406
It is never accepted normally

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:22.647
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

00:30:22.672 --> 00:30:29.395
So, now according to Indian style of

00:30:29.943 --> 00:30:35.549
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

00:30:35.574 --> 00:30:37.983
or great Muni or a great...

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:41.670
you can call a saint has
said something,

00:30:42.099 --> 00:30:47.990
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

00:30:49.323 --> 00:30:52.100
because you are not equally the same.

00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:58.470
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

00:30:58.762 --> 00:31:02.833
and you have no business to judge him or to say

00:31:02.858 --> 00:31:07.235
this is not true, that is not true.

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:10.328
You accept it

00:31:10.489 --> 00:31:15.504
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

00:31:16.131 --> 00:31:19.405
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:26.045
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:31.011
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

00:31:31.584 --> 00:31:34.101
So the approach is different.

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:37.955
In one way if you start going through science,

00:31:38.043 --> 00:31:41.941
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:44.815
and moreover your growth is stunted.

00:31:45.104 --> 00:31:50.667
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

00:31:51.177 --> 00:31:54.681
through believing in what they have said.

00:31:54.706 --> 00:31:57.706
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

00:31:58.198 --> 00:32:01.245
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

00:32:01.638 --> 00:32:05.103
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:09.605
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.967
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

00:32:11.992 --> 00:32:16.699
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.901
So accept it.

00:32:19.329 --> 00:32:23.147
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

00:32:23.218 --> 00:32:26.269
and in that analysis you get lost.

00:32:27.004 --> 00:32:32.292
So once you are a realized soul of that level

00:32:32.649 --> 00:32:37.546
and then you grow into your fullness

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:40.014
what we call sampurna --

00:32:40.364 --> 00:32:44.249
then only you will know whether whatever they have

00:32:44.274 --> 00:32:48.381
said is true or not and then you can find out.

00:32:48.814 --> 00:32:54.033
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

00:32:55.594 --> 00:33:01.380
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

00:33:01.405 --> 00:33:05.780
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.694
Only through vibrations you can do.

00:33:09.388 --> 00:33:12.130
But going beyond that, I am saying,

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:16.753
beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.180
and what are they made of.

00:33:35.548 --> 00:33:41.185
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

00:33:41.852 --> 00:33:45.674
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

00:33:46.373 --> 00:33:50.648
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

00:33:50.674 --> 00:33:54.077
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

00:33:54.665 --> 00:34:00.164
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

00:34:00.515 --> 00:34:03.971
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:07.586
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:15.876
you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

00:34:16.745 --> 00:34:19.314
A connection is established.

00:34:19.834 --> 00:34:25.689
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:29.455
then what happens?

00:34:30.479 --> 00:34:33.851
The subtle part we should understand.

00:34:34.094 --> 00:34:40.857
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

00:34:40.952 --> 00:34:45.490
these vibrations gradually start breaking into

00:34:45.521 --> 00:34:49.752
the subtler form of which they are made.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:55.767
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

00:34:55.792 --> 00:35:00.211
as it is said that "Word is God."

00:35:01.084 --> 00:35:04.252
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

00:35:04.277 --> 00:35:06.325
Now what is this Word?

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:14.947
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

00:35:15.145 --> 00:35:17.114
We can call it like that.

00:35:17.276 --> 00:35:21.788
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

00:35:21.836 --> 00:35:25.899
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

00:35:30.984 --> 00:35:35.560
or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:44.912
and then it becomes the Bindu means
one small dot, you can see

00:35:45.459 --> 00:35:48.048
and then from this dot...

00:35:48.148 --> 00:35:53.534
you see, all these five elements
start coming one after another.

00:35:53.828 --> 00:35:59.818
The first element that comes out is light...

00:36:01.318 --> 00:36:07.141
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:12.530
So the essence of the first element is light.

00:36:15.197 --> 00:36:18.274
We call it Tej, Tejas.

00:36:18.379 --> 00:36:22.636
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

00:36:23.026 --> 00:36:28.427
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

00:36:28.554 --> 00:36:31.652
and you see the light everywhere.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.843
So the first element which is light

00:36:36.924 --> 00:36:45.994
and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

00:36:46.019 --> 00:36:53.287
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

00:36:53.602 --> 00:37:00.006
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

00:37:00.308 --> 00:37:04.975
For example a person who gets realization has a face

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.311
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

00:37:09.336 --> 00:37:14.946
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:18.870
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

00:37:18.981 --> 00:37:22.511
Radiance starts expressing itself

00:37:22.543 --> 00:37:28.349
and with that radiance people get impressed

00:37:28.374 --> 00:37:34.828
and they start thinking something special about
this personality which has a radiance.

00:37:34.853 --> 00:37:38.973
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

00:37:38.998 --> 00:37:42.362
many a times you find lots of light around.

00:37:42.387 --> 00:37:50.711
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

00:37:50.748 --> 00:37:53.438
because the light becomes subtler.

00:37:53.723 --> 00:37:57.134
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

00:37:57.206 --> 00:38:02.231
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

00:38:02.256 --> 00:38:11.792
then it gives radiance and so this is the
subtle growth within you that takes place.

00:38:11.962 --> 00:38:14.757
Your faces also start shining.

00:38:14.782 --> 00:38:23.758
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:31.974
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

00:38:32.304 --> 00:38:36.719
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

00:38:37.488 --> 00:38:43.416
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

00:38:43.441 --> 00:38:48.831
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:53.848
So the air that we have which is gross air,

00:38:53.873 --> 00:38:58.801
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

00:38:58.865 --> 00:39:03.358
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

00:39:03.442 --> 00:39:10.802
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:16.735
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:20.709
which is a part and parcel of our making.

00:39:20.815 --> 00:39:28.858
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.555
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.142
It is not only that you get vibrations
but you get the cool breeze

00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:45.230
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

00:39:48.231 --> 00:39:51.087
Then comes the Water.

00:39:51.642 --> 00:39:54.098
We are also made of water.

00:39:54.215 --> 00:39:59.245
What is the subtle of water is...

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:07.678
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

00:40:07.703 --> 00:40:12.836
especially but they call it...

00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:19.403
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.366
The skin becomes soft.

00:40:24.985 --> 00:40:31.989
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

00:40:33.823 --> 00:40:38.249
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

00:40:38.906 --> 00:40:48.966
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:54.076
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

00:40:54.192 --> 00:40:57.399
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

00:40:57.563 --> 00:41:06.101
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

00:41:06.126 --> 00:41:17.059
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:28.549
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:35.810
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

00:41:36.105 --> 00:41:44.056
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:50.304
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

00:41:50.381 --> 00:41:57.661
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

00:41:58.512 --> 00:42:05.273
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

00:42:05.665 --> 00:42:10.125
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:15.140
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

00:42:15.165 --> 00:42:17.701
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

00:42:17.726 --> 00:42:20.776
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

00:42:20.801 --> 00:42:25.211
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

00:42:25.558 --> 00:42:33.048
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

00:42:33.335 --> 00:42:38.310
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:44.252
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

00:42:44.506 --> 00:42:46.897
It is very important to understand.

00:42:46.922 --> 00:42:51.148
Also if you are doing something wrong,

00:42:51.197 --> 00:42:55.875
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:01.070
and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

00:43:01.532 --> 00:43:08.180
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

00:43:08.437 --> 00:43:14.877
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

00:43:15.027 --> 00:43:22.495
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:26.791
For example, the water which you touch,

00:43:26.824 --> 00:43:32.720
water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

00:43:32.745 --> 00:43:34.888
the water becomes vibrated.

00:43:34.913 --> 00:43:35.913
Means What?

00:43:36.228 --> 00:43:40.630
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

00:43:40.655 --> 00:43:45.219
curing power also comes in that water.

00:43:45.434 --> 00:43:49.925
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:54.230
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

00:43:56.524 --> 00:44:03.195
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

00:44:03.756 --> 00:44:08.764
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:11.914
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

00:44:11.939 --> 00:44:13.855
They have shown clearly.

00:44:14.093 --> 00:44:18.733
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

00:44:18.995 --> 00:44:25.103
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

00:44:25.128 --> 00:44:27.665
They can become very big like that,

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:32.169
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

00:44:32.194 --> 00:44:33.367
I am doing nothing.

00:44:33.392 --> 00:44:35.970
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

00:44:35.995 --> 00:44:41.528
You see now there this principle of
the Mother Earth works...

00:44:41.553 --> 00:44:45.320
the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

00:44:45.471 --> 00:44:52.760
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

00:44:52.977 --> 00:44:57.885
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

00:44:58.354 --> 00:45:04.082
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

00:45:04.107 --> 00:45:09.321
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:13.710
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

00:45:13.735 --> 00:45:18.093
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

00:45:18.118 --> 00:45:21.290
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

00:45:21.315 --> 00:45:26.715
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.353
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

00:45:30.378 --> 00:45:34.315
come into us. One of them is gravity.

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:40.302
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:43.278
but in the spiritual sense.

00:45:43.303 --> 00:45:46.343
Such a person attracts others.

00:45:46.665 --> 00:45:54.504
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

00:45:54.803 --> 00:45:57.952
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

00:45:57.977 --> 00:46:03.800
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

00:46:03.825 --> 00:46:08.005
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:12.760
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

00:46:12.761 --> 00:46:20.263
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

00:46:20.288 --> 00:46:24.645
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:29.207
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

00:46:29.232 --> 00:46:32.884
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

00:46:32.909 --> 00:46:36.172
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

00:46:36.197 --> 00:46:41.529
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

00:46:41.554 --> 00:46:45.248
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

00:46:45.273 --> 00:46:48.862
Up to a point, he tolerates.
In the same way,

00:46:48.887 --> 00:46:54.638
we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

00:46:55.043 --> 00:47:00.604
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

00:47:00.629 --> 00:47:05.839
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

00:47:05.864 --> 00:47:12.800
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

00:47:13.184 --> 00:47:20.291
it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:20.316 --> 00:47:26.525
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

00:47:27.276 --> 00:47:29.555
Look at them, how do they look like?

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.218
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

00:47:33.243 --> 00:47:40.794
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

00:47:40.935 --> 00:47:42.968
So, that is artificial.

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:50.280
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:56.780
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

00:47:56.805 --> 00:48:03.702
the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

00:48:03.727 --> 00:48:09.050
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

00:48:09.075 --> 00:48:12.331
to understand what you are, what you have got.

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:17.950
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

00:48:17.975 --> 00:48:25.599
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

00:48:25.624 --> 00:48:30.421
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

00:48:30.446 --> 00:48:32.154
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

00:48:32.179 --> 00:48:34.699
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

00:48:34.724 --> 00:48:41.057
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

00:48:41.082 --> 00:48:47.755
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

00:48:47.755 --> 00:48:52.182
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

00:48:52.207 --> 00:48:54.842
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:55.024 --> 00:48:59.672
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

00:48:59.706 --> 00:49:04.114
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

00:49:04.139 --> 00:49:08.161
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

00:49:08.186 --> 00:49:11.186
I am here to give you self-realization

00:49:11.211 --> 00:49:17.299
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
you must accept as a challenge,

00:49:17.339 --> 00:49:21.828
take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

00:49:21.853 --> 00:49:24.189
and how you will get the results!

00:49:24.214 --> 00:49:29.322
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

00:49:29.347 --> 00:49:31.991
It also means that you get spontaneity.

00:49:32.016 --> 00:49:34.335
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:38.086
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:39.964
and they work it out.

00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:44.637
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

00:49:44.662 --> 00:49:47.329
but you need not worry about them just now.

00:49:47.354 --> 00:49:51.545
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:56.664
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

00:49:56.751 --> 00:50:04.135
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

00:50:05.448 --> 00:50:12.600
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:14.489
Just  comes in.

00:50:14.514 --> 00:50:16.373
Everything works out.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:22.391
But whatever works out is for your good,
is for your growth,

00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:25.916
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:50:25.941 --> 00:50:31.140
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

00:50:31.149 --> 00:50:38.079
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

00:50:38.104 --> 00:50:44.691
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

00:50:44.807 --> 00:50:47.092
and you can do wonders.

00:50:47.156 --> 00:50:52.576
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.347
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

00:50:55.372 --> 00:50:57.542
Only understand and locate.

00:50:57.567 --> 00:51:00.947
Thank you very much.
