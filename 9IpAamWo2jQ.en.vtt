00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:09.228
…The worshipping of your Guru, not of your
Mother but of your Guru.

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:21.268
The Guru establishes the Dharma,
the sustenance in the disciples.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:29.678
He gives all clear-cut ideas

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:35.615
about what is the sustenance power
for the disciples.

00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:41.532
He may preach for the whole world, but
for his disciples

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:47.811
he gives very clear-cut instructions.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:58.921
Most of the Gurus, when they do it, they
actually chisel out every disciple.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:07.418
First, they weigh what is the urge
of a disciple.

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:13.286
How much a disciple really can receive.

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:24.248
And then they accept somebody as a disciple

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:29.570
after verifying if the disciple is really
capable

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:35.591
of receiving even the instructions about
dharma.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.500
But not in Sahaja Yoga, because your Guru
is a Mother.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:48.896
So She initiates you without finding out
what is your urge,

00:01:49.097 --> 00:01:55.721
what is your capability and what quality
of a personality you have.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.732
It’s a very different style of Guru that
you have,

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:07.812
which looks after your body, looks after
your mind and looks after your problems;

00:02:08.013 --> 00:02:15.075
and then bestows upon you the blessings
of Kundalini awakening.

00:02:15.276 --> 00:02:17.736
But normally the Gurus do not do;

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:24.775
the reason is they are only Gurus,
not Mothers.

00:02:30.773 --> 00:02:39.226
When you do the Guru Puja, what do you do
really you must understand that.

00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:49.815
That means you worship the principle
of Guru in you by worshipping Me.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:56.579
The principle is within you which is to be
awakened,

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:06.987
which is to be blossomed, by which you
become the Gurus.

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:13.129
And the principle is that of Dharma.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.499
So, one has to know that when you are doing
My puja

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:29.830
I would like this time really to give you
that blossoming within your being

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.308
which makes you fragrant with Dharma.

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.884
But as you have seen, after Realization you
have to be very careful,

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.842
in the same way, after becoming Guru,
it is even more necessary to be careful,

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:52.823
because as you know that in the West
we have ego problem.

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:58.271
The Westerners are ego-oriented. And
this principle, once established…

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:04.373
Guru means higher. Guru means the one
who has more weight within.

00:04:04.574 --> 00:04:10.315
Guru word is used even for magnetic: which
has more weight, gravity.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.534
Such a person has much more gravity than
others have.

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:17.792
So he can teach others, he has to be
a higher person.

00:04:17.993 --> 00:04:26.251
When this awakens into you, has to be
sustained

00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:35.913
with complete observation within you that
you do not succumb to the ways of ego.

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:44.614
Also you should not have irreligious
behaviour,

00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:52.835
nor you should have indecent behaviour,
neither you should be hot-tempered,

00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:58.597
nor should be servile, but should be
in the centre.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:03.872
You are the Guru. You are the higher
personality than the rest of them.

00:05:04.073 --> 00:05:11.043
So you have to maintain a certain higher
values of dignity

00:05:14.894 --> 00:05:20.518
of your own sustenance

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:26.150
which have to be higher than those to whom
you teach,

00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.968
who become your disciples.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:37.015
If you are defective, it would be a very
big loss for the Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:37.216 --> 00:05:43.245
Like you become the activated organs
of the body.

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:48.142
Supposing one cell dies, makes no
difference to the body.

00:05:48.303 --> 00:05:50.955
Even many die, makes no difference.

00:05:51.156 --> 00:05:55.363
But if the organ fails in its functioning,

00:05:55.564 --> 00:06:02.560
then all that depends on that organ fails
completely. Maybe it couldn’t be fixed.

00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:10.454
Now with ego, superego also becomes
very active

00:06:10.655 --> 00:06:17.325
and many people feel that then, “How can
we bear this load, Oh Mother?”.

00:06:17.526 --> 00:06:20.988
And the another, you see, escape starts.

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:24.756
As soon as I say that there should be
no ego expression,

00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:27.806
people do not like it and they want
to escape it by saying:

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:32.157
“Oh we can’t do it. It’s too much for us.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.629
How can we come up to that point?”.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.077
This is a typical example of too much
ego-superego in us.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:50.107
But it is not at all difficult. It’s not
at all difficult.

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:56.474
First of all, you must have faith in
yourself and faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:04.339
I will definitely today awaken that in you.
No doubt. I will.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.711
But keep it enlightened.

00:07:10.427 --> 00:07:17.593
By understanding that you are a Guru,
you will understand your responsibilities.

00:07:17.794 --> 00:07:21.478
We change our positions very easily
in general life.

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:24.743
If you are made a jailer immediately
you assume as it is.

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.333
In the same way, when you are the Guru,

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:32.734
not by bestowing upon you any names
or anything I call you a Guru,

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:39.345
but because it has happened in the, your
Nabhi chakra

00:07:39.546 --> 00:07:43.571
and in the Void that you become the Guru.

00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:50.221
It’s a happening in your awareness that
blossoms you into that position of a Guru.

00:07:50.422 --> 00:07:53.974
It is not artificial. It is no brain
washing or anything:

00:07:54.175 --> 00:07:59.735
it happens within you. But to retain it
one has to know.

00:07:59.936 --> 00:08:05.801
But the biggest thing of the ego is playing
games.

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:09.505
That is the biggest thing. Some people try
to show they are very innocent.

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:11.889
Some people try to show they are very
clever.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.999
Playing games is the worst thing of ego
and that’s why

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.521
you must know as a Guru, you are not
to play games.

00:08:21.738 --> 00:08:28.065
You have to be absolutely straightforward,
absolutely straightforward.

00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:31.149
Everyone can make you out what you are.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.352
As soon as you are a Guru, you have to be
absolutely a transparent person.

00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:42.015
Face yourself. Even you make mistakes
makes no difference at all,

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:46.166
doesn’t make any difference at all if you
make some mistakes.

00:08:46.352 --> 00:08:51.551
But do not pretend something which you
are not.

00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:58.008
Trying to put up some sort of a face and
all these things are not going to help you.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:06.173
Sahaja Yoga is a genuine thing, is a true
thing and we have to be true gurus.

00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:08.727
It doesn’t happen by just giving somebody
a name

00:09:08.928 --> 00:09:11.905
“Now come along, you become an initiator
and all that”: it is not that way.

00:09:12.106 --> 00:09:16.098
You have to raise the Kundalini, give them
Realization and tell them

00:09:16.299 --> 00:09:20.826
that unless and until it is realized,
it won’t work out.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:25.210
You could be better Gurus than Me. I can
assure you.

00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:31.095
For two reasons: firstly, I am a Mother,

00:09:31.296 --> 00:09:36.101
so the love principle is much more - always
it supersedes, you see,

00:09:36.302 --> 00:09:38.830
the Guru principle.

00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.237
You have to love others, no doubt,

00:09:43.438 --> 00:09:49.299
but in surrendering you can help Me much
more than I can help you.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.636
For example, I’ll give you the example
of Bala. He has the centre in Birmingham

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:57.747
and he had some people and he sent Philip
to Me yesterday,

00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:59.898
he came down, I saw him.

00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:04.943
Of course he, he had lots of problems,
tremendous problems on his Kundalini

00:10:05.144 --> 00:10:07.338
but his surrendering capacity was
so great

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:11.087
that he just started sucking My vibrations,
he just started flowing into it

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:13.914
and it was only because he came
through Bala.

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:19.455
Because Bala must have told him that
the only way to do it is to surrender.

00:10:19.656 --> 00:10:25.304
And that has gone into his being so clearly
that he’s done it.

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:29.756
He has seen to all arguments and everything
and he has finished them off

00:10:29.957 --> 00:10:34.052
and when he came to Me, he just started
getting everything into himself.

00:10:34.253 --> 00:10:37.368
And he was so much changed by
the evening time - I was amazed

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:43.524
at the whole saintliness that was coming
out of him. I was amazed at him.

00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:48.822
But you yourself have to be very careful.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:52.693
You have to be loving, no doubt.

00:10:52.894 --> 00:10:55.484
But loving doesn’t mean that you show fear
about things

00:10:55.685 --> 00:10:59.280
and go out of the way to please people.
No, it never means that.

00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:04.229
Neither it means shouting at people
or getting angry with people,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:10.265
but it never, never, means for a Guru
Tattwa, never means

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:17.051
that you go on asking for votes. Have
a little indifference about it.

00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:22.184
If the disciple accepts, well and good,

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:32.808
but you are not going to throw pearls
for these animals to trample over.

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:39.363
So that dignity, the protocol of your own
personality you must maintain.

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:44.520
That is very important because such people
are extremely difficult,

00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:51.764
and nobody will accept Guru who is like
this -

00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:55.852
trying to show that you are afraid of them.

00:11:56.053 --> 00:11:58.886
If you are afraid how could you be
the Guru?

00:11:59.087 --> 00:12:01.763
Or trying to show you are very innocent
or very sweet,

00:12:01.964 --> 00:12:05.711
overnice and looking after food and this
and that. No.

00:12:05.912 --> 00:12:11.489
They should look after you, not that you
should look after them.

00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:17.477
When you are the Guru, they have to look
after you.

00:12:17.678 --> 00:12:20.846
Of course, you have to be kind and you have
to be nice to them

00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:27.524
as your Mother has been; but you just don’t
run after them.

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:31.724
That could reduce your quality as a Guru.

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.360
Stand in your own dignity and
understanding.

00:12:34.561 --> 00:12:38.292
I know some of them will despise you:
makes no difference.

00:12:38.493 --> 00:12:41.558
Somebody will laugh at you: makes no
difference. Stand with your dignity,

00:12:41.759 --> 00:12:46.991
like a big elephant walking and the dogs
are barking.

00:12:47.192 --> 00:12:50.404
Dignity is the first thing, the gurutva as
call this –

00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:54.949
there’s no words exactly which can match
with Guru in English language.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:00.137
But I would call you - can say that
the dignity and the gravity of personality.

00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:02.648
The gravity, the weight of the personality.

00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:06.236
You see, the personality should be such
that it’s not frivolous.

00:13:06.437 --> 00:13:09.762
People know you cannot take liberties.

00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:15.388
It is not frivolous, it is joyous, but not
frivolous.

00:13:15.747 --> 00:13:20.037
People who talk frivolously can never be
good gurus.

00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:24.227
Any kind of frivolity is not good.

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:28.110
This is the first thing you have to know;
is the gravity you must have.

00:13:28.311 --> 00:13:38.106
And second thing is, dealing with your
disciples, never despise them.

00:13:39.328 --> 00:13:43.721
Despising is against Sahaj Yog, it’s a sin!

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.086
Even if somebody is suffering from,
say, very bad spirits,

00:13:48.287 --> 00:13:52.382
you should not despise. You can condemn,
but not despise.

00:13:52.583 --> 00:13:55.138
Must understand the difference between
the two.

00:13:55.347 --> 00:13:59.678
That you can condemn that this guru is
bad, he’s a rakshasa, he’s satanic;

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:04.608
but you cannot despise. Despising is a very
sly method.

00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:10.943
It is not meant for any Sahaja Yogi,
it’s most undignified.

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:16.535
But you can clearly condemn a person,
is alright.

00:14:16.712 --> 00:14:22.432
You have to be clear about this point, is
never despise your disciples.

00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:26.404
Love them. Give them respect.

00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:31.792
And respect them, for maybe tomorrow
they may be greater gurus than you are.

00:14:31.993 --> 00:14:37.154
I respect you. And you have to respect
them.

00:14:37.355 --> 00:14:41.580
And never be in competition with your
disciples.

00:14:41.781 --> 00:14:47.935
Be happy when you find your disciples
come up higher and higher.

00:14:48.136 --> 00:14:52.867
That is the greatest fulfillment of a Guru,
is to see

00:14:53.068 --> 00:14:56.578
that your disciples are rising like you,
you see, they are your flowers,

00:14:56.779 --> 00:15:02.305
you are the tree, you are watching
the flowers rising, should be like that.

00:15:04.465 --> 00:15:10.434
While talking, you should not be very
silent nor over-talkative.

00:15:10.635 --> 00:15:17.458
You see, any extreme should be given up –
when you have to talk you must talk.

00:15:17.659 --> 00:15:22.676
Talk with dignity and gravity. And with
experience, with understanding.

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:26.287
Now, see, supposing you have some problems,

00:15:26.488 --> 00:15:28.670
sit down in your meditation and find out.

00:15:28.871 --> 00:15:35.699
You will find out within yourself
the answer; if not, you can always ask.

00:15:37.344 --> 00:15:42.160
And you’ll be amazed how the powers will
be flowing through you.

00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:50.477
Today, in this puja, please, be in
a receptive mood. And it will work out.

00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:55.277
If there are some problems, some chakras
catching, just don’t worry about them,

00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:59.180
pay attention to how much you are
receiving in, that’s all.

00:15:59.381 --> 00:16:03.717
Some people have very funny ideas, even
during puja they’ll go on like this –

00:16:03.918 --> 00:16:09.080
it’s very bad. Even when I am speaking,
they do it like this. Is all frivolous.

00:16:09.281 --> 00:16:11.938
It’s a kind of a gravity a person must
have,

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:17.426
that when you are listening you must listen
with full gravity.

00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:23.715
And that is gravity of this Mother Earth
is nothing but is her awareness,

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:28.651
is her vibrations, sandipan (संदीपन).
That is her gravity.

00:16:28.852 --> 00:16:32.288
In the same way, this gravity must come
into us.

00:16:32.489 --> 00:16:37.684
When it comes into you, a person becomes
like a magnet.

00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:40.822
Absolutely like a magnet a personality
becomes.

00:16:41.023 --> 00:16:50.015
Magnet as it attracts people, or we can
say as it attracts the iron.

00:16:50.216 --> 00:16:53.143
Not – it doesn’t attract every sort
of thing.

00:16:53.344 --> 00:16:57.497
In the same way, you’ll be attracting
the real seekers.

00:16:57.698 --> 00:17:03.434
The real seekers will come to Me when they
will see that magnet working in you.

00:17:03.635 --> 00:17:08.615
In India many people have put sign-doors
in their houses, you see.

00:17:08.816 --> 00:17:12.482
Sign-doors that “Sahaja Yoga center”.

00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:17.500
And you’ll be surprised that in every
corner one can do like that work,

00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:23.171
and people can join and come there, and
a center can be started.

00:17:24.867 --> 00:17:29.968
Next time, of course, I will also tell you
how you should, before doing anything –

00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:33.720
must, before starting your guru work,
you must always

00:17:33.921 --> 00:17:37.267
prostrate yourself before your own Guru,
and then do it.

00:17:37.468 --> 00:17:42.456
Because in India even a musician –
a musician

00:17:42.657 --> 00:17:45.502
when he starts singing, first
he takes his Guru’s name,

00:17:45.703 --> 00:17:48.213
then of his family, “Dharana”, they
call it.

00:17:48.414 --> 00:17:52.884
Means your, the family is Sahaja Yoga.
You should take the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:53.085 --> 00:17:58.007
And while singing the songs, you see,
sometimes these Gurus have composed

00:17:58.208 --> 00:18:01.877
the poems and things, and there is the name
of the Guru somewhere in between that –

00:18:02.078 --> 00:18:05.174
Kabir says, or somebody says. When the name
comes in,

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:09.222
they hold their ears like this. Even while
dancing they’ll hold their ears like this,

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.530
you see, musicians carefully they’ll hold
their ears,

00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:16.183
meaning that, “Oh Guru, please forgive
us, we are taking your name

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:19.284
like this, so please forgive us, Oh Guru”.

00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:24.238
That kind of a complete respect for
the Guru has to be there.

00:18:24.439 --> 00:18:27.586
If you do not give respect you will not get
respect.

00:18:27.787 --> 00:18:31.988
Respect is to be given, then it is to be
commanded.

00:18:32.189 --> 00:18:38.011
First you start demanding respect you
cannot. First you have to give respect.

00:18:38.212 --> 00:18:44.985
And that is something you should remember,
and people will respect you, no doubt.

00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:48.927
Now see that we have to be very careful

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:53.216
about how we behave with others, and
how we dress up also.

00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:56.427
It’s better that you take to lighter shades
of clothes,

00:18:56.628 --> 00:18:59.477
and whiter, more whiter shades of clothes,

00:18:59.678 --> 00:19:03.939
because that is how it is going to work
out ultimately.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:08.529
Try to take – when you are doing guru’s
job, then take to lighter colours,

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.858
and lighter shades, maybe white,
is the best.

00:19:13.066 --> 00:19:18.917
I mean now, henceforward when you buy
something, buy of genuine stuff

00:19:19.118 --> 00:19:22.726
like cotton and all that, and buy one thing
like that –

00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:27.666
you can have such a thing which is genuine
thing for when you are doing guru’s work,

00:19:27.867 --> 00:19:32.408
when you are meeting your disciples,
meet them in that dress.

00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:35.803
Because white colour is meant for the Satya
Yuga.

00:19:36.005 --> 00:19:39.712
And that’s what you have to wear only when
you are dealing like a guru.

00:19:39.913 --> 00:19:42.132
That is important, that will help you,

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:45.596
because you must have the personality
of a guru.

00:19:45.812 --> 00:19:48.384
When people see you they should know
that you are a guru,

00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:50.507
when you walk they should see you are
a guru,

00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:53.255
when you talk they should think that,
“He is the man,

00:19:53.456 --> 00:19:58.743
we can say he is definitely the man who has
achieved something in life”.

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:05.069
So in every way you’ll be blessed
by the Divine,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.446
because you are doing the job
of the Divine.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.664
The Divine is going to look after you,
everything;

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:16.938
only thing what you have to look after
is your own dignity;

00:20:17.139 --> 00:20:24.335
own dignity and your own proper
countenance, that’s important.

00:20:24.536 --> 00:20:27.184
That’s why, I mean, I tell the hippies that
you cut your hair,

00:20:27.385 --> 00:20:29.394
I mean, this is too much of it’s not good.

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:32.545
I mean, you shouldn’t look like something
out of the blue,

00:20:32.746 --> 00:20:36.186
even too much dandy person doesn’t look
nice as a guru.

00:20:36.387 --> 00:20:39.889
It’s a – it’s both the extremes must be
avoided. Should be in the center,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.988
something very, very in the center, you
must just try,

00:20:44.189 --> 00:20:47.976
nothing this extreme or that extreme.

00:20:48.177 --> 00:20:50.981
As for the knowledge, that is within you.

00:20:51.182 --> 00:20:53.451
Actually, I don’t have to tell you
anything.

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.867
That is within you, you just seek inside,
and it will be there.

00:20:57.068 --> 00:20:59.822
You just start speaking and it will be
expressing itself.

00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:04.105
You won’t have to at all ask Me, I can tell
you this much –

00:21:04.314 --> 00:21:07.434
it will just come out. There’s a girl
of ten years in India,

00:21:07.635 --> 00:21:10.873
and she started this – and I mean, she was
speaking, people said,

00:21:11.074 --> 00:21:14.457
as if Mataji Herself was speaking.

00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:18.469
So you don’t have to worry about it, but
in case there is any problem

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.757
I am always there to help you.

00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:23.951
So may God bless you. Let us be prepared
for this puja,

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:26.821
by God’s Grace all of you will have it.

00:21:27.022 --> 00:21:33.825
In this awakening, I have to tell you
that age, race,

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:41.855
sex, colour, nothing matters...
