00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:10.878
Today we are going to worship

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:23.696
the principle of Mahalakshmi in Belgium.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:45.446
Belgium has a speciality that it creates
glass bangles for the Mother.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:10.220
That is, the bangles which are used

00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:16.134
as a beautiful musical accompaniment

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:24.964
to the gait, to all the movements
of the Goddess.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.602
It brings a delicacy in a woman;

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:58.840
and gives a consciousness to the man
or the men

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.210
that there are ladies around.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:25.920
And the ladies are around who are married
ladies, are very auspicious.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.559
And this auspiciousness is the one that
is going to bring

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.696
in this country or in any country
whatsoever all the blessings.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:09.488
Also in Sanskrit language a bangle is
called as Valaya,

00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:26.585
and that is the last stage which one has
to reach in one’s ascent.

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:35.665
That means the complete.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.999
Also, we are having here a puja for Holland

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:56.957
which is the Jala Devata, is the Goddess
of water.

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:10.831
It comes from the word “marine”,
the word Mary, Maria.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.566
All these words come from the word
“marine”.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.005
In Holland as you know, the sea is above
the land.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:47.942
We can say that the Guru is sitting
at a higher position than the chela.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.063
And His knowledge is channelized
into various channels.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:24.890
And all the wealth, the money, that is
earned out of marine activities

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:32.209
flow through the greatness of this ocean.

00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:55.527
So Dutch people are highly blessed people.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:12.077
They are very tall because Dattatreya is
a very tall personality.

00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:36.461
And if they become conscious of their
position,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:48.804
one day Dutch can do a lot in the realm
of God's work.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:04.075
But all the time trouble in both
the countries has come

00:07:04.276 --> 00:07:13.070
because they have not paid any respect
to their Guru, which is the ocean.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.119
They exploited and took advantage
of the sea,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:39.885
but never realised what the sea means
in the religious aspect.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.776
The Lakshmi came out of the sea;

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.920
that is the wealth that has come out
of the sea.

00:08:08.463 --> 00:08:13.355
But the wealth has to be like a Lakshmi.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.360
The Lakshmi has a motherly nature.

00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:27.069
She's a mother. She's a mother.

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:38.347
She is standing on a lotus.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:45.224
That means She does not throw her weight
anywhere.

00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:53.687
Like people go and occupy other territories

00:08:53.888 --> 00:09:01.287
and use them for their own purpose will
never give them Lakshmi principle.

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:18.105
Only thing that may happen to them is
to get some money for the time being.

00:09:18.306 --> 00:09:24.075
But they say Lakshmi is chanchal; means
She is all the time shifting and She shifts.

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:29.881
Such a Lakshmi is chanchal, is shifting.

00:09:44.915 --> 00:09:52.997
Lakshmi has got one hand which is giving,
like this.

00:09:56.037 --> 00:10:02.298
Another hand She has got by which She
protects people.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.757
In two hands She has got pink lotuses.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.604
The pink lotus suggests the warmth.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:38.048
A person who has got Lakshmi has to have
warmth in his household.

00:10:45.844 --> 00:10:53.763
He must have in his heart warmth to receive
people.

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:06.599
A lotus flower receives even a horrible
beetle,

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.760
black beetle which has got all kinds
of thorns in it

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:17.755
and allows it to sleep overnight as a nice
guest.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:35.711
In the corona of the lotus there is
beautiful spread

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:40.040
of the yellow coloured pollen

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:50.181
on which this beetle rolls and enjoys
the comfort.

00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:08.113
And the lotus watches the enjoyment
of the beetle.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.177
It does not get disturbed. It does not get
upset

00:12:18.378 --> 00:12:28.491
and when the lotus opens out, the beetle
just goes away.

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:41.004
And the lotus still grows, it doesn't die
out.

00:12:46.671 --> 00:12:52.532
In modern life, we don't want guests

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:02.892
and if some guests come in the house they
dare not even spoil the carpet.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:18.261
We clean the house; we polish all our
silver and all our brass,

00:13:18.462 --> 00:13:24.670
but we don't want even a little rat to come
inside.

00:13:35.597 --> 00:13:40.058
For whom are we doing all this work?

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:50.991
There are no children in the house and
the old people are in the old house.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.440
Children are in the hostels.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.161
And the husband, wife are in the divorce
case.

00:14:12.253 --> 00:14:18.113
But they are very particular about their
brass being polished.

00:14:19.694 --> 00:14:24.597
So the whole polish has come outside.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:37.632
So the beauty of lotus flower is that it is
all embracing.

00:14:44.137 --> 00:14:47.830
It's a very motherly principle.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:54.079
It tolerates any type of nonsense from
the beetle.

00:15:02.182 --> 00:15:09.192
So one of the aspects of Mahalakshmi

00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:14.350
is Gruhalakshmi, is the one who is
the housewife.

00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:27.309
And if this aspect is spoiled, then we
cannot have Lakshmi in our house;

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.104
we cannot have wealth in our house.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.550
The Lakshmi will disappear from all such
houses

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:47.066
where the housewife is not respected

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.928
or the housewife is not respectable.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:06.109
The another aspect of that Lakshmi tattwa is

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:13.898
that She gives protection to some people.

00:16:17.912 --> 00:16:27.520
That means ashraya means there are people
who are supported by such a person.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.121
I do not know how you people run your
orphanages here

00:16:39.322 --> 00:16:41.998
or how you manage your charities.

00:16:42.199 --> 00:16:48.156
But in India, if a man or a woman gets
money beyond a certain point,

00:16:48.357 --> 00:16:57.107
she will take out at least one tenth
of that money for charities.

00:17:13.478 --> 00:17:23.559
And she will also have or he will have money
or any shelter or anything for people

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:31.378
who are working for him, ashraya, working
for him.

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:48.689
I have seen many people who are rich,
but they are extremely beggarish.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.597
They have no dignity of any kind.

00:18:01.421 --> 00:18:08.643
They will come to your house and they may
even ask for an empty tin.

00:18:11.004 --> 00:18:14.456
Translator: An empty tin? Shri Mataji:
Empty tin, yeah. There are people.

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:17.588
Translator: What is empty tin?
Yogi: Empty can.

00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:24.178
Shri Mataji: Empty can. Translator: Oh!
Oh, sorry. I didn’t understand.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.482
Shri Mataji: Or else if you go to their
house

00:18:33.683 --> 00:18:41.452
they'll give you or offer you something
which is leftover.

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:51.323
So there is no dignity of any kind in this.

00:18:52.357 --> 00:18:56.218
It's without any self respect.

00:18:57.093 --> 00:19:02.979
Because if you have self respect, how can
you behave like this?

00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:17.807
Then there is another aspect of Lakshmi
where She is proud like an elephant.

00:19:21.206 --> 00:19:24.811
She has a propensity.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.951
She is not like a mosquito.

00:19:30.452 --> 00:19:35.047
I mean, many people think that these days
to be mosquitoes is very good,

00:19:35.248 --> 00:19:42.827
but, I think, if you have mosquito-like
personality nobody respects you.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:20:02.069
They all think you must be some sort of
a typist or maybe some sort of a person

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.629
or doing some sort of menial work

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.415
or working very hard that you have lost
all your weight.

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:26.769
So a Lakshmi has to have a gravity.

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:38.972
But nowadays, the whole thing is changed.

00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:48.179
I knew Belgian people long time back;
they were all having some propensities.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.530
They were rich people.

00:21:01.973 --> 00:21:05.121
Even the Dutch.

00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:09.389
But now both the countries have perhaps
become poor,

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:13.906
so people look like mosquitoes to Me.

00:21:27.454 --> 00:21:35.285
So a person who has got money doesn't jump
like a monkey,

00:21:35.486 --> 00:21:39.296
but walks like an elephant;

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.385
in a dignified manner.

00:21:51.586 --> 00:21:59.299
But sometimes, I have seen in the west
people walk like horses.

00:22:04.414 --> 00:22:12.204
In India, we had a wedding and we all
ladies were walking in the procession,

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:21.069
and we saw one lady in the middle
of the whole crowd

00:22:21.277 --> 00:22:28.004
just coming up and down like a yo-yo.

00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:41.035
So we couldn't understand what was this,
who is this lady.

00:22:43.397 --> 00:22:49.081
Then we discovered that one Indian had
married an American lady,

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.070
and when she was walking she was walking
like a horse

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:03.415
between all the Indian women singing,
she was walking like a horse, you see.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:17.029
So you have to be like an elephant when
you walk, Gaja Gamini.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:23.755
That's one of the names of the Goddess;
She walks like an elephant in a swingy way.

00:23:28.024 --> 00:23:31.367
The reason you see also...

00:23:31.568 --> 00:23:34.269
(Aside to the translator) Did you say that?
Translator: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.241
Shri Mataji: ...and the Kundalini also,
you see, doesn't agree very much

00:23:39.442 --> 00:23:42.972
with the horse movement.

00:23:46.342 --> 00:23:49.867
Because, if you move the Kundalini up
and down, up and down,

00:23:50.068 --> 00:23:53.358
She doesn't know where to go!

00:24:04.966 --> 00:24:09.220
But you see elephant's walk is
left, right, left, right, left, right.

00:24:09.421 --> 00:24:16.234
It goes up, properly, keeping the central
path.

00:24:22.298 --> 00:24:27.029
So it's not very, very good to walk
in that fashion,

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.529
if you have to establish Sahaja Yoga
properly.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:49.016
Now the Mahalakshmi principle comes out
of the Lakshmi principle.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:57.825
That is when you have wealth and when
you have acted

00:24:58.026 --> 00:25:03.069
according to the image of the Lakshmi

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:08.184
then the Mahalakshmi principle rises
within you.

00:25:18.513 --> 00:25:21.228
Now the Mahalakshmi tattwa, the principle

00:25:21.429 --> 00:25:31.228
is that you start thinking only about
your Spirit.

00:25:37.382 --> 00:25:43.592
When you are absolutely satisfied with
the material wealth,

00:25:45.598 --> 00:25:50.787
then you start coming to the Spirit.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.683
It was nice that people were seeking

00:25:55.884 --> 00:26:02.248
material wealth and had industrial
revolution in a way.

00:26:07.926 --> 00:26:13.470
But as a result of that you do not find
that the greed has gone down,

00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:17.537
on the contrary, it has increased.

00:26:21.449 --> 00:26:26.098
And... Translator: Sorry, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Sorry.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.433
And the lust has become so perverted.

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:42.403
So we can find very clearly that we have
failed the principle of Lakshmi

00:26:42.604 --> 00:26:50.690
in our societies, in our families, in our
governments.

00:27:02.422 --> 00:27:09.869
So the understanding of Spirit is only
possible for people

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:17.728
who have understood the meaning of Lakshmi
principle, first of all.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:30.846
So the purpose of Lakshmi is only fourfold;

00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:37.437
first is, that you have to give.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.190
It is not like in the church they will say:
“All right,

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.712
you have to give your money, give it
to me”, it's not that.

00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:56.798
Because I don't want anything. But you
have to be generous by nature,

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.760
and not miserly.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:11.596
Supposing you have one door open, no air
will come in.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.549
Only the air that is sufficient for
the room will be there,

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:29.081
and there won't be any entry of new air
or more air or any draught inside.

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:36.668
But if you open the door, another one,

00:28:36.869 --> 00:28:41.721
then you will find there will be
a circulation of air.

00:28:45.444 --> 00:28:52.687
So by generosity, the circulation starts
and you solve your material problems.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:05.852
The another principle which we should
follow - one of generosity -

00:29:06.053 --> 00:29:10.724
another of supporting others.

00:29:17.349 --> 00:29:23.475
Especially among Sahaja Yogis we should
try to help each other.

00:29:27.422 --> 00:29:33.229
May not be with money, but with moral
support.

00:29:35.384 --> 00:29:39.789
But if you have to support sometime,
someone with money

00:29:39.963 --> 00:29:44.629
you should do it voluntarily without
even thinking

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.530
that you are doing any obligation on that
person.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:06.817
Or else, you can think that, “I am doing
this just for my own pleasures.”

00:30:12.694 --> 00:30:23.537
The third great quality of the Lakshmi
tattwa is that it is respectful to everyone.

00:30:27.607 --> 00:30:30.230
But we see the other way round, everywhere.

00:30:30.438 --> 00:30:36.149
A person when he becomes rich, he becomes
very arrogant.

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:43.430
That's a sign as we say, of a nouveau
riche, a person

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.798
who has suddenly got the money and he
doesn't know what to do.

00:30:53.983 --> 00:30:57.353
Supposing somebody is sitting on a donkey,
and suddenly

00:30:57.554 --> 00:31:00.405
he gets a Cadillac; then what will happen
to him?

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:04.214
He won't be able to bear that.

00:31:17.518 --> 00:31:25.254
So this quality is we have that we should
respect others,

00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:32.862
and we should understand that if we have
money we haven't got everything.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:49.958
For example, in India a saint is respected
higher than anybody else;

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:56.070
higher than all the artists, higher than
all the painters,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:03.545
higher than all the kings, all
the governments, highest is the saint.

00:32:14.582 --> 00:32:18.963
So if you are a rich person, you will be
known

00:32:19.164 --> 00:32:25.004
by your respectful behaviour towards
everyone.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:40.137
This respectful behaviour, you can also
show to things of others.

00:32:44.845 --> 00:32:50.897
But such a person would respect the all
auspicious things.

00:32:54.774 --> 00:33:02.139
Like, there could be a small monkey nut,
but is say vibrated;

00:33:02.356 --> 00:33:09.011
should be much more important than
the diamond of the same size.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.110
So this quality, when it develops in
a human being

00:33:23.311 --> 00:33:28.746
then we can say the Mahalakshmi principle
has started.

00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:41.546
Now in all of you Mahalakshmi principle
has been awakened.

00:33:44.045 --> 00:33:48.306
Mahalakshmi resides in the Sushumna nadi

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:57.077
and Sushumna is developed only up
to a point in human beings.

00:33:59.158 --> 00:34:01.957
It is later on,

00:34:02.158 --> 00:34:10.424
like a bridge built in, is created by
Mahalakshmi principle;

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.004
that means a person who is satisfied,
who is in balance,

00:34:23.205 --> 00:34:34.832
who is dharmic: his ocean becomes desirous
of becoming the clouds

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:42.957
of this Sushumna nadi or the path
of Sushumna.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:14.325
This desire creates this path, this bridge
of Sushumna within us.

00:35:19.469 --> 00:35:24.234
Unless and until Mahalakshmi principle
is awakened within us,

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:27.565
we cannot make the Kundalini pass properly

00:35:27.766 --> 00:35:32.454
because it will always get lost
in the Void.

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:52.054
So the dignity, the respect of a Sahaja
Yogi will always help him

00:35:52.255 --> 00:36:00.573
to build this path of Sushumna over
the Void.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:22.349
It is not some sort of an artificial
respect, or an artificial etiquette,

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:28.759
but is a feeling from inside, a kind
of a state

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.749
human beings reach where they feel that
it is important

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:38.724
that we have to be respectful to everybody.

00:36:55.188 --> 00:37:02.719
But the Lakshmi principle disappears with
certain things which we must know.

00:37:08.118 --> 00:37:11.340
First of all, it is said in Marathi
language,

00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:17.277
that if a bottle comes from the door,

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:22.303
the Lakshmi goes, runs away from
the window.

00:37:28.277 --> 00:37:34.393
So the bottle must be kept out if you want
to keep Lakshmi inside.

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.789
Then another thing is the badha. When
a person gets possessed

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:47.639
anywhere if there is darkness, then
Lakshmi runs away.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:38:01.365
In these circumstances, one must try
to clear out so that there is no problem.

00:38:01.566 --> 00:38:06.334
If there is a badha, then money-wise
you cannot be all right,

00:38:06.535 --> 00:38:09.591
whatever you may try.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:23.961
These two things if you look after,
the Lakshmi will stay.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:38.064
And on the satisfaction of that Lakshmi,
you will build up your path of Sushumna.

00:38:47.334 --> 00:38:53.373
So for today, I have told you what is
a Mahalakshmi principle is.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.789
Now if Mahalakshmi principle is awakened
within us,

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:03.687
then the Lakshmi just runs after us.

00:39:09.141 --> 00:39:14.886
In the western culture, what we have done
is to bring Lakshmi

00:39:15.087 --> 00:39:21.094
to the level of only money, that also
in paper.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.000
And it is so artificial,

00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:39.232
that people don't know how suddenly
they become bankrupt.

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:51.243
So the innate Lakshmi principle is to be
understood

00:39:51.444 --> 00:39:58.989
that you Sahaja Yogis have a special
responsibility

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:04.868
for all these western countries which are
slowly

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:13.903
losing all their wealth and the Third World
will have all the money.

00:40:19.092 --> 00:40:21.663
Translator: We are responsible
for, Shri Mataji?

00:40:21.864 --> 00:40:25.489
Shri Mataji: Nothing. I’m just telling.

00:40:48.942 --> 00:40:53.957
I'll tell you what; we didn't create
so many machineries in the Third World,

00:40:54.174 --> 00:40:57.217
because these machineries are just
like devils.

00:40:57.418 --> 00:41:02.469
They go on taking away all that is
materially important,

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.757
all the matter they eat and create
all kinds of nonsense

00:41:06.958 --> 00:41:11.469
like plastic, this, that. And once
something goes from their mouth

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.310
and whatever comes out is of no use
later on.

00:41:15.476 --> 00:41:19.883
So all those things are becoming useless.

00:41:40.966 --> 00:41:47.910
So all the indiscriminate use of these
kinds of policies have exhausted

00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:55.120
all your material wealth which was there
from the Mother Earth.

00:42:06.625 --> 00:42:15.354
Now when that is exhausted, then on which
you can depend is your paper money.

00:42:23.453 --> 00:42:27.070
I've always said that machine is for you
and you are not for machine.

00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:36.643
So why go into the complete subjection
of the machinery like this?

00:42:45.943 --> 00:42:49.046
Now the computer has come. And after
sometime

00:42:49.261 --> 00:42:55.634
our computer will be useless, and we will
be just using the other computer.

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:13.869
But situation may arise that there will be
nothing to eat,

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:18.474
there will be nothing to create, only you
will be making 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;

00:43:18.675 --> 00:43:22.670
and add them up and subtract them.

00:43:31.853 --> 00:43:34.813
So now one should stop and go back
a little bit

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:40.859
and see where have we gone wrong.
Let us correct at that point.

00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:58.374
And once one realises that it is important
to keep a balance on the Nabhi chakra,

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:05.590
then the Mahalakshmi tattwa is properly
manifested.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.029
Also it is vice versa.

00:44:17.235 --> 00:44:21.795
If your Mahalakshmi tattwa is awakened
as it is awakened in you;

00:44:21.996 --> 00:44:29.388
you can create balance, being auspicious
in nature.

00:44:36.909 --> 00:44:45.745
Through you, it will happen that
the prosperity will come back.

00:44:51.158 --> 00:44:56.869
When I went to Italy first time, they told
Me there are three problems.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:05.092
One is mafia, another is violence and
the third is poverty.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:19.118
And all that looked so great like
a mountain,

00:45:19.319 --> 00:45:24.307
has all dissolved into thin air now.

00:45:36.645 --> 00:45:39.835
And the day may come when Italians

00:45:40.073 --> 00:45:45.657
will enjoy the greatest of wealth.

00:45:54.165 --> 00:45:58.496
And... Translator: We'll send the tape
to Guido, Shri Mataji.

00:45:58.697 --> 00:46:02.869
Shri Mataji: And, and we will discover
one more thing

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:08.921
that so far, all the Europeans used
to laugh at Italians.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:20.096
look down upon them,

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:27.452
though they were the source of your art,
your music,

00:46:27.653 --> 00:46:32.907
all kinds of beautiful creativity.

00:46:39.157 --> 00:46:43.172
But you all used to laugh at them.

00:46:50.397 --> 00:46:58.549
Because they were rich in their heart and
simple hearted, dignified,

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:04.014
they did not put their pressures on you.

00:47:05.294 --> 00:47:12.281
So their Lakshmi tattwa has become
Mahalakshmi principle.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.629
In the same way, I would request you
the Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.591
not to worry as to what is happening
around,

00:47:22.792 --> 00:47:29.202
but to worry what is happening inside and
build up your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:47:35.464 --> 00:47:38.181
Once you have built up your Mahalakshmi
principle,

00:47:38.397 --> 00:47:41.947
you will have no problem at all.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:51.328
Then through you the Mahalakshmi Herself
will work

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.975
and fill your countries with great bounties

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.237
and great joys.

00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:13.147
May God Bless you all.
