WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:10.878
Today we are going to worship

00:11.437 --> 00:23.696
the principle of Mahalakshmi in Belgium.

00:32.079 --> 00:45.446
Belgium has a speciality that it creates
glass bangles for the Mother.

00:56.880 --> 01:10.220
That is, the bangles which are used

01:10.421 --> 01:16.134
as a beautiful musical accompaniment

01:16.335 --> 01:24.964
to the gait, to all the movements
of the Goddess.

01:35.880 --> 01:42.602
It brings a delicacy in a woman;

01:50.143 --> 01:58.840
and gives a consciousness to the man
or the men

01:59.040 --> 02:03.210
that there are ladies around.

02:13.800 --> 02:25.920
And the ladies are around who are married
ladies, are very auspicious.

02:34.360 --> 02:42.559
And this auspiciousness is the one that
is going to bring

02:42.760 --> 02:50.696
in this country or in any country
whatsoever all the blessings.

02:58.760 --> 03:09.488
Also in Sanskrit language a bangle is
called as Valaya,

03:15.983 --> 03:26.585
and that is the last stage which one has
to reach in one’s ascent.

03:31.903 --> 03:35.665
That means the complete.

03:40.400 --> 03:46.999
Also, we are having here a puja for Holland

03:47.200 --> 03:56.957
which is the Jala Devata, is the Goddess
of water.

04:03.825 --> 04:10.831
It comes from the word “marine”,
the word Mary, Maria.

04:11.040 --> 04:17.566
All these words come from the word
“marine”.

04:26.200 --> 04:33.005
In Holland as you know, the sea is above
the land.

04:39.160 --> 04:47.942
We can say that the Guru is sitting
at a higher position than the chela.

04:58.240 --> 05:06.063
And His knowledge is channelized
into various channels.

05:14.970 --> 05:24.890
And all the wealth, the money, that is
earned out of marine activities

05:25.091 --> 05:32.209
flow through the greatness of this ocean.

05:49.404 --> 05:55.527
So Dutch people are highly blessed people.

06:00.999 --> 06:12.077
They are very tall because Dattatreya is
a very tall personality.

06:25.391 --> 06:36.461
And if they become conscious of their
position,

06:37.200 --> 06:48.804
one day Dutch can do a lot in the realm
of God's work.

06:56.080 --> 07:04.075
But all the time trouble in both
the countries has come

07:04.276 --> 07:13.070
because they have not paid any respect
to their Guru, which is the ocean.

07:24.360 --> 07:30.119
They exploited and took advantage
of the sea,

07:30.320 --> 07:39.885
but never realised what the sea means
in the religious aspect.

07:49.680 --> 07:56.776
The Lakshmi came out of the sea;

08:00.360 --> 08:05.920
that is the wealth that has come out
of the sea.

08:08.463 --> 08:13.355
But the wealth has to be like a Lakshmi.

08:14.800 --> 08:22.360
The Lakshmi has a motherly nature.

08:22.561 --> 08:27.069
She's a mother. She's a mother.

08:33.225 --> 08:38.347
She is standing on a lotus.

08:39.840 --> 08:45.224
That means She does not throw her weight
anywhere.

08:49.783 --> 08:53.687
Like people go and occupy other territories

08:53.888 --> 09:01.287
and use them for their own purpose will
never give them Lakshmi principle.

09:11.739 --> 09:18.105
Only thing that may happen to them is
to get some money for the time being.

09:18.306 --> 09:24.075
But they say Lakshmi is chanchal; means
She is all the time shifting and She shifts.

09:24.276 --> 09:29.881
Such a Lakshmi is chanchal, is shifting.

09:44.915 --> 09:52.997
Lakshmi has got one hand which is giving,
like this.

09:56.037 --> 10:02.298
Another hand She has got by which She
protects people.

10:07.930 --> 10:13.757
In two hands She has got pink lotuses.

10:17.560 --> 10:22.604
The pink lotus suggests the warmth.

10:28.360 --> 10:38.048
A person who has got Lakshmi has to have
warmth in his household.

10:45.844 --> 10:53.763
He must have in his heart warmth to receive
people.

11:01.169 --> 11:06.599
A lotus flower receives even a horrible
beetle,

11:06.800 --> 11:10.760
black beetle which has got all kinds
of thorns in it

11:10.936 --> 11:17.755
and allows it to sleep overnight as a nice
guest.

11:30.065 --> 11:35.711
In the corona of the lotus there is
beautiful spread

11:35.912 --> 11:40.040
of the yellow coloured pollen

11:40.240 --> 11:50.181
on which this beetle rolls and enjoys
the comfort.

12:01.066 --> 12:08.113
And the lotus watches the enjoyment
of the beetle.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.177
It does not get disturbed. It does not get
upset

12:18.378 --> 12:28.491
and when the lotus opens out, the beetle
just goes away.

12:35.672 --> 12:41.004
And the lotus still grows, it doesn't die
out.

12:46.671 --> 12:52.532
In modern life, we don't want guests

12:55.990 --> 13:02.892
and if some guests come in the house they
dare not even spoil the carpet.

13:09.830 --> 13:18.261
We clean the house; we polish all our
silver and all our brass,

13:18.462 --> 13:24.670
but we don't want even a little rat to come
inside.

13:35.597 --> 13:40.058
For whom are we doing all this work?

13:43.150 --> 13:50.991
There are no children in the house and
the old people are in the old house.

13:54.790 --> 13:58.440
Children are in the hostels.

14:01.230 --> 14:06.161
And the husband, wife are in the divorce
case.

14:12.253 --> 14:18.113
But they are very particular about their
brass being polished.

14:19.694 --> 14:24.597
So the whole polish has come outside.

14:28.583 --> 14:37.632
So the beauty of lotus flower is that it is
all embracing.

14:44.137 --> 14:47.830
It's a very motherly principle.

14:48.030 --> 14:54.079
It tolerates any type of nonsense from
the beetle.

15:02.182 --> 15:09.192
So one of the aspects of Mahalakshmi

15:09.393 --> 15:14.350
is Gruhalakshmi, is the one who is
the housewife.

15:20.798 --> 15:27.309
And if this aspect is spoiled, then we
cannot have Lakshmi in our house;

15:27.510 --> 15:31.104
we cannot have wealth in our house.

15:38.430 --> 15:41.550
The Lakshmi will disappear from all such
houses

15:41.750 --> 15:47.066
where the housewife is not respected

15:50.550 --> 15:54.928
or the housewife is not respectable.

15:58.190 --> 16:06.109
The another aspect of that Lakshmi tattwa is

16:06.310 --> 16:13.898
that She gives protection to some people.

16:17.912 --> 16:27.520
That means ashraya means there are people
who are supported by such a person.

16:35.470 --> 16:39.121
I do not know how you people run your
orphanages here

16:39.322 --> 16:41.998
or how you manage your charities.

16:42.199 --> 16:48.156
But in India, if a man or a woman gets
money beyond a certain point,

16:48.357 --> 16:57.107
she will take out at least one tenth
of that money for charities.

17:13.478 --> 17:23.559
And she will also have or he will have money
or any shelter or anything for people

17:23.760 --> 17:31.378
who are working for him, ashraya, working
for him.

17:41.328 --> 17:48.689
I have seen many people who are rich,
but they are extremely beggarish.

17:54.510 --> 17:58.597
They have no dignity of any kind.

18:01.421 --> 18:08.643
They will come to your house and they may
even ask for an empty tin.

18:11.004 --> 18:14.456
Translator: An empty tin? Shri Mataji:
Empty tin, yeah. There are people.

18:14.657 --> 18:17.588
Translator: What is empty tin?
Yogi: Empty can.

18:17.789 --> 18:24.178
Shri Mataji: Empty can. Translator: Oh!
Oh, sorry. I didn’t understand.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.482
Shri Mataji: Or else if you go to their
house

18:33.683 --> 18:41.452
they'll give you or offer you something
which is leftover.

18:46.486 --> 18:51.323
So there is no dignity of any kind in this.

18:52.357 --> 18:56.218
It's without any self respect.

18:57.093 --> 19:02.979
Because if you have self respect, how can
you behave like this?

19:06.549 --> 19:17.807
Then there is another aspect of Lakshmi
where She is proud like an elephant.

19:21.206 --> 19:24.811
She has a propensity.

19:26.190 --> 19:29.951
She is not like a mosquito.

19:30.452 --> 19:35.047
I mean, many people think that these days
to be mosquitoes is very good,

19:35.248 --> 19:42.827
but, I think, if you have mosquito-like
personality nobody respects you.

19:53.150 --> 20:02.069
They all think you must be some sort of
a typist or maybe some sort of a person

20:02.270 --> 20:04.629
or doing some sort of menial work

20:04.830 --> 20:10.415
or working very hard that you have lost
all your weight.

20:18.369 --> 20:26.769
So a Lakshmi has to have a gravity.

20:33.941 --> 20:38.972
But nowadays, the whole thing is changed.

20:42.462 --> 20:48.179
I knew Belgian people long time back;
they were all having some propensities.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.530
They were rich people.

21:01.973 --> 21:05.121
Even the Dutch.

21:06.282 --> 21:09.389
But now both the countries have perhaps
become poor,

21:09.590 --> 21:13.906
so people look like mosquitoes to Me.

21:27.454 --> 21:35.285
So a person who has got money doesn't jump
like a monkey,

21:35.486 --> 21:39.296
but walks like an elephant;

21:48.250 --> 21:51.385
in a dignified manner.

21:51.586 --> 21:59.299
But sometimes, I have seen in the west
people walk like horses.

22:04.414 --> 22:12.204
In India, we had a wedding and we all
ladies were walking in the procession,

22:14.870 --> 22:21.069
and we saw one lady in the middle
of the whole crowd

22:21.277 --> 22:28.004
just coming up and down like a yo-yo.

22:35.103 --> 22:41.035
So we couldn't understand what was this,
who is this lady.

22:43.397 --> 22:49.081
Then we discovered that one Indian had
married an American lady,

22:53.870 --> 22:57.070
and when she was walking she was walking
like a horse

22:57.310 --> 23:03.415
between all the Indian women singing,
she was walking like a horse, you see.

23:12.245 --> 23:17.029
So you have to be like an elephant when
you walk, Gaja Gamini.

23:17.230 --> 23:23.755
That's one of the names of the Goddess;
She walks like an elephant in a swingy way.

23:28.024 --> 23:31.367
The reason you see also...

23:31.568 --> 23:34.269
(Aside to the translator) Did you say that?
Translator: Yes, Shri Mataji.

23:34.470 --> 23:39.241
Shri Mataji: ...and the Kundalini also,
you see, doesn't agree very much

23:39.442 --> 23:42.972
with the horse movement.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.867
Because, if you move the Kundalini up
and down, up and down,

23:50.068 --> 23:53.358
She doesn't know where to go!

24:04.966 --> 24:09.220
But you see elephant's walk is
left, right, left, right, left, right.

24:09.421 --> 24:16.234
It goes up, properly, keeping the central
path.

24:22.298 --> 24:27.029
So it's not very, very good to walk
in that fashion,

24:27.230 --> 24:32.529
if you have to establish Sahaja Yoga
properly.

24:42.150 --> 24:49.016
Now the Mahalakshmi principle comes out
of the Lakshmi principle.

24:53.550 --> 24:57.825
That is when you have wealth and when
you have acted

24:58.026 --> 25:03.069
according to the image of the Lakshmi

25:03.270 --> 25:08.184
then the Mahalakshmi principle rises
within you.

25:18.513 --> 25:21.228
Now the Mahalakshmi tattwa, the principle

25:21.429 --> 25:31.228
is that you start thinking only about
your Spirit.

25:37.382 --> 25:43.592
When you are absolutely satisfied with
the material wealth,

25:45.598 --> 25:50.787
then you start coming to the Spirit.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.683
It was nice that people were seeking

25:55.884 --> 26:02.248
material wealth and had industrial
revolution in a way.

26:07.926 --> 26:13.470
But as a result of that you do not find
that the greed has gone down,

26:13.641 --> 26:17.537
on the contrary, it has increased.

26:21.449 --> 26:26.098
And... Translator: Sorry, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Sorry.

26:26.990 --> 26:31.433
And the lust has become so perverted.

26:35.326 --> 26:42.403
So we can find very clearly that we have
failed the principle of Lakshmi

26:42.604 --> 26:50.690
in our societies, in our families, in our
governments.

27:02.422 --> 27:09.869
So the understanding of Spirit is only
possible for people

27:10.070 --> 27:17.728
who have understood the meaning of Lakshmi
principle, first of all.

27:24.870 --> 27:30.846
So the purpose of Lakshmi is only fourfold;

27:32.278 --> 27:37.437
first is, that you have to give.

27:38.430 --> 27:41.190
It is not like in the church they will say:
“All right,

27:41.390 --> 27:45.712
you have to give your money, give it
to me”, it's not that.

27:50.795 --> 27:56.798
Because I don't want anything. But you
have to be generous by nature,

27:59.590 --> 28:02.760
and not miserly.

28:03.670 --> 28:11.596
Supposing you have one door open, no air
will come in.

28:15.310 --> 28:19.549
Only the air that is sufficient for
the room will be there,

28:19.750 --> 28:29.081
and there won't be any entry of new air
or more air or any draught inside.

28:32.977 --> 28:36.668
But if you open the door, another one,

28:36.869 --> 28:41.721
then you will find there will be
a circulation of air.

28:45.444 --> 28:52.687
So by generosity, the circulation starts
and you solve your material problems.

29:01.310 --> 29:05.852
The another principle which we should
follow - one of generosity -

29:06.053 --> 29:10.724
another of supporting others.

29:17.349 --> 29:23.475
Especially among Sahaja Yogis we should
try to help each other.

29:27.422 --> 29:33.229
May not be with money, but with moral
support.

29:35.384 --> 29:39.789
But if you have to support sometime,
someone with money

29:39.963 --> 29:44.629
you should do it voluntarily without
even thinking

29:44.830 --> 29:49.530
that you are doing any obligation on that
person.

29:59.190 --> 30:06.817
Or else, you can think that, “I am doing
this just for my own pleasures.”

30:12.694 --> 30:23.537
The third great quality of the Lakshmi
tattwa is that it is respectful to everyone.

30:27.607 --> 30:30.230
But we see the other way round, everywhere.

30:30.438 --> 30:36.149
A person when he becomes rich, he becomes
very arrogant.

30:40.199 --> 30:43.430
That's a sign as we say, of a nouveau
riche, a person

30:43.630 --> 30:48.798
who has suddenly got the money and he
doesn't know what to do.

30:53.983 --> 30:57.353
Supposing somebody is sitting on a donkey,
and suddenly

30:57.554 --> 31:00.405
he gets a Cadillac; then what will happen
to him?

31:00.606 --> 31:04.214
He won't be able to bear that.

31:17.518 --> 31:25.254
So this quality is we have that we should
respect others,

31:25.455 --> 31:32.862
and we should understand that if we have
money we haven't got everything.

31:42.230 --> 31:49.958
For example, in India a saint is respected
higher than anybody else;

31:52.590 --> 31:56.070
higher than all the artists, higher than
all the painters,

31:56.270 --> 32:03.545
higher than all the kings, all
the governments, highest is the saint.

32:14.582 --> 32:18.963
So if you are a rich person, you will be
known

32:19.164 --> 32:25.004
by your respectful behaviour towards
everyone.

32:32.470 --> 32:40.137
This respectful behaviour, you can also
show to things of others.

32:44.845 --> 32:50.897
But such a person would respect the all
auspicious things.

32:54.774 --> 33:02.139
Like, there could be a small monkey nut,
but is say vibrated;

33:02.356 --> 33:09.011
should be much more important than
the diamond of the same size.

33:19.070 --> 33:23.110
So this quality, when it develops in
a human being

33:23.311 --> 33:28.746
then we can say the Mahalakshmi principle
has started.

33:36.141 --> 33:41.546
Now in all of you Mahalakshmi principle
has been awakened.

33:44.045 --> 33:48.306
Mahalakshmi resides in the Sushumna nadi

33:50.670 --> 33:57.077
and Sushumna is developed only up
to a point in human beings.

33:59.158 --> 34:01.957
It is later on,

34:02.158 --> 34:10.424
like a bridge built in, is created by
Mahalakshmi principle;

34:19.390 --> 34:23.004
that means a person who is satisfied,
who is in balance,

34:23.205 --> 34:34.832
who is dharmic: his ocean becomes desirous
of becoming the clouds

34:35.070 --> 34:42.957
of this Sushumna nadi or the path
of Sushumna.

35:06.166 --> 35:14.325
This desire creates this path, this bridge
of Sushumna within us.

35:19.469 --> 35:24.234
Unless and until Mahalakshmi principle
is awakened within us,

35:24.435 --> 35:27.565
we cannot make the Kundalini pass properly

35:27.766 --> 35:32.454
because it will always get lost
in the Void.

35:43.750 --> 35:52.054
So the dignity, the respect of a Sahaja
Yogi will always help him

35:52.255 --> 36:00.573
to build this path of Sushumna over
the Void.

36:15.790 --> 36:22.349
It is not some sort of an artificial
respect, or an artificial etiquette,

36:22.550 --> 36:28.759
but is a feeling from inside, a kind
of a state

36:28.960 --> 36:33.749
human beings reach where they feel that
it is important

36:33.950 --> 36:38.724
that we have to be respectful to everybody.

36:55.188 --> 37:02.719
But the Lakshmi principle disappears with
certain things which we must know.

37:08.118 --> 37:11.340
First of all, it is said in Marathi
language,

37:11.541 --> 37:17.277
that if a bottle comes from the door,

37:17.510 --> 37:22.303
the Lakshmi goes, runs away from
the window.

37:28.277 --> 37:34.393
So the bottle must be kept out if you want
to keep Lakshmi inside.

37:36.470 --> 37:41.789
Then another thing is the badha. When
a person gets possessed

37:41.990 --> 37:47.639
anywhere if there is darkness, then
Lakshmi runs away.

37:54.310 --> 38:01.365
In these circumstances, one must try
to clear out so that there is no problem.

38:01.566 --> 38:06.334
If there is a badha, then money-wise
you cannot be all right,

38:06.535 --> 38:09.591
whatever you may try.

38:18.470 --> 38:23.961
These two things if you look after,
the Lakshmi will stay.

38:29.870 --> 38:38.064
And on the satisfaction of that Lakshmi,
you will build up your path of Sushumna.

38:47.334 --> 38:53.373
So for today, I have told you what is
a Mahalakshmi principle is.

38:54.950 --> 38:58.789
Now if Mahalakshmi principle is awakened
within us,

38:58.990 --> 39:03.687
then the Lakshmi just runs after us.

39:09.141 --> 39:14.886
In the western culture, what we have done
is to bring Lakshmi

39:15.087 --> 39:21.094
to the level of only money, that also
in paper.

39:32.140 --> 39:34.000
And it is so artificial,

39:34.201 --> 39:39.232
that people don't know how suddenly
they become bankrupt.

39:46.790 --> 39:51.243
So the innate Lakshmi principle is to be
understood

39:51.444 --> 39:58.989
that you Sahaja Yogis have a special
responsibility

39:59.190 --> 40:04.868
for all these western countries which are
slowly

40:05.069 --> 40:13.903
losing all their wealth and the Third World
will have all the money.

40:19.092 --> 40:21.663
Translator: We are responsible
for, Shri Mataji?

40:21.864 --> 40:25.489
Shri Mataji: Nothing. I’m just telling.

40:48.942 --> 40:53.957
I'll tell you what; we didn't create
so many machineries in the Third World,

40:54.174 --> 40:57.217
because these machineries are just
like devils.

40:57.418 --> 41:02.469
They go on taking away all that is
materially important,

41:02.670 --> 41:06.757
all the matter they eat and create
all kinds of nonsense

41:06.958 --> 41:11.469
like plastic, this, that. And once
something goes from their mouth

41:11.670 --> 41:15.310
and whatever comes out is of no use
later on.

41:15.476 --> 41:19.883
So all those things are becoming useless.

41:40.966 --> 41:47.910
So all the indiscriminate use of these
kinds of policies have exhausted

41:48.111 --> 41:55.120
all your material wealth which was there
from the Mother Earth.

42:06.625 --> 42:15.354
Now when that is exhausted, then on which
you can depend is your paper money.

42:23.453 --> 42:27.070
I've always said that machine is for you
and you are not for machine.

42:27.271 --> 42:36.643
So why go into the complete subjection
of the machinery like this?

42:45.943 --> 42:49.046
Now the computer has come. And after
sometime

42:49.261 --> 42:55.634
our computer will be useless, and we will
be just using the other computer.

43:10.454 --> 43:13.869
But situation may arise that there will be
nothing to eat,

43:14.070 --> 43:18.474
there will be nothing to create, only you
will be making 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;

43:18.675 --> 43:22.670
and add them up and subtract them.

43:31.853 --> 43:34.813
So now one should stop and go back
a little bit

43:35.070 --> 43:40.859
and see where have we gone wrong.
Let us correct at that point.

43:49.179 --> 43:58.374
And once one realises that it is important
to keep a balance on the Nabhi chakra,

43:58.590 --> 44:05.590
then the Mahalakshmi tattwa is properly
manifested.

44:14.510 --> 44:17.029
Also it is vice versa.

44:17.235 --> 44:21.795
If your Mahalakshmi tattwa is awakened
as it is awakened in you;

44:21.996 --> 44:29.388
you can create balance, being auspicious
in nature.

44:36.909 --> 44:45.745
Through you, it will happen that
the prosperity will come back.

44:51.158 --> 44:56.869
When I went to Italy first time, they told
Me there are three problems.

44:57.070 --> 45:05.092
One is mafia, another is violence and
the third is poverty.

45:12.830 --> 45:19.118
And all that looked so great like
a mountain,

45:19.319 --> 45:24.307
has all dissolved into thin air now.

45:36.645 --> 45:39.835
And the day may come when Italians

45:40.073 --> 45:45.657
will enjoy the greatest of wealth.

45:54.165 --> 45:58.496
And... Translator: We'll send the tape
to Guido, Shri Mataji.

45:58.697 --> 46:02.869
Shri Mataji: And, and we will discover
one more thing

46:03.070 --> 46:08.921
that so far, all the Europeans used
to laugh at Italians.

46:16.630 --> 46:20.096
look down upon them,

46:21.950 --> 46:27.452
though they were the source of your art,
your music,

46:27.653 --> 46:32.907
all kinds of beautiful creativity.

46:39.157 --> 46:43.172
But you all used to laugh at them.

46:50.397 --> 46:58.549
Because they were rich in their heart and
simple hearted, dignified,

46:58.750 --> 47:04.014
they did not put their pressures on you.

47:05.294 --> 47:12.281
So their Lakshmi tattwa has become
Mahalakshmi principle.

47:15.790 --> 47:19.629
In the same way, I would request you
the Sahaja Yogis,

47:19.830 --> 47:22.591
not to worry as to what is happening
around,

47:22.792 --> 47:29.202
but to worry what is happening inside and
build up your Mahalakshmi principle.

47:35.464 --> 47:38.181
Once you have built up your Mahalakshmi
principle,

47:38.397 --> 47:41.947
you will have no problem at all.

47:45.590 --> 47:51.328
Then through you the Mahalakshmi Herself
will work

47:54.510 --> 47:59.975
and fill your countries with great bounties

48:03.750 --> 48:07.237
and great joys.

48:09.829 --> 48:13.147
May God Bless you all.
