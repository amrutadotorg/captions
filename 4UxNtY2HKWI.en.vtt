00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:05.356
Now I think I have covered most of the points.

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:09.068
But if you have any question, you can ask them today.

00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:18.364
Q.; “Shri Mother, we feel the same chakras,
more on legs than on the fingers.”

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:21.836
The integration is not there, that’s why.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.952
You have to attend collectively.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.766
You have to be more collective. The body has to be collective.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.106
The thing is that if you are not a collective person

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.261
then sometimes you’ll feel them on the legs,

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:36.522
sometimes on the hand, sometimes in the head.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.274
That’s not a good thing.
You should try to be more collective, you should

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.795
meet more people, take more interest.

00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:45.156
You see, the body of your’s

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.409
want work out efficiently unless and until you use it.

00:00:54.078 --> 00:00:59.586
Because individually you see if they individually if you work out,

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:06.309
it will not develop collectively, because where are you using it?

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.317
You are correcting your self to give it to others.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.309
And if you don’t give it, if you do not work it out

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:17.218
in a collective way, there is no circulation.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.615
For example, there’s a fruit is there,

00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:28.329
and you take it out of the tree, and you mature it.

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:33.122
But if it is connected with the tree,

00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:43.210
it will mature by itself giving a proper identity to itself

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:49.086
and to the tree, and taste would be better.

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:53.411
And those who would come under that tree

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.983
will receive the fruits of that tree.

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:01.983
But a fruit, which is separated, will be lost after sometime.

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:07.138
That is how one has to be very collective.

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:13.269
Q. How to develop our discrimination, Mother?

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.813
Discrimination comes through Hamsa Chakra.

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:27.460
And Hamsa chakra is very simple thing,
is to put some ghee in the nose,

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.992
is a physical thing.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.409
On the emotional side, one should not cry too much.

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.733
Or women specially have too much crying business.

00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:45.936
I also sometimes feel like crying, but seldom.

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:50.856
So sometimes men must cry also.

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:57.721
Now spiritually, to develop discrimination

00:02:57.975 --> 00:03:03.237
is by vibratory awareness.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.531
When your vibrations are developed,

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:12.404
then you automatically discriminate.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.848
You are such a big computer.

00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:19.459
It has to work in its full way, and

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.724
then you’ll be amazed what a computer you are.

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:25.599
I’ll give you an example of Warren now.

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:33.335
Pat’s husband Prole, who was

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:37.672
measuring my house for certain purpose,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.640
while Warren was sleeping. Poor David was working,
Warren was sleeping.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.909
And in his dream, he dreamt that he had finished
with the last measurement.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:49.103
And in his half-sleep he got up

00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:53.627
and he told him that this house measures...how much?

00:03:57.576 --> 00:04:01.655
Three thousand nine hundred and sixteen square feet.

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.119
And ‘exactly’ that’s what David Prole had written!

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:09.563
Poor David had worked so hard measuring everything!

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:14.229
He actually fell from his chair!
You see.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:24.027
Like today I told Guido that I think
I spent three hundred and eighty pounds.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:29.297
And he said, no it was three hundred.
I never calculated, nothing. I just said it.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.142
And by calculation, it was 379, according to him,
but I gave him one pound more!

00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:42.863
So it was 380. And that’s how you become a computer.

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:47.665
All mathematics comes through your brain. It’s so dynamic.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.633
But first of all you have to have concentration,
concentration of your devotion.

00:04:56.684 --> 00:05:06.015
Such a person achieves that.
There are so many blessing waiting for you, to be manifested.

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:18.522
Just you have to concentrate
your efforts in devotion and dedication.

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:21.081
May God Bless You.
