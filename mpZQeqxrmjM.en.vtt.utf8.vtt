00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:22.580
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.019
When Bala says that I can give you realization
in a split of a second I have to tell you

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.289
that it is you who get it.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:42.050
You are built in that way like a seed; when
you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.480
Whom will you give the credit -- the seed
or the Mother Earth?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:58.789
Without the Mother Earth the seed cannot sprout
and it does not mean that if you put a stone

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.649
in the Mother Earth it will sprout.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:10.140
So the credit is not to anyone but it is a
process which is built within us through ages

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.310
of our seeking.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.099
We have been seekers in previous lives and
before that we have been seeking.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:19.899
Even when we were amoeba we were seeking.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.580
That's how we have become a human being.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.000
And now we have reached a stage where we are
human beings and we are seekers of truth.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.500
This is the epitome of the highest that any
human being can reach where he is seeking.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:45.119
As a human being when we are born we are quite
aware that we are higher than animals, that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.780
we have capacities much more than animals
have.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:01.970
We are quite aware of our being as a human
being but this awareness that we have is still

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.030
not complete because we are still in confusion.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.789
We do not know why we are on this earth.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.940
We do not know what we have to achieve.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.380
We do not know what mistakes we are committing
or this is right or that is right.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.390
A man lands up himself into confusion because
of ignorance.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.570
Now this ignorance, as has been described
by all the prophets and saints, is just a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.520
myth, like if you have darkness here that
doesn't mean it exists, but because there

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.970
is no light.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.190
In the negation of the light gives you the
darkness.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.950
Where is the light, and how do we awaken it?

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.650
This question has been very much looked into
by thousands and thousands of people earlier

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.790
also, and thousands of years back people have
bothered to find out where is this light and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.460
how do we awaken it.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:25.690
Now this light is within us because they found
it, and the method they have said also is

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.080
within us because they knew about it.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:36.440
But this knowledge was quite a big secret
for many years, thousands of years, and was

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.420
not given to people because people were not
ready to accept it and to take advantage of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.230
it.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.410
But we should not say that it was not said.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.100
It was very clearly said in most of the scriptures
that you are to be born again.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.330
Unless and until you know yourself you cannot
know God.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:07.209
First you know yourself and then you will
know God Almighty.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:20.449
For example, supposing we are coming to Birmingham
and we do not know the way, and we get lost.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.840
We can come here, can be brought properly,
but the car that you are driving, you don't

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.960
know the car.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.100
You don't know how to drive.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.950
You don't know the way.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.720
Then how are you to reach the right place?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.690
If everything is missing, how can you say
that you can reach Birmingham without any

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.900
knowledge about it?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.600
In the same way, if you have no knowledge
of yourself itself, how can you know God when

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.110
you have not known yourself?

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.169
It is very logical, and extremely simple logic
should tell you that you do not know about

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.520
yourself.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.560
People become mad and when they are absolutely
gone cases they end up into lunatic asylum.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.630
But when it starts they do not know.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.990
They get cancer diseases, terminal diseases
of the worst type, and they don't know how

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.380
to overcome it.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.220
Till they have reached their last stage they
do not even feel it.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.180
Suddenly they discover, "O God, I have this
disease."

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.090
So we do not know even our physical being
that when it is hurt, when it is in danger,

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.520
when it is diseased we have no idea.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.889
We do not know our mental being either.

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.680
When we are impressed by other people we start
behaving like them.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.360
When they mesmerize us, we start following
them.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.620
We are not aware that we have no mind of our
own; we are just following something that

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.650
is very aggressive and that's how we accept
it.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:10.490
If you are accepting something about which
you have no idea just because you are impressed

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:18.949
by somebody's personality or the way he talks
or the way he comes to you, then definitely

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.110
your mind you do not know.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.620
Like Hitler, he came with funny ideas.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:32.500
He told people that, "We are a very great
race and we have a right to kill everyone

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.650
and to put the people in the gas chamber."

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.350
They accepted.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.949
How can you accept such a mass massacre of
people like that?

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:46.949
But they did accept.

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.140
The reason was they did not know what is their
mind.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.949
We do not know our emotions also.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.280
We say, "This is my son.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.419
I'll give my life for this son.

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.850
I'll do this for him.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.850
This is my daughter.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.979
This is my father."

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:07.530
But when it comes to selfishness everything
drops out.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.540
So we do not also know our emotions.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.900
If we had known we would not talk like that.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.750
Every moment we are changing our mood from
this to that.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.430
Sometimes we are happy with that person.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.130
Then we are very unhappy.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.110
Then we become enemy of that person.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.979
We fight for that person first.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:28.630
We say, "No, this is my brother," and then
we say, "No, he is my enemy."

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.630
Why?

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.980
Because both of them do not know their mind.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:44.600
So first we must know ourselves by which we
get the light to know all these things.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.759
Now what is that self?

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:50.280
What is that Spirit, that Atma about which
all the great people have talked?

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.500
Where does it reside within us?

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.020
It resides in our heart.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.650
Now when I say this, you need not accept Me.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.860
In these modern times nothing should be accepted
blindfolded.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.750
It's very dangerous.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.840
That's how you have fallen into traps of so
many wrong people.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.919
When I say that you should only have an open
mind of a scientist, to see whatever Mother

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:18.889
is saying is true or not.

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:28.520
Now the time has come that God can be proved
scientifically.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.390
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is God.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:40.750
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is self, the spirit.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:46.629
It can prove all the saints and prophets who
came on this earth told the truth.

00:08:46.629 --> 00:08:52.860
It can prove that whatever is said about the
miracles of God is all true.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.759
The time is like that.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:57.269
Only our mind doesn't go to that side.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:58.990
We don't want to know about it.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.200
We don't want to understand it.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.089
Now this is a special time which is described.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:14.160
This is a very, very special time which has
been prophesized by so many.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.130
Every one of them, those who were great saints,
have.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:24.189
They have to be great saints or real saints,
as we say Sat-Guru [Hindi word meaning True

00:09:24.189 --> 00:09:25.189
Master].

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:33.420
Those prophets who were real prophets, they
all have said that the time is going to come

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.139
when you are going to be resurrected.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:43.290
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak."

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.563
Very clearly he has talked about resurrection
throughout, but who is bothered to know that?

00:09:48.563 --> 00:09:55.509
They all only want to talk about the doomsday
so that everybody is frightened.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:10:01.459
Another is that we talk of the day when you
are all going to be damned into something

00:10:01.459 --> 00:10:08.319
because you should be all frightened and you
should just go under their clutches and surrender

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:16.779
yourself so that these people who will be
destroyed first are going to save you.

00:10:16.779 --> 00:10:18.889
People have made money out of God.

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:19.889
Imagine!

00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:22.689
How can you have an enterprise in the name
of God?

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:25.019
How can you make money in the name of God?

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:27.740
I mean, how does it go into your logics?

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.300
I can't understand that you can pay money.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.350
How can you intellectualize God?

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:40.769
It's amazing the way they are intellectualizing
Christ and believing Paul was nothing but

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:41.769
an intellectual.

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:42.869
Why is he there in the Bible?

00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:46.540
I can't understand he should not have been
there.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.660
That way, we Indians are sensible.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.529
We had Guru Nanak who wrote Guru Granth Sahab.

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:56.920
He has taken all the poets who are realized
souls.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.939
Not one is none realized.

00:10:59.939 --> 00:11:06.420
We don't listen to people who are not realized,
who are not of a great evolved state.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.500
But this Mr Paul has come inside there, and
now he's challenging Christ and his miracles.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.500
What does he know?

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.350
He is not a realized soul.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.129
If he's not a realized soul how can he talk
about God?

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:19.129
He has no business.

00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:20.129
He has no right.

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:25.360
None of these people who authorize themselves,
get elected and selected as big Brahmins and

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:35.899
big pundits and big bishops and Popes and
others, they are nowhere near God.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.379
They are not realized people, are they?

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:41.160
What realization have they got?

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.211
They are just interested in politics, economics
and all nonsense that is not God's job.

00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:53.009
But we get into their traps.

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:54.009
Be careful.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:59.499
You are seekers of truth and not of something
that is ignorance.

00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:04.089
We have had enough of ignorance.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:09.819
Any person who has any power will never succumb
or compromise with untruth.

00:12:09.819 --> 00:12:12.819
That is first sign of a person who is a realized
soul.

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:18.420
He is not bothered, even if you put him to
jail, you crucify him, poison him, do what

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.889
you like.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:22.379
And this is what surprises me.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:28.970
How do you like such people and adore such
people for compromising and meek and taking

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:34.019
to all kinds of falsehood?

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.600
Take the case of Christ.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.870
Did He compromise?

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.059
Did not!

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:43.920
Any time, He never compromised.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.029
What I am saying about Paul was said by Kahil
Gibran.

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:52.610
Openly he said it in his book, "The Son of
Man" or something like that, he clearly says,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.069
"This Paul, a strange man."

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:55.069
I don't understand.

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:57.619
He's not a man with a free will.

00:12:57.619 --> 00:13:03.869
It's true anybody who is a realized soul can
see this, and all those who follow him are

00:13:03.869 --> 00:13:07.379
following falsehood and making others follow
him.

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:09.420
I must tell you God is not an enterprise.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.540
Remember that.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.779
If you understand that God doesn't understand
money at all.

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:16.579
Is your headache.

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:19.300
You better deal with money, not Him.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.899
So in Sahaja Yoga people say, "Mother, what
about money?"

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.040
I say, "What money?

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.860
How much money you pay to the Mother Earth
to sprout the seed?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.850
You pay that much to Me.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:38.160
If Mother Earth can take for her love any
money, you can give me some money."

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.389
How can you talk like this?

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:40.480
This is ridiculous.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.300
It is ridiculous.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.189
So there is no money.

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:46.189
That is nonsense.

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:47.190
There is no effort, either.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.380
See what effort do we put in?

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.820
It's a living process and for a living process
what effort are you going to put?

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.869
What effort did we put to become human beings?

00:13:57.869 --> 00:13:58.869
Nothing!

00:13:58.869 --> 00:13:59.869
Effortless!

00:13:59.869 --> 00:14:01.619
Sahaja Samadhi Lago.

00:14:01.619 --> 00:14:05.369
Sahaj is born with you.

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:08.369
Sahaja, born with you.

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:12.569
So what is there for people to put in effort?

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:15.160
It is He who does all the jobs.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.399
What work do we do?

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.399
In our ego we think, "I have done this.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.619
I have done that."

00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:19.619
What?

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:22.949
A tree must have died and you make a platform.

00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:23.949
So what?

00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:25.369
Dead from the dead!

00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:27.410
What else have we done?

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:28.660
Then you make a chair and sit on the chair.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.759
You can't sit on the garden, floor.

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.110
The other day somebody was interviewing on
the BBC.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.110
Poor thing!

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.359
You see, they were trying to arrange a platform
and I sat very comfortably, but he had such

00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.339
aches and cramp.

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:46.720
He couldn't even ask me proper questions because
he can't sit on the platform.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.429
He said, "Mother I have never sat on a platform
all my life," because now he must carry a

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:57.899
chair with him on his head.

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:04.009
So one must understand that this dead is going
to make us slaves.

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:07.509
What we do is to create dead out of dead and
think, "Oh, I have done this.

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.139
We have done that."

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:12.439
Can you transform a flower into a fruit?

00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:13.929
Can you?

00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:18.889
One flower?

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:21.589
What can I describe?

00:15:21.589 --> 00:15:22.899
The glory of God!

00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:25.889
There's no words.

00:15:25.889 --> 00:15:33.540
Just think that every human being gets a child
according to the family.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.259
Who does that job?

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:38.259
Imagine!

00:15:38.259 --> 00:15:41.879
Imagine that child has cells developed.

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:48.439
There's thousands of cells: some for the nose,
some for the eyes, some for the hands.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:52.889
How it develops automatically -- Sahaja.

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:54.339
What do you do?

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:55.579
Spontaneous!

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:59.970
Do you give any treatment to the child or
give any suggestions to the child?

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:05.019
The One who does all these things, how can
you describe His glory?

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:07.240
And you challenge Him.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:14.189
Here we are, like Newton has said in a very
humble way, collecting the pebbles on the

00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:16.790
shores of knowledge.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.129
That's what we are.

00:16:18.129 --> 00:16:23.959
And so we have to know, only thing that we
can become is a drop in the ocean and become

00:16:23.959 --> 00:16:31.660
the ocean so that all our angularities drop
out.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.470
This is the only thing we have to achieve.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.059
But for that also, God has made all arrangements
so sweetly within us.

00:16:39.059 --> 00:16:45.189
He has made us so beautifully; he has created
us so beautifully within ourselves.

00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:51.749
This is the picture of that tree of life which
is still dormant within you, and the Kundalini

00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:57.389
that is the Holy Ghost is described, is in
the triangular bone.

00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:04.809
Now this Kundalini has to rise, just like
a primule in a seed, or you can say the germinating

00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:15.610
power, and she rises through six centers,
comes out of your fontanel bone area and gives

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:20.370
you the Cool Breeze, from your body, from
your head.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.360
For that you need not change your dress.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.780
You need not put up any show.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.780
Nothing.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.180
It is something inside that happens.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:34.380
Kabira has described, "Shunya shikhar par
anahad baaje."

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:46.370
On 

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:52.310
the silent apex there is the percussion of
Anahata.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.030
Anahat is this "lub-dub" of the heart you
feel there.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:00.660
And then when it breaks you start getting
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.660
If you call it, miracle.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:02.660
It is a miracle, but to Me it is not.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.660
It's all there.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.660
It is built in.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:09.230
There are thousand and one miracles we see
morning till evening.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:15.420
We are not surprised and this is also the
great thing that God has done, that you all

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.750
have to get your Self-realization.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:18.930
The time has come.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.690
This is the time of judgment, a special time,
a blossom time when thousands of you have

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.750
to get your realization.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:31.490
First of all we have to know that we must
get the light within ourselves.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.100
Then one can tell you all about the chakras
and the nadis and everything.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:40.730
Like the light here has to be put on first,
and then one can tell you about the history

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.930
and how it came and about everything else,
but very easy to get the light.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:50.660
Now the other day somebody asked me a question,
"Mother it used to take thousands of years

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.420
for people to get realization.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.650
They used to be born again and again and all
that."

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.660
I said, "That was all right."

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:03.570
Because on the tree of life first there were
one or two flowers only, but today you all

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:05.200
have come through all that.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.350
Now that background is with you.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.910
You are just cashing your background with
Me.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.920
I am just like a banker sitting here.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.680
But even you feel that you don't have a background.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.850
You have it.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.650
You don't know what background you must have
had that you have become a human being, and

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.180
on top of that you are a seeker.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.230
You might done some mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.190
After all, human beings are only going to
make mistakes.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.930
So we are not to feel guilty.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:39.560
That is one thing I have to make very humble
request that we are not going to feel guilty

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560
at all.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.970
Today, somehow or other, the time has become
very short for Me.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.200
Your train times have to change.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:53.530
You have to go to London tonight, and I will
start the program of giving realization to

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.530
you.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:20:00.270
But there will be some people here who will
look after you, fulfill all your questions

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.400
and do everything.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.810
They have become experts and sometimes they
are more effective than Me.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:18.270
Especially in India you see, and here I find
that somehow I, being a very gentle Mother,

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.960
people do not take things seriously.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:30.330
Mother may be gentle but She can be very forceful,
and you all should take your realization because

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:41.690
the power of love is the highest that suits
you, controls you, makes you a higher personality.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.030
We have never used the power of love so far.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.950
We have only used the power of hatred.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.280
The power of love just flows.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:03.090
That is, not to be seen but to be felt as
cool breeze all around, is called as Rutambhara

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:08.020
Pragya -- in Sanskrit language, is called
as the All Pervading Power of God's love.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:15.170
Is called as Brahma, is called as so many
Nirakaar sakshat brahma, but all these things

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.440
are to be felt.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:25.710
It acts so that you get cured of your troubles.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:33.940
It acts so that you are mentally a very happy
and a satisfied person that you rise into

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.940
joy.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:41.350
It acts through your attention that wherever
you put your attention it cures; it makes

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.650
a person innocent.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.020
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes."

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.700
Where are those people?

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.730
Where do we find those people who have no
adulterous eyes?

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.050
But you get purified..

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:59.510
Your eyes get purified, and you have those
eyes that when you put those eyes on anybody

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.280
he gets his realization.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.800
That sort of a personality you develop.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.980
You are so great and glorified by God.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.670
Just achieve what is inside you.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.750
Just get it, manifest it.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:21.350
But truth has to be manifested on your central
nervous system.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.680
Not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.260
No mental projection, but you must feel it
on your central nervous system and you have

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:33.080
to become your own master.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:38.330
That's what when happens then you say you
are a self-realized person.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:45.110
It's not that you do all kinds of bad things
and say that, "Oh I am great."

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.210
Not so.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:58.220
You really become embodiment of virtue, embodiment
of righteousness and you lose that capacity

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.000
to be tempted by nonsense.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.800
Nor do you allow any habits to come over you.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:11.510
Such a powerful, compassionate personality
you develop and the whole personality beams

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.440
with that and you can see it clearly.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:22.340
You don't become a miserable bony structure,
as they put up of Christ, but you really become

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.090
like the one Michelangelo has done -- that
sort of a great personality.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.240
When they put up such a picture know that
they are miserable creatures themselves.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.080
Ask them if they can carry the cross themselves
that they can put up such a picture of Christ.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:43.110
They have done harm to everyone, not only
to Christ; to all the great prophets when

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.770
they lived and when they died.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:50.150
They are still harming them by giving wrong
ideas about them, by making money out of them,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.430
by spreading hatred out of them.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.280
Anything extreme is wrong.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.450
You have to be in the center.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.790
You have to be moderate and it acts and works
out.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.990
May God bless you all.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:10.700
Today I am sorry I won't allow you to ask
Me questions because there's no time today.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:16.230
I'm sorry I didn't have so much time, but
what we can do is to leave someone here for

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.270
you, whom you can ask questions.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.520
Best is to get your realization.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.800
That will work it out and let's see how much
time it takes.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.850
Actually, Kundalini takes split of a second
to rise, split of a second.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:30.850
But where?

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.400
In Indian villages.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.090
I don't know about Birmingham.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.200
Let us see how it works out.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:45.500
But you have many people here who are already
realized souls sitting and it should take

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.200
no time for you to be that.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.880
But don't start thinking about it.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.800
It is beyond thought.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.120
It is in thoughtless awareness you have to
rise but you don't have to fight your thoughts.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.430
You become thoughtlessly aware.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:07.640
You become -- again I say you have to become,
it's not just a mental projection or a certificate,

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.260
"born again", and behaving like a stupid fool.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:19.400
Or, "I am such and such guru," wearing his
mala and the guru and the shishas going to

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.550
hell, taking two running jumps that way.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.940
That's not it.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:33.240
It's such a funny sight when you see those
people, the chelas of the gurus the way they

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240
are.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.240
Just can't believe it.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.510
The guru has befooled them and they have really
become fools and stupid people.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.200
So be careful.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.370
You have to become your own guru.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.020
I am just your Mother.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.800
I am here to give you your realization.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.060
As far as the Mother Earth gives sprouting
to the seed, that's all.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.920
There's no obligation, nothing of the kind.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:57.920
It's your own.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.040
You have it and enjoy it.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:06.420
Only thing after this, as yoga has one meaning,
the Union with the Divine, and another is

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:14.520
the deftness, the art of handling this power
of God.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:18.810
The Divine Power, the Divine Laws, this is
the, another meaning.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.640
That is in Sanskrit it's Kaushalam.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.680
It's the deftness, the technique, the technicalities.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:33.710
Not of how to handle a car but how to handle
this power, this great power that starts flowing

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:34.710
through you.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:44.700
You become like the flute of Shri Krishna,
egoless, and you enjoy that egoless state.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.720
That's what you all are for and you should
get it.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.520
May God bless you.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.320
Question from a seeker.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:10.120
Shri Mataji: Just a minute, I'll tell you
now.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.120
Sit down, sit down.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.390
It's very simple, you see.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:18.010
Your question is all right but is not thought
out.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:21.510
But you understand how you have not thought
out.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.640
Now just a minute, now in this light there
is a lamp and a light coming out, all right?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.070
Now you think about your question again.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.170
What is it?

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.020
What are you asking me?

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.100
All right!

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.170
All right!

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.870
God is everywhere, all right?

00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:46.570
I can't understand what he is talking about.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:52.230
Bala: Mother I don't think this is the time
to discuss...

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.710
Shri Mataji: All right, you can discuss with
him later on.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.190
All right, we'll give you a full chance.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.190
What is he trying to say?

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.190
Just tell me.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.190
One minute.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.930
Bala: He is saying that the Kundalini is wholly
within the body but God is everywhere.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.990
How can you awaken something which is within?

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.820
Shri Mataji: But that I will show you....

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.440
Bala: On the assumption that God is everywhere.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.820
Shri Mataji: I mean, God is everywhere.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.820
Now see, it's very simple.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.820
I'll tell you.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.820
It's like this.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.010
There is ether everywhere, all right, but
how is it that only the radio receives the

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.400
programs?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.990
Why do you have a radio?

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.020
You can receive yourself.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.000
After all, ether is everywhere.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.320
It's very simple.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.510
I mean, you have not used your brains at all.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.630
When asking the questions use your brains.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.430
Comment from questioner: "Let the people receive
the"....

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.300
Shri Mataji: Now you should not be -- Hello,
sir, you should not be aggressive.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.310
There are many who want it.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.400
Let it be.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.730
We are going to give you time.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.730
I will tell you all about it.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:50.780
Why you are for the people?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.090
Are you representing them?

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:53.950
How are you talking for people?

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.180
Who wants to hear his lecture?

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.780
Is there anyone?

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.920
No one wants you.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.520
Please go away.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.720
Useless man, does nothing for you.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.920
From where they come, God knows.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.860
Must be from some guru paid by them.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.230
That's all, nothing else.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:16.310
They earn money and that's how they manage.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.810
They earn money; good advertisements by some
people put them up.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:26.920
Some of them came to kill Me because you see
they are enterprisers.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.720
So, they think when I say, "You can't give
money," you see.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.400
In Marathi we say that, or in Hindi we say,
"Pate pe pair aana."

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.690
You see, his earnings are hurt.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.920
They don't like Me.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.360
It's all right.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.680
I'll have to say what I have to say.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.220
I am not afraid of them.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:55.580
All right, please take out your shoes.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.680
It's not that only I can raise the Kundalini.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.490
You see, ego gets challenged by that.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.770
I don't mean that.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:03.220
If you get your realization you can give.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:09.470
Actually there's one gentleman in Maharashtra
who has raised the Kundalini of ten thousand

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:14.020
people, but one light has to enlighten another
light.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.260
What is wrong in that?

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:17.670
And then another light can enlighten just
another light.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.480
But the one that is not enlightened has to
get their light from someone.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.690
In that their ego is hurt.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.880
They don't mind taking dole from the government
but if somebody tries to raise their Kundalini,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:32.910
his ego is hurt.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.180
Such self-respecting people, I can't understand.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.290
It's a great blessing that somebody's raising
your Kundalini.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.630
Where do you get people these days?

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.480
They only want to have all your money, that's
all.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.650
Who does that?

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.560
Have you met anyone?

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.240
If you have met anyone like Me, please tell
Me.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:57.540
I haven't met one.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.720
It's not that I am something great, but this
is the fact.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:09.450
This is the truth that somebody has to do
it without any selfish interest.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.450
It has to be done.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.720
It's a job of a person who has no selfish
interest.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.730
It's just the love, the compassion.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.690
So, how can you challenge that?

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:23.690
It is there.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.130
It will act and work out.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.750
All right, so settle down little bit.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.490
Don't be upset with this gentleman.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.600
It's all right.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.820
They are always there to upset.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.500
Only one is not to fight.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.130
Now what you have to do take out your shoes,
simple.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:43.300
What I say, you just do it and it will work
out.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.570
Have faith in yourself.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.070
First of all, have faith in yourself.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.330
Forgive yourself.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.330
Don't feel guilty.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.100
I have told you before now, "Don't feel guilty.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.100
Don't feel guilty.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.100
Don't feel guilty."

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.480
All of you are capable of this Kundalini awakening.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.300
So, please don't feel guilty.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.490
Just know that everyone can get realization.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:14.290
Everyone can become a guru and everyone can
give realizations to others.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.350
Is a fact.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.400
This has happened.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.679
But if you want to sit on the fence, you go
ahead with it because I have to gain nothing

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:24.679
out of you.

00:32:24.679 --> 00:32:25.830
Be sure on that.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:30.190
You see, it's a subtle type of a ego that
works in people.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.960
What do you have to give Me?

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:38.490
Supposing I say I want something, then it's
all right, but there's no shop here.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:40.960
It's a temple.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:49.380
In a temple you have to get something and
you don't go and fight with someone in a temple,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.790
do you?

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.200
All right!

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.920
So now close your eyes.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.620
Put your hands like this, just like this.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.179
You don't have to do anything.

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:02.179
Effortless!

00:33:02.179 --> 00:33:03.260
It's effortless.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.370
Don't fight your thoughts.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.370
Don't fight anything.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.760
Just let your attention be loose.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.920
Kundalini itself will rise.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.470
You don't have to do anything.

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.110
Just have faith in yourself, that's all, that
you are going to get it.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:24.110
Now 
one thing you have to do is to remember that

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:29.200
the left hand is for your desire, desire power,
which they will explain to you later, and

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:36.720
the right hand is for awakening of the Kundalini
in the way that it goes into action.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:43.380
It gives release to your different centers
by which the Kundalini rises easily.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.620
It's very simple thing.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:58.000
So, put your right hand on your heart.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.700
Put your right hand on your heart.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:22.529
Now, as I said, the Spirit resides in your
heart but God Almighty, the seat of God Almighty,

00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:29.409
is on top of your head where you have a very
soft bone in your childhood called Talu.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:31.690
He resides there.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:36.929
But His reflection, the Spirit, resides in
your heart.

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:44.730
So here you have to say, or ask Me a question
with full confidence again, not counting your

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:49.389
sins or anything, but knowing that you are
a seeker and you are going to be blessed into

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:50.500
the Kingdom of God.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:56.510
With all that dignity as a question to Me
-- you can call Me Shri Mataji or you can

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:05.230
call me Mother, whatever you like -- "Mother,
am I the spirit?"

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:10.249
Three times.

00:35:10.249 --> 00:35:22.789
Three times, ask a question.

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:25.869
You are the spirit, but you have to just ask
the question.

00:35:25.869 --> 00:35:27.210
There's no harm in asking.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:31.410
Please keep your eyes shut because Kundalini
won't rise if you, if you keep your eyes shut.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:36.180
Please have respect for yourself because you
are the spirit.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.660
So just ask Me a question, "Mother, am I the
spirit?"

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:42.559
We all have to become that.

00:35:42.559 --> 00:35:45.200
That is the epitome of our evolution.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:52.739
We all have to become the spirit.

00:35:52.739 --> 00:35:59.940
Now second position of the hand should be
on the stomach on the left hand side.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.390
We work on the left hand side.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:10.390
On the upper part of the stomach on the left
hand side you have to say again a question,

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.950
"Mother, am I my own master?

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:20.650
Am I my own guru," because logically if you
are the spirit you become your own master.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:25.390
All these great masters reside within us.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:29.420
So they bless you for that.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:35.490
Now with full confidence, without feeling
guilty, just ask Me a question, "Mother, am

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.810
I my own master?

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.749
Am I my own guru?"

00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:48.329
All the great gurus are there within us.

00:36:48.329 --> 00:36:56.430
This is a very important center.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:07.839
Now ask this question three times.

00:37:07.839 --> 00:37:30.890
Now take this right hand down on to the lower
part of the stomach, abdomen, and press it

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:31.960
hard a little.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:38.030
This is a very important Swadhistana chakra
on the left hand side and it is related to

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:44.470
the second part of yoga that I told you -- the
deftness, the technique of the true knowledge.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.619
Here I must confess I cannot cross your freedom.

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:52.720
You are free to choose.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:59.839
So you have to ask that you want this true
knowledge and you have to say, "Mother, please

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:02.410
give me my true knowledge.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:04.170
Give me Shuddha Vidya.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.819
Mother, give me true knowledge.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:12.539
Give me absolute knowledge.

00:38:12.539 --> 00:38:15.650
Give me pure knowledge."

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:22.589
You have to say it six times because this
center has got six petals.

00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:32.960
These are like lotuses and they have six petals.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:44.069
In the same way it looks after the aortic
plexus in the gross and it has got six sub-plexuses.

00:38:44.069 --> 00:39:01.880
Now please raise your hand again back to the
same position on the stomach on the left hand

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.650
side, that is the upper portion of the stomach,
upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.650
side, please, again.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:15.230
Putting the left hand there where it was.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:29.960
Now here again you have to assert because
you have asked for the true knowledge, so

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:36.420
at this center of the guru there are ten gurus;
there are ten masters.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.160
Or we can say there are ten valences human
being have got.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:50.829
So, you put your hand on that center on the
left hand side and you have to ten times assert,

00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:56.230
"Mother, I am my own master.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:59.980
Mother, I am my own guru."

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.530
That's what people don't like.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:11.200
They want to be subservient of somebody who
is not a realized soul because a realized

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:21.369
soul never makes you subservient; he makes
you higher and higher.

00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:26.140
"Mother, I am my own guru."

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.130
Say it ten times, please.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.680
Now please do not feel guilty.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.069
Even if you have been to wrong gurus, whatever
has happened has happened.

00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:36.210
Forget it.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.910
Don't blame yourself for that.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:43.630
Just say, "Mother, please make me my guru."

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:49.990
First of all as you have said it, now you
say, "Mother, I am my own guru."

00:40:49.990 --> 00:41:12.930
Say it ten times.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:18.130
Now raise your right hand.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.569
It's like a play, I tell you.

00:41:19.569 --> 00:41:20.569
It's just a leela.

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:22.190
It works out so well.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:25.589
Now put your right hand on the heart again.

00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:38.369
Now you have to assert ten times with full
confidence, "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:41:38.369 --> 00:41:40.290
With full confidence please say.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.660
Don't you worry.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.960
Many people think we have to cleanse this,
cleanse that.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.530
You leave it to Me, all those things.

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:53.190
You just say whatever I tell you, please,
believing in yourself, "Mother I am the spirit."

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:58.329
This you have to say twelve times because
this center has got twelve petals.

00:41:58.329 --> 00:42:16.950
This is the heart chakra, is called as the
anahat chakra, twelve times.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:35.150
Now raise this hand to the base of your neck
and place it on your shoulder from the front

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:42.749
side in the corner where the neck and the
shoulder meet.

00:42:42.749 --> 00:42:44.599
Put it tight.

00:42:44.599 --> 00:42:49.549
This is the center gets caught up when you
feel guilty which is very badly caught up

00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:52.079
just now.

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:56.369
What is there to feel guilty?

00:42:56.369 --> 00:43:03.670
Now take the hand from the front side, from
the front side on the left hand, front side,

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.430
not this way across, front across.

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:08.609
[Aside: No.

00:43:08.609 --> 00:43:18.130
Left hand towards Me and right hand like this
and hold it tight, yes.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:23.710
This gentleman is not knowing, you just - this
hand like this and this hand like that.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.039
Can you do it, please?

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:26.319
Left hand towards Me.

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:30.190
Yes, left hand towards Me like that, left
hand towards Me.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.829
Yes, correct and right hand here.

00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:34.890
That's good.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:39.180
Now this is a very important center what we
call the Vishuddhi chakra on the left hand

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.180
side.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:45.349
Those who suffer from this center get all
the diseases like angina and rheumatic heart

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:52.720
and all those things where there's a slow
movement of the circulation.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:44:00.029
So please say sixteen times, "Mother, I am
not guilty."

00:44:00.029 --> 00:44:07.630
You have to be pleasantly approaching towards
God's Kingdom, isn't it?

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.990
You should be pleasant about it.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:17.359
What is there to be so sad or to be so gloomy
about?

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:21.700
So just say, "Mother, I am not guilty," sixteen
times, and if you still continue with that

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:29.220
kind of a thing is better that you say hundred
and eight times to punish yourself.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.010
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:37.220
Be pleasant about it.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.920
There's nothing to be upset about yourself.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.230
All the time you have condemned yourself for
nothing at all.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:51.609
Believe me, you have done nothing wrong that
cannot be forgiven by God because God is the

00:44:51.609 --> 00:44:53.619
ocean of love.

00:44:53.619 --> 00:44:56.549
He is the ocean of compassion.

00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:58.769
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:44:58.769 --> 00:46:06.609
What can you do that it cannot wash away these
little specks?

00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:12.759
Some people say that it is difficult to forgive
but just see what is the logic behind it.

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:14.960
What do we do when we do not forgive?

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.880
What do we do when we forgive?

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.880
Nothing!

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880
It's a myth.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.499
We are just torturing ourselves.

00:46:20.499 --> 00:46:29.569
So just say, "Mother I forgive everyone,"
with your heart in it.

00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:33.229
Please forgive everyone.

00:46:33.229 --> 00:46:41.250
To forgive is Divine, and really, that's a
fact.

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:56.049
You'll feel much lighter if you forgive.

00:46:56.049 --> 00:47:06.009
Now you have to put your hand on top of your
head for a while, just for a while, pressing

00:47:06.009 --> 00:47:16.410
the palm of your hand on top of the fontanel
area or the soft bone or the talu and press

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:26.380
it in a clockwise manner and move it so that
your scalp also moves in a clockwise manner.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:28.240
Press it hard.

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.549
Seven times you have to press it.

00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:37.130
Before that you just say without feeling guilty
again, without confidence before entering

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:44.400
into the Kingdom of God that, "Oh God, please
forgive me if I have done any mistakes," but

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.819
don't feel any way guilty about it.

00:47:48.819 --> 00:47:59.019
Just say it three times.

00:47:59.019 --> 00:48:11.700
Now here at the top of the head you have to
cross the gross into the subtle.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.410
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.170
For that I cannot force you.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.579
I cannot push you in.

00:48:18.579 --> 00:48:20.000
You have to ask for it.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.729
So again you have to say, "Mother, I want
my realization.

00:48:24.729 --> 00:48:26.420
Please give me self-realization.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.029
Mother, please give me Atma Shakshatkaar."

00:48:30.029 --> 00:49:32.869
Just press it hard, seven times.

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:38.700
Now you can take down your hand.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.869
Put your left hand on top of your head.

00:49:40.869 --> 00:49:45.839
Pay attention there, about four inches above.

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:51.920
And now see if there's a cool breeze coming
out.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:50:09.920
Keep your eyes shut.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:40.589
[Mother breathes into the microphone] You
start feeling a cool breeze on top of your

00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:42.420
head.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.809
Just move it up and down.

00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:47.160
Now don't get upset you are not feeling it
-- Vishuddhi.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:54.460
If you are feeling any cool breeze, well and
good.

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:58.970
Even it you are not feeling you should not
worry.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.020
There might be heat coming out.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.349
First, there's a lot of heat in the body.

00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:05.349
Let it come out.

00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:06.349
Let the heat come out.

00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:10.589
You can change your hand and see if there
is cool breeze coming in.

00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:17.190
If it is coming you can put down your hand.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.109
Little higher!

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:28.690
Move it up and down or move backwards and
forwards.

00:51:28.690 --> 00:51:30.609
All right?

00:51:30.609 --> 00:51:31.609
Good.

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:37.319
Now put your hands like this.

00:51:37.319 --> 00:51:43.769
Now putting the hands towards Me, you have
to ask Me a question again sixteen times,

00:51:43.769 --> 00:51:48.789
I am sorry, "Mother, am I the part and parcel
of the whole?

00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:55.660
Mother, am I the part and parcel of the whole?"

00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:22.960
[Aside: that will work out for Vishuddhi].

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:32.029
Now I will tell you how to raise your own
Kundalini and keep it there because it has

00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:33.029
stuck.

00:52:33.029 --> 00:52:34.729
I know it has stuck.

00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:35.729
Still you may not feel it.

00:52:35.729 --> 00:52:38.099
Some may feel it.

00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:43.700
There are many Sahaja Yogis here who will
help you how to do it.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:49.489
They'll tell you, but there's very simple
which you should follow every day to raise

00:52:49.489 --> 00:52:52.829
your Kundalini and keep it in proper place.

00:52:52.829 --> 00:53:03.099
It's first of all, just hold it.

00:53:03.099 --> 00:53:11.599
You have to put your left hand in front of
your Kundalini, just like this, how to raise

00:53:11.599 --> 00:53:14.140
it.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:19.049
That is -- [Aside: should we give them a bandhan
first of all?

00:53:19.049 --> 00:53:20.049
All right!

00:53:20.049 --> 00:53:21.049
Doesn't matter.]

00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:26.980
Now you put your right hand here and go on
moving it just like that.

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.460
Take it on top of your head.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.890
Push it back your head and make a -- that's
it.

00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:37.220
This is the first way we raise our Kundalini.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:40.259
Everybody should try because then they will
say, "We didn't feel it.

00:53:40.259 --> 00:53:41.259
We didn't have."

00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:42.259
It's very simple.

00:53:42.259 --> 00:53:46.880
Now this is what in the Bible they said that
when the Holy Ghost blessed them they started

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.200
speaking in strange languages, means the languages
of the chakras, and they moving their hands

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.240
in a funny manner.

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.930
This is the way because that's how you raise
the Kundalini.

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:57.780
Even the children were doing.

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.900
I saw them.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.700
They are -- some of them are born realized
so they themselves were trying all the things,

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.130
so -- but we are grown-ups, you see.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.910
So we are too much up here.

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:11.009
Now let us be humbled down and take it.

00:54:11.009 --> 00:54:16.950
This is the first time we push back our head.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:17.950
That's one.

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:19.430
Again second time.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:22.900
This is, we are raising our Kundalini.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.130
You'll see the vibrations will increase.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.300
Second time.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.359
Third time, three times we have to give, beautiful.

00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:39.240
Three times we have to give a knot, beautiful,
one, two and three.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.460
Now see your hands.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.460
Are they feeling cool breeze?

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:51.989
In the hands, feeling it, yes.

00:54:51.989 --> 00:55:02.680
[Mother speaks in Hindi] If it is not coming
you should not be dishonest.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.109
You have to get it.

00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:05.930
You should not be dishonest to yourself.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:11.529
You should be kind to yourself and as a result
of that sometimes, you know, people think,

00:55:11.529 --> 00:55:12.980
"Oh, I haven't got it.

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:13.980
So what!"

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.180
It's nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.180
It's something wrong with you.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.969
Either you are egoistical or you are conditioned.

00:55:19.969 --> 00:55:28.009
Either you are not well or there's something
going in your minds which is against, or some

00:55:28.009 --> 00:55:30.469
sort of a thing that works out.

00:55:30.469 --> 00:55:32.869
I have seen there was a gentleman who asked
me, "Why I can't get it?"

00:55:32.869 --> 00:55:38.969
He was a very frivolous man and I didn't want
to tell him that, "You are frivolous."

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:54.579
Another one was thinking no end 

00:55:54.579 --> 00:55:55.849
of himself.

00:55:55.849 --> 00:56:08.160
So just see if you are feeling.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:13.900
Is it so simple?

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:22.579
[Mother speaks in Hindi] Taking the name of
Nanaka himself, you see, such a great primordial

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.640
master born on this earth.

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.729
Just taking his name itself, the Kundalini
rises.

00:56:29.729 --> 00:56:40.859
[Mother speaks in Hindi] He was the same as
Mohammed Sahib.

00:56:40.859 --> 00:56:42.019
He was the same as Abraham.

00:56:42.019 --> 00:56:47.619
He was the same as Moses.

00:56:47.619 --> 00:56:52.539
Why are you fighting?

00:56:52.539 --> 00:56:56.950
Just see this.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:03.109
All right, I am sorry I have to catch a train
because there is some sort of an emergency

00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:06.559
for Me to go to London but here is Warren.

00:57:06.559 --> 00:57:07.670
He is Dr Warren Reeves.

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:12.220
I call him Warren because he is like my son,
he -- they are all My children.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.299
He is here to satisfy your mind.

00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:18.020
If you have any questions you can write to
him.

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.670
If you have not felt the vibrations don't
go away.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:21.749
Raise your hands.

00:57:21.749 --> 00:57:27.650
There are at least here thirty to forty Sahaja
Yogis who have been imported.

00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:30.819
Now we have to import people from Birmingham
to London.

00:57:30.819 --> 00:57:33.720
So there are so many have come.

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.430
Please just listen to them.

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.329
You can outbeat them in no time.

00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:46.309
There is nothing to feel bad and this is how
you are going to achieve, that is being prophesized.

00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:49.989
And now you can ask a question, "Is there
God?"

00:57:49.989 --> 00:57:53.329
Ask a question, "Is the God miraculous?

00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:56.390
All the miracles of Christ -- are they correct?"

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:02.019
Real, ask a question and you'll get the answer
as tremendous vibrations.

00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:06.109
You become a computer which is living computer.

00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:08.500
That's how you can prove everything.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:10.799
Everything can be proved.

00:58:10.799 --> 00:58:13.309
May God bless you all.

00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:14.309
There are people here.

00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:16.450
Dr Warren will tell you about it.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.309
He is going to stay on.

00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:22.890
He has given realization to I don't know how
many thousands people in Australia, but somehow

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:25.319
Australians are very much in the center.

00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:28.519
I must say Australians are very different.

00:58:28.519 --> 00:58:32.220
English now think that they have punished
Australians; so now they are great.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.249
It's not so.

00:58:33.249 --> 00:58:37.529
In Australia great saints are born.

00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:41.200
So in England also but we have to become.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.390
So the becoming is the point.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:46.510
We have a very nice center in Birmingham and
I've been coming to this hall I don't know

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:49.339
how many times, and to Birmingham.

00:58:49.339 --> 00:58:52.769
I hope you people become the tree.

00:58:52.769 --> 00:58:56.320
Now the seed has sprouted but just don't give
it up.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.190
Become the tree.

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:04.660
That's very important; otherwise it's just
a waste and is a sin against yourself if you

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:05.660
do that.

00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:07.920
So may God bless you.

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:10.709
I don't think you have questions.
