1
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:16,370
All right. First I would like to tell you about

2
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:21,855
the meaning of puja.

3
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:23,808
There are two aspects.

4
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:37,168
One is the aspect that you have got your own deities within yourself.

5
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:41,230
And these deities are to be awakened within you.

6
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:45,517
Deities are the different aspects of one God.

7
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:50,485
So on one side you have the Deities, means the aspects of God,

8
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:53,166
which are all the time awakened.

9
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:58,406
On the other side you have your own Deities,

10
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:03,046
which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half-awakened,

11
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:08,194
sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick.

12
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,350
So you have to use two methods:

13
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:21,311
one to please the Deities

14
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,831
of God,

15
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:28,191
and to ask them to bless your Deities,

16
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:33,694
or to ask them to awaken your Deities.

17
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:39,374
So by doing the puja, means when you offer anything

18
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:42,579
that you have got to offer,

19
00:01:42,699 --> 00:01:46,979
anything that you offer is - say, flowers,

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:51,929
if you want to offer flower to God, you don't have to speak anything,

21
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:55,089
you have to just offer, that "this is for You."

22
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,790
Anybody can understand offering,

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,353
for that you don't have to have even a tongue.

24
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:04,953
Even if a blind man is there, if he wants to give you something,

25
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,993
he can just give you like this.

26
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,473
And that expression is sufficient

27
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,153
for anybody to be convinced that he can offer it.

28
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:14,650
You don't have to say anything about it.

29
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,970
So now, when you offer a flower to God,

30
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,449
even if you don't say a mantra

31
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:26,689
it is offered - all right, it's given.

32
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:32,183
But whether it is accepted or not is a problem.

33
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:36,824
But now, when you are a realized soul and you offer anything,

34
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:41,165
it is acceptable to God even if you don't say anything.

35
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:46,314
But what about you getting any reward out of it?

36
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:51,822
After realization when you offer anything to God, He accepts,

37
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:56,079
because it's coming from a realized soul, so He accepts.

38
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,279
Now, how do we get

39
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:07,040
blessed by Him, by giving a flower to God?

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,504
Now if you don't say anything about it,

41
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:12,126
you just offer a flower,

42
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:16,329
then you might be rewarded with many flowers

43
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:20,072
automatically in life.

44
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,947
Or you may be, whatever material things you offer,

45
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,704
you may be blessed materially.

46
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:30,915
Then in a subtler way if you say something,

47
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:34,158
as you say for offering somebody

48
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:36,970
that humble way of saying that

49
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,439
"I'll be happy if You would accept this,"

50
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:45,642
will be even subtler results of that maybe,

51
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:51,650
which could be much wider, maybe much deeper.

52
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,369
Now, you do something symbolic

53
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,611
which is very, the essence, the principle of something.

54
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:01,322
Like flowers are the -

55
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,728
they represent the principle of the Mother Earth.

56
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:06,248
Now,

57
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:11,415
so the symbolicism of all the things

58
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,415
that we can offer to God has been meditated upon,

59
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,884
and has been found out.

60
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:22,134
So they use five things called as panchamruta,

61
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:24,603
Because if you have hit the principle,

62
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,790
then you have really hit the whole, isn't it.

63
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,345
Because spiritual well-being is a total well-being.

64
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:35,063
It's not just partly that your material well-being

65
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:38,111
or your physical well-being, or your emotional well-being,

66
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,876
or your mental well-being.

67
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:44,494
It's a total one, completely balanced into totality.

68
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:51,051
Now when you offer these other things like the,

69
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:59,043
we call them akshadas,

70
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,634
what do you call ?

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,103
Turmeric. Turmeric rice, you see, this yellow thing, you see.

72
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:13,454
When you offer this, you know, the yellow color

73
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:16,361
is that of the Swadisthana Chakra.

74
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:20,056
And rice is very dear to all the gods.

75
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:23,697
Now there's a trick in it, because it's a human trick.

76
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:26,001
Gods are fond of rice.

77
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:28,158
So they put turmeric on it,

78
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:32,611
means that "We offer to You a rice which is yellow-colored"

79
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:38,658
- means, "You should give us blessings of our creativity."

80
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,572
When you eat it, more creativity will flow

81
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:45,408
and we'll be blessed by that deity - it's a trick.

82
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:50,173
The whole thing of puja is the trick of human saints, you see,

83
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:54,681
how to trick God to give more blessings!

84
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:58,884
But whatever God likes, it has to be auspicious and holy.

85
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:01,595
So ultimately it works out for the

86
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:06,829
holiness of saints and their simple hearts.

87
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,275
Now, the puja cannot be done by a person who is not a realized soul.

88
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:14,478
A person who preaches also has to be a realized soul,

89
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,783
the one who does namaz has to be a realized soul,

90
00:06:17,903 --> 00:06:20,689
the one who prays has to be a realized soul.

91
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:25,118
So all the utensils that are used are to be worshipped in a way

92
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:28,501
that they are to be holy things,

93
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,376
they are to be respected things.

94
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:34,103
You cannot use anything, say the one you are using in the bathroom

95
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:37,618
and you use the same thing for the puja, is absurd.

96
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:39,548
Three things are very important,

97
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:42,548
is a ghatah, means [UNCLEAR] the vessel,

98
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,634
vessel that contains the kundalini,

99
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:49,014
the vessel that contains the

100
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:53,564
primordial desire within us to get to God,

101
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:55,939
is first to be worshipped, our desire.

102
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,673
Is the ghatah, is the one made here.

103
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,634
And on top is called as a Shriphala.

104
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,322
Shriphala means this also has got water in it, if you  see,

105
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:11,804
the coconut represents the same thing.

106
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:16,720
Now in the subtler form it is

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,783
the water of all the rivers of the world.

108
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:26,368
And the coconut is the water of all the oceans.

109
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,540
The water from the ocean or sea

110
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,134
rises through the tree-trunk of the coconut,

111
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,767
and becomes the sweet water in the coconut.

112
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:41,517
It's a symbolic thing.

113
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:46,090
So this is the vessel called ghatah-puja, this is the ghatah-puja.

114
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:51,439
Now, I don't want to go to details today, because we have to talk about Ganesha.

115
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:55,001
The same is - now that is water, all right.

116
00:07:55,121 --> 00:08:00,548
Then we have to worship Ghanta (bell) and Shankha (shell).

117
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:03,837
These are two representing the sound. Shell.

118
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:08,165
Actually the Shankha represents the ether.

119
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,165
Then we have the Deepa, means what?

120
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:16,696
It's the light, represents the light element, called as tejas.

121
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:21,689
Normally also to the Goddess they also give Her a fan,

122
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:24,712
which represents the air element.

123
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:28,142
So this is how all the five elements

124
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:32,892
are pleased beforehand, using them.

125
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,814
So the essences of these or the causal essences

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,806
of these five elements

127
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,009
should be pleased at this time,

128
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,329
Now there are also all kinds of other things,

129
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:51,244
like your family deities, you might be

130
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,564
worshipping in your family some deities.

131
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:57,361
They should not be also at this time upsetting the puja;

132
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,439
or maybe the forefathers who are dead.

133
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,759
All these things are to be quietened,

134
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,095
so that they should be told that this is a puja like this,

135
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:08,451
and you do not disturb us at this time.

136
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,697
Means even thoughts should not come,

137
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,189
their thoughts or their - any disturbances.

138
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:17,009
So everything is to be first made into peace.

139
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:20,001
Now this is the one aspect I have told you in short,

140
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,876
because it's a very long thing. If I have to speak about it

141
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,322
I'll have to speak at least three times,

142
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:30,056
and with three hours each time, still it may not be finished.

143
00:09:30,176 --> 00:09:32,306
Now we come to the second aspect,

144
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,736
which question I asked you "What do you,

145
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,783
how do you get benefited by it?"

146
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:43,894
So apart from this technique, to have the best

147
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:47,598
effect of the blessings

148
00:09:47,718 --> 00:09:53,658
or the best flow of the Grace within us,

149
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:56,290
we say mantras.

150
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,668
The sound of mantras,

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,673
the sound, the sound echoes

152
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:12,111
into the being of God.

153
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,978
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

154
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:19,501
and then the chakras start opening more.

155
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:24,103
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

156
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,986
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

157
00:10:28,106 --> 00:10:32,275
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

158
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:34,009
It is a vicious circle.

159
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:37,665
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

160
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:40,642
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

161
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:45,853
And the chakras won't open by a person who is not a realized soul.

162
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:49,236
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

163
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:54,025
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

164
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:57,259
and of all the saints, like you.

165
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:02,978
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

166
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:06,134
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

167
00:11:06,254 --> 00:11:09,126
Once you raise the kundalini, the kundalini opens

168
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,244
the chakras a little bit,

169
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:15,298
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

170
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:18,611
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

171
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:22,134
behind the seeker, she rises.

172
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:25,267
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

173
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:29,204
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

174
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:32,072
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

175
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,423
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

176
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:39,197
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.

177
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:44,525
That's why in the beginning we don't tell them about the mantras,

178
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:49,603
because in the mantras you have to accept Me as the Deity.

179
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:54,314
In this advent of Mine it is made compulsory

180
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:57,895
that you have to recognize Me.

181
00:11:58,207 --> 00:12:00,712
Because this is very precarious,

182
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,892
the Resurrection Time we can call it,

183
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:06,267
or the time of your Last Judgment.

184
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:08,900
First the realization has to be given

185
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,134
without any recognition.

186
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:16,744
But not to those who are denying or insulting Me.

187
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:19,579
Under any circumstances they cannot get realization,

188
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,033
whatever you may try.

189
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:26,197
Even after realization if people start thinking against Me,

190
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:28,181
vibrations will stop,

191
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,783
because of Sahasrara.

192
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:33,345
And the heart has to be

193
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:37,111
completely in unison with Me,

194
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:41,212
otherwise Sahasrara is closed.

195
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:45,454
Now those people who are simple,

196
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:50,158
who are full of open heart, you see,

197
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,283
such people understand Me very well and

198
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:56,822
they just put Me in their hearts.

199
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,392
After realization,

200
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,759
after going through the understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

201
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:08,033
through their mental activity, also the intellectuals understand Me

202
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:13,231
and recognize Me in a little circuitous way.

203
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,181
After the puja, when they receive the blessings,

204
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:21,564
a very blissful state they achieve,

205
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:27,450
then they realize the value of puja also - afterwards.

206
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:32,851
Now in India, where the puja system has been traditionally coming

207
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:35,290
and has been maintained quite a lot,

208
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,556
they understand it without any mental processes.

209
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:42,494
But when they meet somebody, an intellectual,

210
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,294
who has become a Sahaja yogi, you see

211
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:48,908
they can't understand them.

212
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,064
They don't want to listen about it,

213
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:55,486
the whole rigmarole of the whole movement of the brain.

214
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,769
And some of them who try, you see, a little westernized,

215
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,119
they try, you see; they develop an inferiority complex,

216
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,204
and they go to the left side.

217
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:07,619
But there is no need to understand it with mental,

218
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:12,400
I mean, to all the time analyzing through your mental process,

219
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,876
and then to understand everything,

220
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:20,650
and then become Sahaja yogis with the heart open.

221
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,484
This is rather very circuitous. But what to do?

222
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:27,228
They have gone that way, so they have to come that way.

223
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:30,333
Because even if they become Sahaja yogis,

224
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,538
they start questioning and thinking about it,

225
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:36,369
and worrying about it.

226
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:40,040
So the false people just mesmerize them

227
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,954
and take advantage of that mesmerism.

228
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:46,900
So one should not feel bad.

229
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,415
If you feel like analyzing, you should go ahead with it,

230
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:55,400
because I cannot stop your speed,

231
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,236
I'm not going to mesmerize you.

232
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:03,369
In Sahaja Yoga the freedom is to be respected.

233
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:07,306
But we do not allow people to come for puja

234
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:10,494
who have not achieved a certain amount

235
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:16,329
of understanding mentally of Sahaja Yoga

236
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,634
- from the Western people, not in India,

237
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:21,251
but here there is a restriction.

238
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:27,158
Because supposing in India I do not explain to them,

239
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,720
they don't want to know. They know that they'll get vibrations.

240
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,533
They already know about vibrations,

241
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:36,642
so I don't have to tell them "You will get more vibrations."

242
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:39,259
If they get more vibrations they know I am the Shakti,

243
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,556
that's all, I don't have to explain it.

244
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,970
Like as you can make out which is the best wine,

245
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,322
they can make out who is the real person.

246
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:51,431
They know the taste of it.

247
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,892
Now, once in a puja

248
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:58,017
I had about six thousand people that touched My Feet.

249
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,119
So I said, "In a puja now, please don't have

250
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:04,173
- the people need not touch My Feet." I said it.

251
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,900
But they thought it was Dhumal who suggested,

252
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,845
so they all got after his life.

253
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:12,869
They said, "You only want to take all the blessings

254
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,876
from Mother's Feet, and you didn't want us to take it",

255
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:17,775
and they got after him.

256
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,408
Another thing is, you see, in the West

257
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:25,244
I never used to make the panchamruta with My Feet but with My Hands,

258
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:29,869
because here people would think that that's a dirty thing feet is,

259
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,392
and we should not have of the feet, you see.

260
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:34,720
But actually the Feet are very powerful,

261
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,775
and they can never be dirty.

262
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:40,329
Like the River Ganges has vibrations.

263
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,014
If you have the water of Ganges

264
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,814
you will see that it will never be dirtied.

265
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,556
On the contrary, whatever are inside that

266
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:50,369
because it's never sort of very kept clean,

267
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:53,322
whatever dirt has gone into it,

268
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:56,572
it settles down and doesn't dirty the thing at all.

269
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:00,040
It's very clean water, all the time vibrating.

270
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,431
So one must understand whatever is pure,

271
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,220
which is responsible for purity,

272
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,767
which is the source of purity,

273
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,454
can cleanse any impurity. So how it can be impure?

274
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,556
But with the brain if you think it, it's so limited.

275
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:19,204
You cannot think of something which is just

276
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:21,251
the embodiment of purity.

277
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,001
This is the point we have come now,

278
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:27,853
where I think I should talk about the Absolute.

279
00:17:27,973 --> 00:17:29,493
That is Shri Ganesha.
