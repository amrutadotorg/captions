1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:17,300
Modi must have told you very clearly about 
how to grow in Sahaja Yog because he’s one

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:26,010
of them who has really taken very positive 
step to see that he grows.

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:33,050
Now one has to understand one simple point 
about realisation is that, just mere awakening

4
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,370
of the Kundalini is not sufficient, that’s 
just the beginning.

5
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:48,559
You get your realisation but you must become 
the tree, you have to grow, you have to become.

6
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:57,020
If you cannot grow then you have not achieved 
what you wanted to be.

7
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:09,070
And you grow very fast, very fast with meditation 
and with understanding about meditation.

8
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,820
Now one of the few hurdles that we have, that 
I’ve seen it, that are innately built in

9
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,420
Sahaja Yog itself.

10
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,810
One of them is that you get it spontaneously 
so easily that you take it for granted.

11
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,640
This is in the pattern of it, only innately 
built.

12
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,000
You see what ever you get so easily you just 
take it for granted.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,110
But the another side of it is like that, that 
when you have your eyes you don’t know the

14
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,690
value of your eyes, you take it for granted.

15
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:47,930
But when you don’t have them then you know 
the value of eyes, it’s like that.

16
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:55,200
So when you lose vibrations and when you get 
out of Sahaja Yog, then you start feeling

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,469
much more lost and then you come back to Sahaja 
Yoga again.

18
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:10,489
Like a person becomes rich, he enjoys the 
riches and then you make him poor then he

19
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,870
feels it more.

20
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,340
So this is the correcting point.

21
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:22,980
But it is very true that Sahaja has this thing 
innately built in its self that it all happens

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,349
very spontaneously and you get it for doing 
nothing at all.

23
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:41,709
So, may be so many of you may lose it because 
you might find that it is just you got it

24
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:42,709
because of something.

25
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:48,140
I’ve also known of people they get vibrations 
and they say, “Now it’s all right I don’t

26
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,940
need Sahaja Yoga, I am on my own."

27
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:56,099
Again they’re back like bad pennies with 
some troubles and some problems and then they

28
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,099
go out.

29
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:03,931
Now I would say that Modi is one of those 
first twelve people who got realisation, after

30
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:09,129
two years I’ve worked on them, while you 
got realisation in such a short time.

31
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:16,470
Two years I’ve worked on twenty five people 
out of which twelve got realisation you can

32
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,690
imagine, two years! As I’ve told you in 
London I’ve worked on six people for four

33
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,769
years to give them realisation.

34
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:34,540
But once a certain number of people of particular 
ideologies of permutations and combinations,

35
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:41,459
once they get realisation I find the rate 
of realisation increases very fast.

36
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,240
Like formally we never use to have anybody 
in the program who has been to any other Guru,

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,730
just avoid them.

38
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,180
Even up to the point that this Modi himself 
used to tell people there’s no program today,

39
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,480
no program.

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,890
And they would ring Me up and find out that 
there was a program and why they were not

41
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,890
allowed.

42
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,330
They said “Mother we get headaches you see.

43
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,930
They break our necks and they just disturb 
us and they are good for nothing."

44
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,830
But now, it’s very different, once we have 
built up our strength of collectivity we have

45
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,160
so many channels, things are working out very 
differently.

46
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,630
So the value that Modi would attach to his 
realisation is much more than you would attach

47
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,350
normally.

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:36,380
Because as you see, first even say to have 
a ordinary oil lamp was a problem.

49
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,530
So the oil lamp was very important for people.

50
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,450
They would see to it that they would not use 
out all the oil and they were so careful.

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,670
But today we have no problem, we have got 
electricity we take it for granted.

52
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,460
Only when the electricity goes off we know 
what is electricity is.

53
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:03,190
In the same way your realisation also, when 
it is lost you understand the value of it.

54
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,720
But supposing you have just touched it and 
then you lose it, then you do not understand.

55
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,260
But if you’ve got it you’ve enjoyed it 
then you lose it then you want it back again,

56
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,280
so best thing is to be steadily moving towards 
your evolution.

57
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,850
Now after I go away that’s the fears people 
have here that people start doubting.

58
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,120
They said, “It happened with people they 
started doubting."

59
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,090
Doubting what?

60
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,680
Your doubting yourself is the main point is.

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,470
You cannot believe that you can get realisation.

62
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,210
This is the basic.

63
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:53,240
You see to Me, it seems that you feel that 
how can you get realisation?

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Only those who are very highly realised souls 
know that you are realised, they know that

65
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,630
you have been given realisation, but they 
also sometimes ask Me, “Why did you give

66
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,630
them realisation.

67
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:12,910
What have they done?” Because you also think, 
I mean we still have to look forward to something

68
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,230
else.

69
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,340
How can we get realisation, this is the trouble

70
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,330
You don’t believe in yourself.

71
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,370
That’s what you have to have confidence 
in yourself and then you’ll have confidence

72
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,060
in Me also.

73
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,960
Because there are so many ways, by which you 
can verify.

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
First of all

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:44,470
you can ask questions to the photograph or 
to Me in your heart, about Myself, My relationship

76
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,810
what ever you think could be, what ever you 
think, put your imagination and see that what

77
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,740
you think I could have been.

78
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,260
Ask that question.

79
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,300
Your vibrations will answer.

80
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,980
Put your, stretch your imagination to the 
last, what could be the last word you could

81
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,540
think of Me.

82
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,820
You see, some people will put doubts saying 
that, “Kundalini awakening is very difficult,

83
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,880
it is not easy."

84
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,820
Yes it’s true, it’s not easy, it’s a 
very difficult things for human beings.

85
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,070
You just can’t do it, is a fact.

86
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:32,130
You have to work for days with some guru in 
some jungle all alone, seeing nobody, working

87
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,960
out your chakras by chakras, sometimes you 
have to starve, sometimes you have to eat,

88
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,700
sometimes you have to breathe, you have to 
do all kinds of things.

89
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,090
And then the guru can work out.

90
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:51,780
But there could be someone who is somehow 
the master, could be someone.

91
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:58,240
Kundalini is the Holy Ghost within you.

92
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:06,000
So there could be someone like that who can 
do the job and that is what it is.

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,550
These things put you into doubts, because 
you can’t believe it.

94
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,240
In relation to yourself you can’t believe 
it.

95
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,420
You can believe in God, you can believe in 
Holy Ghost, you can believe in Christ but

96
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:27,300
you cannot believe that it has any relationship 
with you, that you could be that great, that

97
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,230
you could get your realisation.

98
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,140
So just feel it and enjoy it.

99
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,430
First of all, don’t think, that’s why 
I say, “Don’t think."

100
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,871
Because as soon as you start thinking, Mr.

101
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:43,159
Thomas in you will get up and say that “Hello, 
this cannot be Self-realisation."

102
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
Mr.

103
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,180
Thomas was great, you see.

104
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,830
Christ had all the disciples and I find all 
those types around, permutations and combinations

105
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,820
and some how Judas also, but they’re rarely 
to be found.

106
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:05,240
But there are, no doubt and some are Thomas’s, 
and these Thomas’ are described as murmuring

107
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,890
souls by Christ Himself.

108
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,640
He said, “These are murmuring souls,” 
and they murmur and one murmuring soul comes

109
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,880
to you, another murmuring soul in you joins 
hands and you start all murmuring together,

110
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
start thinking.

111
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,560
Now at that time what have you to do on rational 
grounds is very simple.

112
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,140
What have I done so far?

113
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,970
I’ve done everything, did I get cool breeze?

114
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,830
Did I get my self realisation?

115
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,210
Did I feel my own powers?

116
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,210
Have I been able to feel myself and others?

117
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,900
Because you see your still not fully realised, 
you may not be able to feel the vibrations

118
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,680
of another person, neither you will be able 
to feel your own vibrations.

119
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,520
But there are so many people here who are 
realised and they can feel yours, and they

120
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
can verify.

121
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,930
Supposing they ask you, “How is your father?”

122
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,300
There was one gentleman in England he came 
and told Me, “Why is everybody asking me

123
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
about my father?”

124
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,750
I said, “Because there’s one particular 
centre that’s catching,” and I called

125
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,030
a child I said now tell Me, “What is the 
centre catching?” She pointed out this one

126
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,900
and I said, “This is the centre."

127
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,070
Everybody is catching on this centre, this 
is the father centre so they’re asking you

128
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,180
about your father.

129
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,330
He said, “Yes he’s dead and he died of 
cancer and he had this and that,” and we

130
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,770
had to treat him.

131
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:39,930
For example anorexia is a disease can be cured 
by curing this centre.

132
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:47,900
It’s such a deep knowledge and it is such 
an all pervading knowledge.

133
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:56,310
Because once you know in a tree the sap that 
goes to all the leaves and all the ends of

134
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,361
it and if you can move the sap, your attention 
can move with the sap, you can know the whole

135
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,850
of the tree.

136
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,950
You cannot know leaves and then know the tree.

137
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,990
How many leaves can you count?

138
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,130
But to know the tree the best thing is to 
get to the sap.

139
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,550
To treat a tree is best is to get to its sap, 
isn’t it?

140
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:30,830
In the same way when you go from inside out 
then you find that you know yourself and others

141
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,830
very well.

142
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,740
It’s very simple even small children can 
do it.

143
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:42,000
So the first doubt comes about yourself, “Oh 
this is one of them” because there’s a

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,490
guru shopping going on, you see.

145
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:50,769
There’s a guru shopping, there’s a float, 
you go to one guru to another, to ESPs and

146
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:58,150
what you call them, all sorts of things, mediums, 
and all sorts of things they do with the dead

147
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,740
bodies or anything.

148
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,700
All these things you have been to and you 
will have found it.

149
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,720
So now suddenly you have to come to a temple, 
where you don’t pay anything and you just

150
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
get the blessings.

151
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,420
So can’t believe it, you just can’t believe 
it, it’s too much to believe.

152
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,120
This is what happens you get

153
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
confused.

154
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,220
You are all ready confused, but confusion 
could be over by understanding that something

155
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,890
is happening to you just wait and see, give 
it a chance.

156
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:37,760
There’s no way we can bind you to Sahaja 
Yoga, because there’s no mesmerism here.

157
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,350
This is another innately a problem with Sahaja 
Yoga.

158
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,490
Second problem I should say is that you’re 
too free to do what you like, absolutely free,

159
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:55,690
there’s no binding force except that you 
feel the love of your Mother.

160
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,690
Supposing you are not feeling the vibrations 
in your hand, there’s no way of binding

161
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,840
you down to Sahaja Yog, nothing.

162
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,960
We just advise “Go ahead, it will work out, 
let it work out."

163
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,810
There is no fees, there’s no registration, 
there’s no compulsion, nothing.

164
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,200
It’s your own free will.

165
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,740
If you want to stick on you can stick on, 
if you want to go away you can go away.

166
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,880
There’s no force on you of any kind.

167
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,540
There’s no registration of your names with 
some fees or anything, I mean you are not

168
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,240
bound to pay anything.

169
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,211
If you paid something then you feel, “All 
right I’ve paid for it, so go through it

170
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:35,800
what ever it is, good or bad..

171
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,960
Supposing you go to see a play and it’s 
a horrid play but still you say, “All right

172
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,570
I’ve paid for it so let me go through it."

173
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,290
But that you cannot do with Sahaja Yog because 
you’ve not paid.

174
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,920
There’s nobody will force you down, nobody 
will go on telephoning to you, “Come along,

175
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,630
please come along,” and all that.

176
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,029
So the attitude has to be changed, it is I 
who has to gain.

177
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,920
Say there’s a beautiful spot somewhere.

178
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,279
Now that beautiful spot doesn’t send an 
invitation card to anyone, everybody goes

179
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,279
there.

180
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,190
But if you have not yet discovered the beauty 
of Sahaja Yog in that way and have not enjoyed

181
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,541
it fully, you’ll have to go again and again 
and see for yourself.

182
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:23,670
It is a deliberation on your side not on the 
side of the Sahaja Yogis or Sahaja Yoga.

183
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,500
It’s not going to fall at your feet.

184
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,410
That please come to Sahaja Yoga, please donate 
something, nothing of the kind.

185
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,970
If you come you are welcome, if you don’t 
come, welcome.

186
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,500
On the contrary, you will be surprised there’s 
more rejection than acceptance in Sahaja Yog.

187
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,060
That’s also innately built.

188
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,021
I’ve seen some people who are very insincere 
type they just go out from Sahaja Yoga like

189
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:51,650
a tangent.

190
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,300
There was a gentleman who was very troublesome 
to us in Bombay and we didn’t know what

191
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:06,170
to do with him and he just got transferred 
from there and we got rid of him.

192
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:14,650
So you just go out of Sahaja Yoga like a tangent 
and we are saved from the botheration.

193
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:19,660
Because you must understand, if you have problems, 
if you are not all right it’s a problem

194
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,520
for Sahaja Yogis to correct you.

195
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,910
It’s just the other way round, if you understand 
this, then you will understand the thing,

196
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,910
what works out.

197
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,700
For example if I have to cure somebody it’s 
a problem for Me and not the problem for the

198
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,910
person who’s sick.

199
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:43,290
Now if the tree has to grow is the problem 
for the gardener not for the tree.

200
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:52,110
So the tree must see to it that it co-operates 
with the gardener and gets itself developed.

201
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:58,170
If this understanding is developed, that it 
is I who has to gain, it is I who has to go

202
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:06,190
forward, Mother has not to gain from me anything, 
She wants me to have all my powers manifested.

203
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,740
She wants me to grow through it, if this attitude 
is developed then you’ll work hard to grow

204
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,980
and you’ll work it out.

205
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,710
But on the contrary you see at the slightest 
protest if you ego stands up and says, “Why,

206
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,980
why should I do this?”

207
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,810
To overcome this hurdle you see, we have to 
build up certain stages.

208
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,970
That’s what Modi was telling Me.

209
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,110
That you first become thoughtlessly aware, 
see that silence is established.

210
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:47,020
There are certain things that you do much 
later, everybody is not allowed in there,

211
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:54,470
because truth can be only born by people who 
are strong enough to bear it.

212
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:03,900
That’s why I’m not going to tell you who 
am I, till you reach a certain stage, because

213
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,470
you cannot bear the light.

214
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:08,100
That’s what happened with Christ.

215
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,440
They crucified Him because they could not 
bear Him.

216
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:19,319
Human beings are like that, they can’t even 
bear an incarnation of love.

217
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,260
They can’t even bear love, it’s too much 
for them.

218
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,190
Even if you give them too much love they get 
upset, they get disturbed, they just can’t

219
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,190
bear it.

220
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,781
So you have to build up yourself to come to 
a certain stage of understanding of Sahaja

221
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:35,781
Yoga.

222
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,450
It’s a state, which you achieve.

223
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,410
It’s a state.

224
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,660
You are not to be certified by anyone on the...But 
it’s a state where you will start giving

225
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,179
realisation to others and the whole way you’ll 
be talking you will be in a very different

226
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,620
manner as if you are completely detached.

227
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,280
You’ll say “It is going, it is coming."

228
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
It happens.

229
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,250
You will not say my mother must get, my father 
must get, you will never say like that.

230
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:11,630
Because you’ll understand that the problem 
of Sahaja Yoga is that it cannot give to anyone.

231
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,840
Like

232
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,350
the sunshine can shine it is for the trees 
to expose themselves to the sunshine and get

233
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,850
the advantage of it.

234
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:29,240
The sunshine is not going to run after you 
all over to see that you get it.

235
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:38,030
This is the point here, it will shine the 
whole day and you take it.

236
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,890
But it’s not that it will run after you 
all the time requesting you, “Oh please

237
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,990
get me, oh please get me, have it, have it,” 
like that.

238
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:57,470
And this is what one has to understand very 
clearly, that it is you who has to ask for

239
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,390
it, and not anybody is going to force on you 
anything.

240
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:09,360
On the contrary if anybody tries to say something 
more your ego gets like that.

241
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,830
So try to be careful.

242
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:17,970
I am very happy to know that also, that in 
all the ego orientated societies I’ve seen

243
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,470
that Sahaja Yoga works like wonders.

244
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,640
Because first thing they see is their colossal 
ego.

245
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,140
And that’s a very positive point about it, 
because once you start seeing this horrible

246
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,750
balloon in you, you just start watching yourself 
and enjoying, “Oh Mr so and now get along

247
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,750
with your ego."

248
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,610
You see it’s a very interesting life you 
start leading.

249
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,990
If your ego you see, is a very good sign.

250
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,250
If you cannot see your ego then there’s 
danger.

251
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,809
But some can even see their super ego if they’re 
possessed.

252
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:58,030
See people see how they get possessed suddenly 
because the frequency of possession becomes

253
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:06,360
very little so that there’s a big gaps you 
see to see the time when you are normal and

254
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,400
when you get abnormal also you can see clearly 
that you are abnormal.

255
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,020
By seeing that you start judging, “Oh God 
I have again been caught up, I’m again lost,”

256
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,910
and you come back to normal.

257
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:29,400
The whole thing becomes a very beautiful understanding 
of the reality about yourself and you laugh

258
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,520
at yourself all the time.

259
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,250
All the time you laugh at your self and you 
laugh at everything and you find the whole

260
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,650
joke going round how people are seriously 
indulging into nonsensical things and how

261
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:48,060
it’s such a big joke you’ve been yourself 
worrying about things which have no meaning,

262
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,150
which has no significance.

263
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,600
Like I went first to Paris and people told 
Me, “Mother they are not going to like you

264
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,510
very much, because they believe a person who 
is so happy is ignorant.

265
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,950
You should not be a happy person.

266
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,299
You should be a crying baby so they’ll believe 
You."

267
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:11,320
They’re all les miserable, very unhappy 
people, extremely unhappy and if you tell

268
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,020
them you are a happy person so they are going 
to be shocked at such a thing.

269
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,150
I said, “Really this Les Miserable, let 
me (inaudible).

270
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,840
Let Me do something about them and I made 
them laugh so much at their miseries that

271
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,179
they got all right and they understood that 
the joy is just there.

272
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:35,670
You have to just peep in your heart and you’ll 
find the source of your joy and then the whole

273
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,330
thing vanishes into thin air.

274
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,820
But it has to work, it has to happen.

275
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,890
There is no quick way of doing it in the sense 
that I say, “All right you give me five

276
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,480
rupees or five dollars, Australian dollars 
and you get it."

277
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,910
NO, no, no, no, you may give Me any amount 
it won’t work out.

278
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,370
It has not worked out with My own daughters 
you’ll be surprised.

279
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,970
I’ve never forced them or I’ve never asked 
them.

280
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,370
I’ve only two daughters they’re not realised 
I’m not bothered.

281
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,230
When they’ll ask for it they’ll get it.

282
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,390
But My four grandchildren are born realised.

283
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:17,090
And one of the eldest ones one day very seriously 
said, “As it is you cannot commit mistakes

284
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,830
I know but it would have been nice if you 
have given them realisation when they were

285
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,830
children."

286
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,880
You see this is what it is that you cannot 
force these things on anyone and you have

287
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,720
to take a very detached view.

288
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,140
You are a seeker, your mother and you are 
there but they are not your responsibility,

289
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,950
you can tell them about Sahaja Yog.

290
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,929
But if they are opposing you better have, 
let them be alone, they’ll come round.

291
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:51,000
When they see the transformation in within 
you, they’ll definitely come.

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,730
So leave them alone.

293
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,870
Don’t bother your heads.

294
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,190
Just leave them alone and you will be amazed 
that they will see you transforming so well

295
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,390
and acting so well and they’ll change themselves 
and they will come to you and ask you, “How

296
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:14,820
are you so much changed and transformed?” 
You see proof of the pudding is in seeing

297
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,780
the pudding up there changing people.

298
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:26,740
And this transformation you’ll be amazed 
coming into you so suddenly that you will

299
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,310
be amazed.

300
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:36,440
But as I told you that on the left side is 
the desire or you can say the super ego, the

301
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,100
desire to do something.

302
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:46,390
And the right side is the ego which we try 
to sort of please and which feels happy and

303
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,120
the one by which we have ambitions.

304
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,309
But in the centre is the will power to do 
this.

305
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:58,100
And this will power has to be increased by 
you, “I have to do it, I have to do it."

306
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,500
First you’ll feel tired because

307
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,190
your left heart is weak, then I will tell 
you how to do it.

308
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,610
‘Then know how to raise your left heart 
if you’re tired.

309
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,410
See most of the people these days are very 
tired people.

310
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,630
They talk, “Ah,” they sit down “Ah."

311
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,940
They can’t, I mean they are very tired, 
absolutely fagged out people.

312
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,640
Morning till evening what have you been doing, 
nothing.

313
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Just sitting in the sun you got tired, just 
lazing out you got tired.

314
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,790
Why, why did you get tired?

315
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,850
Firstly because you’re not integrated you 
are fighting with in yourself.

316
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,850
You’re head is fighting your heart, your 
heart is fighting your liver.

317
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,010
Secondly, you are thinking and wasting your 
energy.

318
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:52,640
So you have to learn how to settle your heart, 
what has to be done to raise your heart to

319
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,120
make it peaceful and how to get the energy 
from your spirit.

320
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,560
Once you start doing that your tired feeling 
will go away.

321
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,640
Then your aggressiveness also will decrease 
and you’ll be amazed that you will just

322
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,919
watch the whole thing.

323
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,590
Neither you’ll aggress nor you’ll take 
aggression and the whole reaction will be

324
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,010
very different.

325
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:23,120
Then everything has a meaning, your feelings 
have a meaning.

326
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,780
Supposing you have a feeling today for Poland, 
which is in trouble, all of you should ask

327
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,700
just now, “Mother solve the problem of Poland."

328
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,990
Because I have no desires you see, I am desire 
less, you have to ask and it works, you’ll

329
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,580
be amazed because your attention is enlightened 
now, it just works.

330
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,010
You have to desire for it and it works.

331
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,010
You have to work for it and it works.

332
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:51,840
And so many miraculous things people will 
tell you just believe them that’s all true.

333
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:59,400
Money problem solved, because of Lakshmi Tattwa 
within, financial problems solved, social

334
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,850
problem solved, family problems solved because 
you are solved.

335
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,860
See in relation to you all everything seems 
problematic.

336
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,179
When your problems are solved everything is 
solved.

337
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,620
It’s so simple as that.

338
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:19,780
We have to solve ourselves and it is solved 
through the awakening of the Kundalini.

339
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:24,900
Now I would like to have some questions from 
you and then I would like you to go into groups

340
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,929
with the Sahaja Yogis and talk to them on 
intimate level and also you must tell Me your

341
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:32,929
problems.

342
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:35,679
If you have any intimate problems, you can 
talk to Me also.

343
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,610
But best is to talk to each other. 
I would like Warren to see to it that he organises

344
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,549
all these groups properly.

345
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:58,220
But I would love to have some questions from 
you about Sahaja Yoga now.

346
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,310
Question: How can one laugh at abortion.

347
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:09,760
He's talking about abortion, you are taking 
the view that it is bad?

348
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,240
Shri Mataji: I’m not saying you have to, 
I said you are not to laugh, means you laugh

349
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,530
at silly stupid things I meant, you see.

350
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:26,000
But at abortion as I can’t understand you 
see.

351
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,340
This is a very funny situation in this country.

352
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,520
As it is the birth rate is minus and you are 
having abortions.

353
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,120
Question: Does it exist in India much abortion

354
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,510
Shri Mataji: Not much, people don’t like 
it at all, they hate it.

355
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,650
And you know the trouble is like this.

356
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,650
You people are having no children so we have 
to have the load on us.

357
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,900
You see what to do?

358
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,260
Nobody to be born here, they don’t want 
to be born here because there is no love in

359
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,950
the heart.

360
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,059
See when the other day when somebody told 
Me about the doctors here some of them are

361
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,710
butchers I couldn’t believe it.

362
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,980
Because in India at least, doctors are not 
butchers by any chance.

363
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,730
I was surprised; this is because everything 
has become a butchery here, because the heart

364
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,760
is covered with ego.

365
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,330
There’s no heart left.

366
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,950
You have to raise the heart.

367
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:21,130
That’s important, once you raise the heart, 
you see you cannot stand all this nonsense,

368
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,130
you know.

369
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,160
Why do you want to have abortion I still can’t 
understand?

370
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,900
Question: Does it affect Swadisthan charka?

371
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,210
Shri Mataji: Oh, it affects many chakras, 
I mean.

372
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:37,880
There was someone I knew who always used to 
catch on right heart, I must tell you this,

373
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,130
very nice person, always on right heart.

374
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:47,400
His father was a good man everything was fine, 
asked him, “How are you catching on right

375
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,160
heart?” He was not married and when he came 
very close to Me then he confessed to Me that,

376
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:00,610
“I lived with a woman and she was going 
to have a baby and she went in for an abortion

377
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:04,910
and I conceded, and since then

378
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,669
I have been feeling very sad about the whole 
thing."

379
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:16,679
But the whole view about life has to be changed 
then only you can avoid these things.

380
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,309
You see it is a symptom of a disease.

381
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:25,419
It’s not the disease itself, abortion is 
not the disease, is a symptom of a disease.

382
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:32,560
Now what is the disease with in us is, is 
that, that we have allowed our sex to be let

383
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,120
loose completely, talking too much about sex 
from childhood.

384
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,710
What is the need to give education in sex, 
I’ve been failed to understand?

385
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:45,360
Openly, there’s no need to teach about, 
you see, do the animals need any sex education,

386
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,480
they still produce.

387
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:55,320
Then they told Me, “They tell about sex 
only because they think by telling about sex

388
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,179
they can protect people from not going into 
sex."

389
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:02,110
I said, “No, they create too much of curiosity 
in children."

390
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,620
For example, in India we never talk about 
sex to children, they do not know, they are

391
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,620
so innocent.

392
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,250
Even till the marriage takes place some of 
the girls do not know what sex actually is,

393
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,780
how it works out and all.

394
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:21,370
But they are told this is something filthy 
to do and all that and when the girl gets

395
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:27,210
into puberty it is told and to the boys also, 
somehow or other it is a very different society.

396
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,940
This question doesn’t come, it never comes 
into the head of the boys and girls.

397
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,690
You see if you keep them pure, like it doesn’t 
come in the head of a sister and a brother

398
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,929
even today, thank God.

399
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:44,440
Many sisters and brothers I should say despite 
Freud’s all efforts to spoil your minds,

400
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,900
but still there are brothers and sisters relations 
today.

401
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,480
In the same way it doesn’t come into their 
heads at all.

402
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,410
And when they get married they are to be told, 
this is what it is.

403
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:03,100
And that’s why they say these koarak and 
all these places were built where they could

404
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,650
take young brides and young people to see 
that.

405
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:14,090
This was called as Koomari Kar Temple, means 
the married women when they were not virgins

406
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:21,020
could go there and see those places to understand 
what is sex is and they got so exhausted with

407
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,450
this early sex life, I mean you go into all 
kinds of tantrums then.

408
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,540
Because you’re so exhausted then you go 
into perversions.

409
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,159
The basics are wrong.

410
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,770
We are trying too hard to be sexologists.

411
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:39,360
There’s no need to be sex points you are 
that already.

412
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,679
But you don’t want to be only sex points, 
do you?

413
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:55,321
I don’t know what makes you feel that that 
is the end of every, every endeavor, everything

414
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:56,500
should end up there.

415
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,559
May be that advertisement and all this is 
coming to you too much because they think

416
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,150
that by exploiting these things they will 
help you.

417
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:18,580
But it’s such a perverted thing and

418
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:33,600
Seeker interrupts and asks Shri Mataji about 
people in India being given a gift like a

419
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,360
transistor radio for sterilization.

420
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,660
Does it have a purpose?

421
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:47,830
It has a purpose to a point.....Oh I'm sorry 
this has another point....

422
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:52,610
He is talking about in India where they give 
a transistor radio....

423
00:32:52,610 --> 00:33:00,299
Shri Mataji: That’s what they try, this 
is also, you see western ideas coming to India.

424
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:03,720
Oh, they did all sorts just to sterilise them.

425
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,110
Oh! that’s how the lady lost her last election, 
last election she has now pulled her ears

426
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,110
for that.

427
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,640
You see, they are all westernised people you 
see, they try to try all these tricks in....

428
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,340
People don’t like it you see.

429
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:28,450
There’s a bridegroom who went for his wedding 
and poor thing saw that there was a team of

430
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,169
people standing there for sterilisation.

431
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:38,270
He jumped out of the bus and he disappeared 
forever, nobody knows where he is, disappeared.

432
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:44,630
‘And they even sterilised people who were 
very old and who were not even married you

433
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,630
see.

434
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,040
It’s so funny, so indiscriminate, I think 
they were possessed by some bhoots I don’t

435
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,400
know what to call them.

436
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:59,810
You see population is a problem in India but 
what to do now, you should solve the problem.

437
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,650
And there is something working out in a very 
funny way, I must tell you.

438
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,950
I went to Colombia, I found lots of these 
Norwegians carrying Colombian children with

439
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,950
them.

440
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,409
And they looked so different from Norwegian 
children, Norwegian people and these Colombian

441
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,409
children.

442
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,669
I asked them, “Why do you acquire these 
children where are you carrying them?

443
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,889
They said “We have adopted them”. 
I said, “Why don’t you produce your own?

444
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:25,710
That would be better, to produce your own."

445
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:32,540
"No we don’t want to go through the process 
of it, it’s better to have ready made."

446
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,960
So the supply has started in having all this 
in developing countries to give you ready

447
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
made children.

448
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,289
Isn’t if funny, it’s funny things going 
on, instant babies.

449
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:55,869
Question: If a chakra is blocked and you clean 
the chakras wouldn’t you being undoing the

450
00:34:55,869 --> 00:35:02,099
karmic cycle that a person has to go through?

451
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:08,211
Shri Mataji: Very good idea, Because I think 
you people...I know the question is this,

452
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:13,729
that he is saying that if you try to clean 
the chakras you will be undoing the karmic

453
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:20,759
cycle and all that you see this is the typical 
things that are being circulated in the west

454
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:21,779
you see.

455
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:26,890
That you have your own karmas you see and 
we are the gurus so you have to go through

456
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,930
your karmas, you must suffer for your karmas 
you see like that is there.

457
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,420
Now, this theory was all right before Christ 
came in, not after His coming.

458
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,749
And why are they here then?

459
00:35:39,749 --> 00:35:42,469
Why are we paying them, for what?

460
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,299
You better pickle them out.

461
00:35:44,299 --> 00:35:49,200
They’re worth nothing because they just 
take money from you, and we have to go through

462
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
our karmas.

463
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
They make you dance, jump go into all kinds 
of things.

464
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,279
Put spirits in us and say, “You are suffering 
your karmas.

465
00:35:56,279 --> 00:36:02,640
Why should we suffer?” At least they should 
suffer for our karma’s minimum of minimum.

466
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,769
Now Christ has done that for you.

467
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,170
He has taken all these karmas, your karmas 
upon Himself.

468
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:15,249
He has made way for us, that’s why you have 
to pass through Him.

469
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:22,890
Once you pass through Him, through Agnya chakra, 
your karmas are sucked in by Him, that’s

470
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,289
your ego.

471
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:29,099
It’s the only ego that says you have done 
this wrong, and that wrong.

472
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,829
You see an animal doesn’t think that way.

473
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:37,509
It thinks it’s it own sva bhavah the way 
it has to be.

474
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:42,130
But it’s only the human beings who think 
I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done that wrong.

475
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,250
I’ve done this good, that bad because we 
have ego.

476
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:55,190
But when your Kundalini passes through your 
Agnya chakra your ego is sucked in, your superego

477
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,190
is sucked in.

478
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,849
Christ has done double job in one shot you 
know, it’s great.

479
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:08,170
That’s why He was crucified, it was to be.

480
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:15,910
He took all your karmas upon Himself and put 
it into hell.

481
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:22,969
So what ever karmas you have done are all 
sucked in.

482
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:25,210
But the door must open fully.

483
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:30,529
In the beginning it happens that only a thread 
comes up, you see, and the ego is not fully

484
00:37:30,529 --> 00:37:34,640
sucked in so sometimes it still comes up and 
all that.

485
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,480
The best weapon to get rid of them is to forgive 
others.

486
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,299
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon Christ 
has given us, which we have to use, forgive,

487
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,220
forgive and forgive.

488
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:57,319
That’s a very good way, Lords Prayer is 
the solution for your Agnya charka, you’ll

489
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,400
be amazed.

490
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,960
You have to say Lords Prayer after realisation 
to open your Agnya.

491
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,170
Then you become thoughtlessly aware.

492
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,630
After realisation again I say, not before 
realisation, it has no meaning.

493
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,619
Before realisation what ever you have said 
has gone into karmas.

494
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:21,869
Only after realisation you are baptized and 
get an opening here and all your karmas pass

495
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:25,289
through that.

496
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:29,469
Also you will find when you get realisation 
lot of heat comes out these are the karmas

497
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:32,890
you see, that are coming out.

498
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,730
Let the heat go out and all karmas are finished.

499
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,430
It’s like that.

500
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,529
This is what is Self-Realisation.

501
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:51,190
Like an egg is in a egg shell is very different, 
but when it becomes a little chick and the

502
00:38:51,190 --> 00:39:01,239
mother breaks the tip of the egg a new bird 
comes out with out any karmas or the smell

503
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,489
of the egg.

504
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:08,710
So clean and nice, every thing converted into 
something beautiful.

505
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:14,930
It’s like that, this is the rebirth.

506
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,950
This is how we become a new personality a 
new being.

507
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,993
So to forget about your karmas after your 
realisation, all right.

508
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:25,849
He has said it

509
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:31,489
that, “He died for your sins."

510
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:34,440
Didn’t He?

511
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,569
And the wages of sin is fear.

512
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:42,420
If you still have fear within you of your 
karmas, you are still sinning.

513
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,349
There should be no fear about it.

514
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:52,039
Do not have any guilt, I’ve been telling 
you not to have any guilt.

515
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,010
What can you do?

516
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,010
What sins can you commit?

517
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,940
Do not have any fears.

518
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,380
This is very common as I told you the other 
day left Vishuddhi, I have to talk about it

519
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
quite a lot.

520
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,710
It’s so common, in Australia, in America 
and in all the western countries, to feel

521
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,710
guilty.

522
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:17,200
Everything collapses there and nobody can 
rise through the Agnya because it collapses

523
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,420
down here onto left Vishuddhi where you feel 
guilty.

524
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,440
What are you feeling guilty about?

525
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,430
And why did Christ come on this earth.

526
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,960
You are just wasting His incarnation by feeling 
guilty yourself.

527
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,599
He has taken all your guilt upon Himself.

528
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,869
What do you thing He was?

529
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:42,589
He was Omkara, he was Pranava, He was the 
word, He was that power.

530
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:52,810
He’s not attached to anything but He can 
take away everything that you think is sin,

531
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,799
because He’s sinless, He so pure, immaculate.

532
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:01,539
All right does that give you some hopes?

533
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:06,190
Or still you are indulging into your own miseries?

534
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,519
Question: Can You give us some guide about 
diet.

535
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,969
Shri Mataji: Diet?

536
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,969
All right.

537
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:17,349
This diet theory is also coming from some 
horrible Brahmins you see.

538
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,539
Don’t listen to them.

539
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:24,009
They are the greatest rakshasas ever born 
on this earth.

540
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:26,859
Devils, rakshasas are monsters.

541
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:32,391
They eat like hell, they eat such a lot and 
they always tell you, “Don’t do this and

542
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:36,789
don’t do that."

543
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:43,440
You can eat anything you like except don’t 
eat the meat of animals which are bigger than

544
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
you.

545
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,450
I mean other wise you will develop muscles 
which will have funny contours and things.

546
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:58,039
Eat animals which are smaller than you is 
the point is.

547
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:06,589
And if you eat those animals they do not also 
have much sense of compassion and all that.

548
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:11,170
It’s all right they are just like vegetables 
sort of things, so it doesn’t matter.

549
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:15,270
You don’t kill them, they are killed in 
the machine and all that, you have to eat

550
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,670
that, and you need it, you have to eat.

551
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,630
But that doesn’t mean that if you are vegetarians 
you should become non vegetarians.

552
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,829
It doesn’t mean that.

553
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:24,369
What ever you eat, you can eat.

554
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:28,390
Eating is not going to change your spirit.

555
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:41,049
Spirit doesn’t eat, it does not, makes no 
difference to the spirit except that, to your

556
00:42:41,049 --> 00:42:44,839
body which is the lamp.

557
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:48,959
So if you have to keep the wick all right, 
you have to keep the lamp all right and for

558
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:54,099
that don’t eat anything that is a very big 
animal compared to yourself.

559
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:58,410
Cows meat for example in India they don’t 
eat, because, “Have you ever seen Indian

560
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,690
cows they’re very gentle."

561
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:06,049
And the cows are in the house, just like mother 
they start giving milk to the children they

562
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,049
see.

563
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:10,930
Every day they are taking the milk of the 
cows so they develop a feeling, you see.

564
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,719
And that’s why they don’t drink, you see.

565
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,400
But it doesn’t mean that if your Australian 
cows are I don’t think are like that.

566
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,279
Because what I’ve seen they look like buffalos 
to Me sometimes.

567
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:30,140
Like My granddaughter, she came to England 
and she asked Me, “Mother, Grandmother,

568
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:34,960
why the buffalos in England are white?” 
Yes, so, it’s all right.

569
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,440
But you’ll come down on diet.

570
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,900
It will be different you see, you’ll see 
gradually.

571
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,579
But don’t worry about it.

572
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:45,200
Gradually everything drops out into very little 
things.

573
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,070
But you allow yourself to develop.

574
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,070
Question: Eggs?

575
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:49,070
And things like that?

576
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,190
Shri Mataji: Oh, eggs you better have, lots 
of it.

577
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,630
But if you have liver it’s not good to have 
eggs.

578
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,490
Eggs is very heating,, pork is otherwise good 
but not good for the people who have liver

579
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,490
problem.

580
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,869
See you must understand that every person 
is different.

581
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:04,660
Now today I met a lady who is very left sided.

582
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,019
So I had to tell her, “You eat pork, eggs 
everything.

583
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,529
You see it is how you are.

584
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:11,119
Even the Indian Ayurveda is like that.

585
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,359
They want to know the prakruti, the character 
of a person how he is.

586
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:19,459
We have evolved from different types of animals.

587
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:21,200
I saw the nocturnal ones.

588
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,640
You see the nocturnal ones must eat a lot 
of meats, those who have evolved from nocturnal

589
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,640
side, you see.

590
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,289
Left-sided, the ones who are afraid and frightened 
and who are not egoistical at all you see.

591
00:44:33,289 --> 00:44:38,450
Such types they should take more meats and 
things but those who are too much aggressive

592
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,799
better take to vegetables, is better.

593
00:44:40,799 --> 00:44:46,630
All right now, what’s the question?

594
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:56,750
Question: Does forgiveness stop the rich getting 
richer and the poor getting poorer?

595
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,759
Shri Mataji: It does absolutely, absolutely.

596
00:44:58,759 --> 00:45:03,480
Sahaja Yoga is the thing that balances the 
society.

597
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,969
Those who are poor become richer and the rich 
understand that they must share.

598
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:16,890
Willingly they start sharing their money.

599
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:20,940
But you become really rich in a very miraculous 
manner.

600
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,549
Now there’s a girl here and I would like 
her to tell you what happened to her, it’s

601
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:26,549
miraculous.

602
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:29,829
But she’s an Australian and she doesn’t 
tell lies you can see that very clearly and

603
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:33,329
she’ll tell you what happened to her.

604
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:38,779
Where is she gone?

605
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:42,430
Sharon come along..is she here?

606
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:51,200
No let her tell, is better, she’s Australian 
they’ll believe her more.

607
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,049
But never trust an Indian that’s even worse.

608
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:04,059
You know some of the gurus have introduced 
some Indian bhoots, Indian spirits into English

609
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:10,160
people, and Americans and also European and 
I find they behave just like Indians.

610
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,260
They’ll cheat, they embezzle, they’ll 
take away things, not the women, they’ll

611
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,089
not touch the women you see.

612
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:22,509
But they’ll touch the things they take away 
the empty cans, is typical Indian you see.

613
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:23,999
It’s rather

614
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:29,569
surprising, yes there are some, I’ve seen 
them like that.

615
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:35,119
It’s surprising to see such things happening 
to a western person who behaves just like

616
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,289
an Indian must be some possession of bhoots 
put by these gurus.

617
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:48,329
So if you believe Me then I can tell you what 
she’s told, it’s really miraculous, very

618
00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:50,089
miraculous, you see.

619
00:46:50,089 --> 00:46:56,190
Cheryl was telling Me that she wanted to come 
to India and she had no money.

620
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:06,789
So her daughter was very anxious to come to 
India and they didn’t know what to do, they

621
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:07,789
didn’t have sufficient money.

622
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:15,789
So they just said, “Mother we want to come 
to India can you arrange it for us, that’s

623
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:16,789
all."

624
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:20,930
And it so happened that this girl had taken 
a trinket she had in the house, a bracelet

625
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,670
to the school for a sale, whenever they have 
the fetes all over.

626
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:29,299
So she took that for the fete and the teacher 
said, “I think this is gold."

627
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:32,059
She couldn’t believe it.

628
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:36,809
She brought it home and they got it valued 
and they found that the price of the thing

629
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:41,209
was equal to what they had to spend for both 
of them travels.

630
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:43,059
But this is nothing.

631
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:46,569
And then she got some money from somewhere 
in the house, somewhere I don’t know how

632
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:49,539
she got some money and she didn’t sell even 
the bracelet.

633
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,700
And that’s still there she said, “For 
the next trip."

634
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,460
I said, “I hope so, you sell it."

635
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,460
“May not."

636
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:02,450
Like that you see, things work out, because 
your Laxshmi Tattawa, your centre of well

637
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:05,430
being gets enlightened and then you are looked 
after.

638
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,150
So many things happen.

639
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:14,029
Like today they told Me so many things of 
this kind happening to them and I too.

640
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:19,499
You see when these people came in, I had told 
them all right, you give Me so much money

641
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,900
may be required for your stay there.

642
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,289
Very little it was, very little for them to 
be there in India after all, you see India

643
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:30,109
is also now becoming very expensive.

644
00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,009
And when I went to India I had discovered 
it had become very expensive, doesn’t matter

645
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:35,289
I said, “I’ll put it in the bank.

646
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:36,709
“Let it be there."

647
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:42,910
And anybody ask Me, “Have it, you want it, 
have it, now spend go,” and it was all right.

648
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:48,459
I could manage, see that’s what he did, 
and so many of them have done it.

649
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:49,759
It’s looked after.

650
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:55,710
You go to right places, you get right things, 
don’t spend too much, you do not repent

651
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:01,519
for spending and you feel happy for whatever 
you have.

652
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,339
You feel very joyous, not worried about counting 
but if you make a budget you had it.

653
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:13,190
You don’t worry your head about budgeting, 
how much your going to spend, you’ll be

654
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,190
surprised.

655
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,170
You won’t go to things which are unnecessary, 
useless but you’ll buy something that is

656
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:23,410
very good and ultimately these things will 
be very precious for you to sell.

657
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,519
Many things have happened like that.

658
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:30,769
Many things have happened.

659
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:34,930
Question: Why is Australia important for the 
future?

660
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,160
Maybe about Shri Ganesha?

661
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,459
Shri Mataji: Only thing I don’t want to 
pamper the ego.

662
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:46,400
Question: Is Australia blessed?

663
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,660
Shri Mataji: Very much, very much blessed.

664
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:58,809
It’s a very much blessed place, specially 
created.

665
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:08,309
Australia was the first continent to be created 
and if I dare to answer this question, I hope

666
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:13,849
you’ll believe Me and not get into ego trips.

667
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:28,309
Australia is a place which is described in 
the ancient Puranas that a great saint was

668
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:36,130
sent to Australia and another heaven was created.

669
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:46,029
And that saint is called as Thrishanku which 
is your Southern Cross...what do you call

670
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:47,959
that?

671
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:52,119
That shows the Southern Cross and you can 
only see Southern Cross from Australia.

672
00:50:52,119 --> 00:51:03,150
This is one of the Puranas, the Vedas have 
also mentioned this and even before that Australia

673
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,069
is the place which has the Ganesha.

674
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:13,450
The first is the Mooladhara Chakra, the first 
centre is in Australia.

675
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,549
How much wise you should be.

676
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:23,410
Did you hear Me?

677
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:32,009
Question: She wanted your opinion about the 
Australian aboriginals.

678
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:39,599
Shri Mataji: Oh, they must have been good 
people to begin with, I am sure of it.

679
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:48,500
They must have been very good and holy people 
and nice people but I think later on they

680
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:56,999
deviated because of too much jungles and things 
you know, they started feeling the fear of

681
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:58,359
the nature too much.

682
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:06,380
They must have worshiped things, which were 
good to begin with and later on to some things

683
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:09,160
like spirits and this.

684
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:15,400
More over the dead bodies the way they disposed 
of must have been something wrong.

685
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:24,680
So maybe they might have gone into a left 
sided action into primitive ways of exciting

686
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,680
these bhoots

687
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,390
and things, spirits and spiritualism and all 
that.

688
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:33,710
But in Australia must be the minimum, in Africa 
is horrible.

689
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:39,489
African countries have too much of it but 
it should be the minimum of minimum because

690
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:45,279
you see, Ganesha’s chakra is connected with 
the left side, you see is more on the left

691
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:46,779
side isn’t it?

692
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:54,589
So also one can go drift more on to the left 
side that is what it is.

693
00:52:54,589 --> 00:53:01,069
And even today I feel there’s kind of a 
lurking inferiority complex that works in

694
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:02,069
Australians.

695
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:06,589
They try to copy the west, there’s nothing 
to copy there, they’ve nothing sensible.

696
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:08,779
They have to learn from you.

697
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:12,769
You see this is a little inferiority complex 
we have that all the best things are in the

698
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:13,769
west.

699
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:18,299
That’s wrong, you are much better of in 
so many ways.

700
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,950
At least you’ve not lost your moorings.

701
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:27,690
So I would not pass a general remark about 
a community as such but there is a possibility

702
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,450
that they can come up very well too.

703
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:31,930
I mean they can get out of all that left-sidedness.

704
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:40,160
In India also we have big communities in the 
south where people have lived with too much

705
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,769
ritualism and all that and have taken to left-sided 
behaviour of attracting you know spirits and

706
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:49,249
this and that, and giving those [telesmart?] 
and all that.

707
00:53:49,249 --> 00:53:54,529
They have done all that they are doing, like 
witchcraft, witch doctors and all that.

708
00:53:54,529 --> 00:53:59,440
They must be doing it, but it can be cured 
there’s no problem.

709
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,220
As the west, people are over developed and 
very ego orientated and right side.

710
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,699
Both are extreme cases, but you can be correct.

711
00:54:08,699 --> 00:54:14,359
The people who are left side it’s easier 
because they have to move forward but it’s

712
00:54:14,359 --> 00:54:16,940
difficult for ego orientated to move backwards.

713
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,809
But if we can do that there why not here, 
so nothing is lost.

714
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:24,690
One should not worry too much about these 
things.

715
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,109
Human begins are just the same everybody has 
Kundalini, finished.

716
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:39,209
As long as you have Kundalini I have no problem.

717
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:43,549
Question: Is there anything wrong with eating 
chilies?

718
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:47,309
Shri Mataji: No, it suits some people very 
much.

719
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:51,920
Some people should have, those who suffer 
from colds will be a good idea, suffer from

720
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,809
constipation is a good idea.

721
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:55,940
But don’t eat too much of anything.

722
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:01,099
But it’s good for some people, something 
is good for some people, something is good

723
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,779
for some people, you have to just find out.

724
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:07,229
For people who get constipated it is better 
to have a little of green chilies all the

725
00:55:07,229 --> 00:55:10,280
time, it is very rich in vitamin C.

726
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:21,130
It is very rich in vitamin C is good for people 
who catch colds very easily.

727
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:27,779
Question: Do you know anything about the teaching 
called Mahikari

728
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:30,719
Shri Mataji: I know.

729
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:40,390
You see Mahikari thing was, the person who 
started Mahikari was a realised soul, though

730
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,210
not so well equipped.

731
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:50,209
I’ve met him before his realisation and 
he got realisation I think through Me only,

732
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:51,259
what ever it was.

733
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:54,119
I do not want to claim anything like that.

734
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,200
But only thing is he was not equipped, well 
equipped.

735
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,329
Like anybody here who gets realisation starts 
doing something.

736
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:03,809
And his daughter I think, mislead the people 
because she’s not a realised soul.

737
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:09,029
She became very money-orientated, she started 
putting it, it’s happened with every one

738
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:10,029
of them.

739
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:15,890
But poor thing, this one was not, he just 
got realisation he was not an incarnation

740
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,890
also, you see.

741
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:26,579
Even incarnations who came on this earth like 
Christ you see, like Mohammad Sahab, like

742
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:31,939
Rama, Krishna see such great incarnations 
were purest of pure.

743
00:56:31,939 --> 00:56:38,749
Even those people have been mishandled and 
people have raised organisations, which are

744
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:41,199
just money making propositions.

745
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:42,859
Everything some how man makes into money.

746
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:47,939
I don’t know how, it’s something that 
happens to human beings you see.

747
00:56:47,939 --> 00:56:53,349
Then they start giving [Telesmart?] then they 
start giving this, that, cross, this I mean

748
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:55,529
it’s a money-making proposition through 
out.

749
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:59,559
You see this is the trouble.

750
00:56:59,559 --> 00:57:04,720
Warren: She said you are right.

751
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,499
Shri Mataji: And you may lose lots of your 
powers, even ordinary, normal powers with

752
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:22,029
this kind of a wrong attitude you see, or 
misguidance, because it happens like that,

753
00:57:22,029 --> 00:57:24,630
you can make mistakes, you can do so many 
things.

754
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:32,380
You know I’ve seen people, one girl whom 
I had given realisation she went to a lady

755
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,769
who was a medium.

756
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:37,019
She used to get “Ho, ho, ho, ho,” like 
that, and this thing.

757
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:38,019
And she

758
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:41,499
gave her a talisman and she became actually 
blind, actually blind.

759
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:47,690
Now she’s blind, her eyes are open, I mean 
I have to still cure her.

760
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:51,439
This is the report I got about her.

761
00:57:51,439 --> 00:57:55,758
Question: Would you say the same of the Hari 
Krishna Organisation?

762
00:57:55,758 --> 00:57:57,589
Shri Mataji: Oh, now you are pulling Me into 
controversy.

763
00:57:57,589 --> 00:58:01,839
But I will tell you the other way round.

764
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:07,749
You see if you go on calling say the name 
of anybody, even your name would you like

765
00:58:07,749 --> 00:58:08,749
it?

766
00:58:08,749 --> 00:58:11,119
So then how can God like it?

767
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:19,039
On the Oxford Street you stand up, you should 
see the site, they even sell those things

768
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,769
see like wigs, they sell them like wigs in 
the market.

769
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:27,739
They shave off and sometimes they wear wigs.

770
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:33,170
See it’s not show, it is something that 
has to happen within.

771
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:38,599
It’s not the show that you put up is something 
that has to happen.

772
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:45,479
You see most of them end up with throat cancer 
and very violent, very violent people.

773
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:49,910
They are beggars’ absolute parasites.

774
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,329
Warren: with expensive cars.

775
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:59,999
Shri Mataji: You see this is very nice, 
I met somebody in England and I told him,

776
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:02,469
“What do you do here?” He said, “I deal 
in opium."

777
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:06,780
I got a fright. 
I said, “Opium, how do you deal in opium?”

778
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,369
“Other people’s money,” 
I said, “That’s very good, other people’s

779
00:59:10,369 --> 00:59:11,369
money."

780
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:12,519
You see you can float an enterprise.

781
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:19,589
It’s very easy because you are such seekers 
such great seekers of ages and you are so

782
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,279
naïve, very good.

783
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:28,819
You go anywhere they’ll take a square, sit 
there with saffron cloths with some circles

784
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,939
on, another fellow will be fanning.

785
00:59:30,939 --> 00:59:35,719
Oh this one is very great, coming direct from 
Kashi.

786
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:37,809
Then have nothing to do with horrible people.

787
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:42,609
Kashi is one of the worst places now.

788
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:46,999
So you all go and prostrate.

789
00:59:46,999 --> 00:59:48,319
This is what it is.

790
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:53,650
I mean, why are you enamoured by these circuses, 
aren’t you fed up with them?

791
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:59,650
We had a lady from Norway, this one was very 
interesting.

792
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:04,190
She came to My house stayed with Me, very 
badly caught up, and she told Me the story

793
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,789
of a lama who came to Norway.

794
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:10,640
First he told all these Norwegians, “You 
see, if I have to come to Norway you have

795
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,459
to make a place with the floor which has got 
all marble."

796
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:15,619
Look at that.

797
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,949
They’re such parasites these Lamas are.

798
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:23,390
First they have sucked the blood of these 
poor Tibetans and now they were willing to

799
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,670
suck the blood of these Norwegians.

800
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:29,640
Now these poor young people you see, I should 
say the young people in the west are really

801
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,709
not rich because they’re parents do not 
give them money the way we give our children

802
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:35,709
you see.

803
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:41,680
So they starve themselves, they ate only potatoes 
and this and that and for one year they starved

804
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,279
themselves to create this floor for these 
horrible people.

805
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:49,640
And this fellow came you see, with his shaved 
head and all that.

806
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:57,819
He stayed there and this lady told Me that 
she had to go and just bow to him one thousand

807
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,380
times for three months.

808
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,539
One thousand times.

809
01:01:00,539 --> 01:01:06,109
Imagine, just to go, as it is he’ll be finished, 
even three times is sufficient to finish you

810
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,759
off.

811
01:01:07,759 --> 01:01:09,599
And three months she did it.

812
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,920
And with Me she was arguing morning till evening.

813
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,269
I said, “Look at that, her arguing with 
Me, eating My head off and here your bowing

814
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:20,269
to him."

815
01:01:20,269 --> 01:01:24,670
They would not allow anybody to go near the 
lama, the great was sitting on the seventh

816
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:27,799
step somewhere hanging in the air.

817
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:37,109
Is very common you know, the more you are 
missing from the scene the more you are difficult

818
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:38,969
to be seen you see.

819
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:42,130
Is something great, “Oh, ho! I’ve seen 
the glimpse of that

820
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,119
horrible thing,” that’s what people think.

821
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:50,680
You see this is what they play upon you emotional, 
what you call it emotional blackmail.

822
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,839
That’s what it is.

823
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,660
They will tell you first of all they’re, 
we call them chumchars, we call them spoons.

824
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:00,369
They’ll come and tell you, “Oh this is 
very difficult, you know.

825
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:09,619
He may not give you any interview, and you 
have to at least you should shell out five

826
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:14,529
hundred rupees, see it is not easy, it’s 
very difficult.

827
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:21,529
Only you should send your photograph with 
five hundred,” all this nonsense.

828
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:27,930
If you are the river Ganges, what can malign 
you, what can dirty you, what can make you

829
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,049
impure?

830
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:33,420
If you are here for purification then nothing 
can impure you.

831
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:41,449
One two three four, now the one who has not 
asked at all should ask

832
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:43,679
Question: Over the years it seems we have 
lost our power to believe in our self that

833
01:02:43,679 --> 01:03:10,000
we had in Egyptian times the power to believe 
in ourselves but we went wrong..

834
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,529
Warren: the question is the loss of power 
within ourselves, perhaps back in the days

835
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:25,160
of Egypt we had these powers, we seem to have 
lost our power to believe in ourself.

836
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:30,750
Shri Mataji: I don’t know even if at that 
time you had those powers very much.

837
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:36,859
But Egyptians indulged more on the ego side 
you see, those who were rulers.

838
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:42,390
And the slaves were on the left hand side 
too much because they obeyed the rulers you

839
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,390
see.

840
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:47,660
So the sensitivity came to them from spirits, 
not directly from themselves.

841
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:54,259
And some of them were really, very realised 
souls and you’ll be amazed if these extreme

842
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:58,380
cases are there they understand an incarnation 
better.

843
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:05,999
Say if you are taking LSD too much, you will 
see only lights coming out of Me, you won’t

844
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:06,999
see Me.

845
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:11,559
There are many who must have seen that, auras 
and things, if you are on the right hand side

846
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:12,650
too much.

847
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:17,059
If you are on the left had side you’ll be 
awed, you’ll be shaking before Me and you

848
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:21,880
may see My previous births and you’ll be 
quite frightened because you’ll know what

849
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,880
it is.

850
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,339
So they understood the incarnations better, 
but evolutionary you are much higher than

851
01:04:29,339 --> 01:04:30,619
they are.

852
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:38,749
Though there’s confusion because of so called 
freedom you had which you misused.

853
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:45,249
But as a whole I think this is the time for 
blossom.

854
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:52,140
Only thing you must know that you’re a seeker 
and you are a seeker then you must get it

855
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,529
and if you get it why should you be surprised.

856
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:01,650
But it’s like a seeking has become like 
a fashion, seeking here, seeking there seeking

857
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:03,479
there, seeking you stop no where you see.

858
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:08,079
You see you go on fixing the bolts you see, 
you’re just going with an inertia, even

859
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:10,549
if you stop fixing you still go on like that.

860
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:16,319
It’s like that, you see, it’s a style 
you have developed going from this to that,

861
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:21,309
that to that, that to that and you cannot 
stop it.

862
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:42,180
Question: I’d be interested in Your opinion 
of philosophy for Rudolf Steiner and secondly

863
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:53,079
you concept of Papa tax sungar in India.

864
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:58,920
All these are all people playing on bhoots 
and things, that’s all I can say.

865
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:07,109
(Shri Mother asks the seeker what does Steiner 
say and he says million words.)

866
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:14,890
Word, words, words and words, what does he 
say?

867
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:29,369
This Steiner his vibrations are very good, 
Might be a realised soul but what does he

868
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:31,349
say?

869
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:51,140
Seekers tries to tell Shri Mataji what he 
writes about.

870
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:58,650
He might be a realised soul like Khalil Gibran 
is, you see his vibrations are good.

871
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,920
He might be, but still you have to become 
realised souls you see.

872
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:05,349
Reading that even Zen is all that.

873
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,799
Zen is everything is, nothing but his realisation.

874
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:14,549
But you’ll be amazed that the head of Zen 
himself reads all Zen without being realised,

875
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:16,959
and he’s a hopeless fellow.

876
01:07:16,959 --> 01:07:19,489
I just talked to him and he said, “Oh, he 
cannot get realisation."

877
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:20,520
He’s confirmed on that point.

878
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,490
Imagine the head of the Zen saying that, and 
he said we had kashapas only twenty six kashapas

879
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:29,750
we had in six centuries can you believe it.

880
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,910
And he wouldn’t take his realisation and 
he was so frightened.

881
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:37,189
He accepted Me all right but he said, “I 
am nowhere, Mother, compared to You."

882
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:38,189
“What is this?

883
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:39,739
But I am telling you can get."

884
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:41,420
Warren: Steiner catches on Agnya and swadisthan.

885
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:46,089
Shri Mataji: So it’s good to read somebody 
who is a realised soul, but you better get

886
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,089
it yourself.

887
01:07:47,089 --> 01:07:50,640
You become Steiner, all right.

888
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:55,569
What I’m saying, you become a realised soul.

889
01:07:55,569 --> 01:08:01,039
And you can write about your own experiences.

890
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,150
Yes, please.

891
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:13,009
Question: Seeker asks about opinion of Dadaji.

892
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:15,910
Shri Mataji: Dadaji, he’s arrested.

893
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,660
Warren: In Calcutta

894
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,150
Shri Mataji: He’s already in jail.

895
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:26,410
No, he was in Pune where he was arrested, 
this Dadaji.

896
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:30,270
This happened about I think, I don’t know, 
but I heard about it.

897
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:33,150
I don’t know when it happened.

898
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:38,490
No it was not because of any political thing.

899
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:44,260
But they found some income tax things and 
all that and lots of, I don’t know, I didn’t

900
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,050
pay much attention but he’s arrested that 
I know.

901
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:58,470
There are these sorts of things but the best 
part of the thing is that all that is untruth

902
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,900
is exposed, gradually.

903
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:05,190
Whatever things they may put out, whatever 
story they may put out, whatever they may

904
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:09,620
try, they may entice you, you may be interested 
in them whatever it is.

905
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,740
But they themselves meet their end.

906
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:20,500
Because all that is falsehood has an end and 
truth is endless, it is anand, it is eternal.

907
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,100
The truth is eternal.

908
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,850
Question: What do you see as the future of 
the United Nations?

909
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,299
Shri Mataji: That’s a tricky question.

910
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:35,190
My husband is one of the secretary generals.

911
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,200
I better not speak all right.

912
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,900
Let it be.

913
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:46,400
We’ll see about it, work it out.

914
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,560
Some tricks we have to play.

915
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,760
Question: Do you know of Krishnamurti?

916
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:58,980
Shri Mataji: Oh, very much, he’s another 
one.

917
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,240
Krishnamurti is another blah, blah, blah.

918
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,650
I’ll tell you about Krishnamurti very well.

919
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:07,330
You see what Krishnamurti does?

920
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:12,650
He says this part what I say that “There 
are false gurus."

921
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:15,980
But I don’t say there are not real ones.

922
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,560
If there is falsehood, if there’s artificiality, 
there has to be real.

923
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,820
If there are artificial flowers there has 
to be a real flower, too.

924
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:29,001
So he negates you from the other side completely 
and he puts up your ego by saying, “Oh you

925
01:10:29,001 --> 01:10:30,090
can find it,” so you are finished.

926
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:34,400
He’s a blind leading others into blindness.

927
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:45,360
(Delete-Yogi relates story of a seeker about 
his meeting with Krishnamurti to Shri Mataji.

928
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:55,370
He saw him personally asks him “why do you 
do what you do” and Krishnamurti said, “Does

929
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:57,070
a rose ask why?”)

930
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:03,110
Shri Mataji: I mean it has no awareness, simple 
answer is as that.

931
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:05,670
A rose has no awareness.

932
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,260
By any chance he’s not a rose.

933
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,340
he’s just thorns that’s what I know.

934
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,671
Those who have come from him have had a very 
bad time I must tell you.

935
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:18,560
You see they are really so depressed and so 
horrid.

936
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,949
We had one architect; I mean his life was 
finished.

937
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:27,570
So many of them I’ve met, horrible they’re 
very argumentative.

938
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:32,340
The best example I’ll give you about this 
because you’ve brought forth.

939
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:45,550
There was a fellow who came to see Me, he’s 
the grandson of his guru.

940
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:54,430
His guru was Yogananda, Yogananda, the Kriya 
yogis, you see.

941
01:11:54,430 --> 01:12:04,410
He was the grandson of the Dadaji or something, 
Babaji, called Dadaji then Babaji

942
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:06,070
are there.

943
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:14,220
This Babaji, his grandson, you see, his Yogananda’s 
guru was somebody else, and he was the son

944
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:20,640
of this fellow, but I mean the grandson of 
his guru, so the great grandson of Babaji.

945
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:27,260
So the whole family was Kriya and he did all 
the Kriya Yoga and everything he did.

946
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,430
He went there and he got so frightened.

947
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:37,030
One day he happened to see this Krishnamurti 
that there should be no he said, “No Kriya

948
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:42,100
and all that, you see, that you are your own 
guru,” and this and that."

949
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,240
So he said, “Oh God, what have I been doing?” 
So he gave up Kriya Yoga and came to Mr.

950
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,960
Krishnamurti. 
He said, “I became such an expert that I

951
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,610
spoke better than Krishnamurti did."

952
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:55,540
And everybody was surprised and said, “Second 
Krishnamurti is coming and I ran away for

953
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,540
there.

954
01:12:56,540 --> 01:13:00,540
I said, “Now this is that thing is happening 
to Me.

955
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:04,710
And he came to Me, you’ll be amazed I’ve 
not been able to give him realisation till

956
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:05,710
today.

957
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:08,220
I must tell you this, he comes to Me still 
often.

958
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,870
Often, very often he comes to Me.

959
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,850
I’ve not yet given him realisation.

960
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:16,450
Imagine the grandson of this Babaji has to 
bear I don’t know what things, poor things

961
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:22,030
has been done to him, I ‘m very sorry for 
him.

962
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:25,470
Question: Do you know Rajneesh?

963
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:29,590
Shri Mataji: He’s another horrible one.

964
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:37,230
Why do you need a guru for such a thing?

965
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:40,380
You are masters, he’s a fool, he doesn’t 
know compared to what you know.

966
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:46,480
But you see what you thought of, that inside 
you are human beings, you feel guilty that

967
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,520
you talk of sex with animals, sex with this, 
this, that.

968
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,540
If there’s something lurking in you, there’s 
something wrong in all this perversion and

969
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,190
homosexuality this that and all that.

970
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:00,570
So you thought it better to have a guru at 
least he’ll certify.

971
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:05,230
But he is going to make you take two running 
jumps to go to hell, I tell you.

972
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:10,980
And he talks, just there and he talks, “That 
you’ll go to bottomless pit,” in the bible

973
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,490
a bottomless pit is the hell.

974
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,940
You see he’s very honest in a way, he says 
so.

975
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,230
He said, “You’ll go to bottomless pit."

976
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:24,010
He has criticised Christ to such an extent 
that he said that Christ had bad relations

977
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,450
with his own Mother.

978
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:30,870
Oh to that extent, he said about Mohammad 
having bad relation with his daughter.

979
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:35,650
All sorts of things he is talking and you 
know people publish it.

980
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,490
He’s getting such a publicity.

981
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:43,860
He pays money to people that they write against 
Me and doing all kinds of things.

982
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:49,300
Indians don’t like him at all, at all, they 
hate him, they want him to get out but he’s

983
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,040
so localised he cannot smell a flower and 
he calls himself Bhagavan, means God.

984
01:14:52,040 --> 01:15:01,340
In the book you see, anywhere you read, any 
Indian book where they have described God,

985
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:06,940
the names of God, they’re thousand names 
supposing, of Vishnu or of the Goddess, anything.

986
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,120
At least fifteen or twenty of them are that 
they are fond of flowers, they’re fond of

987
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,480
fragrance, they’re fragrant.

988
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:17,910
That they’re fond of Kamalas, Champas they’re 
fond this that all is there and this fellow

989
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:22,900
cannot see, if you show a flower to him he’ll 
run away.

990
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:29,340
He cannot bear to have any incense being burnt 
anywhere.

991
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,510
When you go there you they see and you can 
only put phenyl to go and see him.

992
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,440
I think he’s a bathroom cleaner, that’s 
what he is.

993
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,470
The way he’s so much afraid.

994
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:44,400
I don’t know what he likes the bathroom 
smell.

995
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,820
And he does all dirty things, very dirty fellow, 
is filthy I don’t want to tell you what

996
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:54,650
he does but I know what he does.

997
01:15:54,650 --> 01:16:05,440
Question: Could you explain the meaning of 
satoori and samadhi.

998
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,490
Shri Mataji:That’s Zen.

999
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:17,850
You see Zen satoori is the same as samadhi 
but it’s a, you see the Zen were as I told

1000
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:24,210
you in six centuries were twenty-six and whatever 
they wrote people never understood you see.

1001
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:29,160
Because they were realised souls, some of 
them were born realised, some got realisation.

1002
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,880
Now even when you will talk people won’t 
understand you, it’s a very surprise thing.

1003
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,750
But it happens like that because your language 
changes.

1004
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:40,690
Now they call it satoori is a samadhi but

1005
01:16:40,690 --> 01:16:48,190
it’s not so clearly given, they could not 
explain so clearly about it not properly to

1006
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:51,460
people, it’s not so clear cut.

1007
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:57,610
Now in our Sahaja Yoga we have first of all 
Nirvichara samadhi.

1008
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:02,050
Samadhi, dhi means awareness, and samadhi 
means enlightened awareness.

1009
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,720
Nirvichara means thoughtless.

1010
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,970
Thoughtless enlightened awareness is first 
thing, is clear.

1011
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:12,690
Sahaja Yoga is very clear cut practical, every 
word of it.

1012
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:16,060
You see it so clearly there’s no vagueness 
about it.

1013
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:20,410
Even you’ll understand Bible better, Zen 
better, everything better if you know Sahaja

1014
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:23,960
Yoga because your eyes are open to it, all 
right.

1015
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,590
So the first thing is Nirvichara Samadhi.

1016
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:36,300
With Nirvichara Samadhi when it crosses your 
Agnya chakra you get Nirvichara, means when

1017
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,960
your ego is pulled down.

1018
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:39,530
With that you get powers.

1019
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,940
Like you see if you become a deputy governor 
you get powers if you become a governor you

1020
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:43,940
get powers.

1021
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:47,250
The first powers you get is curative powers.

1022
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,770
You get cured and you can cure others.

1023
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:55,260
Many people whom I have cured are not Sahaja 
yogis they’re useless people actually.

1024
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,400
I’ve given up curing people for the same 
reason because they just come for cures they

1025
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,400
get cured and lost.

1026
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,490
What’s the use of curing people who are 
not going to give the light?

1027
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:07,720
You see you don’t repair lights which are 
not going to work out.

1028
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,780
It’s a horrible stuff you see, curing people, 
but you do cure.

1029
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:17,040
You start curing people automatically with 
raising [sounds like das?] not with spirit.

1030
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,170
There are another faith healers and all that 
nonsense is not there.

1031
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:26,270
Also Kundalini can rise to a point with a 
person like that.

1032
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,350
But one should not stay at that point must 
go higher.

1033
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:35,710
Because the movement on right and left you 
start getting either supra conscious or your

1034
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:42,710
subconscious experiences which can be very 
alluring and you can be quite lost in them.

1035
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:49,510
You start seeing lights, you start seeing 
something different, you might see an aura

1036
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:50,510
around Me.

1037
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:55,940
I mean you see lots of things, you may see 
something else in My past , that should not

1038
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,940
be there.

1039
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,940
You should forget about it.

1040
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:02,290
You have to go to the airport to catch the 
plane isn’t it, so don’t see all the things

1041
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:04,920
around, it’s all not wanted.

1042
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,630
Many people get lost at that point when they 
stop at Agnya, if you have concentrated here

1043
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:15,030
this can happen more because this is broken 
or if you have had this third eye business

1044
01:19:15,030 --> 01:19:17,270
and all that you may go to the side.

1045
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:19,110
It can be quite dangerous.

1046
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:28,440
You see if you use these your samadhi for 
some sort of a sensation.

1047
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,210
So you should not.

1048
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:38,520
I mean all wise people should not use this 
movement at all, as far as possible say, “No

1049
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,540
we don’t want to see that.

1050
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,950
We don’t want to have any supra conscious 
sensation,” and all that.

1051
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:51,690
Then you rise higher and then you try to feel 
your silence in the limbic area and you have

1052
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,970
to feel your vibrations coming out from your 
head.

1053
01:19:53,970 --> 01:20:00,130
It is the vibrations when they are flowing 
that’s the best stage, when you have pierced

1054
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,630
through your Bramarundra.

1055
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:06,510
So the second stage starts from Nirvikalpa 
Samadhi growing into, which many of the Sahaja

1056
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:14,750
Yogis have achieved in Australia, is called 
as Nirvikalpa, where the is no doubts.

1057
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,060
You have no doubts left about Sahaja Yoga, 
you have no doubts left about yourself.

1058
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,550
It’s a state, it’s not that by mentally 
or rationally but it’s a state.

1059
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:28,220
Where you see it so clearly, white is white, 
you don’t have to doubt that whether my

1060
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,680
eyes are showing white or black, you see.

1061
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:35,640
That state is reached is called as Nirvikalpa 
where the no vikalpa, you just go, move steadily

1062
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:40,470
and that’s the best stage where you really 
grow faster because you’re so steady and

1063
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:42,080
that stage must be achieved.

1064
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,650
So try to achieve that stage through negating 
things, “Nethi, nethi, vachinay nigamoor,”

1065
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:54,630
by saying, “Not this, not this, not this,” 
and you reach that stage, is very clearly

1066
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:55,630
given.

1067
01:20:55,630 --> 01:21:02,940
You see the trouble is, so many of these books 
which are so great are never translated, people

1068
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:03,940
do not know about them.

1069
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:09,270
Now after coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be 
exposed to them and you will see what truths

1070
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:22,130
there are and how Sahaja Yoga verifies it 
and proves it.

1071
01:21:22,130 --> 01:21:26,500
Question: What influence are you likely to 
have on those around him or on people who

1072
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,540
live with You who are not realised.

1073
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:36,790
What is the realised souls influence in that 
type of environment?

1074
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:45,830
Shri Mataji:You see if you have stones and 
if you have living trees, stones do not receive

1075
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:51,840
anything from the sun but the leaves receive 
something isn’t it, they are more sensitive,

1076
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,190
that’s the difference.

1077
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:58,790
Then in Sahaja yoga there’s a possibility 
that you can convert stones into living beings,

1078
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:00,630
can be done.

1079
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:10,550
Yes, because they see, you see they see you, 
they understand the value that you are, gradually,

1080
01:22:10,550 --> 01:22:16,330
rationally they start understanding then they 
reach certain conclusions, then they come

1081
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:20,540
to Sahaja Yog, then they get realised, it 
works out that way.

1082
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:24,450
But with seekers it’s very different, seekers 
just jump into it.

1083
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:26,980
They do not think about it they just get it.

1084
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:31,560
They get it so fast that they don’t think 
about it, they just they get it.

1085
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:39,140
So they are so sensitive that’s the difference.

1086
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:49,550
Question: Can we help our loved ones who do 
not want to listen to anything particularly

1087
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:51,220
about Sahaja Yoga?

1088
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:56,960
Shri Mataji: You see there’s nobody else 
that you help someone, they are all within

1089
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,960
yourself.

1090
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,810
On the contrary, I would say better to have 
them together who are Sahaja yogis because

1091
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,910
those who are not will trouble you, it will 
be a problem, leave them alone, they’ll

1092
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:08,540
be all right, they’ll come round.

1093
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:13,650
Let them come on their own you cannot force 
them, they’re loved ones, you’ll change

1094
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:18,940
now your priorities, you’ll understand that 
those who are really loved ones are not really

1095
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,100
your brothers and sisters.

1096
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:28,500
As Christ has said, “Who are my brothers 
and sisters?” Now we have to ask that question.

1097
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,380
Because you speak another language, you are 
a different person, not that you give them

1098
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:34,360
up, but they exist.

1099
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,870
But they haven’t got your awareness so is 
a different thing all together.

1100
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:43,840
But you help them in a way, gradually they 
see you but if you force them they’ll run

1101
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,840
away.

1102
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:48,970
No use forcing or telling them anything about 
it but you show your satisfaction and happiness

1103
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:54,640
and your growth and others get impressed by 
it and they just come to you.

1104
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:59,970
Question: how can you..Do You help them?

1105
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:02,750
Shri Mataji: Yes, I do.

1106
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:06,290
But you should put them out of your minds 
and say, “Mother, You help.

1107
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:20,560
If You try to help, then I’ll leave it to 
You."

1108
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:26,020
Question: He cannot understand why You say 
that Christ died for us.

1109
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,320
Why did He die for us?

1110
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:34,140
Shri Mataji: What else could He have done 
with the stupid people?

1111
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,210
They crucified Him, He didn’t say, “You 
come and crucify Me,” did He, you see?

1112
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,070
They’re stupid, horrible people, donkeys.

1113
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:46,120
They didn’t understand Him, stones as they 
were what to do?

1114
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,230
They crucified Him, He didn’t ask.

1115
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:57,580
But when He was crucified the sins that they 
committed in crucifying Him were to be forgiven.

1116
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:00,400
That’s what it is.

1117
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,880
He was, what did He do?

1118
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,290
You see He died because of you because people 
like you only crucified Him.

1119
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,410
You represent them.

1120
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:14,000
When you are realised then you are different 
people, then you are resurrected.

1121
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,600
His message was resurrection not crucifixion 
but that shows the stupidity of these people,

1122
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,600
isn’t it.

1123
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:41,270
I mean you may do that again I can’t say, 
there are people.

1124
01:25:41,270 --> 01:26:02,340
Question: Is it possible to exercise love 
and acceptance when as she says You’re judging

1125
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,810
people as to whether they’re right or wrong.

1126
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,520
Warren: We are using vibrations

1127
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:18,000
Shri Mataji: I am not judging, you are judging 
because when you get your vibrations you start

1128
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,500
judging yourself.

1129
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:26,080
You see I am not judging it’s only your 
own judgment.

1130
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,170
It’s your own judgment.

1131
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:31,590
Are you getting your cool breeze in the hands?

1132
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:34,040
No, then let it happen.

1133
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:38,960
I’m not judging you it’s you are judging 
it yourself.

1134
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,460
All right, then you will know yourself.

1135
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:46,640
Just now you are judging that you’re not 
getting vibrations.

1136
01:26:46,640 --> 01:27:01,380
Question: Is it true that Indira Gandi is 
worshiped as a Goddess?

1137
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:22,240
Shri Mataji: oh don't, That's all political 
stuff, you see Indian people are like that.

1138
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:34,650
Warren: that's useless

1139
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:50,090
Question: She’s confused about the fact 
that You talked about love and acceptance

1140
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:55,880
at the beginning but then when peoples names 
were brought up we often scoffed at them.

1141
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:58,610
Shri Mataji: ah About the gurus?

1142
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:00,060
Ah, that’s it.

1143
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:02,470
It’s a very important point.

1144
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:08,550
That’s very much with you people.

1145
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:13,780
You see you have all of you, you see have 
developed a philosophy where you say that

1146
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:17,340
nobody is evil, everything is fine.

1147
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:22,570
This is a very good philosophy to work with 
because you also fit into the thing.

1148
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:24,590
That nothing is evil about you also, isn’t 
it?

1149
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,100
It happens like that.

1150
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:32,720
You remember when Christ was criticising these 
horrible people they asked Him, “How do

1151
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,400
You criticise them?

1152
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,900
They do not criticise You."

1153
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:45,170
Then He said, “Will the devil talk against 
its own house?”

1154
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:54,220
There is a negative force working, very much 
active and you have to not only scoff but

1155
01:28:54,220 --> 01:29:02,200
get rid of these things because they are acting 
as your destroying forces and they destroy

1156
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:05,450
you, I see them very clearly and I have to 
tell you.

1157
01:29:05,450 --> 01:29:12,000
So love doesn’t mean that I love a snake, 
will you go and love a snake, a snake must

1158
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,429
understand first of all.

1159
01:29:16,429 --> 01:29:20,500
In the same way we have to understand there 
are evil people, that’s true.

1160
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:26,080
That is what is very much in the West, I see, 
“Oh, you love everyone is all right.

1161
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,700
But you don’t love a snake, do you?

1162
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,350
Go and have, ask snake, “I want to love 
you."

1163
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:40,100
He’ll just finish you off.

1164
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:44,730
So many of you are harmed so much by these 
people and I have to cure you.

1165
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:50,400
You don’t know what I have to go through, 
such a lot of work to cure you when you are

1166
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,500
affected by these people.

1167
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:55,260
You don’t know how much I’ve worked, morning 
till evening.

1168
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:02,000
This morning I started six o’clock till 
I came here just ten minutes I got to change

1169
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,200
My sari and I was here.

1170
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:08,600
These are affected by other gurus and things 
and I have to take it out.

1171
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,120
I know what harm they have done to you.

1172
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:16,110
You have no idea.

1173
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:25,050
Question: What are Your objections to chanting 
and singing the holy scriptures?

1174
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:33,720
Shri Mataji: Not at all, who told you I am, 
I’m not but you must understand that without

1175
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:38,030
understanding what chanting is needed it’s 
like a medicine.

1176
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,510
Chanting is a mantra.

1177
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:52,550
Mantra means a thing that acts as a sound 
to correct a particular thing within you,

1178
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:53,590
all right.

1179
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:57,220
It’s you can say sound therapy it is, all 
right.

1180
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:03,260
Now you have to know what medicine is needed 
for which charka, also you must know where

1181
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:07,710
is the problem with you, or with anybody else.

1182
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:13,380
I mean it would be chanting at random means 
sometimes it would be sort of an indiscriminate

1183
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:16,150
drinking of all the medicines, you see.

1184
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:20,380
Taking all the medicines bottles into your 
stomach emptying them without understanding.

1185
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:25,290
We do chant but we know where to chant, what.

1186
01:31:25,290 --> 01:31:27,750
You see, not indiscriminate, just like that.

1187
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:33,350
And it’s very dangerous because when you 
go on chanting say, Rama’s name or Krishna’s

1188
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:34,350
name.

1189
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:38,400
Now when you say Krishna’s name, Krishna 
is here, if your Kundalini has not reached

1190
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:44,220
there up to this point if you take Krishna’s 
name it’s very, very annoying for Krishna

1191
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,970
Himself and He recedes, sleeps off.

1192
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:53,260
He freezes sometimes and by that you develop 
problems of the chakras and sometimes you

1193
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:57,630
develop throat cancer, it’s very serious.

1194
01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:03,810
So first, you must know where is your Kundalini, 
where it has gone, where it has stopped.

1195
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:08,200
Then you should know what is the problem, 
then you must know what exactly is the chanting

1196
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,350
to be used, all right, and then cure that 
part.

1197
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:17,800
You see so it’s a big science, which has 
to be understood in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not

1198
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,800
at random.

1199
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:24,570
You are suffering from whatever trouble you 
are suffering from, you must know first of

1200
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:25,570
all.

1201
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:30,620
See many people who are Christians catch on 
Agnya I told you, they do, because it’s

1202
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,620
unauthorised.

1203
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:39,790
Christ, we treat Him as if I don’t know 
what, some passion fruit hanging in a tree.

1204
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:43,170
Do we know who He is?

1205
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:46,560
There is a protocol, great protocol.

1206
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,910
Even Brahma, Vishnu Mahesh could not reach 
Him.

1207
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:57,910
So for us because we think we are born among 
Christian families and because the church

1208
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:03,660
has given us a certificate so called do you 
think we are authorised to chant His name

1209
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:07,480
all the time and trouble Him?

1210
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,150
And what do we ask?

1211
01:33:12,150 --> 01:33:13,820
Do we ask for our spirits?

1212
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:16,310
Do we ask to give our realisation?

1213
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:19,240
Do we ask that we have to be born again?

1214
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:26,440
No, what do we ask something nonsensical.

1215
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:34,260
Question: What is Your opinion about practicing 
spiritualists.

1216
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:40,200
Shri Mataji: Very dangerous, never go near 
them.

1217
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:46,590
Never touch them even with a barge pole, horrible 
things they are.

1218
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:54,260
You see it is very simple to understand that 
if you get connected with any area what so

1219
01:33:54,260 --> 01:34:00,030
ever, and somebody is connected to that area 
you are exposed to that and there can be any

1220
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:03,230
indiscriminate aggression on you from that 
area.

1221
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:05,110
You would not know who’s coming on you.

1222
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:06,610
So never go near them.

1223
01:34:06,610 --> 01:34:13,510
May be you want to talk to your father say, 
whose dead, you want to talk to him.

1224
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:14,510
Why?

1225
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:16,290
Release him, free him, why do you want to 
talk to him?

1226
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:20,200
Now let him be alone, let him decide for himself 
what he wants to do.

1227
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:22,120
Why do you want him to hang around?

1228
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:25,560
It’s too much, it’s too much of a load.

1229
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:31,740
Then you want to, when you use some medium 
for that you do not know he might get somebody

1230
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:32,740
else.

1231
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:36,130
It’s very dangerous for your children also, 
so many children have died with this kind

1232
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,130
of a thing.

1233
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:43,110
I mean you develop especially cancer, this 
multiple scleroses or anything like that.

1234
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,840
All these come from spiritualists.

1235
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:50,750
These are all spiritualists, these gurus are 
spiritualists only.

1236
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:54,340
They’ll believe is spirits, they’ll handle 
the spirits they’re working out, these are

1237
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:59,890
very dangerous things I may be able to tell 
you some time how they work it out and how

1238
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:03,100
they master it.

1239
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:06,320
It’s very dangerous.

1240
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,250
They’re like vampires, what you call it, 
vampires.

1241
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:15,090
More surprising is that there are so many 
things in English language, which we don’t

1242
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:20,880
have, like witchcraft and the witches were 
sort of punished, all sorts of things are

1243
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:21,880
there.

1244
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:27,760
In England, they talk of all these things 
supernatural and all this but still I don’t

1245
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,830
know how they go into it.

1246
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:35,970
Warren: somebody asked me a question on the 
way up.

1247
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:36,970
Is it wrong to be a medium?

1248
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:41,200
This relates to the previous question, so 
perhaps you could answer that Mother?

1249
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:48,240
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I need not tell, it’s 
very, very wrong to play into the hands of

1250
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:49,240
the spirits.

1251
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:52,210
You are enslaved completely; you don’t know 
what happens to you.

1252
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:56,840
Horrible, it creates problems absolutely you’re 
an abnormal personality.

1253
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,660
Never do it.

1254
01:35:58,660 --> 01:36:00,490
It’s sinful, sinful.

1255
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:13,920
If you accept My words really it’s horrible, 
never do that.

1256
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:19,601
Question: What is the difference between western 
spirituality and eastern spirituality?

1257
01:36:19,601 --> 01:36:23,830
Shri Mataji:Now this word spirituality means 
by these spiritualists you mean?

1258
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:25,160
Warren: No.

1259
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,160
Philosophy

1260
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:29,680
Shri Mataji: Is just the same, spirit is just 
the same.

1261
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:35,920
Is universal, there is no difference at all, 
I do not find any difference.

1262
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:42,850
Spirituality means the spirit that is the 
Atma, you mean the spirit that is the Atma,

1263
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:43,850
the one....

1264
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:49,541
Question: I’m talking more about the quest 
for the spirit.

1265
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:52,670
Shri Mataji: Search is just the same.

1266
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:59,990
But Indians you see now, modern Indians are 
sort of developing you see, they have to go

1267
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:04,160
to that height to see where you have landed 
yourself.

1268
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:09,672
See they can short circuit, they can short 
circuit if they want but if they want they

1269
01:37:09,672 --> 01:37:17,070
may have to go to various types of problems 
you had with that affluence and they may come

1270
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,070
back.

1271
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:21,320
But it is better to short circuit it I tell 
them.

1272
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:31,830
While yours is a problem so easy because you 
have discovered now that matter is not sufficient.

1273
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:36,730
Matter doesn’t give us joy, no use running 
after matter.

1274
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:40,330
But still some of them are running after sex 
you see and all that.

1275
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:45,190
They have to finish another circuit, once 
they are over with that also then things will

1276
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:46,190
be better.

1277
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:50,340
But in all this kind of a quest you have lost 
something indefinitely, no doubt.

1278
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:55,470
Going through the matter, going through the 
sex and going through the power all these

1279
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:59,480
trips you see you have lost something, which 
requires correction.

1280
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:06,510
While Indians if they understand with their 
wisdom they better short circuit this need

1281
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:09,650
not go into plastics and nylons.

1282
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:15,130
You see I have to carry nylon saris from England 
for Indians while they have their silks they

1283
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:16,140
want to wear nylon.

1284
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:22,790
So this is the difference in the basic development.

1285
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:27,810
But Indians if they take to Sahaja Yoga they’re 
very good and easy, especially Indian villagers

1286
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:28,810
are excellent.

1287
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:32,390
They don’t understand all this they have 
no mental problems you see.

1288
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:36,430
I don’t have to discuss with them all these 
things, they have not gone into all this nonsense

1289
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:40,390
so they suddenly become beautiful fruits, 
that’s all.

1290
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:47,100
So this is the difference of little degrees 
I would say that you are gone to other extreme

1291
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:53,110
and you still have to move to that extreme 
or they may finish off and we can achieve

1292
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:54,110
results.

1293
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:58,460
But your quest is much ardent, very sincere 
and truth.

1294
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:05,690
One more thing I always felt and today also 
I feel that really some great souls are born

1295
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:12,900
in the west, that’s why is such a sincere 
desire, very sincere in their desire.

1296
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:18,110
Indians first they come to Me for curing, 
if not for curing for getting children if

1297
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:22,540
not for that for jobs or money all sorts of 
thing they come up.

1298
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:27,140
Or they’ll say, “My mother is sick, my 
father is sick, my brother is this,” all

1299
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:28,230
this goes on.

1300
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:33,800
But I have met many, many seekers in the west 
who just want realisation, very beautiful

1301
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,700
people no doubt.

1302
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:41,510
But you have lost something in your seeking, 
no doubt, doesn’t matter.

1303
01:39:41,510 --> 01:40:01,890
Kundalini is that ardent desire within you, 
which works it out.

1304
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:12,010
Question: It seems as though the simpler the 
life we lead the better we are, it is much

1305
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:13,010
easier for us.

1306
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:14,220
We get away from thinking and so on.

1307
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:22,170
Shri Mataji: I agree is a good idea of simplicity 
but is a, you must understand that also very

1308
01:40:22,170 --> 01:40:26,740
clearly because we had somebody who was a 
hippy I should say.

1309
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:33,360
He was a real hippy, such big grown, he had 
grown hair up to this much and all that.

1310
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:38,110
He came to Me and scarcely wearing anything 
in the horrible English cold you see.

1311
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:41,840
I said, “What are you doing to yourself 
why don’t you clad your self properly into

1312
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,390
proper clothes and better cover yourself,” 
and I was really didn’t understand him.

1313
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:50,530
I said, “You are not living in Africa why 
are you dressed up like this, it’s like

1314
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:51,530
a primitive dress."

1315
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:53,200
He said, “I want to be primitive."

1316
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:55,750
I said, “You cannot by dressing up.

1317
01:40:55,750 --> 01:41:01,150
Your brain is so over developed how can you 
be primitive."

1318
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:03,380
You see by dressing up something do you become 
that.

1319
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:08,950
I mean it’s just a drama you are playing 
with yourself, you do not become primitive.

1320
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:14,681
This is the point is that and then the problem 
is the brain is thinking the same way, that

1321
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:20,900
the same rate and everything the same, only 
by changing is something that is not good

1322
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,600
because you should accept as you are.

1323
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:25,650
Why to do something like that?

1324
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:31,600
But simpler life means this way, that’s 
another extreme.

1325
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:43,940
But you see too much of formality like having 
a tail coat or wearing morning dress, grey

1326
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:49,010
suit and then having a particular type of 
a glass for a thing and all that nonsense

1327
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:50,370
you see you better finish off.

1328
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:57,400
That’s bit too much going too far with it 
and also caring for all these small, small

1329
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:03,280
things like matter that’s something that’s 
grown in you.

1330
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,610
Preservation of horrible things and useless 
things and all that it’s [really?].

1331
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:11,370
And then to think, think, think, think about 
everything, sit down and think how miserable

1332
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:15,440
I am and when there is no misery you just 
sit down and make miseries by thinking.

1333
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,850
I don’t find any thing miserable here, what 
is there?

1334
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:24,220
You see in India these people where there 
people are so happy, chirping just like birds

1335
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,220
enjoying themselves.

1336
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:28,950
They don’t have all the things that you 
have.

1337
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:33,780
So you see to get out of materialism is a 
better idea, to say that a simpler life means,

1338
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:35,580
but you must live beautifully.

1339
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:39,840
Beautiful doesn’t mean that you should have 
ten types of things and all that.

1340
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,500
Beautifully means you should not be as a morbid 
stinking, you see.

1341
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:51,940
Clean and beautiful you can make beauty out 
of the soil anything; with love, you can do

1342
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:52,940
anything.

1343
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:56,760
So you see it’s alright I mean what ever 
way you dress up or anything makes no difference

1344
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,550
that’s what I’m trying to say.

1345
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:01,190
That it is the inner thing that has to change 
not the outer.

1346
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:03,020
Again the Sahaja Yoga is this.
