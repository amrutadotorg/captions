00:02.136 --> 00:05.221


00:05.221 --> 00:10.546
You see, because I try to know so much about religions.

00:10.546 --> 00:15.135
Because I’m dealing with all kinds of religious people, first of all.

00:15.135 --> 00:21.068
And then, you see, within ourselves, it’s - there is a religion, a human religion.

00:21.068 --> 00:25.596
That is actually our valency, it’s our valency.

00:25.596 --> 00:27.596
Our wellbeing?

00:27.596 --> 00:34.207
Valency is a thing like carbon has four valencies, we have also ten valencies within ourselves.

00:34.207 --> 00:35.461
I don’t know this word.

00:35.461 --> 00:43.492
Valency is a word of chemical, chemistry, valency, v-a-l-e-n-c-y. Valency.

00:43.492 --> 00:47.098
And is it something new going, an expression?

00:47.098 --> 00:50.710
Well it is within us, you see, this ten qualities a human being has.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.492
We have ten valencies.

00:51.492 --> 00:57.358
Ten valences. And once we are missing in that, then we are missing in our personality.

00:57.358 --> 01:03.957
And it seems, that you have all sorts of relationship with people’s psyche

01:03.957 --> 01:08.568
and the problems they have, but we will always say there are psychosomatic.

01:08.568 --> 01:20.223
Yes. Psychosomatic diseases or human physical diseases all are because we are very much going into extremes, you see.

01:20.223 --> 01:24.553
So, there are imbalances in our character.

01:24.553 --> 01:34.717
Given that you are living in London it must be odd of you- I mean [unclear] not even from your own bags.

01:34.717 --> 01:37.734
Well, it started in India, I shouldn’t say that.

01:37.734 --> 01:38.234
You did!

01:38.234 --> 01:41.726
It first started first. First, first twelve Sahaja Yogis were from India.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.524
The first twelve

01:43.524 --> 01:47.394
Sahaja Yogis. They are called as Sahaja Yogis - Yogis

01:47.394 --> 01:50.630
Oh, yes, right. You’re the founder of the-

01:50.630 --> 01:52.350
Yes, I’m the founder as you said.

01:52.350 --> 01:53.703
And was it nineteen seventy?

01:53.703 --> 01:54.908
Yes.

01:56.298 --> 02:01.621
And I believe Australia now is the first growing?

02:01.621 --> 02:04.265
Yes, it is, it’s something really remarkable I tell you.

02:04.265 --> 02:06.836
And this must go like this the last six or seven years.

02:06.836 --> 02:12.600
Yes. Suddenly, you see, I think Australians have a quality of innocence in them.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.147
Right.

02:13.147 --> 02:15.162
They have.

02:15.162 --> 02:21.638
And you [unclear] to the fact that it is the first "chakel" of Sahaja Yoga- you call it the "chakel"?

02:21.638 --> 02:23.844
Chakra.

02:23.844 --> 02:32.384
Chakra, yes. And first charka is Australia and New Zealand, yes, first chakra of innocence.

02:34.181 --> 02:36.181
Ok, which makes us more-

02:36.181 --> 02:40.436
Innocent, yes. You are innocent people.

02:40.436 --> 02:45.191
Calibre also because of innocence- calibre. But you are very innocent.

02:46.242 --> 02:51.211
But you understand innocence and you respect innocence also, I think.

02:53.338 --> 03:02.755
And obviously, you had a time with the background Rajneshes and you totally discredit him.

03:02.755 --> 03:09.434
Does that make difficult, does that make people more resistant to listen to you or?

03:09.434 --> 03:12.275
I believe you denounced him.

03:12.275 --> 03:15.157
Absolutely, all of them. I ‘ve denounce all of them, openly.

03:15.157 --> 03:16.242
All of them.

03:16.242 --> 03:18.242
With the name.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.423
You see this is a- you see, what are they there for? That’s the main point is, you see?

03:25.423 --> 03:28.101
They are just there for making money, that’s all.

03:28.101 --> 03:28.601
Right.

03:30.907 --> 03:34.919
The incredible part of this is that you get the experience yourself.

03:34.919 --> 03:35.868
Right.

03:35.868 --> 03:37.279
You certify yourself. the other day we were in New Zealand.

03:37.279 --> 03:41.205
And we had lots of people, the whole hall was filled.

03:41.205 --> 03:49.409
Some were sitting even on the ground. And when they got their Realization they said: "It was like a -"

03:49.409 --> 03:53.689
what‘d you say to the, when you open the bottle of Champagne?

03:53.689 --> 03:57.725
Booze, booze, "It came out like a booze!" They said "Mother".

03:57.725 --> 03:59.348
Yes, so many of them.

03:59.348 --> 04:01.348
And this is-you’re just talking to them, sitting [inaudible]

04:01.348 --> 04:07.728
No, I just - I was talking to them and I told them how you can raise your residual force,

04:07.728 --> 04:14.416
the Kundalini, the force that gives you Realization. That is the reflection of the Holy Ghost with us.

04:14.416 --> 04:18.315
Christians also don’t know what’s the Holy Ghost.  Holy Ghost is the Kundalini,

04:18.315 --> 04:22.117
which is the residual force in the triangular bone, you see?

04:22.117 --> 04:26.589
And when it humps, they make them rise, rise it, with their own hands

04:26.589 --> 04:30.000
and then suddenly they felt the booze coming out of their heads.

04:30.407 --> 04:37.812
Right. So, if I went along and I was sceptical, and I went to the meeting

04:37.812 --> 04:44.140
and I went through the mechanics of, of – how you would you describe

04:44.140 --> 04:46.924
Sometimes, the reporters also get it, surprisingly.

04:46.924 --> 04:51.782
They’re cynical, I Think.  Because they meet all kind of funny people, I tell you,

04:51.782 --> 04:54.905
So, it’s difficult to believe in a genuine person, you see,

04:54.905 --> 04:59.246
There are very few genuine people in this world. So, the whole attitude is different.

04:59.246 --> 05:04.060
All right, yes. And when that resistance stops.

05:04.060 --> 05:10.197
It’s that, even if they, I mean, they just don’t want to have it, you see, you cannot force it on anyone.

05:10.197 --> 05:12.468
And you’re not about to force it on anyone.

05:12.468 --> 05:15.723
Not at all. You have to ask it from your heart

05:15.723 --> 05:21.330
because Holy Ghost is the pure desire within you, pure desire to be one with the Divine.

05:23.161 --> 05:29.666
And you would not want to identify one single God or entity.

05:29.666 --> 05:37.973
No, not at all, it’s not that way. It’s all of them, all of the incarnations, every one of them, are the milestones of our evolution.

05:40.592 --> 05:44.355
of our evolution. And this is the evolutionary process,

05:44.355 --> 05:49.305
the epitome of the last breakthrough of our evolutionary process.

05:49.305 --> 06:00.000
Can you explain to me a question apparently a gentleman did not know you few days ago, and he has found what you believe may be a cure for AIDS or,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.728
can you explain that? Cause you know that’s going to cause all sorts of reactions.

06:05.813 --> 06:11.666
Ha. AIDS. Now, AIDS, so far, I did definitely cure one person, no doubt.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.659
Yes, and it’s only the one person.

06:13.659 --> 06:17.185
One person. But he came from TM.

06:17.185 --> 06:19.947
Transcendental Meditation.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.133
Trans-Med.

06:21.133 --> 06:21.811
Right.

06:21.811 --> 06:25.944
Now, I told him not to go to in near it again and finish it off.

06:25.944 --> 06:28.140
Ho, really? Why?

06:28.140 --> 06:34.073
Because they try all these entities and those things just to capture your attention and capture you.

06:34.073 --> 06:36.505
Well, they have a whole philosophy, you mean.

06:36.505 --> 06:40.200
All like that. They mesmerize actually.

06:40.200 --> 06:45.964
This fellow, he was treated, he was all right. The doctors said that he had not this thing in his blood.

06:45.964 --> 06:50.031
His parents were very happy.
But again, he went to the same.

06:50.031 --> 06:54.349
Naturally, you feel, you see –then he died also.

06:54.349 --> 06:58.916
He came back to me. I said: “Now I cannot treat you”. “Now it’s alright, finished”.

06:58.916 --> 07:02.306
“I cannot go on all the time. Why did you go? I mean I told you.”

07:03.323 --> 07:08.171
Yes. This is the man that became IO and was looking to TM for relaxation

07:08.171 --> 07:10.709
No, no, no, no, no. He was in TM.

07:10.709 --> 07:16.839
And there, I don’t know, he became homosexual because in the TM, in those days-

07:16.839 --> 07:20.202
you are not supposed to even see your wife, you see,

07:20.202 --> 07:23.341
you have to live with men, you’re forced.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.076
You don't.

07:25.076 --> 07:31.721
No, no, no! All this nonsense, we don’t believe in all this nonsense. No, no! You have to be married; you have to happy husband and wife.

07:31.721 --> 07:34.061
And you didn’t believe in funny clothes.

07:34.061 --> 07:35.485
No, no, no, no, nothing.

07:35.485 --> 07:36.279
Or begging on the street, or.

07:36.279 --> 07:38.279
No. We have to be very normal people.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.025
Right.

07:44.653 --> 07:48.179
Or else that sets you apart from every other.

07:48.179 --> 07:53.363
Yes, of course. I mean because they must have some sort of an advertising or sensation.

07:53.363 --> 07:58.482
So, they do all these things, you see. I don’t need that. It’s a question of becoming.

07:59.194 --> 08:05.670
Can you explain to me this question of apparently this AID's cure is ingested gold?

08:05.670 --> 08:08.553
You might try gold.

08:08.553 --> 08:10.160
You're trying it really, you're not so -

08:10.160 --> 08:12.160
I haven't yet and we are trying still.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.539
[Inaudible]

08:13.539 --> 08:19.751
Yes, it is, you see. But I thought that copper can cover, the copper can be covered with gold.

08:19.751 --> 08:21.710
Why using copper?

08:21.710 --> 08:27.600
It is caused by copper. I know for 
definite it is caused by copper [unsure].

08:27.600 --> 08:33.192
AIDS are caused by the copper viruses. The copper 
are the carriers of viruses

08:33.192 --> 08:34.480
and the viruses of those-

08:34.480 --> 08:35.647
Mineral copper.

08:35.647 --> 08:43.889
Yes, in the blood. And, you see, when 
they have these relations you know, it's a dirty point,

08:43.889 --> 08:47.983
and the viruses and dead things are there, and viruses you see,

08:47.983 --> 08:51.653
and the skin is very loose there.

08:51.653 --> 08:52.153
Yes.

08:52.153 --> 08:58.067
It passes into the blood and is then it, it stays on the copper.

08:58.067 --> 09:01.796
You have seen copper becoming green, have you?

09:01.796 --> 09:02.296
Yes.

09:02.296 --> 09:07.357
It becomes like that. Now when it covers that copper,

09:07.357 --> 09:09.698
it can move about in the blood.

09:09.698 --> 09:13.046
Without developing into the secondary stages?

09:13.360 --> 09:17.042
Oh, it is on in the, first of all, in the first 
stage all right?

09:17.042 --> 09:17.605
Yes.

09:17.605 --> 09:25.335
Then it attacks the antibodies.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.560
Antibodies are created in the center, here.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.852
The gold attacks the antibodies.

09:32.852 --> 09:37.287
No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying the copper, the virus.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.181
Right.

09:41.760 --> 09:47.177
Now the antibodies are created in this part, the sternum.

09:47.177 --> 09:48.708
Yes.

09:49.415 --> 09:55.094
Till the age of 12 years or so and then they disappear they are all in the body, you see. 

09:55.094 --> 09:58.436
Now when they start attacking the antibodies,

10:01.040 --> 10:05.331
then so many antibodies die after.

10:05.331 --> 10:06.144
Yes.

10:06.144 --> 10:10.348
And they can't find fight this virus

10:10.720 --> 10:16.480
So, this because of the dead tissues 
and also it grows more. Because it's a fungus,

10:16.480 --> 10:21.120
it's a kind of virus, this kind of fungus, 
it grows on something that is dead.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.099
Right.

10:22.099 --> 10:25.338
So, it starts growing more and more, you see.

10:28.880 --> 10:36.072
But now, if you now put copper, cover it 
with gold, supposing, try, I mean but try,

10:36.800 --> 10:40.400
of course with Realization, I 
brought this man to this level

10:40.400 --> 10:44.269
that his blood was cleared out 
because it's a cleansing process.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.054
That's a different point.

10:46.054 --> 10:49.458
So, I request you one more time. You say the copper is the min-

10:49.683 --> 10:57.282
It's happening in the medical, it's happening with 
the medical side of it. But actually, in our Sahaja Yoga,

10:57.282 --> 11:07.918
we don't have to do all these things. We 
raise your kundalini. Once the kundalini comes up,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.473
Sorry, that's just a subtle mental suggestion. 

11:11.473 --> 11:15.245
That's just, if the doctors want to try, they can try also you see.

11:15.245 --> 11:18.873
But so when the kundalini comes up,

11:18.873 --> 11:20.822
And this is the Self-realization.

11:20.822 --> 11:23.266
The Self-realization. Then, you see, now these are the, say,

11:23.266 --> 11:30.839
these are the centers you see? Now by too much of pull on them, say, here, in the center here, center heart

11:30.839 --> 11:31.845
Yes.

11:31.920 --> 11:37.924
This center gets attacked by these 
people- viruses. So, it gets strong

11:38.160 --> 11:42.800
because the kundalini passes through 
that it enlightens it, it gets strong.

11:42.800 --> 11:49.280
When it gets strong, it starts producing more and 
more antibodies. So, now the antibodies attack.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.476
The reverse process starts.

11:55.200 --> 12:02.035
The viruses. So, the viruses start running away from the body like that,

12:02.035 --> 12:05.212
it's the other way round.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.600
All right, but that obviously will be 
a bone of contention, won't it? I guess.

12:11.600 --> 12:18.595
No, no it is why it has worked. In those people who 
had AIDS, we have three or four of them on the list now.

12:18.595 --> 12:19.310
Worldwide.

12:19.310 --> 12:23.840
Yes. There are four of them at least are there, worldwide.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.752
Are dead.

12:25.752 --> 12:33.255
No living, living, and they got AIDS about, I 
think, two years back

12:33.255 --> 12:36.254
or they came to Sahaja Yoga.

12:37.760 --> 12:43.040
and we gave them Realization, two years 
back we gave them Realization.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.997
I don't know how many years they have AIDS, you see.

12:44.997 --> 12:51.423
And now they are at the same stage as the first stage. They have receded back to the first stage.

12:51.423 --> 12:52.921
They still got the antibodies.

12:52.921 --> 12:54.676
They still got, I mean if-

12:54.676 --> 12:56.676
[Inaudible]

12:56.676 --> 13:03.456
It is in four stages, that's in four states. So, now they have gone back to the first stage, all of them.

13:03.456 --> 13:06.320
Were they at the first stage when you met them?

13:06.320 --> 13:12.003
I don't know. I didn't have their [inaudible] but they 
were saying so. They have gone back.

13:12.003 --> 13:17.283
So, now, they are leading a normal health. Normally 
what happens with this, that one gets diarrhoea.

13:17.520 --> 13:23.490
You get perspiration at wrong times all 
these things happen. They have started doing all that.

13:23.490 --> 13:29.674
All that stopped and now they are at 
the first stage.

13:29.674 --> 13:32.785
So, they had their [inaudible] at that stage.

13:32.785 --> 13:40.000
They are coming back to only that part. So, maybe, they 
might jump out also.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.320
In fact what you're saying is supported by some research here in south Australia which is the only one in the world

13:46.320 --> 13:53.360
that's looking at the effect of your mind on how 
the body whether the AIDS becomes a full-blown

13:53.360 --> 13:59.611
disease or whether it stays in a and you're 
arguing that with that Self-realization they're better.

13:59.611 --> 14:04.400
No, no that is the centre, you see you can 
see on the when the kundalini moves, you see?

14:04.400 --> 14:07.874
You can see it with your own eyes also on some people. 

14:07.874 --> 14:08.619
Really?

14:08.619 --> 14:09.119
Yes.

14:09.119 --> 14:10.000
That's done naturally?

14:10.000 --> 14:16.805
You see, because it's an energy that moves on your backbone, right?

14:16.805 --> 14:26.850
But what happens that you see it clearly in the cases of people who have obstructions in their chakras but if they are open it just shoots off.

14:27.120 --> 14:31.894
Now on these people, you can see it it's there, it 
stops there.

14:31.894 --> 14:38.710
Also, can feel it. You see, on your fingertips, after Realization, you can feel where the kundalini is,

14:38.710 --> 14:41.275
where she is obstructed.

14:41.558 --> 14:50.320
So, you find out that it is obstructed here. Now when you find out it's obstructed here, you have to- a little bit- to move,

14:50.320 --> 14:55.957
you see, that obstruction. Because the hands, from 
the fingertips the vibrations are flowing.

14:55.957 --> 14:58.124
So, you can remove the obstruction.

14:58.124 --> 15:00.497
Can you explain me how it's a physical thing?

15:01.040 --> 15:08.317
You see, after Realization what happens, your hands start emitting 
a kind of an energy, a cool breeze from your hand

15:08.317 --> 15:09.728
This is the cool breeze you told.

15:09.728 --> 15:13.763
Yes, the cool breeze and also you can feel
the good breeze all around you.

15:13.763 --> 15:25.603
it's true, it happens to you. All right. Now this is the vital 
energy from your hand with which Christ has cured.

15:29.638 --> 15:34.898
So if you move- it gets complicated.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.143
Because you asked me about gold, I had to tell 
you the doctor's things. But actually, we don't do that.

15:41.143 --> 15:45.600
We actually don't do all that. No, what we do is to give Realization that's all.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.544
And you start moving the kundalini upward, you start 
moving it.

15:49.544 --> 15:53.070
So, the gold therapy is just something [unclear]

15:53.070 --> 15:55.106
Yes, if they want to try, they can try that.

15:55.106 --> 15:55.920
But you're not really-

15:55.920 --> 15:58.407
No, no, we don't try all that, we don't try.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.983
But didn't you do that in Melbourne for somebody?

16:01.120 --> 16:04.502
No, no, no, no. I told them that if you want you can. 

16:04.502 --> 16:05.766
Oh, I see, yes, yes.

16:05.766 --> 16:07.317
But I didn't try on them.

16:07.317 --> 16:10.000
No, no. You really unconstitutional [unsure]

16:10.000 --> 16:13.763
You see, what we do is to raise
the kundalini all the time at this point.

16:13.763 --> 16:16.640
So, it gets more light
and more light and more light

16:16.640 --> 16:19.154
and it becomes a strong center.

16:19.154 --> 16:22.240
Can you tell me,  is it something that can just happen

16:22.240 --> 16:29.261
on one occasion and then you're okay for, you feel 
better for it, or do you have to work on it again?

16:29.261 --> 16:34.797
You see, one has to work I think, because it's 
an age-old problem I think, with some people.

16:35.200 --> 16:40.501
But in certain things, it happens just like that 
also, just like that.

16:40.501 --> 16:46.800
So, many things you get cured without any difficulties but 
some things you have to work out also.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.820
It is individual. It depends on everybody's -

16:50.820 --> 16:52.202
Everybody's individual-

16:52.202 --> 16:53.770
Yes, style.

16:53.770 --> 17:01.365
So, you cannot say that everything could be that way. But 
so many diseases get better at a very short time.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.609
Well, I won't hold you up anymore you must 
be very tired after you -

17:08.609 --> 17:09.380
No, I'm not.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.741
I'm quite- I don't get too easily tired. 

17:11.741 --> 17:12.241
No?

17:12.241 --> 17:15.089
Not much, yes.

17:15.089 --> 17:17.404
And your husband is still in London?

17:17.404 --> 17:21.005
Yes. He's in in London. Now, today, he's in Rome. He 
telephoned to me.

17:21.005 --> 17:22.191
Right. So, you keep in touch with him.

17:22.191 --> 17:23.597
He travels a lot himself.

17:23.597 --> 17:26.667
Right. And you must be doing a lot of traveling.

17:26.667 --> 17:31.947
Yes, I travel with him also I travel for Sahaja Yoga. There's a double town [unsure].

17:31.947 --> 17:35.811
My brother is with me
he is a high court judge from Bombay. He sits here.

17:35.811 --> 17:39.231
Yes, I gather you've been travelling with [unclear].

17:44.640 --> 17:48.209
I will, perhaps I can get 
your name from your [unclear].

17:48.209 --> 17:49.878
V.P. Salve.

17:50.916 --> 17:56.596
V.P. S-A-L-V-E

17:56.596 --> 17:58.646
Judge, high court judge of Bombay.

17:58.646 --> 18:03.247
Bombay, stationed at Aurangabad.

18:03.519 --> 18:06.804
You'll have to give me the spelling of that too.

18:06.804 --> 18:10.966
A-U-R-A-N-G-A

18:10.966 --> 18:12.337
BA- B-A.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.343
Where you have [inaudible].

18:16.343 --> 18:18.539
Yes, yes. All right?

18:21.200 --> 18:25.145
Thank you very much. And your title is that of 
high court judge.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.133
Yes, yes.

18:26.133 --> 18:28.133
All right. [Inaudible].

18:28.474 --> 18:34.399
He himself was not a believer of God in the beginning. 

18:34.399 --> 18:36.195
You support your sister now.

18:36.195 --> 18:37.686
Now he's all right.

18:40.977 --> 18:42.890
How long did you have to work on him?

18:42.890 --> 18:48.315
You see, being the sister, naturally, it takes time.

18:48.624 --> 18:50.821
[Inaudible] in between.

18:50.821 --> 18:57.764
But not with false gurus. I've seen the false people get all their relations together to make money. I don't know.

18:57.764 --> 19:03.470
My family is a very,
I should say, idealistic family.

19:03.470 --> 19:07.870
And by, you see, not that he didn't believe in me he 
always believed in me and my love.

19:09.120 --> 19:13.862
But he never believed that I could change people or 
transform people, you see?

19:14.371 --> 19:20.236
After I saw the Sahaja Yogis, from a very near point

19:20.236 --> 19:23.857
that I was convinced 
that what she says is right.

19:23.857 --> 19:25.620
Really? And how long ago you took to-

19:25.620 --> 19:28.991
It's only about two- one and a half years.

19:28.991 --> 19:34.146
Since I became a high court judge and was stationed at Aurangabad, I could have some more time.

19:34.146 --> 19:37.977
I was a lawyer, a practicing lawyer that didn't give me time.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.800
And his diabetes is cured and also, he 
could not bend himself, he bends himself well.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.200
I was not able to bend at all.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.743
These legs they're all very stiff.

19:50.964 --> 19:56.000
Really, it's a lovely angle, I must admit.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.127
Terrific! And oh, I ought to ask your age. Do I ask your age?

20:01.127 --> 20:02.176
Age?

20:02.176 --> 20:02.676
Yes.

20:02.676 --> 20:03.489
My age?

20:03.489 --> 20:05.489
I am sixty-one.

20:05.489 --> 20:10.770
He is sixty-one. I am sixty-four. Now running sixty-fifth.

20:12.717 --> 20:15.805
Maybe, I'll be sixty-one in June.

20:15.805 --> 20:19.087
I'm sure [inaudible].

20:19.494 --> 20:25.303
All right then. I will leave you now. Do you have photos?

20:25.303 --> 20:29.661
We have lots of them. Find me some miraculous ones, you may like.

20:29.661 --> 20:32.373
We had some very miraculous photographs
of mine. You would like to see some?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.007
Have you brought up the hands?

20:35.007 --> 20:36.960
The latest yes, we have, let us take this.

20:36.960 --> 20:43.636
[Inaudible] showing something you will 
be interested.

20:43.636 --> 20:45.139
We are getting out of the way.

20:45.546 --> 20:50.758
I met some of you

20:50.758 --> 20:52.758


20:52.758 --> 20:57.531
Dan your home work is very well. You see, if they have done home work well, their hand are all right.

20:57.531 --> 21:00.950
Otherwise, it's a problem. [Unsure].

21:05.324 --> 21:08.436
Have you got some photographs?

21:22.560 --> 21:28.093
He explained to me supreme court is equal to our high court.

21:28.093 --> 21:29.823
Oh so it's topsy-turvy, the other way around.

21:35.858 --> 21:38.698
I don't practice this [inaudible]

21:39.040 --> 21:42.873
because I'm born like this, I don't have to be cleared. But all of them practice.

21:42.873 --> 21:50.960
It takes only five minutes in the morning and five minutes in the evening, twice a day, that’s all. Yes, that’s all.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.443
It's not a regular thing or else. It's something that happens to you.

21:55.443 --> 21:56.960
You are in meditation.

21:56.960 --> 22:02.785
And you become a person who is meditating 
because you are in contact with the Divine.

22:03.734 --> 22:08.721
Then you don't have to worry.  That's it. It's simple.

22:13.773 --> 22:17.755


22:26.096 --> 22:27.741
You were in May?

22:28.320 --> 22:30.880
I was there in November, December.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.125
Oh that's beautiful!

22:32.125 --> 22:33.946
Yes, it's a very pleasant place

22:33.946 --> 22:35.946
Oh, but Jane's going next week.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.779
Thank you very much.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.779
Thank you, thank you.

22:45.554 --> 22:48.126
I think I will go tomorrow at one of these meetings.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.217
You must come along, you see.

22:50.217 --> 22:51.395
Oh, I'll be coming along.

22:51.395 --> 22:52.455


22:52.455 --> 22:56.225
I think that’s ashram in Melbourne.

22:56.225 --> 22:59.821
All right then you can send
some to Paul to see for himself, you see.

23:00.320 --> 23:05.012


23:05.012 --> 23:10.000
You both should come tomorrow get your Realization.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000


23:13.840 --> 23:15.920
But how was that picture taken, with what?

23:15.920 --> 23:17.030
A camera.

23:17.030 --> 23:21.840
You might get something in yours.

23:25.186 --> 23:30.532
Even in a village, I was sitting.

23:30.532 --> 23:35.796
[Unclear] she got lights coming out of my head [unclear].

23:44.262 --> 23:47.534
Thank you, than you.

23:59.504 --> 24:03.946
Lots of them are there, but you don' carry that load with you.

24:06.794 --> 24:11.846
What about them? You should offer them some tea.

24:13.360 --> 24:16.585
They won't have some tea or something? Ask them.
