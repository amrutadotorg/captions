WEBVTT

00:02.349 --> 00:08.384
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

00:08.601 --> 00:15.597
With it we have to also celebrate
the resurrection of human beings,

00:15.798 --> 00:22.764
of Sahaja Yogis who have been resurrected
as realised souls.

00:24.546 --> 00:33.630
With that we have to understand that
we enter into a new awareness.

00:33.831 --> 00:38.908
There was no need for Christ to enter
into any new awareness,

00:39.109 --> 00:44.551
He had to come down and again to show
to this world

00:44.791 --> 00:55.784
that you are the eternal life, that you
lead a life

00:56.881 --> 01:01.104
that is spiritual, which never perishes.

01:01.305 --> 01:06.018
You have to rise into that new realm

01:07.122 --> 01:14.391
which is the realm of God Almighty,

01:15.514 --> 01:18.612
what you call ‘The Kingdom of God’.

01:18.797 --> 01:28.644
And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus
that, “You are to be born again.”

01:29.664 --> 01:35.936
And when he asked, “Am I to enter back
into my mother’s womb to be born again?”

01:36.137 --> 01:38.672
But He said it so clearly! It’s so clear.

01:38.873 --> 01:42.850
Those who don’t want to see can remain
blind!

01:43.051 --> 01:49.450
But he said it very very clearly that,
“No,” that is,

01:49.651 --> 01:54.256
“whatever is born of the flesh is
the flesh,

01:54.457 --> 02:00.784
but whatever is born of the Spirit
is the Spirit.”

02:02.309 --> 02:05.752
I mean, nothing could be more clear
than that,

02:05.953 --> 02:11.166
that it has to be born of the Spirit.

02:11.991 --> 02:17.170
Of course, human beings have a special
capacity to twist everything around.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.824
For them Spirit could be a book, could be
some words,

02:21.025 --> 02:23.704
could be an organisation, a church,

02:23.905 --> 02:27.279
or some sort of a thing like that which
they have made.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.624
But whatever is man-made is not the Spirit,

02:33.825 --> 02:38.745
this is the clear statement of Christ,
which people wanted to avoid

02:38.946 --> 02:44.932
and start their own organisations,
their own ideas

02:45.329 --> 02:51.772
and created a very mythical thing
in His name.

02:51.973 --> 02:56.365
And now the time has come for it
to be blasted.

02:58.155 --> 03:02.081
It has been going on and on for thousands
of years,

03:02.282 --> 03:08.012
captured so many innocent people,
and people are into it.

03:09.069 --> 03:15.904
But when you are resurrected, when you
become realised souls,

03:16.109 --> 03:26.513
one has to understand that now your
movement is inward,

03:26.714 --> 03:30.072
you are moving towards your roots
and not outside.

03:30.273 --> 03:40.760
So whatever was the endeavour before
realisation

03:40.961 --> 03:45.304
has to be changed, the direction has
to be changed,

03:45.504 --> 03:49.523
and that point mostly we miss.

03:51.265 --> 03:57.344
This is the thing, today, [that] I am
trying to explain to you.

03:57.545 --> 04:07.122
That, so far, to a human mind entertainment
was important; entertaining.

04:07.344 --> 04:11.115
To the mind, not to the Spirit.

04:11.316 --> 04:21.904
Entertainment to the Spirit is absolutely
opposite to the entertainment to the mind.

04:22.766 --> 04:27.801
Like somebody the other day telephoned
to me and said that,

04:28.002 --> 04:34.707
“Mother, there is no excitement
in Sahaja Yoga.”

04:39.746 --> 04:44.531
The excitement is too much.

04:44.732 --> 04:49.116
We are going against that.

04:49.317 --> 04:52.834
We are going towards peace, not towards
excitement

04:53.035 --> 04:57.304
and this kind of electric-shocks that we
require every time.

04:57.504 --> 05:03.624
You see, a drunkard – he’s all right in
the morning but evening-time he goes off,

05:03.825 --> 05:09.376
he needs a shock, a, some sort
of an injection into his body.

05:09.577 --> 05:17.727
All human enterprises have been like that.
They are to excite your body.

05:17.928 --> 05:23.821
Because if it is the dead you are dealing
with, then you have to excite it.

05:24.022 --> 05:28.166
But something that is living, that is
eternal,

05:28.367 --> 05:32.030
you have to enjoy it and not to excite it.

05:32.231 --> 05:38.819
So the direction has to be juxtaposition,

05:39.020 --> 05:44.502
and that is where many Sahaja Yogis
fail to understand.

05:46.464 --> 05:50.141
How do we do it? Is the point.

05:50.342 --> 05:59.119
How do we make our attention move inward
instead of going outward?

05:59.320 --> 06:08.344
If you start from the time you are born
again, it is much easier,

06:08.545 --> 06:12.073
because it’s a new venture into [which]
you go in.

06:12.274 --> 06:18.784
That is the peace, peace of your Spirit,
the joy of your Spirit,

06:19.502 --> 06:22.193
which is permanent, you don’t need
any excitement from it,

06:22.411 --> 06:27.024
it is permanent, it is eternal.

06:29.265 --> 06:35.784
So the first thing that comes to our mind
is that whatever we do

06:36.440 --> 06:42.784
before realisation we have not to do.

06:43.217 --> 06:49.776
The first and foremost thing is [that]
realisation comes to you effortlessly.

06:49.977 --> 06:55.340
So the effort which is built in your body
all the time, the energy of effort,

06:55.547 --> 06:59.369
“I must do this, I must do that, I have
to do this, I have to do that!”

06:59.570 --> 07:03.624
That creates tension, that I have told you
already.

07:03.856 --> 07:08.752
So what do we do?

07:08.953 --> 07:20.318
We do not try to compete with others.

07:20.519 --> 07:34.309
We do not try to fix certain timings,
dates, watches.

07:34.510 --> 07:39.673
We do not also put our attention

07:40.141 --> 07:47.583
into any endeavour which puts us
into effort,

07:47.784 --> 07:52.930
but we relax that attitude of effort.

07:53.131 --> 07:56.490
It’s called as, in Sanskrit, prayatna
shaithilya.

07:56.691 --> 08:04.111
For a western mind it’s very difficult
to grasp the subject so try to understand.

08:05.360 --> 08:09.854
That doesn’t mean lethargy, doesn’t
mean lethargy.

08:10.055 --> 08:17.910
One should never confuse with the dead,
the energy of the living.

08:18.111 --> 08:28.395
Now we are trying to transform our energies
towards the energy of the Spirit.

08:28.596 --> 08:33.720
So you have to allow the Spirit
to take over.

08:34.864 --> 08:39.355
Your effort of your mind should be reduced

08:39.556 --> 08:44.524
and the energy of the Spirit should work
through you.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.784
Now how do you do it?

08:51.256 --> 09:00.087
First is detachment, detachment.

09:00.288 --> 09:06.769
Detachment start with the thought, let us
see the thought.

09:06.970 --> 09:11.322
It’s called as vichara shaithilya –
relaxation of the thought.

09:11.523 --> 09:15.740
Now a thought is coming into your mind,
some thought [like],

09:15.941 --> 09:19.823
“Today is Mother’s puja, let’s go. We have
to hurry up.” You see, “Must get this,

09:20.024 --> 09:23.981
you didn’t get the flowers, now you go
to the Third World and get the flowers.

09:24.182 --> 09:26.977
You must get this and you must get that”

09:27.178 --> 09:32.641
Second [thought] is: “No. Detach yourself.

09:36.376 --> 09:44.492
Witness. Leave it to the Spirit. Watch.”

09:44.693 --> 09:49.394
You’ll get it. Many of you have noticed
this.

09:49.595 --> 09:55.011
But still this mind, which is quite silly,
tries to impress upon you

09:55.212 --> 10:04.371
that you have to use the old junky
instrument of this mind.

10:04.572 --> 10:09.734
And it asserts that “Better use.” And when
you start using that,

10:09.935 --> 10:13.852
ego comes in, you get attached to it,

10:15.624 --> 10:22.742
and what you lose is your progress
and thus the joy is minimised.

10:22.943 --> 10:26.838
How do you detach yourself?

10:27.039 --> 10:30.481
For a person who is absolutely detached
is very difficult

10:30.682 --> 10:35.127
to explain how to detach, isn’t it?

10:35.875 --> 10:42.715
I’ll try! Now. I cannot get attached.
That’s the problem is.

10:46.213 --> 10:51.303
And I find it difficult to explain to you
in words which are human words,

10:51.504 --> 10:54.998
but still, I’ll try to say now.

10:58.415 --> 11:02.503
Say, I tried something as human beings do,
in the beginning,

11:02.704 --> 11:06.715
just to see how it works out; because I had
to experiment.

11:06.916 --> 11:13.165
For example, when I had to, say, attend
any puja or anything,

11:13.366 --> 11:19.595
I used to ask them, “What is the auspicious
time?”

11:21.051 --> 11:24.423
So they would tell me, “This is
the auspicious time.”

11:24.595 --> 11:27.866
And then another would telephone to say,
“This is the auspicious time.”

11:28.067 --> 11:30.299
So I said, “How can there be two auspicious
times?”, you see,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.253
[it’s a] big problem with human beings.

11:32.454 --> 11:37.651
So they said, “There are 5 Panchangas
in India.”

11:37.852 --> 11:41.706
Means 5 books to consult the auspicious
time.

11:41.907 --> 11:45.493
That’s what human beings have done.
I said, “Then why consult?

11:45.694 --> 11:50.064
It’s better not to have 5 auspicious times,
isn’t it?”

11:50.265 --> 11:57.344
Then the auspicious time has to be
beyond time.

11:58.127 --> 12:03.603
But it is bound in the time the way human
beings have made it,

12:03.804 --> 12:08.139
so it is bound in the time. Like in India,
it is so much, so much, so much,

12:08.362 --> 12:13.492
but now, here (in London) it’s different.
Then you calculate, you have a watch.

12:13.693 --> 12:18.603
You see, to overcome all these hurdles
human beings also make certain devices.

12:18.804 --> 12:26.201
So you consult. “Now what is the auspicious
time here?” – leave at that time.

12:26.402 --> 12:33.499
Then it’s a big headache because there are
5 books to be consulted,

12:33.700 --> 12:37.986
watch could be wrong, this could be wrong,
that could be so.

12:38.187 --> 12:45.583
But if you are the Spirit, then the Spirit
works out auspiciousness.

12:45.784 --> 12:49.024
It is the Spirit that works out
the auspiciousness.

12:49.193 --> 12:53.859
And imagine when you think like that,
how much tension goes out.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.864
First of all you have to be a slave
of the watch;

12:57.024 --> 12:59.558
another, you have to be the slave
of the books,

12:59.759 --> 13:04.253
then you have to be the slave
of the market,

13:04.928 --> 13:10.308
of the room, of the place which you have
to hire.

13:10.522 --> 13:16.430
But supposing if you allow the Spirit
to work it out,

13:16.631 --> 13:20.890
then everything will work out. And you
will reach at the point

13:21.091 --> 13:24.424
when it is the most auspicious.

13:24.625 --> 13:30.464
So how do you accept it? Just by accepting.

13:31.784 --> 13:38.590
So, just now if you give up your satta,
your own domain,

13:38.791 --> 13:42.786
you get into the domain of your Spirit.

13:43.900 --> 13:49.358
You give up your domain, that is your
ego’s domain,

13:49.559 --> 13:52.812
or may be your super-ego’s domain.
You give up that

13:53.013 --> 13:59.174
and try to see things how it works out.

13:59.375 --> 14:05.052
Now, what is the testing point of it?
How do you test it?

14:05.268 --> 14:11.968
It works out. That’s the point of testing.

14:12.633 --> 14:17.154
It works out. Allow it to work out.

14:17.355 --> 14:20.784
Don’t put your attention.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.931
Attention [word] has the second part of,
is the ‘tension’.

14:25.132 --> 14:30.370
And don’t try to say, “Why not today,
it should have happened today,

14:30.571 --> 14:35.403
we expected it to happen. Why not
at this moment?”

14:35.604 --> 14:42.000
That’s your ego. “Thy will be done”.

14:43.979 --> 14:51.842
So the thought that starts moving
in our mind

14:52.043 --> 14:58.188
all the time, which creates tensions is not
the thought of the Spirit.

14:58.389 --> 15:03.886
So, what you should say [is], “Not this
thought. Not this thought.”

15:04.087 --> 15:06.828
“Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus”

15:07.029 --> 15:11.570
“Not this thought, not this thought,
not this thought”,

15:12.104 --> 15:15.344
and see how you relax. Now you are
relaxing -

15:15.545 --> 15:18.468
“Not this thought, not this thought”.

15:18.669 --> 15:23.481
Just go on refusing accepting any thought.

15:23.682 --> 15:30.051
So you go into Nirvichara. In that state
you feel the Spirit.

15:31.344 --> 15:36.501
Christ has done the greatest work on this,
I should say, but we do not understand

15:36.702 --> 15:42.903
because His life was like a micro-thing,
you see, 3 years.

15:43.104 --> 15:47.823
So we have to open it out a little bit
and see what He did.

15:48.024 --> 15:52.876
He has given us the greatest weapon
of forgiveness.

15:53.918 --> 15:58.748
When you forgive a person, what do you do?

15:59.599 --> 16:06.367
You accept the situation, to begin with,
and secondly you forgive

16:08.108 --> 16:12.426
what you think has been done wrong to you.

16:12.627 --> 16:17.984
But because nothing can be done wrong
to your Spirit,

16:18.185 --> 16:21.784
you just forgive, because you are
the Spirit!

16:23.355 --> 16:30.278
And when you forgive, you have found
that your tension goes away.

16:30.479 --> 16:34.492
So even to your thoughts if you say,
“All right, forgive this thought,

16:34.693 --> 16:40.024
forgive this thought,” because thought is
also not to be punished.

16:40.420 --> 16:44.675
“Forgive this thought, forgive this
thought, forgive everything.”

16:44.876 --> 16:48.069
Not forget, forgive:

16:49.708 --> 16:54.472
because then you will even forget that
you are the Spirit!

16:56.911 --> 17:00.503
But “forgive all the thoughts that
are coming to me.”

17:00.704 --> 17:04.870
Just go on saying this, is a mantra.
What is a mantra?

17:05.071 --> 17:13.421
Is that power of the word that expresses
Spirit.

17:14.813 --> 17:18.426
So this is a very important thing Christ
has given us:

17:18.627 --> 17:23.227
the weapon of forgiveness. Everybody
has that weapon,

17:23.428 --> 17:29.067
everyone can use that weapon. You don’t
have to put in any effort for it,

17:29.268 --> 17:35.157
you don’t have to pay for it, it’s just you
have to say, “I forgive.”

17:35.358 --> 17:41.457
You’ll be amazed your nerves will soothe
down, this tension,

17:41.658 --> 17:49.030
this pressure of these modern things
will be reduced

17:49.231 --> 17:53.185
if you go on saying, “I forgive, I forgive
them”.

17:53.386 --> 17:58.503
For example, you go and see some sort of a…

17:58.704 --> 18:01.880
I mean, if you happen suddenly to see
something very filthy

18:02.081 --> 18:05.583
according to the Spirit.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.797
Maybe it is very exciting according
to normal human beings,

18:09.998 --> 18:15.998
but we are abnormal people and for us
if we find it rather ugly

18:16.199 --> 18:19.199
then the best thing is, to get over,
is to say, “I forgive,

18:19.400 --> 18:24.911
because they are ignorant, they are blind,
they are not yet there where I am.

18:25.112 --> 18:29.551
I am the one who is at the Source
of enjoyment,

18:29.752 --> 18:35.921
at the Source of peace and while these
are not, so I forgive.”

18:38.135 --> 18:43.795
And you’ll be amazed that this forgiveness
that Christ gives you

18:44.024 --> 18:51.660
works out vichara shaithilya, is
the relaxation of the thought.

18:54.475 --> 18:59.973
Now this opposite movement, that you have
to move,

19:00.174 --> 19:08.154
first of all should start at this point,
today, from forgiving others.

19:09.991 --> 19:15.334
Now what happens when you forgive someone?
That means you do not react.

19:15.535 --> 19:24.821
The power to react to somebody’s injuries,
insults is finished.

19:25.022 --> 19:30.167
And when that power is finished, you become
a powerful person,

19:30.368 --> 19:37.540
because nobody can now overpower you,

19:37.741 --> 19:42.450
because nobody can kill you, nobody can
hurt you,

19:42.651 --> 19:46.138
nobody can do anything to you.

19:46.767 --> 19:49.262
But it is not, again I’ll say,
shamelessness.

19:49.463 --> 19:54.148
You see, people can think that it is
shamelessness.

19:55.464 --> 20:00.837
So if somebody says to you something harsh

20:01.887 --> 20:07.086
and something that is wrong, you do not
accept it.

20:07.287 --> 20:10.361
But supposing I shout at someone,
the bhoots run away.

20:10.562 --> 20:13.947
You have seen that many-a-times, I have
to shout at people,

20:14.132 --> 20:18.146
so bhoots run away because they react,
and they just run away,

20:18.347 --> 20:22.670
but the Spirit shines through.

20:23.402 --> 20:31.049
So in Sahaja Yoga one has to understand
that it is just this central path,

20:31.250 --> 20:37.900
is just the balancing thing which is
important. It’s not an extreme of anything.

20:38.217 --> 20:41.966
Like when we go to say that you must
forgive everyone,

20:42.167 --> 20:47.347
it’s not going to that extreme where you
have done some wrong,

20:47.548 --> 20:52.305
and somebody says to you [and] you don’t
take that part of it, it doesn’t mean that.

20:52.506 --> 20:57.783
Again discretion is the engine of your
movement.

20:57.984 --> 21:02.210
So you have to see that, if they have
said it,

21:03.197 --> 21:09.344
something like that, “Is it? Have I gone
against the Spirit?”

21:09.567 --> 21:14.495
Otherwise, if I say to you something, you
will say, “All right, forgive Mother!”

21:14.696 --> 21:19.975
You see the point is? “Forgive Her
for saying so.” No.

21:21.972 --> 21:25.195
You cannot say that to Me!

21:26.675 --> 21:33.264
So then, that is the point [from which]
you start thinking,

21:34.509 --> 21:37.383
“Why Mother said so? What have I done?”

21:37.584 --> 21:40.276
Now think on those lines – so you start
moving again.

21:40.477 --> 21:47.114
It’s a very thin road on which you have
to walk.

21:47.315 --> 21:55.418
One side is the huge, big Gibraltar,
rock of Gibraltar, of your ego,

21:55.611 --> 21:58.706
the another side is a super-ego.

21:58.891 --> 22:03.983
In between is a small discretion path
going,

22:04.184 --> 22:07.794
on which you have to see both the sides,

22:07.995 --> 22:12.625
whether you are hitting yourself with
the rock of Gibraltar,

22:12.826 --> 22:17.758
or falling into the valley of super-ego,

22:17.959 --> 22:22.178
you should see that you are using
your discretion.

22:22.379 --> 22:27.934
So the another thing one has to remember
[is] that whatever you were doing

22:28.135 --> 22:30.875
before realisation, is to go to extremes.

22:31.076 --> 22:36.152
For example now, you start some sort
of a movement.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.782
Say, you say, “We’ll have classical
things!” All right.

22:39.983 --> 22:44.167
Then you go so classical that it becomes
mechanical.

22:44.384 --> 22:46.760
Now you’ll say, “Give up! We’ll start
anti-culture”.

22:46.961 --> 22:50.070
So you go to another side that you become
primitive.

22:50.271 --> 22:53.937
Till you have reached the end of it and
learnt a lesson of your life,

22:54.138 --> 22:57.259
you do not return. But in Sahaja Yoga,

22:57.460 --> 23:02.061
it’s a very slippery road on which we are
walking,

23:02.934 --> 23:08.160
and there you have to see that it’s not
your ego and it is not your super-ego.

23:08.361 --> 23:12.621
So discretion has to be used very much,
and the balance,

23:12.822 --> 23:19.600
in this movement, which we need not use
otherwise.

23:19.801 --> 23:25.783
Till we are absolutely destroyed we can go
ahead with it, before realisation.

23:25.984 --> 23:30.432
But in Sahaja Yoga, as soon as you leave
your discretion,

23:30.632 --> 23:33.622
you fall this side or that side.

23:33.824 --> 23:38.542
Now those people who are of high quality

23:38.743 --> 23:43.944
Sahaja Yogis take to discretion first:
“How far to go?”

23:44.145 --> 23:48.834
Now for that Mother doesn’t have to say
because you are the Spirit.

23:49.035 --> 23:53.863
You yourself, you are the Spirit. First
of all assume your position as a Spirit,

23:54.064 --> 23:58.550
and then move with it, that you see,
discreetly,

23:58.751 --> 24:03.738
how far to go, how far not to go.

24:04.978 --> 24:09.663
Now that is one of the things: that you
have to become thoughtless

24:09.864 --> 24:15.892
by becoming a forgiving person.

24:16.093 --> 24:19.583
Most of the thoughts will drop out once
you become forgiving.

24:19.784 --> 24:23.009
But you cannot forgive some people,
like you cannot forgive God,

24:23.210 --> 24:27.556
you cannot forgive Mother. Certain things
you cannot do,

24:27.733 --> 24:31.186
so the Maryadas must be seen.

24:32.564 --> 24:39.364
Now, in these boundaries if you walk
properly, you can go ahead.

24:40.354 --> 24:43.399
This is the thing which brings you
vichara shaithilya

24:43.600 --> 24:49.348
or you can call – the mind becomes relaxed.

24:50.237 --> 24:52.998
Then you have to have vishayatha
shaithilya:

24:53.199 --> 24:57.783
means your organs, sense organs, always
react to things,

24:57.984 --> 25:01.583
because you are human beings, you see,
you are born like that.

25:01.784 --> 25:07.824
So, whatever happens you react.

25:08.025 --> 25:13.534
For example, you see a beautiful flower,
you react to it.

25:14.582 --> 25:18.072
Some sort of a thought rises with it.

25:19.937 --> 25:28.543
Now you must practice to see something
without allowing any thought to rise,

25:28.773 --> 25:32.962
then you start sucking through your Spirit

25:33.163 --> 25:41.090
the beauty, the glory, the fragrance
of a flower.

25:42.120 --> 25:49.784
Every flower is a poetry, but when you
start thinking about it

25:50.911 --> 25:56.543
then it becomes a dead thing. But you
just try to enjoy.

25:56.744 --> 26:03.604
Now you are the people who are
on this earth to enjoy yourself,

26:04.088 --> 26:08.554
not to worry about anything. Just enjoy!

26:08.755 --> 26:12.319
But if you are still used to,

26:13.764 --> 26:17.970
“I must do this thing special, I am
something special Sahaja Yogi,

26:18.171 --> 26:23.839
I’m a very highly evolved Sahaja Yogi”,
then you are finished.

26:25.272 --> 26:31.219
Say, we are all going in a boat, enjoy
the boat and also the waves.

26:31.420 --> 26:36.591
But somebody says, “I’m a very special one,
I’ll try to jump down,”

26:38.428 --> 26:43.155
then you are back again into the same
position.

26:43.356 --> 26:48.089
So one has to have an attitude
of looking at things.

26:48.258 --> 26:55.136
Try to develop this habit of looking
at things without thinking about it.

26:55.337 --> 27:01.131
Try to develop your mind on those lines
that you do not react.

27:01.332 --> 27:09.657
Now this excitement business, or all this
sensationalisation that is today’s craze,

27:09.858 --> 27:13.702
comes from the same [source]: that
your sense organs

27:13.923 --> 27:18.324
require a kind of sensation because
they react.

27:18.525 --> 27:22.146
While we must have our sense organs
which do not react,

27:22.347 --> 27:27.081
because they must only react to the Spirit.

27:27.296 --> 27:35.684
So we have to develop a new type of sense
organs or a new quality of sense organs

27:35.885 --> 27:41.033
who do not react to outside excitement.

27:42.155 --> 27:46.123
Now if you want Sahaja Yoga to be
excitement, how can you do it?

27:46.324 --> 27:49.924
I mean just, it is just the opposite of it.

27:52.875 --> 27:56.920
So what you have to do is to see

27:57.121 --> 28:01.444
that your sex organs, say for example
your eyes,

28:01.921 --> 28:06.433
they see something then they react.

28:06.790 --> 28:11.219
Your ears, they hear something [and]
they react.

28:12.952 --> 28:19.640
Somebody wants to talk and see
the reaction –

28:20.498 --> 28:23.438
there are expectations (of a reaction).

28:25.984 --> 28:33.353
But because Spirit is active itself,

28:33.554 --> 28:39.129
it acts itself – you have seen vibrations
don’t speak, they act –

28:39.353 --> 28:45.637
It has the power to act, [so] you need
not react.

28:48.028 --> 28:57.506
If you can reduce the power of reaction
you rise much higher.

28:57.707 --> 29:04.226
This is a thing which one has to know
when now

29:04.427 --> 29:10.248
we are celebrating His resurrection:
because it is tapah,

29:10.449 --> 29:15.763
it is the penance of Christ. Christ came
on this earth for penance.

29:15.964 --> 29:21.609
You know in the Gayatri mantra, there are
7 things they have said [in] it,

29:21.810 --> 29:27.141
and at the point of Christ it is tapah,
is the penance.

29:27.342 --> 29:33.148
So you have to have so-called penance
to achieve the joy.

29:33.349 --> 29:40.146
The penance is to pull back your sense
organs inside yourself.

29:40.347 --> 29:43.898
As Krishna has said that you have
to pull back

29:44.099 --> 29:51.857
all your limbs of sense organs like
a tortoise does.

29:54.219 --> 30:00.947
So the excitement that you require

30:01.431 --> 30:07.803
for your sense organs is no more needed,

30:08.004 --> 30:16.868
because your sense organs, now, are
themselves the source of excitement.

30:19.602 --> 30:25.750
In the sense that they neutralise
all the excitements.

30:28.301 --> 30:32.845
You go to that point from where it starts.

30:34.547 --> 30:38.054
A river starts with a very small,
little drop,

30:38.255 --> 30:41.764
and then it expands, expands, expands,
expands.

30:41.965 --> 30:46.701
You go to the source, absolutely
to the central point,

30:47.851 --> 30:52.316
there you’ll find hardly even a drop falling on you.

30:53.670 --> 31:01.483
Another good example would be: a wheel
has the central point,

31:01.684 --> 31:05.593
and the wheel moves all the time but
the central point has to be fixed,

31:05.794 --> 31:11.775
otherwise the wheel, with the wheel
[if] that central point also moves,

31:11.983 --> 31:16.964
then the cart cannot move, [the] cart will
also start rolling down.

31:17.165 --> 31:23.184
So the central point has to be fixed
otherwise the wheel cannot move.

31:23.399 --> 31:29.189
So you go to that central point, and
the movement is on the central point

31:29.389 --> 31:36.888
where there is no movement, in a way,

31:37.089 --> 31:42.282
because there’s only ascent, there’s
no revolution.

31:42.483 --> 31:48.314
It doesn’t revolve any more, there’s just
ascent on the central point.

31:49.874 --> 31:55.821
I hope you try to understand that all
the movements come out of ignorance.

31:56.022 --> 32:03.026
All the outer movements come because we are
not yet on the central point.

32:03.227 --> 32:10.629
But that achievement is not difficult
because you have jumped onto it.

32:10.830 --> 32:17.123
But you again come out onto the periphery,
onto the wheel.

32:17.324 --> 32:22.223
So how to keep there, and to ascend
in that line?

32:22.424 --> 32:25.757
Say, for example, there are wheels
like this, wheels after wheels,

32:25.958 --> 32:32.084
but central point is fixed. Now every time
you jump out,

32:32.285 --> 32:36.171
now how do you go back to the central
point?

32:36.372 --> 32:45.261
Is by detachment, by tapah, by penance.

32:45.478 --> 32:48.974
Penance is to deny.

32:51.136 --> 32:58.532
It doesn’t mean asceticism of outside
but asceticism of within.

33:01.185 --> 33:05.483
First of all we must learn to give,

33:08.634 --> 33:11.991
give to others.

33:13.731 --> 33:16.527
That also sometimes people find it
difficult, I have seen.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.004
Even to give £1, they said,

33:19.084 --> 33:23.437
for Sahaja Yoga people find it difficult.
I was amazed!

33:26.784 --> 33:32.747
So to give to others is going to be
even worse.

33:32.948 --> 33:38.217
Try to give to others. Detachment.

33:38.804 --> 33:47.362
So one way is to have forgiveness,

33:48.164 --> 33:53.272
then second is generosity.

33:57.706 --> 34:03.274
If you work for Sahaja Yoga: “I haven’t
done anything so far”.

34:03.528 --> 34:06.609
Not to react to it what work you have done.

34:06.810 --> 34:12.123
“Oh, it’s pleasure, I did it. It’s my
pleasure, I did it. Just out of pleasure”.

34:12.324 --> 34:18.632
Don’t count it; “I brought four flowers,
she brought two flowers.

34:19.513 --> 34:23.764
I must be paid for one and a half flower.”

34:23.965 --> 34:29.784
All these calculations are on
the periphery, outside,

34:29.985 --> 34:34.225
when you were not realised souls. Now
you just don’t count anything else,

34:34.426 --> 34:40.764
but your blessings. So you be generous.

34:41.291 --> 34:47.505
I have seen now people have different
attachments, subtler ones.

34:47.706 --> 34:52.468
Like attached to their own children.
I have seen people [like that].

34:52.669 --> 34:55.088
Once their children are born
to Sahaja Yogis,

34:55.289 --> 34:58.848
then the whole world becomes
their children:

34:59.437 --> 35:03.590
you spoil them, you spoil yourself.

35:03.791 --> 35:10.164
You are just their trustees.

35:10.782 --> 35:15.523
But to you it becomes a very big thing
that you have produced a child.

35:15.724 --> 35:19.337
Anybody can produce, even a dog produces
a child, what is so great?

35:19.538 --> 35:22.056
I mean, the bitch.

35:24.004 --> 35:27.347
That’s a funny word to say.

35:29.478 --> 35:34.605
So, to create a child is not something
great, but that you have a child

35:34.806 --> 35:41.399
in charge of you, which has to work
for God.

35:41.600 --> 35:46.041
You are just in charge. But to identify
that, “This child is great,

35:46.242 --> 35:50.148
he’s a very big realised soul” and all
that, you see,

35:50.349 --> 35:54.786
will blast your head completely, because
it is subtler blasting.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.723
It’s like hydrogen bomb.

35:57.924 --> 36:03.394
Ordinary bombs can destroy [a] part of it,
but these subtler bombs are even worse.

36:03.595 --> 36:07.924
And that will spoil the child, that will
spoil

36:08.125 --> 36:13.077
also you very much in your ascent.

36:13.278 --> 36:17.502
So what you have to do is to see that
if you have a child,

36:17.703 --> 36:20.967
all right, you are just in charge,

36:23.336 --> 36:29.068
as you are in charge of all the children
of Sahaja Yogis, not [just] of your own.

36:29.269 --> 36:33.901
Be generous! “Udaara charitraanam
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”:

36:34.102 --> 36:39.443
The person who is a generous person,
for him, the whole world is his family.

36:39.644 --> 36:45.025
So expand yourself. “This is my family,
this is my wife,

36:45.226 --> 36:50.197
how can I live without my wife, or
my husband, my child, my…”

36:50.398 --> 36:56.281
This will not help you, this will tie you
down completely.

36:56.482 --> 37:02.401
This is a very subtler thing you start,
because now you are receding back.

37:02.608 --> 37:05.308
First you gave up your family, gave up
your children,

37:05.517 --> 37:08.360
gave up everything, came to this extreme,
now you are going back.

37:08.561 --> 37:12.356
For Indians they understand that they are
already too much in it,

37:12.557 --> 37:14.946
so they know that to detach yourself from
your children

37:15.147 --> 37:18.281
is very important because they are
already in it.

37:18.482 --> 37:21.196
They are too much attached to their
children.

37:21.397 --> 37:23.844
In the beginning, they’ll always tell me,
“My child is like this,

37:24.004 --> 37:27.066
my mother is like this, my father is like
this, my brother is like this,

37:27.267 --> 37:32.803
improve my…” and they’ll be all bhoots,
one better than the other!

37:33.004 --> 37:35.924
Without any discretion, bring all those
relations on my head

37:36.084 --> 37:38.643
and I feel terrible about it.

37:38.844 --> 37:43.254
Even a farfetched relation of a relation
of a relation of a relation

37:43.455 --> 37:46.082
they will bring it along that, “You see,
she’s my relation”.

37:46.283 --> 37:50.934
So, in India it’s very important that you
are a relation of such and such person,

37:51.135 --> 37:53.495
and you may not have anything to do
with that person

37:53.696 --> 37:57.227
but he’s a relation, so “He is a relation.”

37:59.255 --> 38:03.535
So, what we understand is that
our relationships

38:03.736 --> 38:08.406
and our identifications have to be dropped
completely.

38:10.180 --> 38:13.674
We are universal beings now.

38:16.844 --> 38:22.302
So your child is a source of joy – every
child should be the source of joy to you,

38:22.503 --> 38:25.922
every child should be. Bachelors that way
are better,

38:26.123 --> 38:31.001
or the ones who are not yet married,
they can enjoy everybody’s child nicely.

38:31.844 --> 38:35.039
But, when you are not a mother and
a father,

38:35.240 --> 38:38.010
if you are enjoying [other children],
what is so creditable?

38:38.211 --> 38:44.771
When you become the parents, and then
you enjoy other children

38:44.972 --> 38:50.394
as much as you enjoy your child, then
your generosity has started.

38:50.595 --> 38:57.973
So the generosity of loving others,
the generosity through compassion.

38:58.174 --> 39:02.192
Compassion doesn’t mean that you should
pity someone but compassion means

39:02.393 --> 39:10.844
the sharing of personality, sharing
of love personality.

39:11.045 --> 39:14.008
And that is where we miss the point,

39:14.209 --> 39:18.091
that compassion means if somebody
has to be helped.

39:18.292 --> 39:24.644
Sahaja Yoga compassion is not that,
Sahaja Yoga compassion is – it’s sharing.

39:26.269 --> 39:30.874
Now the fourth thing you have to remember.
What I have told you other?

39:31.075 --> 39:40.803
First is? Is the forgiveness. First!
According to Me is first is forgiveness.

39:41.004 --> 39:49.210
Second is, you can call it, the compassion,

39:49.411 --> 39:59.324
or the detachment leading to compassion.

40:00.248 --> 40:06.859
So you can call it the first one
as the forgiveness,

40:07.060 --> 40:12.363
[then] detachment and thirdly
the compassion.

40:12.564 --> 40:21.080
These are the wheels of your chariot which
moves you.

40:21.281 --> 40:24.925
These are the wheels you should remember.

40:25.171 --> 40:27.523
Now,

40:32.617 --> 40:38.242
if you go further with it, with
the detachment,

40:38.443 --> 40:46.230
supposing works out in you, even you
become compassionate, even that comes.

40:46.431 --> 40:54.612
Still what is the judging point? How do you
know that you are all right?

40:54.813 --> 41:02.484
How do you measure? How do you find out
that you are all right?

41:03.050 --> 41:07.963
I mean what you call the, take the bearing,
as they say, of the ship.

41:08.168 --> 41:17.075
How do you know? You must have peace,
you should be a peaceful person.

41:21.006 --> 41:24.661
Agitation should be outside,

41:27.083 --> 41:31.618
but you should be absolutely peaceful
person.

41:31.819 --> 41:35.037
If you are not a peaceful person,
then be sure

41:35.230 --> 41:39.727
that you are not yet there where you should
have been.

41:40.081 --> 41:48.726
Now you can say that, “Christ also got
very angry,

41:48.948 --> 41:54.884
Hhe took a whip in His hand and beat
the people, so we can also do the same.”

41:55.085 --> 41:58.706
You are not Christ. You are not
an incarnation,

41:58.907 --> 42:02.164
you must know, you are a realised soul.

42:03.507 --> 42:08.002
So you don’t have to take a whip in your
hand and hit others. You cannot.

42:08.203 --> 42:12.633
This is the mistake what the disciples
of Mohammad Sahib have done,

42:12.834 --> 42:15.264
that they never thought that He was
an incarnation, you see.

42:15.465 --> 42:21.811
All the incarnations have killed. Krishna
has killed, Rama has killed,

42:22.012 --> 42:26.994
Devi has killed. But you are not the Devi!

42:27.195 --> 42:33.727
You are not Shri Krishna! So you don’t have
to kill anyone.

42:33.928 --> 42:38.563
You don’t have to show the temper.
So if you still have a temper

42:38.764 --> 42:44.905
then know that your progress is very slow.
You have to be a peaceful person.

42:45.106 --> 42:49.092
Imagine Sahaja Yogis having a Jihad.
What do you say to that?

42:49.293 --> 42:56.500
Going with swords in the hand and a spear
in the hand and hitting others.

42:59.925 --> 43:03.124
This point I want to make very clear
because when I am there,

43:03.325 --> 43:07.518
of course, I am going to tell you everyone,
but when I am not there

43:07.719 --> 43:14.677
I don’t want you to take in your hands
the swords and things and fight.

43:19.404 --> 43:22.304
What William Blake has written is
for the incarnation.

43:22.505 --> 43:26.204
The Incarnations say, “Give me my…”

43:26.831 --> 43:32.352
It’s not that you should say now,
“Give me Rama’s Ayudhas.”

43:32.553 --> 43:36.110
You cannot use. You are not an incarnation.

43:36.311 --> 43:43.813
Because the discretion of these are
effective – yours are not.

43:48.564 --> 43:56.420
So you are not to take any weapon
into your hand or even anger.

43:57.248 --> 44:04.850
Doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi at any point,
unless and until I tell you to be angry.

44:07.844 --> 44:15.115
So this is the criteria, that you have to be
a peaceful person, not aggressive person.

44:17.205 --> 44:21.150
Now different people have different type
of aggressiveness.

44:21.351 --> 44:24.641
For example, men would start… men don’t
discuss, you see,

44:24.842 --> 44:28.320
they just slap you – finished. They
don't argue, they don’t like to argue,

44:28.521 --> 44:32.661
at a point they’ll go and they’ll just
hit you out and finished.

44:32.862 --> 44:38.145
But women are very good at argument,
and very aggressive,

44:38.346 --> 44:45.644
very aggressively argumentative. So you
don’t argue: is the second point.

44:46.528 --> 44:52.644
If you are argumentative then know that you
are not yet there where you have to be.

44:53.140 --> 44:58.041
A peaceful person goes to a point and then
argues it out.

44:58.326 --> 45:03.444
If you are argumentative then your progress
is not all right.

45:07.330 --> 45:13.549
So a person has to be absolutely peaceful

45:15.108 --> 45:22.344
and this peace is the most effective thing.
We are seeking the peace of the universe:

45:22.684 --> 45:28.283
you cannot achieve it through any one
of these bombs,

45:28.484 --> 45:35.517
you can only achieve it through the Spirit
which is the source of all the peace.

45:38.188 --> 45:44.143
So, I would request all of you to give up
tempers, angers.

45:44.344 --> 45:50.161
Peace is the greatest powerful thing
on this earth.

45:50.693 --> 45:53.272
There’s a story, a Chinese story,
interesting, about it.

45:53.473 --> 46:01.345
There were two very great fighting cocks,
you see, known to be the greatest of all.

46:01.546 --> 46:06.944
And they have this, you see, excitement
again of the cock-fighting in China.

46:07.145 --> 46:11.443
I mean, you can have of everything in this
world, all absurd things,

46:11.644 --> 46:16.581
like rugby, football, this, that, I mean,
there’s no end to it!

46:16.782 --> 46:27.404
So these, these two cocks were to go in for
an international sort of a fight, I think.

46:27.605 --> 46:30.226
So they said, “There is one great saint
living here,

46:30.427 --> 46:35.030
he makes everyone very powerful.”
So the owner of the cocks went to him

46:35.231 --> 46:39.477
and he said, “Will you make my these
two cocks very powerful,

46:39.678 --> 46:44.443
so that they can fight, they can fight
and win?”

46:44.644 --> 46:49.135
He said, “All right, it’s very simple.
All right, you leave them with me.”

46:50.764 --> 46:53.987
So after a month when he appeared
to take the cocks,

46:54.188 --> 46:58.604
they would not react to anything, they
were just standing like this, watching.

46:59.464 --> 47:01.764
He got a fright of his life, he said,
“How are they going to fight?”

47:01.965 --> 47:05.510
He said, “You just take them, you’ll see.”

47:05.711 --> 47:10.244
So he took them to the arena and put them
there,

47:10.585 --> 47:14.095
and all the cocks, you see, invaded
each other, fought.

47:14.296 --> 47:17.856
These they were just watching, these two
were watching!

47:19.232 --> 47:23.397
And all the rest of them got so frightened
with these two, they all ran away -

47:23.598 --> 47:26.411
and they won!

47:28.075 --> 47:34.387
So the person who is peaceful is
the powerful [one].

47:34.588 --> 47:39.800
The one who does not react to anything
else, is the most powerful.

47:44.154 --> 47:50.272
So, one has to understand that peace
is the criteria to know

47:50.473 --> 47:58.945
that you are absolutely at that point
where you have to be.

47:59.146 --> 48:02.363
But peace by no chance means cowardliness.

48:02.564 --> 48:06.158
Because, you see, I know what indiscretion
is, human indiscretion.

48:06.359 --> 48:12.871
They think then cowardliness. No. You stand
like this - not like this.

48:13.072 --> 48:17.563
The difference between a peaceful person
and a cowardly person is

48:17.764 --> 48:22.563
that a cowardly person acts to the negative
forces,

48:22.763 --> 48:28.293
and a peaceful person creates positive
forces, constructive forces.

48:28.494 --> 48:30.869
Generates it.

48:35.486 --> 48:39.002
So you are not to be cowardly, but you
have to be peaceful.

48:39.203 --> 48:45.496
And a peaceful person is like a magnet,
you see, so soothing it is.

48:45.764 --> 48:52.581
So you can see now we are moving towards
the soothing qualities of the Spirit.

48:52.782 --> 48:57.985
We have to soothe others, and not
to excite, but to soothe.

48:58.890 --> 49:09.391
And that soothing quality, what you call,
is, we call it like the ghee:

49:09.592 --> 49:15.764
when the body is charred and is absolutely
burning,

49:15.965 --> 49:24.854
then you put some sort of a ghee on it
so it becomes smooth,

49:25.055 --> 49:33.729
like lubrication, [a] lubricant. Such
a personality is a lubricant.

49:34.221 --> 49:41.283
It doesn’t go into friction, but reduces
frictions.

49:41.484 --> 49:44.302
It’s a lubricant temperament.

49:44.503 --> 49:48.764
So you should judge yourself, “Am I
a lubricant personality?”

49:48.965 --> 49:54.249
For example, you see two persons
are fighting, all right?

49:54.450 --> 49:58.064
And one goes as a peace-maker;

49:59.164 --> 50:03.314
and one goes to excite it more, you see,
he joins them.

50:03.515 --> 50:06.400
Now the one who is the peacemaker
is the blessed one,

50:06.570 --> 50:15.411
is the one who is the one moving towards
God because he is the peacemaker.

50:15.846 --> 50:20.062
“Blessed are those who are
the peacemakers.”

50:20.263 --> 50:23.733
All these things if you see are, what I am
telling today is the same –

50:23.934 --> 50:27.776
but in a different language, that’s all –
what Christ said it.

50:27.977 --> 50:30.252
To understand Christ you have to open
Him out more,

50:30.453 --> 50:35.230
because He said it in very simple words,
which has very deep meanings

50:35.431 --> 50:39.013
and only a Sahaja Yogi can understand Him.

50:41.081 --> 50:44.641
So you have to make peace.

50:45.324 --> 50:51.249
I have seen people been given Nobel prizes
of peace, who have no peace within at all.

50:51.450 --> 50:57.872
They are hot-tempered, horrible people and
given Nobel prize for peace! All right.

50:58.295 --> 51:04.561
And personified temper, absolutely
hot-tempered; and you call it peace!

51:04.762 --> 51:09.764
How can you have peace with a person
who is so hot-tempered?

51:09.965 --> 51:15.462
So this is possible. In this human
endeavour anything is possible, you see.

51:15.663 --> 51:18.997
It’s sometimes so absurd, you see.

51:19.198 --> 51:26.064
Like I have seen people getting a degree,
“doctorate of learning”,

51:26.265 --> 51:30.925
who has not even been to a school, who
doesn’t know how to read the book!

51:31.484 --> 51:35.908
Anything is possible because it is just
a maneuvering of everything,

51:36.109 --> 51:39.027
it’s so artificial.

51:42.931 --> 51:54.803
So the lubrication of your love, the love.

51:55.004 --> 51:58.675
So the love that you enjoy is not what
is bestowed upon you,

51:58.876 --> 52:02.523
but what you bestow upon others.

52:03.205 --> 52:06.563
The idea of love is also funny.

52:06.764 --> 52:11.404
It’s just the opposite of what you have
seen so far.

52:13.289 --> 52:16.564
They’ll write, “I love you”, all right?

52:16.765 --> 52:20.604
And the second sentence will be,
“I want to divorce you.”

52:23.456 --> 52:26.052
And the modern fashion is like that.
“I love you;

52:26.253 --> 52:30.520
I want to divorce you because I love you
too much!”

52:37.250 --> 52:45.925
“Because I want to spare you!” Is very
modern, very sophisticated it is.

52:48.276 --> 52:54.616
So the love that hurts others, love that
tortures others,

52:55.148 --> 52:58.796
the love that expects, is not love.

52:59.254 --> 53:06.659
Love that just flows, just forgives,
is just compassion,

53:06.859 --> 53:10.635
is the most enjoyable thing.

53:11.079 --> 53:16.295
Radiant, just like the sunshine,
like Christ

53:16.496 --> 53:24.564
who even forgave those who crucified Him!
Imagine! Imagine!

53:27.876 --> 53:32.283
Because He knew that God will not forgive.
Even God will not forgive those –

53:32.484 --> 53:35.764
He tried to forgive them.

53:40.062 --> 53:43.155
But we, those who call themselves
Christians,

53:43.356 --> 53:47.684
those who are supposed to be Christians
are just the opposite of Christ,

53:47.885 --> 53:54.816
just the opposite in every way, if you see,
just the opposite.

53:55.501 --> 54:02.085
So, you come to a point where you
understand that you become the love.

54:03.206 --> 54:07.436
And when it is pure love relationships,

54:07.637 --> 54:14.738
then there is no lust and greed or
anything, but just love and purity of love.

54:15.145 --> 54:22.039
You don’t want to do it  because you
want to have

54:22.240 --> 54:26.606
any lust out of that person. Just see,
the opposite.

54:26.807 --> 54:32.687
Here the girl is very ‘attractive’. What is
so attractive?

54:32.888 --> 54:40.380
They, to my eyes they look like mosquitoes;
Horrible! Sometimes like witches, you know.

54:40.581 --> 54:44.921
Their nails and all that look like, to me,
like witches: so artificial.

54:45.122 --> 54:47.996
Just like machines, sometimes.

54:48.197 --> 54:53.603
What is so attractive in these women?
Or in these men? You see.

54:53.804 --> 54:58.499
They look like skulls to me, sometimes and
sometimes like, Frankenstein

54:58.700 --> 55:03.255
I don’t know what they look like, horrible.
The way they walk,

55:03.456 --> 55:07.924
the way they try to impress. I mean,
nothing but fear comes out of them.

55:08.125 --> 55:13.198
So, what you emit out of your love
to others

55:13.399 --> 55:17.815
[is] a sense of security, an ocean
of security you can call it.

55:20.168 --> 55:24.808
Everyone feels secured, secured with you.

55:26.117 --> 55:32.657
And that security will be felt by you.

55:33.684 --> 55:41.203
Trust, trust others. You must trust.
That is very important.

55:41.404 --> 55:46.192
Trust for everything. I have seen some
people are very serious on money,

55:46.393 --> 55:52.443
some are very serious about possessions,
some are this. I know they…

55:52.644 --> 55:56.388
they are sometimes weak people.

55:57.446 --> 56:00.757
Could be weak about money, could be
weak about possessions,

56:00.958 --> 56:04.991
could be even insulting to things that
should not be so:

56:05.192 --> 56:12.206
but don’t lose your temper, just have
forgiveness for them,

56:12.960 --> 56:17.908
and let them feel secured, absolutely
secured. Trust.

56:18.109 --> 56:23.404
You see, as you know that I never ask
the trustees to give me any reports.

56:23.564 --> 56:28.684
I do not ask them to give me any – what you
call - the accounts or anything.

56:28.764 --> 56:31.527
I don’t understand accounts at all myself,
you see.

56:31.728 --> 56:35.027
So I never see how many accounts you
have got, what money you have got

56:35.228 --> 56:38.729
or, say, supposing Gavin is saying that,
“I am sending money now, Mother, to you,”

56:38.930 --> 56:40.994
whatever I receive, iIt’s all right –
finished.

56:41.195 --> 56:43.348
I don’t know whether he gives you
receipts or not, nothing.

56:43.549 --> 56:45.849
If he says so [it’s] all right. I leave it
to him.

56:46.050 --> 56:49.283
He has to grow, whatever it is. It is
his responsibility,

56:49.484 --> 56:54.182
if he’s not grown up enough he’ll grow.
So trust others because in Sahaja Yoga

56:54.383 --> 56:58.044
you must know we are all growing, we are
all transforming.

56:58.245 --> 57:02.626
So we must grow, we must grow
and for growth

57:02.827 --> 57:06.718
security is the most important thing.

57:06.919 --> 57:11.684
If there is no security for a tree it will
never grow.

57:11.885 --> 57:18.352
So everybody should feel secured
in the company of Sahaja Yogis.

57:19.671 --> 57:25.334
If there is any insecurity from someone
then it should be reported

57:25.535 --> 57:31.572
to the collective and [you] should see that
all such cases of insecurity creating,

57:31.773 --> 57:37.275
trouble creators should be, little bit,
taken out for the time being.

57:37.476 --> 57:39.311
Because there should be a healthy growth.

57:39.512 --> 57:43.316
But growth must take place and for that
you must trust.

57:43.517 --> 57:45.924
Somebody might make mistakes – all right,
doesn’t matter.

57:46.125 --> 57:51.372
Somebody may be dishonest – doesn’t matter.
But give them security.

57:53.694 --> 57:57.764
But what we do is to give security
to bhoots, I have seen, [it’s] very common.

57:57.965 --> 58:02.202
People will have only interest
in the bhootish people.

58:02.876 --> 58:06.355
They will trust a bhootish people than to
trust a person who is a little dishonest.

58:06.556 --> 58:08.871
Doesn’t matter. You see, what is
dishonesty?

58:09.072 --> 58:11.283
Supposing somebody doesn’t give income
tax, doesn’t matter,

58:11.484 --> 58:15.093
it is this government, or it’s that
government. What does it matter to us?

58:15.294 --> 58:19.513
As long as that person is honest to God
it’s sufficient.

58:19.719 --> 58:24.317
Our honesty is of a different level. So we
become angry with that person,

58:24.518 --> 58:29.448
we get upset with that person. There’s
nothing to get angry.

58:29.649 --> 58:33.589
Actually my system as you know is that
I know also that people

58:33.790 --> 58:38.474
who have mismanaged money, who have
not been all right, I know it, somehow,

58:38.675 --> 58:41.846
without knowing accounts. But I said,
“Just forgive, forgive, forgive”.

58:42.023 --> 58:46.883
I know everything but I just say,
“Forgive, doesn’t matter.”

58:48.029 --> 58:51.159
Then, you might say, with rationality,
that, “Mother, such a person

58:51.360 --> 58:56.274
will go ahead with it”. No he won’t!
You try and trust.

58:56.607 --> 59:02.223
Why? Because they are growing, they are
coming to light

59:02.424 --> 59:09.435
and the more light they see the better they
become. This trust has to be there.

59:10.875 --> 59:16.088
Trusting in God that He will give him
the right path.

59:18.297 --> 59:25.162
So this understanding about your growth

59:26.538 --> 59:32.048
is within yourself, which you can see.

59:32.249 --> 59:36.400
And the highest of all is the collectivity.

59:36.601 --> 59:40.638
Not the fraternity of bhoots, but
collectivity.

59:40.844 --> 59:48.250
Again discretion has to be used – how far
you are collective.

59:49.116 --> 59:52.481
If a person thinks he is a very great
person and he can correct everyone

59:52.683 --> 59:58.766
and he can punish everyone and do
as he likes, then he is not collective.

59:58.967 --> 01:00:03.143
But sometimes you have to also understand
that even with bhootish people

01:00:03.344 --> 01:00:09.320
I have to stoop down to conquer them,
to bring them up.

01:00:11.434 --> 01:00:19.083
Don’t become like them, try to elevate them
than to go down to their level.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.404
And if you can manage that, then you have
achieved

01:00:23.605 --> 01:00:27.608
what you wanted to do through
your collectivity.

01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:32.690
And a person has to be collective. If he is
not collective

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:38.636
then one must know that there’s something
definitely wrong with that person.

01:00:42.895 --> 01:00:52.288
Then what you have to do after detachment
from things [is] the penance part of it.

01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:55.958
For this we have to be doing some penance.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:01:00.545
For example if you are too much attached
to anything: say you are fond of food.

01:01:00.746 --> 01:01:05.161
Many people are, I know that. The tongue
is the worst of all.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:08.438
If you can control tongue you have
controlled at least 50%

01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:12.484
of your sense organs. If you are attached
to the tongue [you should say,]

01:01:12.685 --> 01:01:16.030
“These days I am going into a big penance,
I am eating just boiled food

01:01:16.231 --> 01:01:21.200
without salt, without anything in it,
just boiled food. Going into penance.

01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:25.983
I have to! For 9 months.”

01:01:26.184 --> 01:01:31.361
For me it doesn’t matter. It’s no penance
for me because I’ve no tongue at all,

01:01:31.562 --> 01:01:36.654
no taste buds, [so] I can manage.
So whatever you like too much,

01:01:36.855 --> 01:01:39.959
“Ahaa! I love to have something.” You see,
specially here I’ve seen

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.950
if you see good food or anything – “Mmmm…”

01:01:47.063 --> 01:01:53.244
Now, it’s as cold as ice. Should I have it?
I can if you want,

01:01:53.445 --> 01:01:57.617
but it’s rather cold, I think you would
like to give me hot. All right.

01:01:57.818 --> 01:02:00.661
I don’t mind having it. All right.

01:02:00.862 --> 01:02:13.484
So now what you have to do is have a kind
of self-directed discipline.

01:02:13.685 --> 01:02:20.311
Self-directed. Not on others.
Self-directed.

01:02:21.948 --> 01:02:26.673
“Do I meditate in the morning? I don’t.
So what’s wrong with me?

01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:30.090
I’m supposed to be a Sahaja Yogi.”

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:38.380
Don’t have - nobody has to tell you.
You yourself should do this to yourself.

01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:41.808
You are fond of food? “All right, doesn’t
matter, I’ll fast for two days”.

01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:44.413
No fasting is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
all right,

01:02:44.614 --> 01:02:47.084
but fasting for detachment is all right,

01:02:47.244 --> 01:02:51.383
not for God’s Sake, but for your sake
you do it.

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:56.244
“I like a particular type of cake.
All right, I’ll not have it.

01:02:56.452 --> 01:02:59.222
I’ll not have it for one year”. But no,
people have to give up,

01:02:59.423 --> 01:03:03.109
then they’ll give up something like
Rhubarb! [a bitter vegetable]

01:03:11.548 --> 01:03:15.940
So one should not be cunning about it, you
see, should not be cunning with yourself.

01:03:16.141 --> 01:03:18.772
So what you have to do is to see that,

01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:22.993
“Where does this mind go? What is
the attraction?”

01:03:23.194 --> 01:03:27.277
I mean, even now, I find some people are
like Romeo - Juliets, you see,

01:03:27.478 --> 01:03:33.644
still living in that area of Romeo Juliet-
ness. Get out of it! [It’s] Nonsense.

01:03:37.861 --> 01:03:41.883
Get out of that kind of a thing. That
doesn’t mean you become [a] dry personality

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:47.013
of another extreme, can be, that you just
become like sticks, that’s not the point.

01:03:47.214 --> 01:03:52.814
But you should not indulge into
these things.

01:03:53.774 --> 01:03:56.640
These are all artificial things.

01:03:56.841 --> 01:04:02.647
So a tapah is to be established within
yourself. Self-discipline.

01:04:02.848 --> 01:04:07.381
Now those who talk too much should stop
talking, absolutely mauna is the ilaaj.

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:12.315
Mauna is the treatment for such people.
Just don’t talk!

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:18.831
Those who do not talk, most of the English
men don’t talk, women talk too much.

01:04:19.032 --> 01:04:24.265
It’s a fact. I’ve seen – any interview,
you see, the woman will talk first.

01:04:24.466 --> 01:04:26.404
This [police] constable lady died, [and]
her mother was talking!

01:04:26.564 --> 01:04:29.298
In India a mother would not be
in a position to talk, you know.

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:32.481
The father was sitting quietly. You just
can’t imagine.

01:04:32.682 --> 01:04:35.484
In India supposing a child dies like that,
you see,

01:04:35.564 --> 01:04:39.384
the mother would be absolutely sobbing,
in a mess, she won’t be talking.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:42.023
Here the woman was talking, we were
so surprised!

01:04:42.224 --> 01:04:45.490
You see, the women talk too much [here],

01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:51.404
men just don’t talk, they are not supposed
to talk, I think, they just keep quiet.

01:04:51.605 --> 01:04:55.522
At the most they might be slapping.
I don’t know what they do.

01:04:57.884 --> 01:05:01.289
So what we have to do is to teach ourselves

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:06.619
that, if our tongue talks too much, then we
better keep quiet.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.554
If we do not talk, we better talk, we
should teach ourselves how to talk.

01:05:11.755 --> 01:05:14.518
Now go and talk to the sea, go and talk
to some tree,

01:05:14.719 --> 01:05:22.062
go and talk to someone like that. Or best
is to talk to me, to my photograph.

01:05:22.263 --> 01:05:28.125
So that’s how you achieve a kind
of a control over your tongue.

01:05:28.326 --> 01:05:33.483
To talk sweetly. Some people have to go
through penance for that.

01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:41.680
For them to talk sweetly is like taking
rhubarb again

01:05:41.881 --> 01:05:46.154
They just can’t talk sweetly, just can’t.
Sarcasm.

01:05:46.355 --> 01:05:54.975
You see, in that sarcasm they have
a special pleasure.

01:05:55.707 --> 01:06:00.867
Try to say something sweetly. You can be
humorous without being sarcastic.

01:06:01.068 --> 01:06:05.213
Humour is the best way. What is the need
to be sarcastic?

01:06:05.414 --> 01:06:08.948
There’s no need at all. Is a sign
of cowardliness, I think, sarcasm,

01:06:09.149 --> 01:06:13.429
is a sign that you want to hurt others,
but you are not straightforward.

01:06:13.629 --> 01:06:16.782
So try to avoid sarcastic talking.

01:06:16.983 --> 01:06:21.637
If you are sarcastic, better tell your
tongue to behave itself.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:27.086
So, little disciplining towards yourself,
punishment what you call,

01:06:27.287 --> 01:06:31.178
or the tapah, the penance has to work out.

01:06:31.379 --> 01:06:34.975
Now people have so many ways of, you see,
seeing things.

01:06:35.176 --> 01:06:39.860
Some men want to see women all the time,
some women want to see men all the time

01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:44.491
or clothes or anything, you see.
Now, the difference is that

01:06:44.692 --> 01:06:48.330
when you see something, it reacts.

01:06:48.531 --> 01:06:56.150
The difference between my looking
at anything is that, that reacts.

01:06:59.426 --> 01:07:04.720
When I look at you, your Kundalini reacts,
when I look at this, it gets vibrated.

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:12.211
Kataksha, kataksha: Every eye… -
Kataksha, what is… -

01:07:12.412 --> 01:07:17.133
every glance, every glance

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:24.296
makes the thing react. And nirikshana
means, I know what it is.

01:07:24.497 --> 01:07:27.550
I know what it is. Just looking at a person
I know what it is.

01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:31.607
Looking at a thing, I know what it is -
nirikshana.

01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:34.594
And the whole thing is in the memory
there, you see.

01:07:34.795 --> 01:07:38.218
Like, we were going and they said
we have only black stones.

01:07:38.419 --> 01:07:40.942
I said, “No, you have red also.” He said,
“Where do you know?”

01:07:41.143 --> 01:07:43.364
So I told them [the] exact spot where
to get the red stones.

01:07:43.565 --> 01:07:46.400
They said, “How do you know, Mother?”
I said, “We passed that way

01:07:46.601 --> 01:07:49.014
about eight days back and I know there
are red stones.”

01:07:49.215 --> 01:07:56.267
So everything I see gets vibrated and also
I note

01:07:56.468 --> 01:08:04.587
what is there, and is all ready there to be
used at a proper time.

01:08:05.263 --> 01:08:12.358
But what do I do? What do I do?
I do nothing.

01:08:14.918 --> 01:08:22.645
I do nothing. I don’t think, I don’t plan.
Everything that you do, I don’t do.

01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:34.165
So when you have that kind of a temperament
you’ll be amazed,

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.676
the amount of dynamism that will work
it out.

01:08:38.877 --> 01:08:45.827
You don’t have to create a dynamo, it’s
inside you. Let it work it out.

01:08:46.314 --> 01:08:50.633
Today I had told Gavin that I won’t have
so much of a puja but I’ll talk.

01:08:50.834 --> 01:08:54.476
Because puja is all right, it talks
for itself and this thing.

01:08:54.677 --> 01:09:00.070
But I wanted to talk to you because now
the time has come for us to go further.

01:09:00.271 --> 01:09:05.247
As a result of all this, all this, that
when you do [it],

01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:10.291
you become the Truth, you become the Truth.

01:09:13.636 --> 01:09:18.455
So, in every chakra if you concentrate,
and use the chakra

01:09:18.656 --> 01:09:24.653
to detach yourself from the particular
quality of that chakra.

01:09:24.854 --> 01:09:30.383
Like, now for example, the Nabhi chakra
does the digestion.

01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:36.442
Now you don’t worry what you should
eat to digest.

01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:40.930
Just detach yourself from there, with
vibrations, if you just see and eat

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:45.597
whatever is there, you will digest.

01:09:48.239 --> 01:09:54.182
And then you become the Truth. Truth
that is love, that is God.

01:09:54.547 --> 01:09:56.412
May God Bless you all.
