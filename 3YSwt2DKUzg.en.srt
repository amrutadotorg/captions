1
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:21,180
Today is the day we are celebrating Easter.

2
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:36,180
Easter is extremely symbolic, of - not only
of Christ, but also for all of us.

3
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:49,659
In that the most important day is that of
resurrection.

4
00:00:49,659 --> 00:01:06,370
The resurrection of Christ has 
the message of Christianity, not the cross.

5
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:21,210
Through resurrection Christ had shown that
one can be resurrected with the body that

6
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,010
you have.

7
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:37,240
And without His resurrection, we could not
have managed the crossing of Agnya chakra,

8
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,550
no doubt.

9
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:54,500
His life was very short of, we can say three
and half years only, He lived there.

10
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:04,729
He came to India and He met Shalivahana, and
Shalivahana asked His name.

11
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,799
He told him His name was Isa Masih.

12
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:16,010
But He said, "I am coming from the country
where there are malichchas, mala-ichchha.

13
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:26,630
They have ichchha of mal, desire to get dirty,
and I don't know how to live there.

14
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,819
To Me, this is My country."

15
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:40,150
But Shalivahana said that, "You should go
back and save Your people and give them Parama

16
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,280
Nirmala Tattwam.

17
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,980
So He went back, and as it is, within three
and half years He was crucified.

18
00:02:50,980 --> 00:03:02,960
At the time of His death He said so many beautiful
things for forgiveness, but ultimately He

19
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,310
said "Behold the Mother."

20
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,960
That means you should hope for the Mother.

21
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:23,030
And in His lifetime He also said that, "I'll
send you the Holy Ghost Who will comfort you,

22
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,879
counsel you and also redeem", means resurrect
you.

23
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:38,610
All these things He had said it because He
knew what was the whole plan.

24
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:48,180
Also He said that, "You may say anything against
Me or do anything against Me, but anything

25
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,519
against the Holy Ghost I will not tolerate.

26
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,370
I will not tolerate at any cost."

27
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:09,360
Which is true also, so it is very dangerous
also to go against the Holy Ghost.

28
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,810
No doubt about it.

29
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,670
It's not Me that is dangerous, but these Deities
are extremely dangerous.

30
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:29,940
So, in Sahaja Yoga you are all resurrected
with your body.

31
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,960
Before this you were not connected to the
All Pervading Power, and whatever you did

32
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,080
was through your mind or through your emotions.

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:05:02,450
But you did not come out of that grave of
emotions and your desires, your actions and

34
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,530
your ego.

35
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,930
After realization now you know how free you
have become.

36
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:26,530
How you have developed your own personality.

37
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:38,449
There are so many instances which we can talk
about Christ, that He said, "Know Thyself"

38
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:39,520
throughout.

39
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,960
He knew without knowing yourself, you won't
be resurrected.

40
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,290
But Sahaja Yoga is the other way round.

41
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,880
You get your resurrection and you know yourself.

42
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:02,740
It's a very Sahaja, sweet way of getting realization.

43
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:12,580
But if you see to the life of Christ, He has
talked about murmuring souls.

44
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,080
We too have in Sahaja Yoga, because it's open
to everyone, all kinds of people come.

45
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:28,830
We find very shallow people coming to Sahaja
Yoga who try to express their shallowness

46
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:41,310
and talk in a very, in a very 
loose way, about Sahaja Yoga, about the work

47
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,210
of Sahaja Yoga.

48
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:52,479
So that was inevitable, but what Christ has
said that you have to be careful about the

49
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
murmuring souls.

50
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,330
And this is exactly - we have to be very careful.

51
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,419
When you come to Sahaja Yoga, in the beginning,
you may come across such people who are murmuring

52
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:20,110
souls, you may be enticed by them because
they are a kind of, we should say, messengers

53
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,800
of negative forces.

54
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,430
And these messengers of negative forces, you
should try to find out.

55
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,890
They'll complain about this, complain about
that, they talk in a very loose manner, and

56
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:48,210
when you see that they are not talking in
a positive way, you should run away from them.

57
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,669
Because only by getting your resurrection
you are not all right.

58
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,680
After getting your resurrection, after your
Self-realization, you have to grow.

59
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:10,599
And for that growth we have to be very careful
about how we get impressed by all these, I

60
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,509
should say, very frivolous people.

61
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:21,169
Those who grow into it become beautiful angels.

62
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,160
No doubt about that.

63
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,759
But that is one thing one has to know is to
respect your Self-realization.

64
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,699
You shouldn't worry about what others are
talking, what others are saying, what they

65
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:42,520
are criticizing, but you should look at yourself
and all the time try to grow into your depth.

66
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,369
It's a very great chance of life that you
are being resurrected, and this is the last

67
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,889
breakthrough, as you know, of our evolution.

68
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:58,329
But now you should leave your mind on one
side; because this mind, if you go on working

69
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:05,829
with it, you cannot go beyond mind and Sahaja
Yoga you can achieve by going beyond your

70
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,100
mind.

71
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,350
Then you know yourself, because you get Self-knowledge.

72
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,029
You know about your centers.

73
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,110
You know about the centers of others.

74
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:26,800
All this is available to you, but you have
to become a subtler and subtler person.

75
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,269
Not a gross personality.

76
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:37,420
If you become subtler and subtler, you will
be amazed how you will develop your inner

77
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,869
powers in so many different ways.

78
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:48,850
But there are people in Sahaja Yoga, I have
seen, who are very ambitious.

79
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,699
And they start saying that, "Mother, we want
to be God realized.

80
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:57,399
I want to be this and do that."

81
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,220
There is no office going on here that you
give somebody a promotion.

82
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,470
You have to grow yourself.

83
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,360
Then they start proclaiming, "I am this, I
am that."

84
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,540
We call them 'Mahayogis'.

85
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,889
Some of them had started saying that they
have reached very high positions and they

86
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:23,399
ended up in the lunatic asylum.

87
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:32,040
All such suggestions if people give you, then
you should shun such people.

88
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,220
But there are also other people who join such
a bombastic fellow.

89
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:50,009
So, you must remember that this last judgment
is working and all the time there is a big

90
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:59,869
sieving out, a very big arrangement of choices.

91
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:05,369
Those who are subtle, start getting subtler
and subtler and subtler.

92
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:15,579
But those who are frivolous, gross, idiotic,
stupid, they start frittering away.

93
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:25,290
So this last sieving starts very fast, working
out where we realize that where are we.

94
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,910
Now what is the criteria for that?

95
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,549
First is your compassion.

96
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:44,639
Your compassion must be discrete.

97
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,199
Sometimes people only have compassion for
negative people.

98
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:58,199
After Sahaja Yoga you should know for whom
you should have your compassion.

99
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:05,819
With vibrations you can find out, very easy
to find out with vibrations - what sort of

100
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,920
a person you are facing.

101
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,329
But first you must have vibratory awareness.

102
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:24,350
If you don't have vibratory awareness, you
won't be able to find out at all what is correct

103
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,290
and what is incorrect.

104
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,989
So it is important that you all must mediate.

105
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:37,790
Without criticizing yourself, anything, you
can just meditate everyday.

106
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,160
Is very important!

107
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:47,709
I immediately know who is the person who is
meditating and who is not meditating.

108
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:48,709
Immediately!

109
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:58,100
The person who meditates is very clearly an
angel.

110
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:09,939
The whole reaction, the whole behavior, the
whole attitude of such spiritual maturity

111
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:11,739
manifests.

112
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:16,160
And you are amazed.

113
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,049
As you know Sahasrare Mahamaya.

114
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,220
It's not easy to understand Me.

115
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:31,430
For the time being you might know what I am,
but suddenly you will forget.

116
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,059
That's the trick.

117
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:38,720
Because if you know Me in full ways, you won't
even sit here.

118
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,660
You won't even come nearer to Me.

119
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:51,610
So that Mahamaya is acting all the time, but
that's the only way you can judge people.

120
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,560
This last judgment is not a easy thing.

121
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,180
Even if you put thousands of judges, they
cannot do this judgment.

122
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:07,869
All the time you have to know what is what.

123
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:14,999
And somehow I know everything, but I will
never show that I know.

124
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:24,169
That's how I work it out, and gradually I
know what I have to do about that person.

125
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:33,029
This resurrection of yours is much more blessed
than that of Christ.

126
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:37,730
He was alone; people wouldn't recognize Him.

127
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:45,109
He had to show His marks where they had put
nails on His hands and feet.

128
00:14:45,109 --> 00:14:48,649
But today that is not the situation.

129
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:55,230
Only thing is, first of all you have to recognize
Me.

130
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,549
That's all.

131
00:14:56,549 --> 00:14:58,499
Need not know Me.

132
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,499
It's not easy.

133
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:05,389
It's difficult to know Me, but if you recognize
Me, that's all.

134
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:09,310
And it all depends on your sensitivity.

135
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:18,839
Your resurrection has to be complete and you
have to mature in Sahaja Yoga.

136
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,839
If you cannot mature, I will say you should
leave Sahaja Yoga.

137
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:32,579
Go out for a while, where you will understand
what's going on, then you'll come back.

138
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:44,829
In Sahaja Yoga, like Christ sacrificed His
life, is not expected of you to sacrifice

139
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:45,829
your life.

140
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:48,720
Your Mother doesn't want that.

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:59,319
But you have to do some sacrifices, like you
have to stay in uncomfortable places in Ganapatipule

142
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,339
sometimes, or somewhere.

143
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:12,669
You have to face many odds while traveling,
also coming down here may not be so comfortable

144
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:16,389
as you are at your place.

145
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:21,609
But the main sacrifice is of your ego.

146
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:23,679
You have to crucify your ego.

147
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:34,110
The ego is the one, which teaches you all
these nonsensical tantrums that people know.

148
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:45,819
If you can surrender your ego - just surrender
your ego - that surrendering can help you.

149
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:55,959
But if you surrender your ego by thinking
about it, then you are using your mental capacity.

150
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,489
Everything you do like that is through your
mental capacity, by which you are using your

151
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,770
ego.

152
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:13,179
So the best way is to meditate, to go into
thoughtless awareness and there automatically

153
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,870
you are surrendered.

154
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,769
Now what do I have to have from you?

155
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:18,769
Nothing!

156
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:19,769
I don't want anything.

157
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,909
I don't want to have anything.

158
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,630
You are the ones who try to give Me this and
give Me that.

159
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,110
I am trying to run away from all that.

160
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:33,720
Just for your satisfaction also, I agree.

161
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:41,669
I don't have to do Sahaja Yoga Myself, but
that's the love of your Mother.

162
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:50,929
That She wants to save as many as possible
- all that are created on this Earth - to

163
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:51,929
give them their resurrection.

164
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,840
This is a special time and you are My channels.

165
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,169
You can go all over and spread Sahaja Yoga
and try to help others to come out of it.

166
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:14,669
Today is a day of promises, where we have
to promise ourselves that we'll grow in a

167
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:26,649
very deeper understanding, or feeling, or
in sensitiveness of Sahaja Yoga.

168
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:34,100
This growth has to take place for which I
have to meditate.

169
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,700
This is a very important thing.

170
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:44,160
Secondly, people say that here people are
very miserly.

171
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,380
They are not willing to do this.

172
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,019
They don't want to pay any money for this,
pay any money for that.

173
00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:55,270
I think generosity is one expression of your
love.

174
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,490
You will give Me, all right.

175
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,440
When it comes to expenses, either I pay or
somebody bears the burden.

176
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,130
Now things have improved, but still we should
know that this tremendous work has to be done

177
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,880
and we need money for that.

178
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,539
I don't need, I spend My own money.

179
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:29,490
But generosity is the best and this generosity
is very, very important for Sahaja Yogis.

180
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,100
I have seen people are very meticulous sometimes,
very calculating.

181
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,320
They will tell Me, "Bring some sarees for
them."

182
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,309
Take some sarees, all right, very good idea.

183
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,210
And they say, "We don't like it, we don't
want to buy."

184
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,700
I am not doing any business.

185
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,600
I buy it because you wanted, I have selected
it.

186
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,730
Then to say, "we don't want to have it."

187
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,240
There's no business, there's no marketing
going on.

188
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:05,260
And this is the problem when I don't understand
Sahaja Yogis that they should know Mother,

189
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,090
Herself, has put in Her money.

190
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,960
So what is there also, they should say, "take
little more for Sahaja Yoga."

191
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,860
After all such a big organization going on,
and there are so many countries who cannot

192
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,740
pay a single farthing, for them also one has
to pay.

193
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,179
Now, Christ was sold for thirty rubles.

194
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,029
You can imagine, He was sold for thirty rubles.

195
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:44,090
So that shows that when you do not try to
understand the financial difficulties of the

196
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:52,630
organizers and you do not help, you are really
selling the Christ within you.

197
00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:00,690
You cannot sell Christ, you cannot sell Sahaja
Yoga.

198
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,210
But that doesn't mean you exploit it.

199
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:10,250
So I have to tell you that I was Myself surprised
in north India where I least expected people

200
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,090
are extremely generous, extremely generous.

201
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:27,029
And then generosity helps you, in a way that
our Lakshmi Tatwa is to be awakened.

202
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:33,620
I had to bring in this point because I have
complaints from people that people are reluctant

203
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,190
to pay for anything like this.

204
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:48,269
It's very remarkable that some people take
over, but everybody must contribute.

205
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,440
It's important, because you are doing God's
work.

206
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,779
You have to also come forward to do other
things that are there without grudging.

207
00:21:57,779 --> 00:21:59,299
Enjoying it!

208
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:06,769
I was happy the posters were put by the Sahaja
Yogis, and you can see the whole place vibrated.

209
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:11,460
You could see how it has worked out.

210
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:18,390
So everybody must go all out to do everything
that is possible.

211
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:25,919
Nothing else is needed but your full heart
into Sahaja Yoga.

212
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,409
Then you will see how you will grow.

213
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:34,379
It is only through your heart you will receive
all your nourishment for your spirituality.

214
00:22:34,379 --> 00:25:43,480
So open 

215
00:25:43,480 --> 00:26:20,570
your heart, do 

216
00:26:20,570 --> 00:37:22,319
not calculate so much.
