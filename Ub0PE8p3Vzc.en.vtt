00:07.167 --> 00:12.000
In the same way the vibrations, the vibrations are coming,

00:12.083 --> 00:14.125
they are radiated.

00:14.209 --> 00:17.000
What you have to do is to expose yourself to it.

00:17.042 --> 00:20.250
The best way is not to put in any effort.

00:20.334 --> 00:23.167
Don’t worry at what point you have a problem.

00:23.209 --> 00:25.375
Say, many people during meditation, I have seen

00:25.417 --> 00:29.167
if they catch somewhere they go on looking after it.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.375
You just don’t have to worry. You just let it go

00:33.083 --> 00:36.375
and it will work by itself.

00:37.292 --> 00:40.250
It’s very easy.

00:52.334 --> 00:56.083
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:56.167 --> 00:58.125
This is what meditation is.

00:58.167 --> 01:04.042
Meditation means exposing yourself to God’s grace.

01:04.125 --> 01:07.250
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

01:07.334 --> 01:13.167
It knows how to mend you, how to
settle down itself into your own being,

01:13.250 --> 01:19.125
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows everything.

01:20.167 --> 01:25.209
So you don’t have to worry as to what you have to do

01:25.292 --> 01:28.334
or what name you have to take, what mantras you have to do.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.042
In meditation you have to be absolutely effortless,

01:32.125 --> 01:37.000
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

01:37.083 --> 01:42.334
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless at that time.

01:43.042 --> 01:47.125
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may not be thoughtless.

01:47.167 --> 01:50.000
At that time you have to just watch your thoughts,

01:50.042 --> 01:52.083
but don’t get involved into them.

01:52.167 --> 01:58.125
You will find gradually as the sun rises, the darkness goes away

01:58.167 --> 02:02.250
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice and every part

02:02.334 --> 02:07.042
and makes the whole place lighted.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.209
In the same way your being will be completely lighted.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.375
But if you put in an effort that time

02:13.042 --> 02:15.125
or try to stop something within you

02:15.209 --> 02:18.375
or try to give it a bandhan it will know.

02:19.042 --> 02:23.375
Effortlessness is the only way to meditation,

02:24.125 --> 02:26.292
but you should not be lethargic about it –

02:26.375 --> 02:29.292
should be alert and watch it.

02:29.375 --> 02:32.209
The other side could be people just doze off.

02:32.292 --> 02:37.000
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off, nothing will work.

02:37.083 --> 02:43.167
That’s another side of it is.
If you are lazy about it, nothing will work.

02:43.375 --> 02:51.292
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely aware,

02:51.375 --> 02:56.292
completely effortless – absolutely effortless.

02:56.375 --> 03:02.167
If you are absolutely effortless, meditation will work the best.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.042
Don’t think of your problems at all,

03:05.125 --> 03:08.042
whatever chakras you have, anything.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.042
Just expose yourself.

03:10.125 --> 03:15.250
See when the sun shines, all the nature exposes itself to the sun

03:15.334 --> 03:19.042
and receives the blessings of the sun, effortlessly.

03:19.125 --> 03:23.125
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just receives itself.

03:23.209 --> 03:32.125
When it receives the sun’s rays,
then the sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

03:35.083 --> 03:42.334
So, the same way, the All-Pervading Power starts working.

03:43.042 --> 03:46.250
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not to do anything about it.

03:46.334 --> 03:51.125
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

03:51.167 --> 03:55.125
Don’t take any names. Do not bother if your Agnya is catching,

03:55.167 --> 03:58.334
this is catching, that is catching. It is working out.

03:59.042 --> 04:03.334
It will go on working as long as it can

04:04.000 --> 04:11.042
and it will do the miracle that it has to do.
You don’t have to worry about it.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.334
It knows its job.

04:12.375 --> 04:17.083
But when you put in an effort actually you create a barrier for it.

04:17.167 --> 04:19.250
So no effort is needed,

04:19.334 --> 04:21.334
be absolutely effortless and say

04:22.042 --> 04:26.125
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.042
No mantra’s to be chanted,

04:28.083 --> 04:31.083
in case you find it’s impossible – then you can take my name,

04:31.125 --> 04:32.334
but there is no need even.

04:32.334 --> 04:35.125
When you put your hand towards me that’s the mantra,

04:35.167 --> 04:39.083
sufficient, this gesture itself is the mantra.

04:39.125 --> 04:46.167
You see there’s no need to say it more,
but the thought in the mind, the emotion

04:46.250 --> 04:51.334
should be that we have to now spread
our hands to that and it should work.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.042
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

04:57.250 --> 05:02.250
there is no need to say any mantra, you go beyond it.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.167
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

05:06.250 --> 05:12.083
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

05:19.375 --> 05:24.042
Meditation is for your own ascent,

05:24.125 --> 05:29.125
is for your own capital gains that you have to have.

05:29.209 --> 05:34.125
But once you get into it, you also achieve your powers.

05:34.209 --> 05:39.083
Like, you become a governor
then you get the powers of the governor.

05:39.167 --> 05:43.083
At this time you don’t have to think about anybody else.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.125
You are not to put your attention to anybody else

05:46.167 --> 05:50.250
but just receive it, just receive it.

05:50.334 --> 05:53.167
Do not think of any other problem,

05:53.250 --> 06:01.167
but that, that you have to be effortless, absolutely effortless.

06:06.250 --> 06:13.292
It would work best on the people who are just receiving it.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.292
You have problems – that’s why you are here,

06:16.375 --> 06:22.042
but you cannot solve them, they are to be solved by Divine Power.

06:22.125 --> 06:27.209
This must be understood fully, that we cannot solve our problems.

06:27.292 --> 06:35.042
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

06:35.125 --> 06:40.375
So leave it in the hands of the Divine Power

06:41.042 --> 06:47.000
and expose yourself effortlessly, absolutely effortlessly.

06:47.083 --> 06:52.375
Sit in comfort, and properly with both the feet on the ground,

06:53.042 --> 06:57.125
with both the hands relaxed like this.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.209
Be comfortable, you should not be uncomfortable at all.

07:00.292 --> 07:06.167
Be very comfortable, you see,
because you have to sit for quite some time.

07:07.042 --> 07:09.042
Alright, good.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.167
And you try to put your attention to me, within yourself,

07:12.250 --> 07:15.250
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

07:15.334 --> 07:19.250
You can come into my Kundalini and it will be done.

07:19.334 --> 07:24.042
Good, just like this, the hands should be like this, straight.

07:30.209 --> 07:35.125
So effortlessness is the key word, absolutely effortlessly,

07:35.250 --> 07:41.250
whether you are meditating before me,
or before my photograph.
