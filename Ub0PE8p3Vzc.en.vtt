00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:12.000
In the same way the vibrations, the vibrations are coming,

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:14.125
they are radiated.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.000
What you have to do is to expose yourself to it.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:20.250
The best way is not to put in any effort.

00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:23.167
Don’t worry at what point you have a problem.

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.375
Say, many people during meditation, I have seen

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:29.167
if they catch somewhere they go on looking after it.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.375
You just don’t have to worry. You just let it go

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.375
and it will work by itself.

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.250
It’s very easy.

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:56.083
So you don’t have to put in any effort.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.125
This is what meditation is.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:04.042
Meditation means exposing yourself to God’s grace.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.250
Now the grace itself knows how to cure you.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:13.167
It knows how to mend you, how to 
settle down itself into your own being,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.125
keep your Spirit kindled. It knows everything.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:25.209
So you don’t have to worry as to what you have to do

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:28.334
or what name you have to take, what mantras you have to do.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.042
In meditation you have to be absolutely effortless,

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:37.000
[aside: “Sit down”], expose yourself fully

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:42.334
and you have to be absolutely thoughtless at that time.

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:47.125
Supposing there’s a possibility, you may not be thoughtless.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.000
At that time you have to just watch your thoughts,

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.083
but don’t get involved into them.

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:58.125
You will find gradually as the sun rises, the darkness goes away

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:02.250
and the sun’s rays go into every crevice and every part

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:07.042
and makes the whole place lighted.

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:10.209
In the same way your being will be completely lighted.

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:12.375
But if you put in an effort that time

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:15.125
or try to stop something within you

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.375
or try to give it a bandhan it will know.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:23.375
Effortlessness is the only way to meditation,

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.292
but you should not be lethargic about it –

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.292
should be alert and watch it.

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:32.209
The other side could be people just doze off.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:37.000
No! You have to be alert. If you doze off, nothing will work.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:43.167
That’s another side of it is. 
If you are lazy about it, nothing will work.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:51.292
You have to be alert and opened, absolutely aware,

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:56.292
completely effortless – absolutely effortless.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:02.167
If you are absolutely effortless, meditation will work the best.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.042
Don’t think of your problems at all,

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:08.042
whatever chakras you have, anything.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:10.042
Just expose yourself.

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:15.250
See when the sun shines, all the nature exposes itself to the sun

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:19.042
and receives the blessings of the sun, effortlessly.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:23.125
It doesn’t put in any effort, it just receives itself.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:32.125
When it receives the sun’s rays, 
then the sun’s ray’s start acting and activating.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:42.334
So, the same way, the All-Pervading Power starts working.

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:46.250
You are not to manoeuvre it. You are not to do anything about it.

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:51.125
Just be effortless, absolutely effortless.

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:55.125
Don’t take any names. Do not bother if your Agnya is catching,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:58.334
this is catching, that is catching. It is working out.

00:03:59.042 --> 00:04:03.334
It will go on working as long as it can

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.042
and it will do the miracle that it has to do. 
You don’t have to worry about it.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.334
It knows its job.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:17.083
But when you put in an effort actually you create a barrier for it.

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.250
So no effort is needed,

00:04:19.334 --> 00:04:21.334
be absolutely effortless and say

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:26.125
‘Let it go, let it go’ – that’s all.

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.042
No mantra’s to be chanted,

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:31.083
in case you find it’s impossible – then you can take my name,

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:32.334
but there is no need even.

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:35.125
When you put your hand towards me that’s the mantra,

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:39.083
sufficient, this gesture itself is the mantra.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:46.167
You see there’s no need to say it more, 
but the thought in the mind, the emotion

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.334
should be that we have to now spread 
our hands to that and it should work.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.042
When this emotion is absolutely complete,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.250
there is no need to say any mantra, you go beyond it.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:06.167
So, one has to be absolutely effortless,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.083
absolutely effortless. That is what it is.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:24.042
Meditation is for your own ascent,

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:29.125
is for your own capital gains that you have to have.

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:34.125
But once you get into it, you also achieve your powers.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:39.083
Like, you become a governor 
then you get the powers of the governor.

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:43.083
At this time you don’t have to think about anybody else.

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:46.125
You are not to put your attention to anybody else

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:50.250
but just receive it, just receive it.

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:53.167
Do not think of any other problem,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.167
but that, that you have to be effortless, absolutely effortless.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:13.292
It would work best on the people who are just receiving it.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.292
You have problems – that’s why you are here,

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:22.042
but you cannot solve them, they are to be solved by Divine Power.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:27.209
This must be understood fully, that we cannot solve our problems.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:35.042
It is beyond us to solve our problems.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:40.375
So leave it in the hands of the Divine Power

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:47.000
and expose yourself effortlessly, absolutely effortlessly.

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:52.375
Sit in comfort, and properly with both the feet on the ground,

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:57.125
with both the hands relaxed like this.

00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:00.209
Be comfortable, you should not be uncomfortable at all.

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:06.167
Be very comfortable, you see, 
because you have to sit for quite some time.

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:09.042
Alright, good.

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:12.167
And you try to put your attention to me, within yourself,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.250
if you can, to my Kundalini if you can.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:19.250
You can come into my Kundalini and it will be done.

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:24.042
Good, just like this, the hands should be like this, straight.

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:35.125
So effortlessness is the key word, absolutely effortlessly,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:41.250
whether you are meditating before me, 
or before my photograph.
