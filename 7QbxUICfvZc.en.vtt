00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:13.574
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:19.451
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:25.938
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:36.224
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:40.386
As I have said, you all are gurus

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:47.461
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:51.925
but the main thing one should understand

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:07.609
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.513
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:15.824
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:26.867
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:33.280
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.510
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:47.509
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.694
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.398
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:01.518
we cannot assimilate it that well.

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:09.757
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

00:02:10.027 --> 00:02:17.109
We have to realise that we have all come

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.452
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:28.870
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:35.329
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:44.693
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:57.584
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:08.085
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

00:03:08.286 --> 00:03:12.318
We want to grab things of others;

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.066
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:23.043
They first used to grab lands,

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:33.695
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.694
Then they were not satisfied with that,

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:46.814
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

00:03:47.015 --> 00:03:53.109
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.154
still they would grab.

00:03:56.355 --> 00:04:03.733
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:08.684
but it is there because of our inheritance.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:15.698
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:19.821
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:25.542
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

00:04:25.743 --> 00:04:33.972
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:42.238
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:50.309
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.921
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

00:04:56.122 --> 00:05:00.585
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:07.854
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:12.025
we lack in some talents than another
person,

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:17.133
and they try to overpower that person

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:22.030
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:29.544
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:37.415
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:44.114
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:51.691
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:57.119
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:06.740
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:12.441
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

00:06:12.642 --> 00:06:17.532
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:25.408
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:37.018
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:41.017
very violent temper.

00:06:41.218 --> 00:06:48.293
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

00:06:48.494 --> 00:06:52.335
When you see something which you don’t
like,

00:06:52.536 --> 00:06:56.081
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:59.733
immediately you flare up.

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:07.971
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

00:07:08.172 --> 00:07:13.533
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:18.247
they were using match into it, matchstick.

00:07:18.448 --> 00:07:22.784
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:28.511
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

00:07:28.712 --> 00:07:33.676
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

00:07:33.877 --> 00:07:37.744
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

00:07:37.945 --> 00:07:43.598
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:49.802
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

00:07:50.003 --> 00:07:57.201
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

00:07:57.402 --> 00:08:03.755
we should not try to oppress others.

00:08:03.963 --> 00:08:08.045
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

00:08:08.246 --> 00:08:15.974
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:24.657
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:34.272
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:41.224
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

00:08:41.425 --> 00:08:46.859
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.066
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:54.300
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:59.321
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:02.240
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:07.417
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:12.141
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:16.268
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.149
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

00:09:20.355 --> 00:09:22.894
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:27.795
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:32.220
not yet fully equipped to understand,

00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:43.175
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

00:09:43.376 --> 00:09:51.649
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

00:09:53.246 --> 00:10:01.696
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:05.656
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:15.093
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

00:10:15.294 --> 00:10:19.596
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

00:10:19.797 --> 00:10:25.604
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:32.221
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:38.028
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

00:10:38.216 --> 00:10:41.167
We may be even snakes animals.

00:10:41.368 --> 00:10:47.050
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:50.963
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:54.936
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

00:10:55.137 --> 00:10:57.360
if there’s a snake within us.

00:10:57.561 --> 00:11:04.462
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

00:11:04.663 --> 00:11:09.148
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

00:11:09.349 --> 00:11:18.207
Now, this is not a very good situation,

00:11:18.408 --> 00:11:22.766
that we are still at the level of animals

00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:26.550
and our inheritance is still working in us.

00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:30.552
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:33.531
And for good guru, you have to have

00:11:33.732 --> 00:11:42.716
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.581
After all,

00:11:56.257 --> 00:12:02.738
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:09.603
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:18.802
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:24.696
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

00:12:24.897 --> 00:12:28.510
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:30.627
I tell you, it will improve.

00:12:30.828 --> 00:12:34.588
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:43.272
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

00:12:43.473 --> 00:12:47.435
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:51.097
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

00:12:51.298 --> 00:12:53.697
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:57.691
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

00:12:57.892 --> 00:13:03.950
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:08.260
so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

00:13:08.461 --> 00:13:12.819
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.474
I must say other gurus were not like that.

00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:24.506
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

00:13:24.707 --> 00:13:28.931
and they used to lose temper on people.

00:13:29.132 --> 00:13:36.353
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:40.450
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:47.499
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.654
And one of them got lost in the money.”

00:13:52.855 --> 00:13:54.891
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:59.845
“And second one got lost in the women.”

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:06.097
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

00:14:06.298 --> 00:14:09.770
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.176
and kindness, better get around them.”

00:14:14.377 --> 00:14:20.448
So, the one who was lost…

00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:28.184
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

00:14:28.385 --> 00:14:32.358
So who are those sitting outside?

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:42.322
Open it fully. Of course!

00:15:07.143 --> 00:15:09.540
Good.

00:15:28.215 --> 00:15:32.809
Let them move this side.

00:15:41.093 --> 00:15:44.236
Now is better.]

00:15:54.805 --> 00:15:58.043
So as a guru, you must conclude

00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:02.725
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

00:16:02.926 --> 00:16:10.851
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:16.148
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.056
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:27.283
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

00:16:27.484 --> 00:16:34.105
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:39.695
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.921
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:46.592
to achieve this state.

00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:49.491
And why should I give realization to others."

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:57.711
Or, if they have got Realisation, then,

00:16:57.896 --> 00:17:01.934
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:09.364
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:12.674
and how others have to achieve it.

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:25.561
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

00:17:25.762 --> 00:17:36.253
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:41.188
give his family up, do this, do that.

00:17:41.389 --> 00:17:44.616
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

00:17:44.816 --> 00:17:50.423
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

00:17:50.624 --> 00:17:57.259
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:04.498
And the worse comes to worse,

00:18:04.699 --> 00:18:11.410
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.855
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

00:18:16.031 --> 00:18:18.874
what the another person has to say,

00:18:19.075 --> 00:18:25.175
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

00:18:26.978 --> 00:18:33.235
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

00:18:33.436 --> 00:18:38.304
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

00:18:38.505 --> 00:18:47.460
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:53.717
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

00:18:53.926 --> 00:18:59.723
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

00:18:59.924 --> 00:19:03.838
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

00:19:04.039 --> 00:19:08.765
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:12.848
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:16.503
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:22.388
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:27.576
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

00:19:27.777 --> 00:19:32.235
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

00:19:32.436 --> 00:19:40.218
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:44.611
So not to hurt people is very important.

00:19:44.812 --> 00:19:50.165
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

00:19:50.366 --> 00:19:59.894
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

00:20:00.256 --> 00:20:04.029
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.456
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

00:20:09.656 --> 00:20:17.951
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:22.918
As you are, you got your Realisation.

00:20:23.856 --> 00:20:27.162
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

00:20:27.363 --> 00:20:30.660
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:34.554
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:42.229
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

00:20:42.425 --> 00:20:44.623
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:20:44.824 --> 00:20:48.569
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:54.116
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.694
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:04.986
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

00:21:05.187 --> 00:21:10.346
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

00:21:10.547 --> 00:21:14.023
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

00:21:14.196 --> 00:21:18.648
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:21.412
Why? Why do we do it?

00:21:21.628 --> 00:21:26.648
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:31.947
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

00:21:32.148 --> 00:21:36.787
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

00:21:36.988 --> 00:21:45.357
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

00:21:45.558 --> 00:21:48.693
Now you have become a greater human being

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:52.549
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.428
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

00:21:56.629 --> 00:22:04.787
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

00:22:06.179 --> 00:22:11.334
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

00:22:11.503 --> 00:22:19.033
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

00:22:19.907 --> 00:22:27.165
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:32.654
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

00:22:32.855 --> 00:22:37.139
But that too in a such a soft manner

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:44.679
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

00:22:45.774 --> 00:22:55.997
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

00:22:56.198 --> 00:23:02.307
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

00:23:02.508 --> 00:23:09.761
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

00:23:09.962 --> 00:23:12.984
alright, doesn’t matter.

00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:16.888
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

00:23:17.089 --> 00:23:24.317
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

00:23:24.518 --> 00:23:31.338
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

00:23:31.539 --> 00:23:35.791
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

00:23:35.992 --> 00:23:42.255
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

00:23:42.455 --> 00:23:47.274
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

00:23:47.475 --> 00:23:52.267
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

00:23:52.468 --> 00:23:58.753
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:58.954 --> 00:24:02.511
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:05.655
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

00:24:05.855 --> 00:24:10.398
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:16.929
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.579
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:27.006
or some big position, then what does he do?

00:24:27.207 --> 00:24:31.936
You can’t challenge him any way.

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:36.185
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

00:24:36.386 --> 00:24:39.176
because he is so identified with that.

00:24:39.376 --> 00:24:46.284
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:58.920
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:10.149
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:20.316
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

00:25:20.517 --> 00:25:26.005
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

00:25:26.206 --> 00:25:32.451
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

00:25:32.652 --> 00:25:39.097
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:39.298 --> 00:25:45.875
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:52.910
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

00:25:53.111 --> 00:26:01.623
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:07.247
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

00:26:07.447 --> 00:26:11.715
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:16.940
it will never work out. So you must
understand

00:26:17.141 --> 00:26:24.869
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.589
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:34.351
Not by argument, not by saying things,

00:26:34.552 --> 00:26:43.581
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

00:26:44.192 --> 00:26:49.897
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

00:26:50.937 --> 00:26:54.953
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

00:26:55.154 --> 00:26:59.133
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

00:26:59.334 --> 00:27:02.908
and thirdly that he values love.

00:27:03.109 --> 00:27:09.230
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:18.628
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

00:27:18.829 --> 00:27:23.858
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:31.431
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

00:27:31.632 --> 00:27:36.940
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.641
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

00:27:41.842 --> 00:27:48.603
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

00:27:48.804 --> 00:27:52.462
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:58.513
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

00:27:58.713 --> 00:28:09.153
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:22.700
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:27.228
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:31.863
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

00:28:32.063 --> 00:28:35.102
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

00:28:35.303 --> 00:28:38.459
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.986
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

00:28:44.187 --> 00:28:48.094
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

00:28:48.263 --> 00:28:53.316
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

00:28:53.517 --> 00:28:57.610
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:06.470
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

00:29:06.671 --> 00:29:11.385
You put attention, but not attachment.

00:29:12.028 --> 00:29:15.315
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:19.017
What solves the problem is attention.

00:29:19.218 --> 00:29:26.847
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

00:29:27.048 --> 00:29:33.223
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

00:29:33.424 --> 00:29:37.121
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

00:29:37.322 --> 00:29:43.599
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:51.329
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:55.415
paying attention to that person.

00:29:55.954 --> 00:29:59.024
And then your attention will work.

00:29:59.225 --> 00:30:02.659
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:08.304
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

00:30:08.505 --> 00:30:12.414
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:15.427
because you are attached to that person,

00:30:15.628 --> 00:30:20.909
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:29.365
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:33.202
then your attention doesn’t work out.

00:30:33.403 --> 00:30:37.794
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

00:30:37.994 --> 00:30:40.160
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.120
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:48.161
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

00:30:48.361 --> 00:30:55.129
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:00.570
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.750
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:06.027
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

00:31:06.227 --> 00:31:12.426
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

00:31:12.627 --> 00:31:18.085
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

00:31:18.286 --> 00:31:24.515
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:32.052
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

00:31:32.253 --> 00:31:36.061
Attention should be absolutely free,

00:31:36.262 --> 00:31:42.952
so it works automatically, automatically.

00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:47.805
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.913
the attention will work it (out).

00:31:51.114 --> 00:31:56.558
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

00:31:56.759 --> 00:32:01.100
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:05.728
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.469
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

00:32:10.677 --> 00:32:15.875
but something higher, where your attention
works,

00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:20.348
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:24.830
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:28.664
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:34.683
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

00:32:35.103 --> 00:32:42.448
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

00:32:48.973 --> 00:32:58.731
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

00:32:58.932 --> 00:33:02.279
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

00:33:02.495 --> 00:33:11.110
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

00:33:11.311 --> 00:33:14.876
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

00:33:15.077 --> 00:33:18.630
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.863
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

00:33:23.064 --> 00:33:29.342
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

00:33:29.543 --> 00:33:35.115
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

00:33:35.316 --> 00:33:41.387
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:46.768
You have to notice: What are they doing?

00:33:46.968 --> 00:33:54.477
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

00:33:54.678 --> 00:34:00.191
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

00:34:00.392 --> 00:34:06.805
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

00:34:06.982 --> 00:34:11.971
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

00:34:12.626 --> 00:34:17.496
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

00:34:17.697 --> 00:34:24.999
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.248
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.467
It’s just an explanation.

00:34:33.668 --> 00:34:38.495
But if you really don’t fix your attention

00:34:38.696 --> 00:34:41.970
to one person or ten persons only,

00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:48.124
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

00:34:52.309 --> 00:34:58.735
It receives all the information and also
it gives

00:34:58.935 --> 00:35:06.138
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

00:35:06.339 --> 00:35:11.193
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

00:35:11.394 --> 00:35:16.202
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

00:35:16.403 --> 00:35:23.677
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

00:35:23.878 --> 00:35:28.999
and in that you are not involved.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.438
You see the situation and you are away
from it.

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:37.868
Then you can solve that problem better.

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:45.565
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:52.561
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:57.616
cannot solve the problem.

00:35:57.817 --> 00:36:05.407
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

00:36:05.608 --> 00:36:15.685
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

00:36:15.886 --> 00:36:27.100
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

00:36:28.833 --> 00:36:32.519
So our attention has to be always free

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.167
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

00:36:38.368 --> 00:36:44.068
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

00:36:44.269 --> 00:36:49.804
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

00:36:50.005 --> 00:36:57.322
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

00:36:59.043 --> 00:37:02.782
Through introspection you will understand

00:37:02.983 --> 00:37:09.570
that you need help to solve your problems.

00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:15.673
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

00:37:15.874 --> 00:37:23.280
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

00:37:23.564 --> 00:37:34.593
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

00:37:34.924 --> 00:37:46.941
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

00:37:47.142 --> 00:37:51.043
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

00:37:51.244 --> 00:37:56.431
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

00:37:56.632 --> 00:38:02.398
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:06.123
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

00:38:06.324 --> 00:38:10.621
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

00:38:10.822 --> 00:38:15.197
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:20.005
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:24.516
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:30.004
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

00:38:30.205 --> 00:38:37.308
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

00:38:37.509 --> 00:38:45.063
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:47.863
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

00:38:48.064 --> 00:38:52.021
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:56.707
today we have a very complex society.

00:38:56.908 --> 00:39:00.684
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

00:39:00.885 --> 00:39:06.044
in which only thinking is responsible.

00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:09.169
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:13.937
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

00:39:14.138 --> 00:39:19.446
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

00:39:19.647 --> 00:39:26.624
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

00:39:32.607 --> 00:39:39.183
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:43.623
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

00:39:43.824 --> 00:39:50.524
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

00:39:50.724 --> 00:39:55.627
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

00:39:55.828 --> 00:40:02.439
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:06.799
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.397
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

00:40:11.605 --> 00:40:16.249
So there was only one building ahead,

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:24.047
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

00:40:24.248 --> 00:40:27.821
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

00:40:28.022 --> 00:40:33.978
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

00:40:34.179 --> 00:40:38.988
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

00:40:39.189 --> 00:40:41.705
I was amazed how it is there.

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:45.374
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

00:40:45.575 --> 00:40:48.414
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

00:40:48.615 --> 00:40:52.727
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

00:40:52.928 --> 00:40:58.003
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:58.204 --> 00:41:05.133
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

00:41:07.326 --> 00:41:11.879
How, you see, things can be improved,

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:24.748
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:30.767
But love is truth and truth is love.

00:41:30.968 --> 00:41:36.952
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

00:41:37.153 --> 00:41:44.620
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:48.710
because it will be truthful.

00:41:49.283 --> 00:41:54.277
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

00:41:54.478 --> 00:41:58.637
because it is absolutely truthful.

00:41:58.838 --> 00:42:01.998
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:05.495
you should be extremely truthful.

00:42:05.696 --> 00:42:10.322
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:15.382
but you must use such ways and methods

00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:20.500
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:24.780
which will have an effect on that person.

00:42:25.558 --> 00:42:30.355
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:30.555 --> 00:42:33.757
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

00:42:33.958 --> 00:42:41.104
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

00:42:41.313 --> 00:42:45.811
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

00:42:46.012 --> 00:42:53.478
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

00:42:53.896 --> 00:43:00.181
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

00:43:00.382 --> 00:43:08.144
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

00:43:08.345 --> 00:43:16.995
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

00:43:17.196 --> 00:43:21.742
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

00:43:21.942 --> 00:43:26.271
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

00:43:26.472 --> 00:43:31.615
very easily, anything that you want to do.

00:43:31.816 --> 00:43:38.631
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

00:43:38.832 --> 00:43:44.938
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:49.564
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

00:43:49.765 --> 00:43:53.312
very important position that they are
gurus.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:59.337
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

00:43:59.538 --> 00:44:03.230
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

00:44:03.431 --> 00:44:11.330
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

00:44:11.531 --> 00:44:13.709
People should not doubt him,

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:18.243
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

00:44:18.444 --> 00:44:25.574
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

00:44:26.668 --> 00:44:31.657
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

00:44:31.858 --> 00:44:38.653
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

00:44:38.854 --> 00:44:42.118
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:46.837
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:47.038 --> 00:44:49.681
I tell you – very lots of people.

00:44:49.882 --> 00:44:53.243
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

00:44:53.444 --> 00:44:56.638
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

00:44:56.838 --> 00:45:02.734
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

00:45:02.935 --> 00:45:15.797
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:22.877
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

00:45:23.139 --> 00:45:26.436
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

00:45:26.637 --> 00:45:29.457
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

00:45:29.658 --> 00:45:33.032
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:39.157
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

00:45:39.358 --> 00:45:43.928
They all warned Me. So I came here

00:45:44.129 --> 00:45:46.589
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.886
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

00:45:50.087 --> 00:45:55.658
He was surprised, how can I do that.

00:45:55.859 --> 00:46:02.234
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

00:46:02.435 --> 00:46:08.398
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:14.969
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:19.566
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

00:46:19.767 --> 00:46:25.647
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

00:46:28.447 --> 00:46:33.825
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

00:46:34.026 --> 00:46:42.015
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

00:46:42.203 --> 00:46:48.033
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

00:46:48.234 --> 00:46:53.168
your particular ideas about particular
things,

00:46:53.369 --> 00:46:59.389
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

00:47:00.371 --> 00:47:04.819
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.415
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

00:47:08.616 --> 00:47:15.224
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:21.324
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

00:47:22.885 --> 00:47:27.756
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

00:47:27.957 --> 00:47:32.399
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:40.115
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:46.513
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

00:47:46.714 --> 00:47:50.686
It emits and creates a path for you,

00:47:50.887 --> 00:47:55.448
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

00:47:55.649 --> 00:47:59.956
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

00:48:00.157 --> 00:48:04.935
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

00:48:05.136 --> 00:48:09.564
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

00:48:09.764 --> 00:48:17.161
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

00:48:17.362 --> 00:48:20.577
May God bless you all.

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:39.687
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

00:48:39.888 --> 00:48:43.761
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

00:48:43.962 --> 00:48:46.351
which is also a human quality.

00:48:46.551 --> 00:48:51.555
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

00:48:51.756 --> 00:48:56.968
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

00:48:57.169 --> 00:49:01.677
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

00:49:01.878 --> 00:49:05.229
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:12.244
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:16.174
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:18.732
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

00:49:18.933 --> 00:49:22.691
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

00:49:22.892 --> 00:49:27.522
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

00:49:27.723 --> 00:49:31.775
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

00:49:31.976 --> 00:49:36.596
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

00:49:36.797 --> 00:49:40.620
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

00:49:40.821 --> 00:49:44.761
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

00:49:44.962 --> 00:49:51.274
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

00:49:51.474 --> 00:49:56.393
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

00:49:56.594 --> 00:49:58.856
and she has done something very wrong,

00:49:59.057 --> 00:50:02.036
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

00:50:02.237 --> 00:50:04.757
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:15.961
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

00:50:16.161 --> 00:50:23.825
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

00:50:24.026 --> 00:50:28.921
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

00:50:29.122 --> 00:50:33.330
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:37.744
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

00:50:37.945 --> 00:50:43.504
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

00:50:43.705 --> 00:50:47.595
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

00:50:47.796 --> 00:50:55.123
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

00:50:55.333 --> 00:50:58.698
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

00:50:58.878 --> 00:51:03.465
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

00:51:03.666 --> 00:51:09.714
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

00:51:09.914 --> 00:51:16.169
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:19.415
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

00:51:19.616 --> 00:51:23.781
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

00:51:23.982 --> 00:51:26.910
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

00:51:27.111 --> 00:51:30.088
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

00:51:30.289 --> 00:51:34.856
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

00:51:35.057 --> 00:51:41.525
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

00:51:43.805 --> 00:51:46.227
So thank you very much again and again.

00:51:46.428 --> 00:51:49.271
May God bless you.

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:04.622
May God bless you all.
