WEBVTT

00:05.659 --> 00:13.574
Since we have come to Cabella, it is
the ten years completed.

00:13.775 --> 00:19.451
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,

00:19.652 --> 00:25.938
we have been able to progress in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:27.838 --> 00:36.224
Now, today, we are going to have a Guru
puja.

00:37.346 --> 00:40.386
As I have said, you all are gurus

00:40.587 --> 00:47.461
and you want to worship Me as your Guru –
is alright –

00:47.662 --> 00:51.925
but the main thing one should understand

00:56.990 --> 01:07.609
that you have become guru, no doubt,
because you have the knowledge.

01:07.810 --> 01:10.513
You have the Absolute Knowledge,

01:10.714 --> 01:15.824
and so we can say you have become gurus,
no doubt.

01:16.024 --> 01:26.867
But one has to understand that you have
reached a state

01:27.068 --> 01:33.280
where you can raise the Kundalini, you can
give Realisation to others.

01:33.481 --> 01:38.510
Also you know what is the Absolute
Knowledge.

01:40.253 --> 01:47.509
To know the Absolute Knowledge is very
important

01:47.710 --> 01:54.694
and to assimilate is even much more
important.

01:55.609 --> 01:58.398
Though we know the Absolute Knowledge,

01:58.599 --> 02:01.518
we cannot assimilate it that well.

02:01.701 --> 02:09.757
That means we cannot go deep into it.
What is the reason for that?

02:10.027 --> 02:17.109
We have to realise that we have all come

02:17.310 --> 02:24.452
out of the heritage that was the animal
kingdom.

02:24.653 --> 02:28.870
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

02:29.071 --> 02:35.329
So, there are so many things of the animal
heritage

02:35.530 --> 02:44.693
linger in us: the aggressiveness,
the domination,

02:45.228 --> 02:57.584
peevishness, fear, grabbing.

02:58.316 --> 03:08.085
All these are our inheritance and they
are within us, lingering.

03:08.286 --> 03:12.318
We want to grab things of others;

03:12.519 --> 03:19.066
not you people, of course not, but people
who are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

03:19.267 --> 03:23.043
They first used to grab lands,

03:23.244 --> 03:33.695
then they started grabbing people, making
them slaves.

03:34.819 --> 03:38.694
Then they were not satisfied with that,

03:38.895 --> 03:46.814
so they were grabbing kingdoms, jewellery
and all these things.

03:47.015 --> 03:53.109
So, just to grab. They have no legal right,

03:53.310 --> 03:56.154
still they would grab.

03:56.355 --> 04:03.733
It seems – it seems very funny, it seems
very inhuman,

04:03.934 --> 04:08.684
but it is there because of our inheritance.

04:09.311 --> 04:15.698
Now there are so many other things, like
jealousy.

04:15.899 --> 04:19.821
Among animals, there is very little
of that.

04:20.022 --> 04:25.542
They don’t have jealousies so much as we
have.

04:25.743 --> 04:33.972
While we have inherited this jealousy
by our own reactions and thinking.

04:36.152 --> 04:42.238
People get jealous and they want to put
down others.

04:42.439 --> 04:50.309
If they cannot achieve any height, they
want to bring down the heights of others.

04:50.510 --> 04:55.921
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings,

04:56.122 --> 05:00.585
they think whatever is done in the name
of jealousy is alright.

05:00.786 --> 05:07.854
They become very conscious that we are
lower than another person,

05:08.055 --> 05:12.025
we lack in some talents than another
person,

05:12.226 --> 05:17.133
and they try to overpower that person

05:17.334 --> 05:22.030
because of the force of jealousy behind it.

05:23.984 --> 05:29.544
Now the trouble is, though we are human
beings,

05:29.745 --> 05:37.415
we have inherited so many animal qualities:
like, we are ferocious,

05:37.615 --> 05:44.114
we are angry, and we get upset, as animals
do.

05:44.315 --> 05:51.691
But, additional to that, human beings can
react

05:51.892 --> 05:57.119
because of their thinking. They think,
they can think,

05:57.320 --> 06:06.740
and by thinking, all these inherited
properties become perverted.

06:06.941 --> 06:12.441
Like a person wants to put down another
person:

06:12.642 --> 06:17.532
then, he doesn’t behave like an animal,
in a straightforward way,

06:17.732 --> 06:25.408
but he will find out a device and method.
He’ll think it over, how to do it.

06:29.545 --> 06:37.018
The main problem with human beings is
that they still have inherited

06:37.227 --> 06:41.017
very violent temper.

06:41.218 --> 06:48.293
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

06:48.494 --> 06:52.335
When you see something which you don’t
like,

06:52.536 --> 06:56.081
which is against your will, maybe something
like that,

06:56.281 --> 06:59.733
immediately you flare up.

06:59.934 --> 07:07.971
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor,
they had put a sugar candy.

07:08.172 --> 07:13.533
To sugar candy, they were putting
the matchbox – you see,

07:13.734 --> 07:18.247
they were using match into it, matchstick.

07:18.448 --> 07:22.784
It would not take the fire. They tried
and tried, it would not.

07:22.985 --> 07:28.511
So I said, “Let Me see what is there.”
So that was a sugar candy!

07:28.712 --> 07:33.676
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

07:33.877 --> 07:37.744
So the quality of the person is known
in the same way.

07:37.945 --> 07:43.598
If with the slightest provocation, if he
gets into temper and gets annoyed,

07:43.799 --> 07:49.802
then his quality is not very good as
a guru.

07:50.003 --> 07:57.201
As a guru, we should not flare up, we
should not get angry,

07:57.402 --> 08:03.755
we should not try to oppress others.

08:03.963 --> 08:08.045
“But what can we do then?”, people will
ask.

08:08.246 --> 08:15.974
We have another method, what we call is
‘love’. Love.

08:16.175 --> 08:24.657
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person.

08:25.488 --> 08:34.272
So what happens that it doesn’t give you
any anger

08:34.473 --> 08:41.224
and the another person, you don’t make him
angry also. But anger begets anger.

08:41.425 --> 08:46.859
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort

08:47.060 --> 08:50.066
because he is afraid of you maybe there.

08:50.281 --> 08:54.300
But in his heart, he will keep a revenge
in his mind,

08:54.501 --> 08:59.321
that, “One day, I will show him. Why should
he get angry with me?”

08:59.521 --> 09:02.240
So, in Sahaja Yoga, please remember

09:02.441 --> 09:07.417
that love is the only way we can solve
the problem.

09:07.618 --> 09:12.141
Now, if something goes wrong, say,
in the ashram,

09:12.342 --> 09:16.268
if you get angry with that person, what
will happen?

09:16.469 --> 09:20.149
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

09:20.355 --> 09:22.894
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he will -
may realise

09:23.095 --> 09:27.795
that it was a wrong thing to do. But if he
is a bad Sahaja Yogi,

09:27.996 --> 09:32.220
not yet fully equipped to understand,

09:32.421 --> 09:43.175
then what he will do, he will just feel
that, “This man has insulted me,

09:43.376 --> 09:51.649
he has deliberately put me down and all
that, and I should try to take a revenge.”

09:53.246 --> 10:01.696
Among animals, this activity is very
limited.

10:01.945 --> 10:05.656
I don’t think they believe in revenge,
except for few animals

10:05.857 --> 10:15.093
they say that, if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite.

10:15.294 --> 10:19.596
It will come back on you. That’s what is
said.

10:19.797 --> 10:25.604
And this one is something, one quality
of the snake.

10:25.804 --> 10:32.221
But as we have passed through all these
different categories,

10:32.422 --> 10:38.028
we might be having some of the qualities
of some of these animals within us.

10:38.216 --> 10:41.167
We may be even snakes animals.

10:41.368 --> 10:47.050
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you,

10:47.251 --> 10:50.963
you’ll remember it all your life, “He has
hurt me,

10:51.164 --> 10:54.936
so I’ll put him right one day. I’ll take
a revenge!” –

10:55.137 --> 10:57.360
if there’s a snake within us.

10:57.561 --> 11:04.462
But now, if there’s a tiger within you: so
you’ll become very ferocious.

11:04.663 --> 11:09.148
At the smallest thing, you’ll get angry,
lose temper.

11:09.349 --> 11:18.207
Now, this is not a very good situation,

11:18.408 --> 11:22.766
that we are still at the level of animals

11:22.967 --> 11:26.550
and our inheritance is still working in us.

11:26.751 --> 11:30.552
So we have to keep a-watch, we have to be
good gurus.

11:30.753 --> 11:33.531
And for good guru, you have to have

11:33.732 --> 11:42.716
a very peaceful, compassionate, loving
temperament.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.581
After all,

11:56.257 --> 12:02.738
one has to understand that people have
this inheritance

12:02.939 --> 12:09.603
and some people have more, some people
have this, or some people have that.

12:09.817 --> 12:18.802
For that, if you get angry with that person
it’s not going to help him or help you,

12:19.003 --> 12:24.696
but if you are loving and compassionate,
and you explain that person

12:24.897 --> 12:28.510
what is the problem is and what you want
to do,

12:28.711 --> 12:30.627
I tell you, it will improve.

12:30.828 --> 12:34.588
He’ll definitely improve and he’ll feel
your love.

12:34.789 --> 12:43.272
Of course, sometimes, sometimes is
necessary to also forgive such a person.

12:43.473 --> 12:47.435
Such a person is to be forgiven,
absolutely.

12:47.636 --> 12:51.097
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs,

12:51.298 --> 12:53.697
all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

12:53.898 --> 12:57.691
and he goes on still with the same.
It doesn’t mean that.

12:57.892 --> 13:03.950
‘Forgiven’ means ‘forgotten’. Such and such
a person has been misbehaving,

13:04.151 --> 13:08.260
so just forget. Forget it. Completely
forget it!

13:08.461 --> 13:12.819
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja
Yogi guru.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.474
I must say other gurus were not like that.

13:16.675 --> 13:24.506
They were absolutely, I would say,
extremely hot-tempered

13:24.707 --> 13:28.931
and they used to lose temper on people.

13:29.132 --> 13:36.353
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them,

13:36.639 --> 13:40.450
and with this kindness You cannot create
good people.

13:40.651 --> 13:47.499
I have had enough of it!”, he said. “I had
made two people into gurus.

13:47.700 --> 13:52.654
And one of them got lost in the money.”

13:52.855 --> 13:54.891
“Alright, what happened to the second?”

13:55.091 --> 13:59.845
“And second one got lost in the women.”

14:00.046 --> 14:06.097
So, I said, “Now it’s alright, if they are
lost, they are lost.

14:06.298 --> 14:09.770
But if you can revive them with your love,
affection

14:09.970 --> 14:14.176
and kindness, better get around them.”

14:14.377 --> 14:20.448
So, the one who was lost…

14:22.847 --> 14:28.184
[I think if you open that door, people
sitting outside can also hear Me.

14:28.385 --> 14:32.358
So who are those sitting outside?

14:35.918 --> 14:42.322
Open it fully. Of course!

15:07.143 --> 15:09.540
Good.

15:28.215 --> 15:32.809
Let them move this side.

15:41.093 --> 15:44.236
Now is better.]

15:54.805 --> 15:58.043
So as a guru, you must conclude

15:58.244 --> 16:02.725
that they are still lingering with their
inheritance.

16:02.926 --> 16:10.851
But the second problem is much worse
because human beings can think.

16:11.470 --> 16:16.148
Of course, animals also think, but it is
always conditioning.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.056
Whatever conditioning they have,
accordingly they behave.

16:20.257 --> 16:27.283
But they don’t have ego, that kind,
as human beings have developed.

16:27.484 --> 16:34.105
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

16:34.359 --> 16:39.695
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that,

16:39.720 --> 16:43.921
“We have done so much! We have worked
so hard

16:44.306 --> 16:46.592
to achieve this state.

16:46.616 --> 16:49.491
And why should I give realization to others."

16:50.719 --> 16:57.711
Or, if they have got Realisation, then,

16:57.896 --> 17:01.934
“What have they done? Why should they
get Realisation?”

17:02.135 --> 17:09.364
It’s become a comparison between their
own state, and how they have achieved it,

17:09.564 --> 17:12.674
and how others have to achieve it.

17:12.875 --> 17:25.561
So they make all kinds of different
torturing, troubling maneuvers.

17:25.762 --> 17:36.253
For example, they may make the disciple
stand on his head,

17:36.454 --> 17:41.188
give his family up, do this, do that.

17:41.389 --> 17:44.616
They’ll beat the - they can beat also.

17:44.816 --> 17:50.423
They will make him stay in the water
for a long time.

17:50.624 --> 17:57.259
Make him stand on the one feet. Like this
they punish.

17:57.460 --> 18:04.498
And the worse comes to worse,

18:04.699 --> 18:11.410
they may beat with sticks or with stones.
They are like that.

18:11.611 --> 18:15.855
They don’t want to talk. They don’t want
to understand

18:16.031 --> 18:18.874
what the another person has to say,

18:19.075 --> 18:25.175
or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

18:26.978 --> 18:33.235
All this anger and all these things might
have been alright before,

18:33.436 --> 18:38.304
but after the advent of Sahaja Yoga, you
must know it is not necessary.

18:38.505 --> 18:47.460
It is not at all necessary to give any
physical punishment to your disciples.

18:47.770 --> 18:53.717
Now, also the mental punishment to your
disciples should not be given.

18:53.926 --> 18:59.723
Like people start saying all kinds
of things to their disciples.

18:59.924 --> 19:03.838
Like, say - I’m saying, say there’s
a leader,

19:04.039 --> 19:08.765
and the leader finds something wrong
with the disciple,

19:08.966 --> 19:12.848
then he goes on saying, “Now, you are like
this, your father was like this,

19:13.049 --> 19:16.503
your grandfather was like this, your
great-grandfather was like this

19:16.704 --> 19:22.388
and you are also like this!” Or some sort
of thing that will hurt him.

19:22.589 --> 19:27.576
By hurting a person, you are not going
to help.

19:27.777 --> 19:32.235
Supposing, while walking you are hurt,
you can’t walk.

19:32.436 --> 19:40.218
In your spiritual ascent also, if you are
hurt, you cannot go ahead.

19:40.419 --> 19:44.611
So not to hurt people is very important.

19:44.812 --> 19:50.165
Once you go on hurting others, then you
are not a good guru.

19:50.366 --> 19:59.894
You are not a one who is really being kind
and understanding of the disciple.

20:00.256 --> 20:04.029
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a different thing
altogether.

20:04.230 --> 20:09.456
Because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga
without doing any kind of penance,

20:09.656 --> 20:17.951
any kind of guilty consciousness,
confessions, anything. Nothing!

20:18.241 --> 20:22.918
As you are, you got your Realisation.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.162
Nobody had to stand on their heads,
give up their husbands, wives,

20:27.363 --> 20:30.660
their families, this thing – nothing
of that kind.

20:30.861 --> 20:34.554
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,

20:34.755 --> 20:42.229
whatever conditions you are, you are given
Realisation – is a fact.

20:42.425 --> 20:44.623
You don’t have to pay for it.

20:44.824 --> 20:48.569
You don’t have to exert yourself. Don’t
have to do anything.

20:48.769 --> 20:54.116
Just you get it, sitting down, wherever
you are.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.694
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you

20:59.894 --> 21:04.986
that you have a power of love,
of compassion.

21:05.187 --> 21:10.346
Out of your love you have given Realisation
to people. We never realise that.

21:10.547 --> 21:14.023
Supposing we are anxious to give
Realisation to people,

21:14.196 --> 21:18.648
we want to go to the villages and work
there, and give them Realisation.

21:18.849 --> 21:21.412
Why? Why do we do it?

21:21.628 --> 21:26.648
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything,

21:26.848 --> 21:31.947
but just out of the love that is within
your heart, that you feel,

21:32.148 --> 21:36.787
“Why am I enjoying everything? Why others
are not enjoying?”

21:36.988 --> 21:45.357
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realisation.

21:45.558 --> 21:48.693
Now you have become a greater human being

21:48.855 --> 21:52.549
and you feel concerned - others are getting
ruined,

21:52.750 --> 21:56.428
they are going on a wrong path, they are
doing wrong things,

21:56.629 --> 22:04.787
and that makes you feel very, very upset
and you want to help them.

22:06.179 --> 22:11.334
And this understanding, once you have, then
you will know how to deal

22:11.503 --> 22:19.033
with the person with whom you have
to behave like a guru.

22:19.907 --> 22:27.165
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

22:27.530 --> 22:32.654
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they are committing.

22:32.855 --> 22:37.139
But that too in a such a soft manner

22:37.340 --> 22:44.679
that a person doesn’t get any shock out
of that.

22:45.774 --> 22:55.997
All this thing of attachments also: now,
somebody has too much attachment,

22:56.198 --> 23:02.307
say, for the family, for the wife, for
the husband, children or something.

23:02.508 --> 23:09.761
And once they come to Sahaj Yog, still they
have the same amount of attachment –

23:09.962 --> 23:12.984
alright, doesn’t matter.

23:13.185 --> 23:16.888
But how far they will go with that
attachment,

23:17.089 --> 23:24.317
how long it will continue, is the point.
You should be detached.

23:24.518 --> 23:31.338
If I say, you cannot be. It’s a state. It’s
a state of mind when you are detached.

23:31.539 --> 23:35.791
But when it comes to doing something
for them,

23:35.992 --> 23:42.255
you will go all out to help them. But you
are not an attached person.

23:42.455 --> 23:47.274
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

23:47.475 --> 23:52.267
Attached person is always worried about
the other person,

23:52.468 --> 23:58.753
goes on thinking about the other person,
cannot think of Sahaja Yoga,

23:58.954 --> 24:02.511
only think of the people with whom he is
attached.

24:02.712 --> 24:05.655
Then he is very sensitive. You can’t say
anything

24:05.855 --> 24:10.398
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise
he jumps.

24:10.599 --> 24:16.929
Attachment is also with the name that
he has.

24:17.130 --> 24:21.579
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing,

24:21.780 --> 24:27.006
or some big position, then what does he do?

24:27.207 --> 24:31.936
You can’t challenge him any way.

24:32.137 --> 24:36.185
You cannot, by any words you can challenge
him,

24:36.386 --> 24:39.176
because he is so identified with that.

24:39.376 --> 24:46.284
He thinks he is a big person who has
achieved such a lot of positions in life.

24:46.485 --> 24:58.920
He’s so much attached that he wants
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

24:59.121 --> 25:10.149
Now, which is the way you can solve that
problem?

25:12.008 --> 25:20.316
Supposing somebody is very much attached
to his wife, say, for example:

25:20.517 --> 25:26.005
then you should not discuss and argue with
that person, not at all,

25:26.206 --> 25:32.451
because he is still coming up slowly,
slowly, up to this stage.

25:32.652 --> 25:39.097
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

25:39.298 --> 25:45.875
So what do you have to do? If he is
attached to his wife, let it be.

25:47.309 --> 25:52.910
But the Divine will work it out, and he
will realise

25:53.111 --> 26:01.623
that what he has been thinking, doing and
taking decisions is all wrong.

26:01.976 --> 26:07.247
And once he discovered it himself, then
he will get detached.

26:07.447 --> 26:11.715
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out,

26:11.916 --> 26:16.940
it will never work out. So you must
understand

26:17.141 --> 26:24.869
that, as human beings, whatever we were,
also as Sahaja Yogis we have problems,

26:25.070 --> 26:30.589
and these should be slowly, slowly, should
be dissolved.

26:30.790 --> 26:34.351
Not by argument, not by saying things,

26:34.552 --> 26:43.581
but by love and compassion. If you have
love for a person -

26:44.192 --> 26:49.897
you’ll be amazed, ninety-nine percent
people value love.

26:50.937 --> 26:54.953
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

26:55.154 --> 26:59.133
First is his inheritance, second is he
thinks

26:59.334 --> 27:02.908
and thirdly that he values love.

27:03.109 --> 27:09.230
Anybody who loves, the another person
values that love,

27:09.431 --> 27:18.628
because he thinks that, “This particular
person is loving me, not my wealth,

27:18.829 --> 27:23.858
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he
is loving me!”

27:24.059 --> 27:31.431
And this idea of love, this is something
that will get him

27:31.632 --> 27:36.940
completely detached from that person,
easily. How?

27:37.140 --> 27:41.641
Now, it looks very funny that, if you like
somebody,

27:41.842 --> 27:48.603
if you love somebody, and then you should
get detached.

27:48.804 --> 27:52.462
Is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

27:52.663 --> 27:58.513
In Sahaja Yoga, your state of mind is such

27:58.713 --> 28:09.153
that you are absolutely detached and
absolutely attached. How?

28:09.354 --> 28:22.700
For example, now, say, I have My daughter.
So I’m detached.

28:22.901 --> 28:27.228
I never telephone to her, I’m never
bothered about her.

28:27.429 --> 28:31.863
Because in Sahaja Yoga you know how is
that person.

28:32.063 --> 28:35.102
If the vibrations are alright, why should
you telephone?

28:35.303 --> 28:38.459
Why should you talk to her? Why should you
ask for anything?

28:38.660 --> 28:43.986
No need. Only on vibrations you’ll know
how the person is.

28:44.187 --> 28:48.094
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

28:48.263 --> 28:53.316
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing

28:53.517 --> 28:57.610
or are indicating something serious about
that person,

28:57.811 --> 29:06.470
what you will do you’ll put full attention
to that. Full attention.

29:06.671 --> 29:11.385
You put attention, but not attachment.

29:12.028 --> 29:15.315
So the attachment doesn’t solve
the problem.

29:15.516 --> 29:19.017
What solves the problem is attention.

29:19.218 --> 29:26.847
But when you are not detached, then your
attention is attached attention.

29:27.048 --> 29:33.223
It’s an attention that is not available
to everyone,

29:33.424 --> 29:37.121
an attention that gets stuck, absolutely
stuck

29:37.322 --> 29:43.599
into that person with whom you are
identified. You try to understand.

29:43.799 --> 29:51.329
So to be identified with someone is not
actually, what we can say,

29:51.530 --> 29:55.415
paying attention to that person.

29:55.954 --> 29:59.024
And then your attention will work.

29:59.225 --> 30:02.659
If you are of that level, whenever you
put attention

30:02.860 --> 30:08.304
to that particular person who needs your
attention, it will work out.

30:08.505 --> 30:12.414
But if you are all the time wasting your
attention on a person

30:12.615 --> 30:15.427
because you are attached to that person,

30:15.628 --> 30:20.909
your attention will be tired, it won’t work
out.

30:21.110 --> 30:29.365
It’s a big – I should say – paradox, that
if you are attached to someone,

30:29.566 --> 30:33.202
then your attention doesn’t work out.

30:33.403 --> 30:37.794
And if you are not attached to that person,
you do everything else.

30:37.994 --> 30:40.160
Now, You - I have to give lecture, alright,
I’m giving lecture,

30:40.360 --> 30:44.120
then I have to do some cooking, I’ll do
cooking; this, that, that and that.

30:44.321 --> 30:48.161
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person,

30:48.361 --> 30:55.129
all the time you want to have connection
with that person, it’s not necessary.

30:55.330 --> 31:00.570
That person is alright. What is there to be
so much worried about that person?

31:00.770 --> 31:03.750
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things,

31:03.950 --> 31:06.027
you have to raise Kundalini of so many -

31:06.227 --> 31:12.426
now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, is not a very good thing.

31:12.627 --> 31:18.085
By that kind of attachment, your attention
also becomes

31:18.286 --> 31:24.515
useless, absolutely useless. So let
the attention be free.

31:24.716 --> 31:32.052
Attention should not be bound by your
attachments.

31:32.253 --> 31:36.061
Attention should be absolutely free,

31:36.262 --> 31:42.952
so it works automatically, automatically.

31:43.153 --> 31:47.805
And you will be amazed, even if you do not
pay attention,

31:48.006 --> 31:50.913
the attention will work it (out).

31:51.114 --> 31:56.558
It is such a great thing to have this
spiritual attention,

31:56.759 --> 32:01.100
which is nothing but love. It will just
act.

32:01.300 --> 32:05.728
You’ll be amazed how it acts.

32:06.020 --> 32:10.469
It’s another world I’m talking about, not
this mundane world,

32:10.677 --> 32:15.875
but something higher, where your attention
works,

32:16.076 --> 32:20.348
and works so beautifully that you are
amazed how it has worked.

32:20.549 --> 32:24.830
But you should not bound it by your
attachments.

32:25.031 --> 32:28.664
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere -

32:28.865 --> 32:34.683
only the people who are attached to you,
or you are attached to those persons.

32:35.103 --> 32:42.448
That’s why identification is not the way
a guru should work it out.

32:48.973 --> 32:58.731
Now, there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

32:58.932 --> 33:02.279
He thinks, “You see, he is the best and he
should be encouraged

33:02.495 --> 33:11.110
and should be given all the possible help.”
But that’s not going to help.

33:11.311 --> 33:14.876
What, on the contrary, he should say is,
“This is already a good fellow.

33:15.077 --> 33:18.630
He has risen very high. He’s gone very
deep.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.863
So pay attention to those who are not
so good

33:23.064 --> 33:29.342
and talk to them about it, that: “You have
to come up.” In a very sweet manner.

33:29.543 --> 33:35.115
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there,

33:35.316 --> 33:41.387
or who are still struggling. You have
to understand them.

33:41.588 --> 33:46.768
You have to notice: What are they doing?

33:46.968 --> 33:54.477
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

33:54.678 --> 34:00.191
What is the problem? Why the Divine is
not flowing through them?

34:00.392 --> 34:06.805
And you’ll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention –

34:06.982 --> 34:11.971
is because it is focused on someone
all the time,

34:12.626 --> 34:17.496
and they feel it is their responsibility
that it should be focused.

34:17.697 --> 34:24.999
It’s just to give, you see, an explanation.
It’s just an explanation to say that

34:25.200 --> 34:30.248
“You see, naturally, I have to be worried
about this and worried about that!”

34:30.449 --> 34:33.467
It’s just an explanation.

34:33.668 --> 34:38.495
But if you really don’t fix your attention

34:38.696 --> 34:41.970
to one person or ten persons only,

34:42.171 --> 34:48.124
then your attention looks after the whole
world.

34:52.309 --> 34:58.735
It receives all the information and also
it gives

34:58.935 --> 35:06.138
all the information what is to be done
to correct that situation.

35:06.339 --> 35:11.193
So one has to rise into that state where
you do not get angry,

35:11.394 --> 35:16.202
annoyed, upset. No, not at all.

35:16.403 --> 35:23.677
What happens to you, that you see
a situation

35:23.878 --> 35:28.999
and in that you are not involved.

35:29.200 --> 35:33.438
You see the situation and you are away
from it.

35:33.639 --> 35:37.868
Then you can solve that problem better.

35:38.069 --> 35:45.565
But if you are part and parcel of that
problem, then you cannot solve.

35:45.992 --> 35:52.561
It’s like this, I was telling, that those
who are fighting, say,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.616
cannot solve the problem.

35:57.817 --> 36:05.407
But a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

36:05.608 --> 36:15.685
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that, if you are identified,

36:15.886 --> 36:27.100
if you are involved with one person or with
one kind of a thing, then you are lost.

36:28.833 --> 36:32.519
So our attention has to be always free

36:32.720 --> 36:38.167
and can be applied widely, wherever needed.

36:38.368 --> 36:44.068
That is the state one has to reach. If you
reach that state of mind, is -

36:44.269 --> 36:49.804
not I’m saying you can do anything about
it, it’s just a state of mind.

36:50.005 --> 36:57.322
Now, how do we do that? Only through
introspection.

36:59.043 --> 37:02.782
Through introspection you will understand

37:02.983 --> 37:09.570
that you need help to solve your problems.

37:09.771 --> 37:15.673
Firstly, the problem is how to face
yourself,

37:15.874 --> 37:23.280
because you are little bit shy or maybe
nervous about it.

37:23.564 --> 37:34.593
As the time comes, you’ll be amazed that
this nervousness has no meaning at all.

37:34.924 --> 37:46.941
When you try to be deliberate about it,
then it won’t work out,

37:47.142 --> 37:51.043
but if you are sahaj it will work out.

37:51.244 --> 37:56.431
So we come to the second point, apart
from the attention,

37:56.632 --> 38:02.398
that we should leave everything into
the hands of Paramchaitanya.

38:02.599 --> 38:06.123
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

38:06.324 --> 38:10.621
“This is the problem. Let Paramchaitanya
solve the problem.

38:10.822 --> 38:15.197
We are not bothered!” So a detachment
comes in.

38:15.398 --> 38:20.005
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve.

38:20.206 --> 38:24.516
So you are not in it, you are away from it.

38:24.717 --> 38:30.004
Very, very simple things are there, that
if you understand

38:30.205 --> 38:37.308
that we suffer because everybody feels
responsible for us.

38:37.509 --> 38:45.063
Everybody thinks they are responsible,
they have to do this responsibility for us.

38:45.264 --> 38:47.863
Somebody says, this responsibility he has
to do.

38:48.064 --> 38:52.021
All these things are worrying them and that
is the reason

38:52.222 --> 38:56.707
today we have a very complex society.

38:56.908 --> 39:00.684
They are suffering from all kinds
of diseases,

39:00.885 --> 39:06.044
in which only thinking is responsible.

39:06.245 --> 39:09.169
By this thinking all the time – thinking
about one person,

39:09.370 --> 39:13.937
thinking about one problem – you reach
nowhere.

39:14.138 --> 39:19.446
At that moment, what you have to do is
to leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

39:19.647 --> 39:26.624
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage,

39:32.607 --> 39:39.183
It will solve the problem. Now I will tell
you one thing, an experience:

39:39.384 --> 39:43.623
this time I was in America and we wanted
to have a puja there.

39:43.824 --> 39:50.524
So I said, “Alright, let them come for
the puja. It’s nice if they want to come.”

39:50.724 --> 39:55.627
Then they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to bring presents for you, for the puja,

39:55.828 --> 40:02.439
so how can we bring the presents?” I said,
“It’s very simple: don’t bring!”.

40:02.640 --> 40:06.799
But they wouldn’t listen to that. They
said, “We’ll have to bring,

40:07.000 --> 40:11.397
and the customs will trouble us and do
this and do that.”

40:11.605 --> 40:16.249
So there was only one building ahead,

40:16.450 --> 40:24.047
there was another building, where they were
having a liquidation sale.

40:24.248 --> 40:27.821
I said, “This is something nice! One can
have a look at it.”

40:28.022 --> 40:33.978
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable!

40:34.179 --> 40:38.988
Very, very expensive things for throw-away
prices.

40:39.189 --> 40:41.705
I was amazed how it is there.

40:41.905 --> 40:45.374
So I told them, “I can purchase all these
things. I’ll pay you.

40:45.575 --> 40:48.414
But you bring all these things
to Canajoharie.”

40:48.615 --> 40:52.727
They agreed, “Alright, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

40:52.928 --> 40:58.003
And they brought all the things, all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

40:58.204 --> 41:05.133
We had no problem of customs or anything.
I paid them there.

41:07.326 --> 41:11.879
How, you see, things can be improved,

41:12.080 --> 41:24.748
by understanding what is the most important
thing is to love.

41:24.949 --> 41:30.767
But love is truth and truth is love.

41:30.968 --> 41:36.952
If you have love for somebody, genuine
love,

41:37.153 --> 41:44.620
then anything you want to do with that
person will be absolutely obvious

41:44.820 --> 41:48.710
because it will be truthful.

41:49.283 --> 41:54.277
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut,

41:54.478 --> 41:58.637
because it is absolutely truthful.

41:58.838 --> 42:01.998
So when you are dealing with somebody,
also,

42:02.199 --> 42:05.495
you should be extremely truthful.

42:05.696 --> 42:10.322
Of course, you need not say things that
will hurt him,

42:10.499 --> 42:15.382
but you must use such ways and methods

42:15.583 --> 42:20.500
that will not, in any way, hurt the other
person -

42:20.701 --> 42:24.780
which will have an effect on that person.

42:25.558 --> 42:30.355
So this kind of a gurus we need now,
very much, in Sahaja Yoga,

42:30.555 --> 42:33.757
because Sahaja Yoga has spread a lot.

42:33.958 --> 42:41.104
So first of all, our temper has to be
brought into proper shape.

42:41.313 --> 42:45.811
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru, has no business

42:46.012 --> 42:53.478
to lose temper, at all, on any point
whatsoever.

42:53.896 --> 43:00.181
If they can really do that much, it will
save our,

43:00.382 --> 43:08.144
I mean, so much of worry, so much
of problems, so much of mess we create.

43:08.345 --> 43:16.995
All this can be solved very easily, but
first we must have pure love in our heart,

43:17.196 --> 43:21.742
not love out of some gain or out of some
sort of a reward,

43:21.942 --> 43:26.271
but pure love if we have, then we can work
it out,

43:26.472 --> 43:31.615
very easily, anything that you want to do.

43:31.816 --> 43:38.631
This is a very lengthy thing which can
go on forever

43:38.832 --> 43:44.938
because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties

43:45.139 --> 43:49.564
and why they are gurus. It’s very
important,

43:49.765 --> 43:53.312
very important position that they are
gurus.

43:53.520 --> 43:59.337
And they should use that position for
exhibiting

43:59.538 --> 44:03.230
tremendous understanding of their
disciples,

44:03.431 --> 44:11.330
and also their purpose, it should be
clear-cut.

44:11.531 --> 44:13.709
People should not doubt him,

44:13.910 --> 44:18.243
should not think, “Why he is doing such
and such things?”

44:18.444 --> 44:25.574
It should not be a mystery, but it should
be absolutely clear-cut.

44:26.668 --> 44:31.657
All these things I’m telling you today,
because today

44:31.858 --> 44:38.653
we have completed ten - our ten years
of stay in Cabella.

44:38.854 --> 44:42.118
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me,

44:42.319 --> 44:46.837
it has brought forth lots of people
to Sahaja Yoga,

44:47.038 --> 44:49.681
I tell you – very lots of people.

44:49.882 --> 44:53.243
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it

44:53.444 --> 44:56.638
and said, “Where are You going to live?”
and all that.

44:56.838 --> 45:02.734
But here only it has worked, and that
should be accepted

45:02.935 --> 45:15.797
as a very good indication that Sahaja Yoga
does miraculous things – miraculous.

45:15.960 --> 45:22.877
But the foremost thing is you must know
vibrations.

45:23.139 --> 45:26.436
If you don’t know about vibrations then you
can’t do it.

45:26.637 --> 45:29.457
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me,

45:29.658 --> 45:33.032
“Mother, very lonely place, there are
mafias around,

45:33.233 --> 45:39.157
they have only six, seven houses there.
Where are You going? What is this?”.

45:39.358 --> 45:43.928
They all warned Me. So I came here

45:44.129 --> 45:46.589
and immediately I told the mayor,
“I’m going to buy it

45:46.790 --> 45:49.886
and tomorrow I’ll pay you the money.”

45:50.087 --> 45:55.658
He was surprised, how can I do that.

45:55.859 --> 46:02.234
I said, “Don’t worry! Perfectly alright”.
On vibrations it worked.

46:02.435 --> 46:08.398
On vibrations I decided that this is
a wonderful place

46:08.599 --> 46:14.969
and vibrations helped Me so much that time;
though everybody discouraged Me

46:15.170 --> 46:19.566
and everybody gave Me a very big picture,
horrible one.

46:19.767 --> 46:25.647
But still, where is the mafia now?
It’s gone, finished.

46:28.447 --> 46:33.825
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

46:34.026 --> 46:42.015
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

46:42.203 --> 46:48.033
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

46:48.234 --> 46:53.168
your particular ideas about particular
things,

46:53.369 --> 46:59.389
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

47:00.371 --> 47:04.819
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

47:05.020 --> 47:08.415
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

47:08.616 --> 47:15.224
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

47:15.425 --> 47:21.324
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

47:22.885 --> 47:27.756
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

47:27.957 --> 47:32.399
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

47:32.600 --> 47:40.115
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

47:40.316 --> 47:46.513
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

47:46.714 --> 47:50.686
It emits and creates a path for you,

47:50.887 --> 47:55.448
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

47:55.649 --> 47:59.956
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

48:00.157 --> 48:04.935
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

48:05.136 --> 48:09.564
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

48:09.764 --> 48:17.161
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

48:17.362 --> 48:20.577
May God bless you all.

48:34.812 --> 48:39.687
There’s one thing is important
to understand,

48:39.888 --> 48:43.761
that you should not go to extremes
of everything –

48:43.962 --> 48:46.351
which is also a human quality.

48:46.551 --> 48:51.555
For example, if they are rational, they
go on rationalising everything,

48:51.756 --> 48:56.968
“I can’t do this, I can’t do that,”
something like that, goes on.

48:57.169 --> 49:01.677
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional,

49:01.878 --> 49:05.229
and they become so emotional that they
start doing wrong things

49:05.430 --> 49:12.244
in the name of emotionality. You have
to overcome these two things.

49:12.445 --> 49:16.174
If you have not overcome that, what’s
the use?

49:16.375 --> 49:18.732
What’s the use of calling yourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

49:18.933 --> 49:22.691
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

49:22.892 --> 49:27.522
Going to the extremes must be avoided.
Keep a-watch upon yourself.

49:27.723 --> 49:31.775
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out.

49:31.976 --> 49:36.596
You might develop cancer, develop very
horrible diseases on one side,

49:36.797 --> 49:40.620
and on the other side you might become
a very rational person

49:40.821 --> 49:44.761
and no Sahaja Yoga will enter your head.

49:44.962 --> 49:51.274
So you have to keep the balance
all the time.

49:51.474 --> 49:56.393
And with that balance - like, somebody
is a Sahaja Yogini

49:56.594 --> 49:58.856
and she has done something very wrong,

49:59.057 --> 50:02.036
then you should not become emotionally
attached,

50:02.237 --> 50:04.757
“Oh, Mother, what is it? We should forgive
her.”

50:04.958 --> 50:15.961
No. You tell her that, “You must improve
your vibrations and must come to balance.

50:16.161 --> 50:23.825
And once you are in balance, then I will –
I will consider your case.

50:24.026 --> 50:28.921
Then I will say it is so or not.” But if he
has no balance,

50:29.122 --> 50:33.330
he goes into rationality, he goes into
emotional things -

50:33.531 --> 50:37.744
and this emotional business can take you
to any, any nonsensical thing,

50:37.945 --> 50:43.504
as it is a psychological case. And one
can go into very, very wrong things

50:43.705 --> 50:47.595
that they are doing out of this emotional
thing;

50:47.796 --> 50:55.123
you see, like even singing songs that are
neurotic, or anything, you see.

50:55.333 --> 50:58.698
All this emotional thing can take you
anywhere.

50:58.878 --> 51:03.465
So to be emotional is not needed, and you
must love.

51:03.666 --> 51:09.714
And left one is the, is what you can call
another extreme.

51:09.914 --> 51:16.169
One side is - it is emotional, another
is rational.

51:16.370 --> 51:19.415
In rationality, you can start justifying
anything,

51:19.616 --> 51:23.781
like Hitler did. He said, “No, this was
right.

51:23.982 --> 51:26.910
I was doing was right!” He took something
into his head

51:27.111 --> 51:30.088
and ‘now, this was right’. This is
rationality.

51:30.289 --> 51:34.856
So both things are to be properly balanced
and you should see that

51:35.057 --> 51:41.525
whatever you are doing, are giving you
a proper result.

51:43.805 --> 51:46.227
So thank you very much again and again.

51:46.428 --> 51:49.271
May God bless you.

52:02.886 --> 52:04.622
May God bless you all.
