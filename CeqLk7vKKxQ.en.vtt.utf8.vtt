00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.069
So many questions, you see...

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.510
Now, most of the questions are coming from
people who doubt.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.910
Can you translate it?

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:28.730
In Sahaja Yoga best thing is to practice what
is said and then see for yourself, but if

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:40.220
they're coming I would like to tell them about
it.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:52.660
Now the first one is about vegetarianism,
somebody's asked.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.149
Who has asked about vegetarianism?

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.250
Raise your hand.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.040
Ah, you, all right.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.429
Now, I said that there should be, there is
no question of vegetarianism; whether you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:15.409
are a vegetarian or not makes no difference
to your meditation.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.610
But for people, you see, the food is only
important because supposing you're Chinese,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.590
you eat too much of fish and all that.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.700
So to give it a balance, if you become a vegetarian
more you'd be better.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.820
It's a question of balancing, but those people
who eat too much of, say, vegetarians, like

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.510
in India, they should take more to non-veg,
or to proteins; it's a question of carbohydrates

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.140
and proteins, it's not question of vegetarianism.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.210
Now to say that Buddha was vegetarian is not
true; it's false.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.149
Because how Buddha died, you know?

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:04.719
Buddha died when he went to a disciple who
had killed a wild boar, and the wild boar

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.470
is allowed to leave for some time and then
you should eat the meat.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.392
But he was in a hurry, so they didn't do that
and he ate it and he died.

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:20.669
Now the problem with all of you is one, always,
like whether you're Christians or Buddhists

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.320
or anything, you're all conditioned background.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.079
To you Buddha is everything.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.540
What did Buddha do for you?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.340
Where is he?

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.500
What is he doing?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.870
What did he do for the Buddhists?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.660
Did he give you Realization?

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.390
But you all are like that, even the Christians
are like that.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.480
They're so much conditioned by Christ.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.359
You see, they are either Christ or Mohammad
Sahib or someone like that, but I'm sitting

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.450
before you.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.250
They're not here.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.250
Who has given you Realization?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.470
Try to understand.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.620
So why be so much conditioned by Buddha?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.570
Buddha was never, never was a vegetarian;
he died because of that.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.709
He ate that meat and he died; so it's a wrong
idea that Buddha was a vegetarian.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.570
It's all myths they're going about and there
is no need to be vegetarian; if you are suffering

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.060
from too much of protein intake you should
take to vegetarianism.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.840
It's good for you if you have that problem,
and in China eat so much of, say, fish.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.980
So they should take more vegetables with it,
not only the fish because with fish you have

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.980
phosphorous.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.049
Now do you know about your genes, we have
a database of the genes.

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.720
There are three things, carbohydrates, there
is phosphorous and there is nitrogen.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.600
Nitrogen is good for your health, for your
ascent, for everything.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.820
But what happens?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:55.000
People eat too much of proteins and fish and
all that; then they create more phosphorous,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.220
they become very right-sided, their eyes are
spoilt and the whole balance is lost.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.220
Do you follow the point?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.329
The balance is lost; so what you have to do...

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.660
So the people who are eating too much of phosphorous
must take to carbohydrates.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:26.100
So it will suit some people who are eating
too much of proteins or too much of phosphorous

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.010
should take to more vegetarian food, will
help; but it's not the way we should judge

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:41.930
it we start by taking vegetarianism will become
a realized soul, you cannot.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.370
Some people it will improve the meditation,
with some people it will not.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.540
For example Me, I can't take vegetarian food
for more than two days, I get diarrhea, inaudible

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.540
sympathetic.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.780
I just get diarrhea, I cannot eat.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:02.150
I cannot also eat all the time fish, I have
to eat a very much of protein food.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:10.260
You see for the Goddess they offered a lamb
or sometimes a goat, this is the reason She

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.570
has to take proteins.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.580
This is what it is that She has to take proteins,
and somebody has to take, say, more of carbohydrates,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.250
they should take.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:31.790
But it doesn't suit everyone.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:42.770
"We learn that several gurus in Hong Kong..."

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.860
Who is this Sarah Lee?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.860
All right.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.050
"We learn that several gurus in Hong Kong
promote their exegeses free of charge and

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.460
promise the followers that they can get rid
of their karma once they give their faiths

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:04.090
to their guru as they are also promoting internal
peace and transcendence and they do not charge

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.200
for anything.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.870
What are they aiming at?"

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.910
They're just aiming at controlling you.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.700
Just they want to control some people, that's
all; it's a power game, and that's what they

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.350
want to do, it's a power game.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.150
And I'm sure at certain point they must be
taking money also.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.970
Now the thing is if they were giving peace
and they're talking about karma.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.759
I'm not talking of karma.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:34.420
I'm saying you've to go beyond your mind and
it has to be connected with scientific ideas,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.210
that you have to go beyond your mind.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.040
They never say like this, "We'll get rid of
your karmas."

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.090
How can you?

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.500
Who does the karma?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.500
Ask them.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.310
Ask them five questions, they'll be all right.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.310
They don't know about ego, they don't know
about conditioning, they don't know about

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.900
chakras, nothing they know.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.170
They might be cheating you just, I mean it's
just anybody can start something like that

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:57.530
but what is the validity.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.610
Validity is that do they talk relevantly,
do they talk about the inner side, do they

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.110
talk about the chakras, do they talk about
the Kundalini?

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:13.460
Now you have got your Kundalini awakened;
that should give you faith not in Me but in

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.460
yourself.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.350
You have no faith in yourself, that's why
you start thinking like this.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.531
If you have faith in your achievements, what
you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga, you

00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:24.400
won't ask such questions.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.200
All right, so this is over...

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:43.740
There's somebody, a new yogini, she said she
cannot believe in her own feelings.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.570
Who's this one, from Japan?

00:07:48.570 --> 00:08:00.180
Now see, there's nothing to believe in your
own feelings, no question.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.169
You have to believe in your vibrations.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:07.949
You should see what sort of vibrations you
get.

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:13.000
Supposing you are very much inclined for something.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.670
So try to find out of someone, try to find
out on your vibrations, you can find out whether

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.670
it is true or not.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:29.900
Because now you have jumped into an awareness
where you know the absolute but it's not necessary

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.380
that you have reached that state.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.240
But I'll tell you how to reach that state,
it's different but just now as it is, you

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.700
have to go beyond your mind.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.200
And that is what one has to achieve, all right?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:53.970
So how to go beyond your mind, that I'll tell
you.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:09:01.830
Now who's Pamela Ng?

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:16.150
All right, well, she says that when she came
first to meditation she was sleeping very

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.810
well, it was effective after, and all that
and then later on she started...

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:26.660
Now see, look, if you are just thinking about
yourself, vibrations will go away.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:32.180
It's not given only for your benefit, it's
given for the benefit of everyone.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.680
If you're just worried about yourself the
vibrations will disappear.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.160
Because vibrations are there to give it to
others, to work for others.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:46.550
If you're not collective enough, you cannot
grow.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.110
If you do not dissolve into Sahaja Yoga you
cannot grow.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.030
And then when you don't grow you go on falling
down; you go on falling down, then you'll

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.400
lose all these things.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.490
So how many people have you given Realization?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.720
That's it.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.600
First you start giving Realizations to others
then you will understand that how joyous it

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.670
is to give Realization.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:19.350
It's not meant for you alone, it's meant for
everyone, all right?

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.890
"I believe that there are real gurus and false
gurus in this world.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:33.640
If someone follows a real guru but not Sahaja
Yoga does this still do any good for him?"

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.490
Who's this Christine?

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:43.060
Now see, I haven't met anybody who's a real
guru and who is giving Realization to others,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.029
who may be real but he cannot give Realization.

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:48.360
That's the point.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.360
So what will they do?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.500
You see, they're very hot-tempered people
mostly and they take you to task; they make

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.210
you work very hard.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:08.930
I haven't seen anybody giving Realization
so far; if you meet anyone, let Me know (laughter).

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:16.490
I'll be very happy, pass on.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:21.530
Mr. Ling, who's he?

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:27.990
Now, this is interesting, the way you're seeing
visions.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.520
Have you been to some other master before?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.950
No one?

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:32.950
No?

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:41.640
Now, you see, for this, best thing is to know
about Tao which is your speciality, it's Chinese

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:49.600
in which he describes, you see, Tao; Lao Tzu
describes the journey through the river Yangtze.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.410
I've been Myself to see that.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:12:00.240
So he says on the side or the banks there
are beautiful, very beautiful mountains and

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.390
beautiful trees and it's so beautiful that
you feel like jumping out of the boat and

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.920
going to the, these gardens and these mountains.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:18.770
But what your aim is to go through this, Tao,
means the Yangtze river, towards the river.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:26.440
In the beginning, maybe there are some currents
flowing, maybe you might lose faith in yourself.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:34.180
But by the time you reach near the sea, it
becomes very silent and you have to go to

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.610
the sea, that's the point is.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.250
So, you see, all these are there; these are
just enticing...

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.910
It's all right you see but it's nothing important
because all these will keep you on a mental

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.910
level.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.540
You'll be always thinking, "What is this vision?

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.540
What is that?"

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:54.160
There's nothing to be on the mental level,
you have to beyond, all right?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:13:36.800
If you don't see, you don't bother about it,
they'll disappear.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:51.490
These questions are nice.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:59.390
The first one is about confidence, you see
and I'm going to tell you about meditation.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.070
If you do that kind of meditation you'll get
back your confidence, all right?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.339
That's one point.

00:14:05.339 --> 00:14:09.390
And then he says if there's anything like
destiny.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:15.720
In Sahaja Yoga you decide your destiny, you
don't have to depend on any destiny.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:23.690
Then it's true that in Hong Kong is highly
polluted and lot of people get allergies and

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.149
things like that.

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:30.032
But Sahaja Yogis should take bandhans so they
won't suffer with any allergies or anything.

00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:34.500
And also you can use something to cover your
nose or something.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:40.611
I know people are smoking so much I Myself,
I absorb so much of this within Myself, but

00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:46.350
this will all go away as far as you are concerned
because you're protected, all right?

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:57.040
But the first one I'll tell you later.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.290
Werner, where's Werner?

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:16.380
Now your eyes are suffering.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:23.779
So very simple is that...

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:43.050
All right now what you have to do...

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:52.940
What is your digestion problem?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.769
You get diarrhea?

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:55.769
Constipation.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:59.950
What is your digestion problem?

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.630
Digestion, what is it?

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.690
He's already right-sided.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:10.519
You're very right-sided person, you see and
your eye trouble also come from the same.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:15.760
For the eye trouble that you are doing you
have to put ice here, on the left hand side

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.300
from here to here, and also on your liver,
all right?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:39.910
And your right-sidedness has to go, that I'll
tell you how to do it, all right?

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:47.079
This is a nice idea, that they come to your
program and then they come to puja and then

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:48.079
they disappear.

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:51.190
It's all right, now what can you do about
it?

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.320
There's no choice, if they want to disappear
let them go away.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:04.409
We cannot force them, but maybe, maybe some
of the people do not have proper behavior

00:17:04.409 --> 00:17:05.480
towards them, maybe.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.100
So you have to be careful how you talk to
them and how you approach them.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.779
You should not be aggressive with them and
all that.

00:17:14.779 --> 00:17:17.489
Maybe some of the reasons could be that.

00:17:17.489 --> 00:17:21.149
So that's very common, you see, they come
and they go away.

00:17:21.149 --> 00:17:23.200
Because this is the time of Last Judgment.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.830
If they want to go to false guru let them
go because this is their choice.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.950
You don't have to worry on that point.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:42.109
But I think sometimes, sometimes they leave
because they do not do meditation properly,

00:17:42.109 --> 00:17:52.879
and I'll tell you what is to be done properly.

00:17:52.879 --> 00:18:11.590
All right, now we have to go beyond the mind,
as I said it that mind is a myth and we live

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.940
on a mental level all the time.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:18.820
And that's why so many questions and so many
things they come from your mind.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:24.049
If you reach a state where you are beyond
the mind you won't have any questions because

00:18:24.049 --> 00:18:25.419
you will be there.

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:28.159
Because you're not there you're asking these
questions.

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:30.940
You are there for a short time and then you
come down.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.940
So how to be more on that level, I'll tell
you.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.090
I don't have that problem.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:42.110
I can be all the time beyond the mind but
for you people I've tried to find out why,

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.490
how to make it, to keep you beyond the mind.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:54.360
Now the best way I told people and it has
worked wonders that when you are, wherever

00:18:54.360 --> 00:19:00.539
you are free, whether you are meditating or
not, wherever you are freely standing or doing,

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.880
try to see what is your mind is thinking.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.019
You separate, now because you're realized
souls, you have to be, first of all, connected;

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:10.619
if you're not connected you can't do this
practice.

00:19:10.619 --> 00:19:18.700
But if you're connected to the mains then
what you should do is to see that your mind

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.799
is thinking.

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:22.169
Now watch your mind.

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:24.340
Ask the mind, "Now what are you thinking?

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.350
Let's see, what are we to think?"

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.890
And you will be surprised you'll go on watching
and suddenly you'll reach a point that you

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.690
have become thoughtless.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.190
So always watch the mind.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.389
What is it doing?

00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:37.499
What is it thinking?

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:39.340
What is it working out?

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:44.859
And the mind will just not think because it
cannot answer.

00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:50.629
It cannot answer a realized soul, you see.

00:19:50.629 --> 00:19:56.919
But for that, you have to be beyond the mind;
to begin with you should separate yourself

00:19:56.919 --> 00:20:01.179
from your mind.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:03.070
You ask questions to your mind.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.510
"Now let's see what are you thinking, sir.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.120
Where are you?"

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.080
In the mirror also you can see, you shouldn't
suffer from narcissism, of course not, but

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:45.070
what you have to do is to ask.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:21:06.190
You see, if you try to understand how to become
thoughtless, the best way is to look at something,

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.710
now you look at something, say, look at the
flowers.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.999
Now immediately it will react, your mind will
react.

00:21:12.999 --> 00:21:15.261
Now you try to see what is your mind is saying.

00:21:15.261 --> 00:21:18.940
"I don't want to hear, no, I don't want to
hear."

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.309
Just say, "I don't want to hear anything.

00:21:22.309 --> 00:21:25.419
I don't want to know anything."

00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:28.720
You just want to watch, that's all.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720
Gradually you'll grow.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.740
You see, this is the system Zen.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.820
Try to do it, but it was such a thing, you
know, that time, they were no such nice people

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.820
like you, perhaps.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.340
So he had to use other methods to make people
go beyond the thought.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.260
For example, I was telling just now about
the tea ceremony.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:56.690
For tea ceremony, he would take a bowl of,
say, freak, like a freak.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.999
Freak, you understand the freak?

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:09.190
Freak is a thing which comes out by nature
naturally in the cooking.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:16.970
When it is fried it becomes very funny type;
that is the freak.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:21.580
It's not regular.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.860
It's only one piece or something.

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:28.270
Somebody who's Japanese here, who's come from
Japan?

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.270
You?

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.489
You people, they like, that's why freak very
much, you see.

00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:41.779
So, what he said that it is... , you take
the bowl in your hand for tea ceremony, that's

00:22:41.779 --> 00:22:43.580
the best.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:51.479
So first of all, you sit in a garden, with
natural trees and natural fibers of the wood

00:22:51.479 --> 00:22:53.340
and all that, sitting down.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.009
Now you start watching that thing, three times
sitting like this and three times like that.

00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:04.240
And don't think, that's the point, don't think.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:11.409
And then you take that tea; the tea is so
sour, so bitter, take quinine raised to the

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:14.600
power of hundred and eight.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:22.649
Once you take that, you become absolutely
thoughtless; that's one.

00:23:22.649 --> 00:23:28.909
Then they give you a sweet; this sweet is
also sweetness, sugar raised to the power

00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:30.549
of hundred and eight.

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:36.679
You just can't eat it, so you went from one
extreme to another extreme; again you become

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:39.169
like that, you see, it's like standing.

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:43.879
They put this side and that side and suddenly
it works out.

00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:49.549
But it's meant for people who already have
got Realization, not for people who have not

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:50.549
got.

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:54.100
That's why still they're studying Zen, you
know, this tea ceremony.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:24:02.259
When we went to Japan, you see, in one hotel,
they had arranged this tea ceremony and some

00:24:02.259 --> 00:24:06.470
Americans, they said one couple has to come,
they were fighting, "I'll go, I'll go."

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.639
We have had the experience, so we were keeping
quiet, to see what's going to happen.

00:24:09.639 --> 00:24:14.729
And one couple came forward and knew they
were very jealous of them.

00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:19.909
They sat on the stage and then they brought
the tea; they make it with a very care and

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:22.139
all that and gave it to the wife.

00:24:22.139 --> 00:24:28.700
She drank it and she was stunned, and then
they gave it to the husband.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.190
Her husband, you know, American after all,
he got so angry he threw the bowl.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.789
He said, "Damn it!

00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:38.049
You took so much money from us and what are
you giving us?"

00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:43.210
He gave all kinds of American abuses to them
and they came away and everybody started beating

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.399
the people who had put up the show.

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:51.220
So this is meant for people who really want
to go very deep.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:59.200
In Zen we also made a big courtyard filled
with sand, with some sort of designs in the

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.419
sand and they put some stones in it.

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:09.440
You are supposed to sit on the edge of that
and to look at it without thinking.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.889
But normally people start comparing, "It looks
like ships, it looks like this, it looks like..."

00:25:14.889 --> 00:25:17.700
No, you have to just look at it without thinking.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.309
There're many such things he did but nothing
worked out with them.

00:25:22.309 --> 00:25:29.090
There were only twenty-six people who got
Realization in the Zen system in the Sixth

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.510
Century.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.869
From the Sixth Century to the Twelfth Century
and after that nobody got Realization.

00:25:35.869 --> 00:25:39.609
But there were very few and that's why they
don't understand Zen at all.

00:25:39.609 --> 00:25:45.070
You see, people write Zen because it's very
deep and they don't understand; so that's

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.070
what it is.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:53.710
Now Sahaja Yoga is understood, can be understood
by normally educated person, by even uneducated

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:54.710
people.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.989
And this happens because actualization takes
place.

00:25:57.989 --> 00:27:27.669
Your Kundalini takes an actual ascent.

00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:33.909
Now in Sahaja Yoga when people come in, there're
different categories of people also.

00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:42.849
Some of them come because they think they
can get good health; once they get good health

00:27:42.849 --> 00:27:43.999
they disappear.

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:48.419
Then they again get some trouble, they come
back, just for good health.

00:27:48.419 --> 00:27:52.539
So you can't help, they have very limited
desires.

00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:58.019
Then some people come in Sahaja Yoga for throwing
their weight around, you see, showing off

00:27:58.019 --> 00:28:04.219
their ego, that, "I'm this," you see, trying
to make another group, another this thing.

00:28:04.219 --> 00:28:10.129
You see, like that also some people come,
it's very common, like a politics, you see.

00:28:10.129 --> 00:28:14.789
And they try to do it against the leader,
against this, "This is wrong with him, that

00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:16.859
is wrong with him," and all kinds of things.

00:28:16.859 --> 00:28:23.159
Thirdly people come but they don't come regularly
to Sahaja Yoga, they do not come regularly

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:24.269
to the center.

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:27.349
They just keep aloof and after some time they're
lost.

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:32.029
They again get some diseases or trouble, then
they come back.

00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:37.279
So it's a religious duty of all of you to
come to the collective, one thing.

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:45.049
The second one is to meditate everyday in
the night before sleeping on your mind.

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:49.909
Everywhere you go you should be in a meditative
condition, in the sense, you should ask your

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:52.809
mind what is it thinking.

00:28:52.809 --> 00:29:00.720
All should come to collective every time they
have a program wherever it is.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.309
In Delhi you have seen people are really wonderful.

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:11.749
There are so many people, at least about,
I think two hundred people, of course we have

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:18.389
a good center there; two hundred people, every
morning they come for meditation, every morning,

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:19.659
look at these people.

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:26.570
So the quality, we call the pindah, so the
quality of a person depends on how much you

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.909
want Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:31.950
You just want to have all the advantages,
you want to do everything.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:37.169
Like this lady, Sushmita Sen, she got the
first prize, she's a Sahaja Yogini.

00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:43.749
She's a Sahaja Yogini and she meditates everyday,
everyday she meditates and everyday she used

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:47.499
to come in the morning to our ashram in Delhi.

00:29:47.499 --> 00:29:52.070
She's a great Sahaja Yogini, I must say, but
now she's in Calcutta and there also she does

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.320
the same.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:30:01.769
So the children also, some who are...; this
girl child is very highly developed child,

00:30:01.769 --> 00:30:02.769
this one is.

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:07.070
I saw her yesterday, she's a born realized,
and she is the one, she must be meditating,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.070
I'm sure.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:13.609
She is a very highly developed person; she's
got it from her last life so she...

00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:19.600
This kind of children, there are many who
are meditating or when they go to school also

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.019
they become like that.

00:30:21.019 --> 00:31:05.220
So you have to first of all worry about correcting
yourself.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:59.039
Now, you see, also another kind of people
come in Sahaja Yoga they came, they made lots

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:05.609
of money, this thing, that thing, see, the
greed is on.

00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:15.950
So if you still suffer from too much greed
or hatred or you can call it pride and aloofness

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:25.299
and all that, then you must know that still
you have to work out.

00:32:25.299 --> 00:32:41.649
Or if you are very angry type or attached,
some people are very attached to their children.

00:32:41.649 --> 00:32:53.429
So in Sahaja Yoga they learn a lesson also
from their children.

00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:58.779
So one has to be introspective to see, "Are
you just, are you satisfied?"

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:06.349
Then you can certify yourself that you're
all right.

00:33:06.349 --> 00:33:26.710
There're so many types of people you'll meet
but what you have to see about your own ascent.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:32.539
So I've talked about God Realization in My
last speech in this thing, so you better listen

00:33:32.539 --> 00:33:47.499
to that lecture of Mine, for this puja, for
the Shiv Puja.

00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:53.700
So one should not even have ambitions, when
you have become a part and parcel of the whole,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.309
when you have become the ocean, what is there
to be ambitious?

00:33:57.309 --> 00:33:58.899
It's all individuality.

00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:17.050
You have 
to be a satisfied soul and I would say about

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:23.210
Myself that I have to buy for My children,
for My husband, this thing, that thing, but

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:42.929
I never buy anything for Myself, very difficult,
very difficult to buy something for Myself.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:47.310
And somebody says that, "Mother please what
will you have?"

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:54.070
I don't know what to say, what should I have.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:35:03.980
I asked My daughter, "You make all kinds of
things for your father, what about Me?"

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:16.000
So she said, "You don't like something in
particular, what to make for you, you tell

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.790
us."

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:25.130
All these attachments some people have, got
attachments to clothes, you see, "What I'll

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.310
wear tomorrow, I'll wear day after tomorrow,"
like that.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:40.730
But so spontaneously whatever 
is available you can wear.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.610
And some worried about their past, you see,
"I'd a bad childhood," this, that, and they

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:51.730
write about their parents; it's all nonsense,
forget it, you be in the present.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:36:08.350
Now you are no more a seed, you have to grow.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:15.910
That is something one has to understand in
life; that if you have to grow ourselves then

00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:24.220
what we have to see within ourself what lies,
whether that is doing wrong.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:35.870
That is something missing.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:44.710
Best is to see the good points of others,
not the bad points.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:52.710
By that you will gradually develop more good
points within yourself.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:37:01.870
Competition should be in good points.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:11.250
So on one side you have to achieve your self-Realization
in a way that you put yourself beyond the

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:18.360
mind, one way, through meditation.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:32.540
And the second way is to give Realizations
to others.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:37.050
And must attend collective meditation, very
important.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:44.970
You have to be active in it.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:50.130
If you are not active in Sahaja Yoga then
you lose your vibrations gradually because

00:37:50.130 --> 00:38:05.400
Divine thinks, "What's the use of giving to
this hopeless case any vibrations."

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.890
So you have to work it out, understanding
that now you are chosen as the instrument

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.320
of the Divine.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:25.090
It is not only for your health or for the
health of your family or for anything like

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:26.090
that.

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.300
But it is for the good of the others.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:41.370
That's how you'll all go very well.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:52.540
Now diffidence comes through your mind only;
mind only gives you diffidence.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.690
So to overpower this mind, you must watch
and tell him to shut up.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:06.590
Must tell him to shut up.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:12.040
Then you will rise.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:18.090
The proof is that you feel the vibrations.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:33.610
Now, if you ask Me I find the people in Hong
Kong are rather right-sided, most of them.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:42.110
So you 
have to do right-sided treatment for yourself.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:47.650
Every night, about ten minutes, at the most,
you have to sit with your right hand towards

00:39:47.650 --> 00:40:00.840
the photograph and right foot in the water,
with a little salt.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:06.470
Normally use cold water, ice also is good
but cold water normally but if it is very

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:10.880
cold outside, you can use warm water.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:30.620
In this hand (left hand) you must take ice
and put it on your liver, right hand towards

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.690
the photograph.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:54.350
Now, then after that you can put the ice over
here, put your hand there.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:59.880
If you do it everyday your stress will go
down, everything will be perfect, just sit

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.120
like this, just now.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:12.590
Heat is going down; no, no, no, put right
hand towards Me and the left hand there.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:34.950
You're left sided, you're not right-sided;
you have to use the candle treatment, all

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.480
right?

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.040
Now some people have both problems.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:49.600
Then you have to put a candle in front of
the photograph, put both the feet in the water

00:41:49.600 --> 00:42:05.060
and sit like this and in 
both the cases don't close your eyes.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:15.200
You should put your attention on My Agnya,
it'll be very good for you, for your ascent

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:27.550
into the realm of thoughtless awareness.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:38.090
As I love you try to love Me, that's the best
thing.

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:45.800
Lastly, you see, in Sahaja Yoga people come
in, they think it's a sort of a contract with

00:42:45.800 --> 00:43:01.910
us that we should look after them, their health,
their jobs, their everything.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:06.340
This is absurd.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:14.220
The contract is between yourself, with yourself.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.829
You have to work it out, all right?

00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:22.070
This is what it is.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:48.210
So if the mind is asking questions ask it
to shut up now.

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:53.830
Mind is the worst thing, it is standing between
you and reality.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:44:00.560
(Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi here.)

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:12.560
Now whatever it is, like yours, you see, you
give a bandhan to your husband; ask everybody

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:56.381
to give a bandhan to him just now, you can
give bandhan to him, her husband, Atul is

00:44:56.381 --> 00:45:00.510
his name.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.810
Just give him a bandhan.

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:10.870
See, it will work out, you can help, all of
you can help.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:17.220
You can help the whole world but you have
to be strong, you have to have the energy

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.600
within yourself.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.790
Ha!

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:30.370
Good, very good.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:39.870
This is Sahaja Yog, it's cool.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:45.610
So try to remember what is your real problem;
you're right-sided, all right so just try

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:55.670
to cut it off.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:46:08.540
I'll be happy if you could learn some English
because I can't learn so many languages.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:19.310
Deities only understood so far only Sanskrit
but now they understand English, thank God!

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:31.240
(laughter) It's a great credit for the English
people.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:46.540
But still English language very limited, very
limited.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:55.980
For example "spirit" word they will use for
the Atma, they will use it for alcohol, also

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.070
they will use it for the dead spirits.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:14.460
Such a language, what can you say, what can
you explain.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:34.750
And the French is the worst, French is the
worst because first of 

00:47:34.750 --> 00:48:20.140
all if 

00:48:20.140 --> 00:50:29.620
you speak French you catch on Vishuddhi.

00:50:29.620 --> 00:58:40.770
And 

00:58:40.770 --> 00:59:03.180
also 
in French there are many words missing, of

00:59:03.180 --> 01:00:57.510
course "spirit" is missing though, no doubt,
but 

01:00:57.510 --> 01:02:15.940
also 

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:36.480
the word "awareness" is 
not there.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:03:29.850
So now I think everybody is happy.

01:03:29.850 --> 01:49:38.090
Let's have 
some music.
