00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:17.392
So this, this centre that is what we call the
Swadishthana centre is the centre that gives you

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.660
your future energy to think of your future,
your planning; which gives you energy to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.212
bring forth the manifestation of the physical
labor, of physical exercise or physical work.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.730
This poor centre has to work for one work:
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.700
Now, if one centre which has to do many
other things starts doing only one work,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.766
all other things are neglected.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.526
As a result of that you develop problems, because
it has to cater to your liver, to your pancreas,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:14.000
to your kidneys, to your spleen, and once
it goes into action for one channelized

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.180
work it gets programmed for it, and then
it cannot take care of these things.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:32.118
That’s how you develop a bad liver, you develop
a diabetes, kidney trouble, blood pressures.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.863
Also you develop a very serious
disease called blood cancer.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.075
Now, Sahaja Yoga can cure all these troubles.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.560
It’s only physical, but it can cure even physical
troubles, because if this centre is brought to its

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.800
normal behaviour, if it is made to behave
in a very normal way, you can easily cure

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.620
all such diseases which come out of your over
activity, over-thinking, over-imaginativeness.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.337
It’s a very dangerous thing to
always think about the future.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.340
For example, now we are here sitting down,
we should be comfortably sitting down and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.200
talking to each other.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.600
Instead of that we are now, we are thinking
‘What am I going to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.680
am I going to do when I go home?’, ‘How I’m
going to cook?’, ‘What am I going to eat?’,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.604
or ‘How I am going to take my train?’,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.040
all these futuristic behaviours lead
you to a very funny personality.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.100
You become so futuristic that you forget the past.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.835
I met a gentleman who forgot even his own name.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.780
He forgot the name of his father, he
forgot the name of his mother and also,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.947
to the dismay of his wife, her name.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.420
And she started crying.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.560
She said, “Now what to do?

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.240
He’s forgotten everything."

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.820
Now he is in a futuristic area.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.275
He just knows the future.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.960
Then he was to be pushed back again into the
centre; then gradually he started remembering.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.543
Then he told Me that he’s chairman of one of
the councils of a big district place in India,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.800
and he said, he was – he said, “No, I am."

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.760
I said, “That’s good.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.480
That’s better.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.320
Now you are in that state where you say “I am."

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.320
So this is what happens, and
this is what’s going to happen

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.420
to our societies here, which is very futuristic.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.880
So to cut it down one can try anything,
you may try anything; for example you may

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.486
show pictures of the past and things like that,
but that is not going to bring back the horse.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.612
it’s running very fast.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.812
The only thing that can work it out
is the awakening of the Kundalini.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.160
When the Kundalini awakens itself, She
makes the centre enlightened and the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:17.060
centre itself resumes its normal shape, its
normal behaviour and its normal condition.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.929
Apart from that it has got a dynamic

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.986
power or manifestation that this one, this
centre which looks after our attention

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.640
becomes enlightened, and our attention
becomes enlightened, and the attention

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.900
which is enlightened becomes dynamic in the sense
now, sitting down here you can pay attention to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.520
anyone – just pay attention, you don’t have to
do anything, just pay attention to that person,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.278
and you can find out on your fingertips
what’s the matter with the person.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.660
Thousands of miles he may be. When Nixon
was having trouble, suddenly I don’t know,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.420
I said, "Find out about Nixon, how is he?"
And they said, "Ma, he is in a terrible mess."

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.340
Christ has said, ‘Your hands will speak’.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.660
That’s the time has come.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.575
These hands which looks so simple;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.863
but they are so intricate, and so intricately
built that the nerve endings are so microscopic

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.100
that we cannot understand how much
they can tell us, how far they can go.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.300
When the awakening takes place you
start feeling the vibrations around you,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.049
the all-pervading Power which you have
never felt before, through these fingertips.

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:47.580
These fingertips which we neglect,
we misuse them, we use them for wrong

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.580
things, these fingertips themselves get
enlightened, and you start feeling them.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.300
That’s what I said, that you have to
get your awareness which is enlightened.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.297
It’s the awareness which has to manifest.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.080
And that’s how you start
feeling them on your fingers:

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.460
It’s wrong here, there’s wrong there,
you can see where is the problem.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.780
Now all these are related to your centres.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.740
These are five, six and seven; seven
on the left and seven on the right.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.960
So, this is about your emotional side.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.898
And this is about your right, about your physical
and your rational, or you could say mental side.
