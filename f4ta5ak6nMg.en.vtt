00:07.978 --> 00:17.392
So this, this centre that is what we call the
Swadishthana centre is the centre that gives you

00:19.260 --> 00:27.660
your future energy to think of your future,
your planning; which gives you energy to

00:27.660 --> 00:35.212
bring forth the manifestation of the physical
labor, of physical exercise or physical work.

00:35.580 --> 00:42.730
This poor centre has to work for one work:
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.700
Now, if one centre which has to do many
other things starts doing only one work,

00:50.700 --> 00:52.766
all other things are neglected.

00:53.160 --> 01:01.526
As a result of that you develop problems, because
it has to cater to your liver, to your pancreas,

01:01.740 --> 01:14.000
to your kidneys, to your spleen, and once
it goes into action for one channelized

01:16.020 --> 01:21.180
work it gets programmed for it, and then
it cannot take care of these things.

01:21.180 --> 01:32.118
That’s how you develop a bad liver, you develop
a diabetes, kidney trouble, blood pressures.

01:32.460 --> 01:37.863
Also you develop a very serious
disease called blood cancer.

01:39.060 --> 01:43.075
Now, Sahaja Yoga can cure all these troubles.

01:44.280 --> 01:52.560
It’s only physical, but it can cure even physical
troubles, because if this centre is brought to its

01:52.560 --> 02:01.800
normal behaviour, if it is made to behave
in a very normal way, you can easily cure

02:01.800 --> 02:10.620
all such diseases which come out of your over
activity, over-thinking, over-imaginativeness.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.337
It’s a very dangerous thing to
always think about the future.

02:14.640 --> 02:20.340
For example, now we are here sitting down,
we should be comfortably sitting down and

02:21.000 --> 02:22.200
talking to each other.

02:22.200 --> 02:27.600
Instead of that we are now, we are thinking
‘What am I going to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What

02:27.600 --> 02:31.680
am I going to do when I go home?’, ‘How I’m
going to cook?’, ‘What am I going to eat?’,

02:32.460 --> 02:35.604
or ‘How I am going to take my train?’,

02:36.900 --> 02:44.040
all these futuristic behaviours lead
you to a very funny personality.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.100
You become so futuristic that you forget the past.

02:47.100 --> 02:51.835
I met a gentleman who forgot even his own name.

02:52.049 --> 02:57.780
He forgot the name of his father, he
forgot the name of his mother and also,

02:57.780 --> 03:00.947
to the dismay of his wife, her name.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.420
And she started crying.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.560
She said, “Now what to do?

03:04.560 --> 03:06.240
He’s forgotten everything."

03:06.240 --> 03:08.820
Now he is in a futuristic area.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.275
He just knows the future.

03:11.520 --> 03:18.960
Then he was to be pushed back again into the
centre; then gradually he started remembering.

03:18.960 --> 03:26.543
Then he told Me that he’s chairman of one of
the councils of a big district place in India,

03:26.880 --> 03:28.800
and he said, he was – he said, “No, I am."

03:28.800 --> 03:29.760
I said, “That’s good.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.480
That’s better.

03:30.480 --> 03:34.320
Now you are in that state where you say “I am."

03:34.320 --> 03:37.320
So this is what happens, and
this is what’s going to happen

03:37.320 --> 03:41.420
to our societies here, which is very futuristic.

03:42.780 --> 03:47.880
So to cut it down one can try anything,
you may try anything; for example you may

03:47.880 --> 03:52.486
show pictures of the past and things like that,
but that is not going to bring back the horse.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.612
it’s running very fast.

03:54.840 --> 03:59.812
The only thing that can work it out
is the awakening of the Kundalini.

04:00.060 --> 04:08.160
When the Kundalini awakens itself, She
makes the centre enlightened and the

04:08.160 --> 04:17.060
centre itself resumes its normal shape, its
normal behaviour and its normal condition.

04:17.220 --> 04:20.929
Apart from that it has got a dynamic

04:24.780 --> 04:31.986
power or manifestation that this one, this
centre which looks after our attention

04:33.120 --> 04:38.640
becomes enlightened, and our attention
becomes enlightened, and the attention

04:38.640 --> 04:45.900
which is enlightened becomes dynamic in the sense
now, sitting down here you can pay attention to

04:45.900 --> 04:50.520
anyone – just pay attention, you don’t have to
do anything, just pay attention to that person,

04:50.520 --> 04:55.278
and you can find out on your fingertips
what’s the matter with the person.

04:55.500 --> 05:00.660
Thousands of miles he may be. When Nixon
was having trouble, suddenly I don’t know,

05:00.660 --> 05:05.420
I said, "Find out about Nixon, how is he?"
And they said, "Ma, he is in a terrible mess."

05:05.420 --> 05:08.340
Christ has said, ‘Your hands will speak’.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.660
That’s the time has come.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.575
These hands which looks so simple;

05:13.920 --> 05:21.863
but they are so intricate, and so intricately
built that the nerve endings are so microscopic

05:22.560 --> 05:29.100
that we cannot understand how much
they can tell us, how far they can go.

05:30.240 --> 05:36.300
When the awakening takes place you
start feeling the vibrations around you,

05:36.300 --> 05:42.049
the all-pervading Power which you have
never felt before, through these fingertips.

05:42.049 --> 05:47.580
These fingertips which we neglect,
we misuse them, we use them for wrong

05:47.580 --> 05:53.580
things, these fingertips themselves get
enlightened, and you start feeling them.

05:53.580 --> 06:00.300
That’s what I said, that you have to
get your awareness which is enlightened.

06:00.300 --> 06:03.297
It’s the awareness which has to manifest.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.080
And that’s how you start
feeling them on your fingers:

06:07.080 --> 06:11.460
It’s wrong here, there’s wrong there,
you can see where is the problem.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.780
Now all these are related to your centres.

06:15.780 --> 06:19.740
These are five, six and seven; seven
on the left and seven on the right.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.960
So, this is about your emotional side.

06:21.960 --> 06:29.898
And this is about your right, about your physical
and your rational, or you could say mental side.
