1
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:09,698
So,

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,180
this last centre, the Sahasrara,

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,224
is contained in the limbic area of the brain.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,754
Our head is like a coconut.

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:55,000
The coconut has the hair, and then a hard nut
and then a black covering and inside is white

6
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:06,088
shell of coconut and inside
is the space, the water.

7
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,111
In the same way, our brain is made.

8
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:27,845
That’s why coconut is called as shriphala,
is the fruit of the power that is Shri.

9
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,376
Shri Power is the right-side power

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,300
and the left-side power is the Lalita Power.

11
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:52,020
So, we have two chakras – left side, here, is the
Lalita and right side, here, is the Shri Chakra.

12
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,737
These two chakras are working out

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:10,860
the right side Mahasaraswati’s power
and left side Mahakali’s powers.

14
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,057
Now, the central power is the Kundalini.

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:27,468
That has to rise and penetrate through
different chakras, enter into the limbic area

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:36,314
and enlighten the seven "pithas"
– seats of these seven chakras.

17
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,421
So, it penetrates through
six chakras, enters into the

18
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,171
limbic area, enlightens all
the seven pithas in the brain,

19
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,301
which are placed along the
mid-line of the limbic area.

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:10,347
So, we start it from the back, is placed
here, at the back, is the Mooladhara Chakra.

21
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:19,200
Around it is the Swadishthana, then is the Nabhi,

22
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,176
then the Heart, then the
Vishuddhi and then the Agnya.

23
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:36,253
So, all these six centres are
combining to make the seventh centre.

24
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,943
This is a very important
point, which we should know.

25
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,704
Now, the Shri Chakra is the right side working
and the Lalita Chakra is the left side working.

26
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,920
So, when the Kundalini doesn’t
rise then we do with our right side

27
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,772
our physical and mental activities.

28
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:14,701
So, our brain is doing right side activity
and that’s why our brain is like shriphala.

29
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:28,309
Sahasrara is actually is the
assemblage of these six chakras

30
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,144
and is a hollow space, on the sides
of it there are one thousand nadis.

31
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:50,100
And when the light penetrates into the
limbic area, then the enlightenment of

32
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:00,435
these nadis take place and you can see
them as flames, very gentle flames burning

33
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,635
and these flames have all the seven colors
that you see in the VIBGYOR [stands for

34
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:11,760
“Violet–Indigo–Blue–Green–Yellow–Orange–Red”,
for memorizing the optical spectrum].

35
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:20,340
But the last one, ultimately becomes again
integrated and it is a crystal-clear flame.

36
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,194
All these seven lights
ultimately become crystal clear.

37
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,680
So, you have Sahasrara with one
thousand petals, as they called it,

38
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:46,680
but if you cut the brain in a transverse section
or horizontal section, you will be able to see

39
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:56,769
that all these nerves are built like this along
the limbic area, all of them are like a petal.

40
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,500
And if you cut it like this
[horizontally], you will find

41
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,420
that there are many nerves
in every bundle of nerves.

42
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,960
So, when it is enlightened,
you can see Sahasrara as a

43
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
burning bundle of flames.

44
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:36,127
So, when the enlightenment of the
Kundalini takes place in the brain,

45
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,962
then the truth is perceived through your brain.

46
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,514
That’s why it’s called as “satya kanda”
[truth; bulb], means you start seeing the truth

47
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:04,038
perceived by your brain because so far whatever
you see through your brain, is not the truth.

48
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,010
What you see, is just the outer
side, say, you can see the colours.

49
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,607
You can see the different
aesthetics of the colours.

50
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,801
You can see the quality of the thing.

51
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:29,409
But you cannot say whether this
carpet has been used by some saint.

52
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,019
You cannot say whether this is
made by a devil or a divine person.

53
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:47,870
You cannot say that this gentleman, is
he a good person or he is an evil person.

54
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:56,814
You cannot say if this Deity has
come out of the Mother Earth or not.

55
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:13,380
Also, you cannot say about any person,
who is your relation, whether he is a

56
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,280
good relation or a bad relation, or what sort
of a person he is, whether he goes to wrong

57
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,707
people or to the right people, whether he has
connections with wrong side or with good side.

58
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,061
Here good means Divine.

59
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,985
So actually, you do not know anything
about divinity with your mind, nothing.

60
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,820
Nothing – is impossible for you to judge
a person about his divinity unless and

61
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,223
until the Kundalini reaches at least
this part, which is the limbic area.

62
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:02,323
You cannot make out whether a person is
real or not, whether a guru is real or not.

63
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,799
Because divinity cannot be
perceived through your brain,

64
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:16,283
unless and until this light
of your Spirit shines into it.

65
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,820
Now, the Spirit is expressed in the
heart, is reflected in the heart,

66
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,704
the centre of the Spirit,
we can say, is in the heart.

67
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:33,066
But actually, the seat of Spirit is above, here.

68
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,720
And that is the Spirit what we call of
the God Almighty, Who say, Whom you call

69
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:47,640
Parvardigar [Persian word],

70
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:57,877
you call Him Sadashiva or
you can call Him, the Rahim

71
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:10,440
and you can call Him by many names which
are said about the Lord who is God Almighty.

72
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:21,120
Niranjan, they call It, Nirankar, every
sort of words which start with Nira, Nihi.

73
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:32,793
Now, at every centre in the body
you’ll receive a different type of joy.

74
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,260
Every centre has a different type
of joy and there are names for every

75
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,704
types of joy you receive at every
centre when the Kundalini rises.

76
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:54,850
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara,
then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda,

77
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,020
Nirananda.

78
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,260
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda.

79
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,100
Nirananda.

80
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,440
Also, is surprising, my name is Nira –
also, in my family I’m called as Nira.

81
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:17,403
And Nira also means Mary, Maria.

82
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,952
Because it means marine.

83
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:21,030
Nira is water.

84
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,940
Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

85
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,000
It is called as Nirananda in the brain.

86
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,385
And this stage ultimately unfolds.
