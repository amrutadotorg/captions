00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.420
Mataji: So, [everyone UNCLEAR?] a nice weekend?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.620
Yogis: Thank you Mother.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.680
Mataji: [UNCLEAR]

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.680
I wish you could send your thanks to [UNCLEAR]

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.580
Mataji: Hello [UNCLEAR], how are you?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.740
Hello [UNCLEAR], how are you?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.660
Mataji: Now, are you all right? Now, are you all right?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.160
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] everyone understands?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.260
Mataji: I am sorry, I have to go [by this one UNCLEAR]

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.420
You have to go by which one?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.880
Mataji: He has to drive his own car.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.520
Maatji: All right, bye bye.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.320
Mataji: God bless you all.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.740
Angry people very much. they are being very kind to us.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040
Yogi:Here comes mother

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.220
Mataji: Let's go there where the water is flowing.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.960
Mataji: This is the source of Thames river.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.340
Be careful.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.820
[UNCLEAR] start going [UNCLEAR]

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.480
That's written on the

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.400
Mataji: That's [UNCLEAR] inside there, you see?

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.479
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] father Thames, [UNCLEAR] seven [UNCLEAR]

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.880
Yogi: Then they call father

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.260
Mataji: What's the meaning of [UNCLEAR]?

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.560
Yogi: It's used to be [UNCLEAR]

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.560
Yogi: It's used to be [UNCLEAR]

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.120
But still the Isis or anyone [UNCLEAR] Oxford, they still call it the [UNCLEAR].

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.540
Yogi: The Oxford or the [UNCLEAR] call it Isis, that is [UNCLEAR] the baby's name [UNCLEAR].

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.700
Mataji: It has started.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.500
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] water you never get it [UNCLEAR]

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.320
Mataji: There is nothing.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.100
They will never get into [UNCLEAR]

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.300
Surprisingly.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.240
Yogi: We take, we should take off all of our shoes.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.680
Mataji: Keep your feet there.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.100
Mataji: It is rising. It has to rise.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.060
Maatji: All these things will go away [UNCLEAR]

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.360
Yogi: Bolo Shri Ganga Mata Shri Nirmala Devi ki Jay!

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.100
Mataji: See the cool breeze coming, are you feeling the cool breeze now?

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.100
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] She is happy, no body has respected her [UNCLEAR]

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.280
Yogi: Now, we will respect.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.260
Mataji: Cool Breeze is coming.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.020
Yogi: Robert, how many people are there here?

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.780
Mataji: All of you have a meaning, after all.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.060
[UNCLEAR]

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.580
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] power

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.680
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] in sahaja yoga

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.480
Mataji: It has started, quite a bit.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.980
Mataji: Of course, of course.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.700
Mataji: [Take away your UNCLEAR] badhas and everything.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.800
Mataji: Wash your hands at least.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.040
Mataji: 35 crore devatas are there.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.700
Yogi: What does that mean?

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:33.540
Yogi: 35 times 10 million devatas in the universe.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.980
Mataji: 35 crore, I crore is equals to 10 million.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.140
That's an impossibility

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:09.420
Mataji: 33. Yogi: But some say 35. It is in the Devi Bhagawat. It is 35.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.820
Mataji: Peace has settled down.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.360
Yogi:

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.729
It is a holy place.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.349
Small girl.

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:40.129
Take her down. Take her down carefully because she might touch she should not touch.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.520
Little baby.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.240
Thames river comes from this river.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.900
Mataji: This is where the Thames river originates. There are 7 places where water is coming from. Go and see.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.460
Baby: No, I have already seen it.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.560
Mataji: Go and put your feet in it and come, its very cold.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.420
Mataji: Can somebody carry her in the lap?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:17.780
Mataji: It is a very holy place. Just somebody should take her down.

00:27:19.899 --> 00:27:21.899
I think Alan can do it.

00:27:25.779 --> 00:27:27.779
Alan just take her down, let her, put in the water.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.480
Yogi: She was there. Mataji: She was there?

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.640
Yogi: We counted 36, Mataji: She has to go, you didn't count her.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:06.039
Very cool, very soothing all left is waking up

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.180
Water

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.240
I think they went to tourist attractions.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.040
Mataji: I see there are the tourist [UNCLEAR] but this is the deity [UNCLEAR]

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.260
Mataji: They should come, you see they should understand the meaning.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.660
Mataji: Now, I have become an actress or what?

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.200
Yogi: You are the movie stars of movie stars Mother.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.500
Yogi: You move the Stars Mother.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.500
Mataji: Just look after her, she should not put on the [UNCLEAR].

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.560
Yogi: They are watching her Mother.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.329
There was that thing on the wall, someone said

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.380
Yes, letters, inscriptions.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.389
What.? [UNCLEAR] inscriptions.

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:07.620
[UNCLEAR]

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:17.810
Oh father Thames this your

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.550
7

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.520
Nik? yeah.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.899
Take the stone of mother you took it with you did you?

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.680
Yogi: I just wanted to find if you can see the seven sources

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.899
Yogi: Did Mother stand on this one here?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.320
Yogi: This one here.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.180
Just get one

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.280
Mataji: [UNCLEAR]Just can't see the water flowing or anything? Yogi: No Mother.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.740
[UNCLEAR] in the building [UNCLEAR]

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.160
Mataji: What sort of an arrangement they have?

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.460
Mataji: We can't see anything there?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.320
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] the building there [UNCLEAR]

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.840
Mataji: It's a tap there?

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:16.700
Yogi: But they actually have to electrically pump it up the ground.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.900
Mataji: It's nice here, you see.

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.500
Mataji: Very meditative, the vibrations are coming.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:05.160
Mataji: It's [sulphur?] that is [clouding?] the water, it will never [UNCLEAR]

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.340
Mataji: The vibrations are [UNCLEAR]

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:47.540
Yogi: Mother, this was the hall we wanted to have a meeting one time. Mataji: We are going to have? Yogi: We were going to have this one time. Mataji: When?

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.160
Yogi: The meeting you had last night. This is the one we wanted.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.080
Mataji: Next time.[UNCLEAR]

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.220
Mataji:  [UNCLEAR] that's what they do.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.020
Yogi: It does the same effect on the brain cells.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:45.760
Mataji; Just [UNCLEAR]

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:55.180
Mataji: The worst thing that I have [UNCLEAR] is that

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.600
Mataji: those who are [UNCLEAR] feel they are wise but then they come to Sahaja yoga and think they are [UNCLEAR]

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.340
Maaji: This is the thing I [UNCLEAR], isn't it?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.260
Mataji: How can you [UNCLEAR] that you [work for sahaja yoga UNCLEAR?]

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.020
I just don't understand that [those who are settled? UNCLEAR]

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.780
Not you Robert, so many others.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.680
Not you, you are not like that.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.180
But must be some reason.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.180
 

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.320
I asked a sahaja yogi [UNCLEAR]

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:48.880
I said, "What how were you so much  [subjugated? UNCLEAR], you should have asked questions. He said no, they say that this is to kill your ego.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.160
Yogi: So you have to go out of the mind?

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.640
Mataji: I mean they are very frank and honest.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.900
Mataji:  [Even if ?UNCLEAR] you are out of your mind.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.680
They do not understand the world.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.780
[UNCLEAR] means hell.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:37.160
Yogi:  The entrance of the center where I went, you know, [UNCLEAR] They put, "Please take off your shoes and your mind." Leave your shoes and mind outside the door.

00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.040
See that means, they want to say that we don't send the mind.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.780
But that is what they would like to say,  [UNCLEAR]

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.740
They are trying to  [UNCLEAR] us

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.680
[UNCLEAR] that you transcend the mind beyond mind.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:00.980
They say that you keep your mind outside.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.280
Mataji: People are very attached to shoes so

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.980
it will make them nervous when they take out their shoes.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.560
Keep them outside.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.760
There is a saying in Marathi.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:36.200
means, you get into the temple and all your attention is on your shoes which is outside.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.680
In India it is very common if you lose them.

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:49.000
When they go to a temple, they buy something, which is absolutely useless, which they want to get rid of.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.420
Because in the temple,  [UNCLEAR] it is stolen.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.800
Or they replace their  [UNCLEAR]

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.440
These are the ones we are getting  [UNCLEAR]?

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.900
Mataji: It should have been a very good  [UNCLEAR]

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.320
How far is Bristol from here?

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:11.260
Yogi: Mother they wondered why we were all sitting here

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:12.980
Mataji: So what did you say?

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.920
Yogi: I said we were just waiting to see the water

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.430
Just waiting to see the water.

00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:19.040
Mataji: What did they say?

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.040
Yogi: They said, "That's all right."

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.980
They didn't say that if it's going to be ready they're trying

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:38.120
Yogi: We could hear the pump going that's all. Could you can you just check because the pump is actually there's thumping away?

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.640
Mataji: Make a bandhan maybe.

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:56.340
What's that?

00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.620
Yogi: That's where the water is actually [coming from?]

00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.860
Mataji: On top?

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:15.140
They used to be, in 1830 they used to come  [UNCLEAR]  with handles they used to pump it  [UNCLEAR]

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.400
Yogi: But now it's  [UNCLEAR] electrical.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:24.020
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] didn't come up? There's nothing to see honestly?

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:44.300
That  [UNCLEAR] was just taken from the tap, not from the top. There's a little tap there you just took it from the tap so

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.000
Mataji: It must be also  [UNCLEAR]

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.520
[UNCLEAR] sulphur?

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:56.080
I see,  [UNCLEAR] salt.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.280
That thing you get is  [UNCLEAR] salt?

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.240
It's like that.

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.080
Mataji: In 10 minutes, we leave.

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.380
Mataji: Go record the water.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.620
Yogi: Mother was telling

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:42.340
[UNCLEAR] is good for  [UNCLEAR], anybody who has

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.480
got a  [UNCLEAR] , left nabhi, problem.

00:59:52.780 --> 01:00:00.920
Mataji: Yello colour, is  [UNCLEAR] good for liver that is [sleepy?]

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.340
Like carrot could be very good also.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:09.520
And all that white colour is vitamin A.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.520
 

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:21.440
Because calcium , calcium is white in colour. Sulphur is yellowish.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:30.640
[UNCLEAR] but calcium is also   [UNCLEAR]

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:34.340
[UNCLEAR] people who are having a cold.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:40.420
specially for children, you have got allergies and if you give them calcium,

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.040
[calcium is not good?]

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:56.740
You see we have got a liver which is over active and the one which is absolutely active.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.480
The one which is overactive is [UNCLEAR] too much  [UNCLEAR] too much

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.140
And those who have inactive one are the one who are  [UNCLEAR]

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:09.860
[UNCLEAR] or sort of  [UNCLEAR] develop allergies, more on the left hand side.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.960
So those who have allergies, should take to sulphur,  [this is good for them ?UNCLEAR]

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:21.220
And for the right-sided people better to take cooler things. [UNCLEAR]

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.700
Like you can say, sugar, sugar is very cooling, sugar is a coolant.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:40.660
Yogi: Mother, people who are anxious and have too much nerves problem, they take these yellow plant, marigold type.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.240
And make tea out of it, fresh from the plant.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:46.820
I tried that in  [UNCLEAR], two or three times.

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.080
And also it has an effect in the liver.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:04.220
Mataji: Nervous people are mostly the people who are left sided.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.200
Mataji: That could be very good.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.360
Yogi: Also also jasmine tea helps.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.160
Mataji: Jasmine tea is very good.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.660
Yogi: It's yellowish too.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.680
Mataji: Ganges river, you see, go anywhere, wherever river Ganges goes

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.940
you will never find these dirty things.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.300
Yogi:  [UNCLEAR] river Ganga comes from the snow.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.700
and it goes past many flowers and herbs in the meantime.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.480
Yogi: And it also picks up all sort of elements and it mixes in the Ganges.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.800
Mataji: Its  [UNCLEAR] in the Sahashrara of Shiva.

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:42.100
Yogi: Yes Mother, we are going to have a havana there,  and the people to come [UNCLEAR] the jewish ego.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.960
We have some plans Mother.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:52.280
Like saying Jewish hyms,  singing and also the Lord's prayer to confuse them and Mataji's mantra.
