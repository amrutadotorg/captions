00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:10.533
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:14.653
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:19.693
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:00:35.013 --> 00:00:39.853
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:42.933
and new has started.

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:56.213
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:02.853
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:13.253
And gradually –

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:28.933
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:37.533
and gradually moving towards the completion,

00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:46.533
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:05.453
It is a very natural process of growth

00:02:05.613 --> 00:02:08.653
that you have gone through.

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:19.173
The first one was, we can say,

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:24.093
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:34.813
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:44.333
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:49.373
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:03:00.093
And you have the chakras same way built in,

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:03.253
in your Sahasrara.

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:16.613
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:20.813
the deities in your centers,

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:28.533
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:42.813
But now the time has come for us to spread it

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:47.013
on a horizontal level.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.333
And to move it on the horizontal level,

00:03:56.493 --> 00:04:00.573
we have to understand how to go about it.

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:18.413
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

00:04:18.613 --> 00:04:24.133
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

00:04:24.293 --> 00:04:27.213
of the chakras.

00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:40.253
And when we start it from the back,

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:44.733
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

00:04:44.893 --> 00:04:54.333
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:57.573
if you see it clearly.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:24.013
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:28.613
because it's a concave replacement,

00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:35.453
is important to understand that the center

00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:45.533
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

00:06:00.573 --> 00:06:08.973
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:29.133
I hope you understand what I mean.

00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:38.533
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:44.573
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

00:06:54.853 --> 00:07:02.573
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:07.093
the Atma, coincide.

00:07:13.893 --> 00:07:21.253
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

00:07:21.413 --> 00:07:23.813
that is the Atma.

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:40.613
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

00:07:46.813 --> 00:07:55.693
At this point of time it is very important to understand

00:07:55.853 --> 00:08:01.493
that we have to take a bigger step.

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:19.373
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:24.453
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

00:08:24.613 --> 00:08:35.733
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

00:08:53.253 --> 00:08:59.293
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

00:08:59.453 --> 00:09:04.853
of all the incarnations is compassion,

00:09:05.013 --> 00:09:10.933
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

00:09:24.493 --> 00:09:28.933
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

00:09:29.093 --> 00:09:33.973
we have to have compassion.

00:09:44.373 --> 00:09:50.093
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:58.013
If God Almighty had no compassion,

00:09:58.173 --> 00:10:07.133
He would not have created this great universe.

00:10:13.933 --> 00:10:17.973
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:23.133
is the embodiment of His compassion.

00:10:30.173 --> 00:10:36.773
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:43.773
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

00:10:54.133 --> 00:11:00.013
And compassion is always completely covered

00:11:00.173 --> 00:11:03.173
with forgiveness.

00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:18.053
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:27.173
The Son of God is forgiveness,

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.533
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:41.453
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

00:11:42.293 --> 00:11:44.933
the Mother who is the compassion

00:11:45.093 --> 00:11:47.173
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:54.133
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:20.413
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:34.213
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

00:12:40.853 --> 00:12:48.933
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

00:12:49.093 --> 00:12:51.253
as you think it to be,

00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:57.253
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

00:13:06.613 --> 00:13:11.773
To develop this, you have to pay attention

00:13:11.933 --> 00:13:18.173
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

00:13:31.573 --> 00:13:36.373
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:43.693
then there you must establish the deity.

00:13:55.133 --> 00:14:01.933
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:09.573
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:12.573
in person with you.

00:14:25.533 --> 00:14:30.933
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

00:14:31.093 --> 00:14:34.973
had to imagine the deities,

00:14:42.893 --> 00:14:49.013
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:59.693
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

00:15:04.413 --> 00:15:07.693
that is how it is described –

00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:13.133
so if you also see the person,

00:15:13.293 --> 00:15:16.253
you may not be knowing fully that person

00:15:16.413 --> 00:15:20.613
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:31.133
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

00:15:31.293 --> 00:15:34.013
than your imagination.

00:15:40.653 --> 00:15:43.813
That is why one has to surrender.

00:15:45.853 --> 00:15:51.613
With your limited imagination of brain,

00:15:51.773 --> 00:15:57.253
one cannot see the deity.

00:16:03.813 --> 00:16:06.613
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:11.693
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:19.093
So the devotion has to be there,

00:16:19.253 --> 00:16:24.453
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:27.293
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:30.613
Heart should be clean.

00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:42.933
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:54.733
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

00:16:54.893 --> 00:16:57.733
of reality,

00:17:00.933 --> 00:17:04.773
but reality is absolute.

00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:11.613
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

00:17:11.773 --> 00:17:18.733
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

00:17:23.813 --> 00:17:31.733
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

00:17:32.413 --> 00:17:36.573
not with very clean heart.

00:17:44.173 --> 00:17:47.933
At that time we had lots of attachments,

00:17:49.933 --> 00:17:55.013
we were identified with false things.

00:17:57.613 --> 00:18:03.413
And also we thought by getting realization

00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:07.773
we’ll become very powerful people.

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.933
After realization also,

00:18:20.093 --> 00:18:24.933
we started indulging into petty things.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:37.173
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.493
mothers, sisters;

00:18:44.613 --> 00:18:48.333
and the women thought of their husbands

00:18:48.493 --> 00:18:53.533
and their brothers, children.

00:18:56.613 --> 00:19:01.533
They all asked for the blessings of all those

00:19:01.693 --> 00:19:05.613
with whom they were entangled.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:21.693
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

00:19:32.013 --> 00:19:35.773
Now the job of a Avatara is such

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:41.893
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:53.293
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:59.533
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

00:20:13.013 --> 00:20:17.613
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

00:20:17.773 --> 00:20:19.493
“we want You to be with us,

00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:23.493
individually with every one of us.”

00:20:32.613 --> 00:20:36.173
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:41.293
and He was with every one of them.

00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:52.013
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

00:20:52.173 --> 00:20:57.173
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:01.453
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

00:21:01.613 --> 00:21:05.253
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

00:21:05.413 --> 00:21:08.493
whatever was possible.

00:21:14.093 --> 00:21:17.533
Also the kshema that you asked for,

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.933
ashrams you asked for,

00:21:20.093 --> 00:21:24.213
all the things that you needed,

00:21:25.773 --> 00:21:31.933
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

00:21:42.173 --> 00:21:44.373
So at the Krishna's level it was

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:46.613
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:51.453
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:04.173
because it was promised.

00:22:05.373 --> 00:22:10.373
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:19.573
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:28.773
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

00:22:43.373 --> 00:22:48.253
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

00:22:50.733 --> 00:22:55.693
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

00:22:59.893 --> 00:23:04.853
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

00:23:05.013 --> 00:23:10.013
may dim out, or may be defective.

00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:20.773
So, all the chakras that are within us

00:23:20.933 --> 00:23:23.933
are to be looked after.

00:23:29.773 --> 00:23:37.093
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:43.333
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

00:23:58.493 --> 00:24:02.573
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

00:24:06.453 --> 00:24:11.053
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

00:24:11.213 --> 00:24:16.053
establish Him through your thought –

00:24:16.213 --> 00:24:19.733
because now your thought is divine –

00:24:19.893 --> 00:24:24.733
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

00:24:46.013 --> 00:24:52.093
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

00:24:52.253 --> 00:24:55.613
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

00:24:55.773 --> 00:24:57.133
of these things to you, of …

00:24:57.293 --> 00:25:03.813
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:15.173
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:19.173
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:23.333
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

00:25:28.613 --> 00:25:31.293
And that's the country.

00:25:33.653 --> 00:25:38.333
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:43.453
put your feelings towards Him,

00:25:51.173 --> 00:26:00.093
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

00:26:04.333 --> 00:26:07.533
And then to manifest compassion,

00:26:07.693 --> 00:26:11.573
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:18.373
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:23.493
to all the people of the world."

00:26:32.693 --> 00:26:36.893
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:41.573
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:45.653
you have no right to ask.

00:26:54.573 --> 00:26:59.493
So to understand innocence

00:26:59.653 --> 00:27:02.133
you should try to understand yourself,

00:27:02.293 --> 00:27:06.213
how your mind is working.

00:27:12.053 --> 00:27:18.893
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:22.053
should possess that person?

00:27:22.213 --> 00:27:27.573
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

00:27:27.733 --> 00:27:31.653
comes into your mind?

00:27:45.613 --> 00:27:48.013
For an innocent person,

00:27:48.173 --> 00:27:51.773
a beautiful person, or a woman,

00:27:51.933 --> 00:27:56.133
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

00:27:56.293 --> 00:27:59.133
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

00:27:59.293 --> 00:28:02.173
there’s no thought.

00:28:15.893 --> 00:28:19.773
So if there is no thought, there's no question

00:28:19.933 --> 00:28:23.053
of having any expression of possessiveness

00:28:23.213 --> 00:28:27.133
or any kind of a baser feeling.

00:28:39.693 --> 00:28:46.173
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:49.893
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

00:28:50.053 --> 00:28:55.133
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

00:28:55.293 --> 00:29:05.093
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

00:29:18.573 --> 00:29:25.893
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

00:29:26.053 --> 00:29:29.933
they feel I am innocent."

00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.773
This is compassion,

00:29:42.253 --> 00:29:46.253
the compassion to ask Him to give you

00:29:46.413 --> 00:29:51.333
the power of compassion itself.

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:08.933
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:16.053
the light starts moving horizontally;

00:30:27.573 --> 00:30:34.573
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

00:30:36.333 --> 00:30:42.253
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

00:30:46.293 --> 00:30:49.373
You don't become stupid or childish,

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:52.613
but you become child-like.

00:30:59.693 --> 00:31:07.733
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

00:31:11.493 --> 00:31:15.293
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

00:31:15.453 --> 00:31:20.413
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

00:31:24.213 --> 00:31:27.373
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:30.373
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

00:31:30.533 --> 00:31:33.213
to impress others.

00:31:39.573 --> 00:31:44.053
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

00:31:44.213 --> 00:31:51.133
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

00:31:51.293 --> 00:31:54.453
of deliberations.

00:32:03.053 --> 00:32:10.933
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:23.853
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

00:32:24.013 --> 00:32:29.733
expressing itself on horizontal level,

00:32:29.893 --> 00:32:34.013
that you become discreet.

00:32:42.693 --> 00:32:45.173
But that is a power, I'm again say,

00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:49.333
the power of discretion you develop.

00:32:53.893 --> 00:32:57.213
Now one must understand the difference between

00:32:57.373 --> 00:33:02.213
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

00:33:05.293 --> 00:33:09.293
So “the power” means it acts.

00:33:13.773 --> 00:33:16.773
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

00:33:17.693 --> 00:33:19.733
but if you are standing somewhere

00:33:19.893 --> 00:33:24.853
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

00:33:34.013 --> 00:33:37.613
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

00:33:37.773 --> 00:33:41.253
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

00:33:41.413 --> 00:33:46.413
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

00:33:57.613 --> 00:34:06.053
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

00:34:06.213 --> 00:34:08.893
that acts by itself.

00:34:09.053 --> 00:34:11.773
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

00:34:11.933 --> 00:34:14.173
but you just become the vehicle,

00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:19.133
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

00:34:32.973 --> 00:34:35.493
Then you should believe,

00:34:35.653 --> 00:34:39.613
now you are spreading horizontally.

00:34:48.933 --> 00:34:53.013
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:53.173 --> 00:34:57.853
you needed to see Me in person.

00:34:58.853 --> 00:35:02.533
You needed to see Me in person.

00:35:07.093 --> 00:35:12.253
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

00:35:12.413 --> 00:35:16.533
You wanted the target in front of you.

00:35:24.613 --> 00:35:29.773
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

00:35:30.213 --> 00:35:33.813
whatever is to be achieved.

00:35:36.573 --> 00:35:39.373
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

00:35:39.533 --> 00:35:43.413
So now when you wanted that all the time,

00:35:43.573 --> 00:35:49.133
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

00:35:49.293 --> 00:35:54.133
when you had that in person before you.

00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:08.493
Then in the second era, now,

00:36:08.653 --> 00:36:14.053
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:17.613
you'll take it over from Me.

00:36:31.973 --> 00:36:36.813
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

00:36:39.973 --> 00:36:46.013
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

00:36:52.693 --> 00:36:54.773
I am with you, you know that;

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:56.733
but need not be in this body,

00:36:56.893 --> 00:37:01.773
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

00:37:08.013 --> 00:37:11.293
But once this desire starts working,

00:37:11.453 --> 00:37:16.173
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

00:37:24.613 --> 00:37:27.373
When the child is born to a mother,

00:37:27.533 --> 00:37:31.933
automatically she gets milk.

00:37:38.853 --> 00:37:43.933
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

00:37:44.093 --> 00:37:49.213
In your divine desire also it is connected.

00:37:58.173 --> 00:38:03.253
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

00:38:05.893 --> 00:38:07.813
So you may find Me anywhere:

00:38:07.973 --> 00:38:09.893
you are walking on the street,

00:38:10.053 --> 00:38:14.133
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

00:38:26.293 --> 00:38:30.733
So this is the second era we have started,

00:38:30.893 --> 00:38:33.173
and you should not be shocked

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:37.013
if you see Me sitting on your bed

00:38:37.173 --> 00:38:41.933
and putting My hand on your head.

00:38:58.773 --> 00:39:02.013
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:05.213
walking into your room,

00:39:09.573 --> 00:39:12.973
or as Shri Rama.

00:39:14.093 --> 00:39:16.933
That has to happen,

00:39:17.093 --> 00:39:20.133
so you should be prepared.

00:39:27.373 --> 00:39:30.693
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

00:39:30.853 --> 00:39:33.933
but on a grosser level.

00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:41.813
We have seen the light coming on My head,

00:39:41.973 --> 00:39:46.733
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:55.773
But many things will happen,

00:39:55.933 --> 00:40:00.893
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

00:40:08.653 --> 00:40:12.453
This has to happen, just to convince you

00:40:12.613 --> 00:40:18.053
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

00:40:18.213 --> 00:40:24.293
in the new area of Pragyalok.

00:40:32.933 --> 00:40:35.893
Because this is a new state into which

00:40:36.053 --> 00:40:41.013
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

00:40:47.773 --> 00:40:55.933
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:12.733
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

00:41:16.573 --> 00:41:19.493
The asking will disappear,

00:41:20.933 --> 00:41:25.813
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

00:41:30.693 --> 00:41:34.813
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

00:41:38.253 --> 00:41:48.173
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

00:41:56.053 --> 00:42:06.093
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

00:42:11.373 --> 00:42:16.253
Now the new work of compassion,

00:42:16.413 --> 00:42:22.573
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

00:42:35.293 --> 00:42:38.733
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

00:42:38.893 --> 00:42:45.813
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

00:42:54.013 --> 00:42:58.773
So you become the giver of compassion.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:06.253
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

00:43:06.413 --> 00:43:11.573
I have requested you how to do tapah.

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:16.773
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

00:43:28.253 --> 00:43:35.453
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:41.293
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

00:43:57.693 --> 00:44:00.973
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

00:44:01.133 --> 00:44:03.573
that you have to do, because I am told

00:44:03.733 --> 00:44:09.573
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

00:44:09.733 --> 00:44:12.173
and you people suffered a little bit

00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:16.333
on your way for the pilgrimage.

00:44:24.693 --> 00:44:35.333
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

00:44:35.493 --> 00:44:38.893
where the devils dare not go.

00:44:42.293 --> 00:44:44.453
Fun: no word!

00:44:44.613 --> 00:44:50.693
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

00:45:04.773 --> 00:45:10.453
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

00:45:10.613 --> 00:45:13.813
discomforts, then you should know

00:45:13.973 --> 00:45:16.093
you are on the right lights.

00:45:28.773 --> 00:45:33.853
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

00:45:34.013 --> 00:45:37.853
you should know you are progressing well.

00:45:44.213 --> 00:45:47.213
As you become more peaceful and your temper

00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:51.333
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

00:45:51.493 --> 00:45:57.493
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

00:46:16.093 --> 00:46:24.733
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

00:46:24.893 --> 00:46:29.653
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

00:46:29.813 --> 00:46:33.253
then know that you are progressing.

00:46:42.453 --> 00:46:44.293
No amount ….

00:46:47.293 --> 00:46:53.693
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

00:46:53.853 --> 00:46:57.693
then know that you are progressing.

00:47:05.773 --> 00:47:14.613
No amount of material well-being in others

00:47:14.773 --> 00:47:19.653
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

00:47:19.813 --> 00:47:23.773
then know that you are progressing well.

00:47:33.613 --> 00:47:38.413
No amount of

00:47:44.093 --> 00:47:47.253
labor or

00:47:48.373 --> 00:47:59.413
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:47:59.573 --> 00:48:03.973
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

00:48:04.133 --> 00:48:10.173
while you have got it without any effort.

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:14.213
So you are something special.

00:48:23.293 --> 00:48:27.213
So this, once you understand that you are special,

00:48:27.373 --> 00:48:31.373
you will become humble about it.

00:48:36.853 --> 00:48:42.533
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

00:48:42.693 --> 00:48:45.333
when you see you have achieved something,

00:48:45.493 --> 00:48:47.573
that you have some powers,

00:48:47.733 --> 00:48:53.493
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

00:48:53.813 --> 00:48:58.213
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

00:48:58.373 --> 00:49:02.453
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

00:49:02.613 --> 00:49:05.853
then you should believe

00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:10.893
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:36.533
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

00:49:36.693 --> 00:49:46.173
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

00:49:57.253 --> 00:50:03.493
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

00:50:03.653 --> 00:50:06.613
you will be in meditation;

00:50:12.013 --> 00:50:17.573
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

00:50:25.933 --> 00:50:34.453
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

00:50:37.413 --> 00:50:40.373
This is what you are in for;

00:50:40.533 --> 00:50:46.573
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

00:50:46.733 --> 00:50:50.773
on this great day of Sahasrara.

00:51:01.053 --> 00:51:05.053
May God bless you all.
