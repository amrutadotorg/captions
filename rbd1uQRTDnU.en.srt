1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:14,458
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

2
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:21,750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

3
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:29,332
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva that we are going to worship today.

4
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:40,176
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

5
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:51,460
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:01:01,065
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:16,985
The combination between Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

8
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:25,326
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

9
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:30,847
We cannot understand such relationship in human being, among human marriages

10
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:35,673
or among human relationships.

11
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:45,406
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

12
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:56,170
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

13
00:01:57,094 --> 00:02:03,653
And when He is watching this creation

14
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:12,884
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

15
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:20,158
He witnesses the whole universe

16
00:02:20,935 --> 00:02:26,489
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

17
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:33,853
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

18
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:38,923
His power is of witnessing

19
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:47,987
and the power of Adi Shakti

20
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:53,874
is this all pervading power of love.

21
00:02:56,203 --> 00:03:02,658
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

22
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:12,789
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

23
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,869
and She expresses Her power as love.

24
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:26,834
So the relationship between the two is extremely

25
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:34,737
understanding, very deep,

26
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,232
and whatever She‘s creating,

27
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:46,308
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

28
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:52,031
or there are people, human beings specially

29
00:03:52,232 --> 00:04:00,969
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

30
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:09,160
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

31
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:15,141
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

32
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:24,644
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

33
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:32,462
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

34
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:38,245
among all the creations He pulsates.

35
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:48,129
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

36
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:57,927
And He can destroy anything that goes against the plans of the Adi Shakti.

37
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:05,737
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

38
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:12,637
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

39
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:17,475
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

40
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:27,246
She wants human beings to go to that level where

41
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:32,427
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

42
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:39,582
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

43
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:50,016
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

44
00:05:50,217 --> 00:06:00,769
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

45
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:11,977
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.
