WEBVTT

00:00.080 --> 00:03.249
leaves the children with other Sahaja Yogis:
“All right, you manage everything,” and

00:03.249 --> 00:08.290
now they come back from, say work, and tired
and here all the children are passed on to

00:08.290 --> 00:13.240
them: “Now come along, do this, do that.”
It’s not the way. They’re your responsibility,

00:13.240 --> 00:16.470
children are your responsibility and you have
to look after your own children. You should

00:16.470 --> 00:20.350
not put children on to other people like that.
Oh, Saturday, Sunday, it’s a little bit

00:20.350 --> 00:25.439
they can play and do something, but it’s
not proper to put your children on somebody

00:25.439 --> 00:30.539
else who is a Sahaja Yogi, because he’s
staying in the ashram. It’s not proper.

00:30.539 --> 00:34.320
Or say, supposing, tomorrow you will say:
“All right, you clean my room because I’ve

00:34.320 --> 00:39.490
got children.” It’s not proper. That’s
your responsibility to see that you look after

00:39.490 --> 00:42.700
your room, look after your own children.

00:42.700 --> 00:47.220
And there are so many other things I have
heard about that people just say that: “Mother

00:47.220 --> 00:54.440
said so, Mother said so.” I mean, it’s
going to become another, really, a fundamental

00:54.440 --> 00:59.420
religion, Sahaja Yoga? Not at all. You see,
only the – it’s like a spiral. Sahaja

00:59.420 --> 01:07.250
Yoga is like a spiral. Spiral has the beginning,
but end is eternity. You have to move on.

01:07.250 --> 01:11.150
If you go like this, delimiting yourself,
what will happen? I don’t want to delimit

01:11.150 --> 01:19.530
you, by any chance. You are realized souls,
you are saints. Assume your powers.

01:19.530 --> 01:25.070
Only thing, you must go deep down into yourself
first of all, and see for yourself. You see,

01:25.070 --> 01:29.220
knowledge is so extensive. I never said: “Don’t
read any other book.” I never said so, there’s

01:29.220 --> 01:32.750
a – they said: “Mother said that don’t
read any other book.” How can I say such

01:32.750 --> 01:39.120
a nonsensical thing? I never said so. You
should read, and whatever is needed, you should

01:39.120 --> 01:45.170
be selective; and you yourself only see that
whatever is good is there, you should have.

01:45.170 --> 01:49.960
And I never said that all the pop music is
bad, I said some pop music is very bad. That’s

01:49.960 --> 01:55.290
My own opinion. But I am not – leaving it
to you to decide what you like, what you don’t

01:55.290 --> 02:06.720
like. You see, that is how you are going to
judge yourself. All this kind of saying that:

02:06.720 --> 02:11.700
“Mother said so,” indeed it’s another
false-style behavior, which one should not

02:11.700 --> 02:16.100
follow at all. There’s – nobody has right
to say that. Anybody who says: “Mother said

02:16.100 --> 02:21.260
so,” you should keep quiet. You can yourself
find out. You see, Bible says so, everybody

02:21.260 --> 02:25.120
can read Bible, there’s no need for somebody
to quote it that: “Bible said so,” we’ll

02:25.120 --> 02:26.650
see for Bible ourselves.

02:26.650 --> 02:34.890
Otherwise, what will be the difference between
you and others, other religions, where people

02:34.890 --> 02:42.140
have faltered with this kind of a fundamental
things? So this is very important to understand,

02:42.140 --> 02:48.709
and I came to know. Especially I have seen
in Australia, people are very systematically

02:48.709 --> 02:54.770
unsystematic. They’ll tell: “This is what
Mother said, this is what Mother said.”

02:54.770 --> 03:02.319
I don’t want to put you into any compartments,
nothing, no. You must grow your wings, and

03:02.319 --> 03:10.599
now I’ve just embedded you in the roots,
and the tree has to grow. You see, the tree

03:10.599 --> 03:18.520
has to grow with all the freedom, and this
one should remember, that all of you are intelligent,

03:18.520 --> 03:22.349
all of you are realized souls, all of you
have got vibrations.

03:22.349 --> 03:28.239
Sometimes, of course, it can be some negative
force can act suddenly and act on you, and

03:28.239 --> 03:33.150
you might go astray. Then you have to consider
and consult your leader. Blind-folded you

03:33.150 --> 03:41.870
consult your leader, or if not, consult Me.
I am open to you. There are many people who

03:41.870 --> 03:47.870
have said that people have fear for Me. I
mean, I’m not that frightening, am I? You

03:47.870 --> 03:52.410
can always telephone to Me; if not, if don’t
you get Me, you write to Me. Why don’t you

03:52.410 --> 03:58.379
write to Me? I get all the letters, and practically
every morning I go through them. I’m sometimes

03:58.379 --> 04:04.800
are delayed, but doesn’t matter, I go through
them, and if something has to be done I immediately

04:04.800 --> 04:12.129
answer, or I work it out. So one should not
have all these inhibitions or those fears

04:12.129 --> 04:16.389
about Me at least, when I am with you. I’m
your Mother. You can tell Me everything, and

04:16.389 --> 04:24.189
I have to work it out. Otherwise, unnecessarily
Sahaja Yoga will completely be dissolved into

04:24.189 --> 04:27.580
nonsense, which should not be.

04:27.580 --> 04:34.599
We have to be absolutely fearless. First of
all, such a fear exists in Australia. Why,

04:34.599 --> 04:45.330
I can’t understand. You’re not in jail.
What is there to be so frightened about? Historically

04:45.330 --> 04:53.219
it has been there, but now forget it. Just
be very free people. I talk to everyone who

04:53.219 --> 05:01.479
wants to talk to Me or meet Me, and all that.
So there is no reservation of any kind. But

05:01.479 --> 05:07.589
as long as you know that you are doing right
and you’re meditating, you are all right.

05:07.589 --> 05:12.300
And if there’s any need I will definitely
meet you or I’ll definitely receive your

05:12.300 --> 05:17.189
letters. I’ll definitely answer, do everything
that is possible. Because to Me you are very

05:17.189 --> 05:24.009
precious and you should never think on those
lines, because I’m really amazed that this

05:24.009 --> 05:31.619
kind of a fear, I don’t know. I am not a
wrathful person at all, by any chance. I am

05:31.619 --> 05:39.999
extremely forgiving. But, of course, if some
person tries to go to, say, do the tantric

05:39.999 --> 05:42.809
thing and then tries to do the tantric on
others, naturally that is in the open I’ll

05:42.809 --> 05:46.839
say that such and such person is not all right.
Nothing secretly, I won’t call them in the

05:46.839 --> 05:51.809
room and tell them that you are doing like
this, nothing. I openly, I tell before you

05:51.809 --> 05:58.449
that such and such person is to be abhorred
and should be given up.

05:58.449 --> 06:04.330
Of course, you should not also cross your
limits of just asking Me questions or saying

06:04.330 --> 06:14.129
things which are not necessary, just talking
to Me too much; there’s no need. Sometimes

06:14.129 --> 06:20.059
they come out very good questions, and even
I may not have said those things I say, when

06:20.059 --> 06:23.740
they ask such questions, so it’s nice to
ask some questions also. You are all free

06:23.740 --> 06:28.419
to ask questions. I’ve never said: “Don’t
ask Me questions”; but questions that are

06:28.419 --> 06:35.180
sensible. Like the other day we saw one film,
what was the name of that film? “Henry the

06:35.180 --> 06:44.110
Fifth,” you see, and it was a miracle how
he won against the France. So somebody asked

06:44.110 --> 06:49.270
Me: “Mother, how this miracle has taken
place?” I said: “Because England is the

06:49.270 --> 06:54.610
country of Shiva. Nobody can conquer it, that’s
a fact.” But that doesn’t mean they should

06:54.610 --> 07:01.710
all lose their heads. You see, Shiva blessed
so many rakshasas all His life, all His life,

07:01.710 --> 07:07.559
in the sense “lives”. See, Ravana was
blessed by Him, so many people were blessed

07:07.559 --> 07:13.889
by Him, because He is such a innocent person,
Shiva. He doesn’t think what harm this person

07:13.889 --> 07:19.099
can do to others, and that’s how He has
been blessing. And so many were blessed, so

07:19.099 --> 07:24.520
there are some rakshasas also blessed, I think,
were blessed definitely, in England. They

07:24.520 --> 07:29.809
conquered us and they tortured us and did
everything in India, did it all over. But

07:29.809 --> 07:31.069
still that country cannot be conquered, because
it is Shiva’s place. But that’s how they

07:31.069 --> 07:31.069
have become more arrogant. But now so many
things are coming, pinching them, and I think

07:31.069 --> 07:31.379
they’ll come round after some time. They
are just under the protection of Shiva, they

07:31.379 --> 07:32.460
have a little bit become arrogant and forgotten
what is dharma is. That, they will have to

07:32.460 --> 07:32.529
learn.

07:32.529 --> 07:33.669
While here it is the fear. I’m just bothered
about this fear part of it. See, it’s something

07:33.669 --> 07:37.039
I can’t understand. One should have no fears.
You can always tell your leaders, you can

07:37.039 --> 07:43.379
always telephone to Me, you can always tell
Me about it. We are all open, open people,

07:43.379 --> 07:48.029
we have to open out our hearts. Of course,
if you do anything wrong, then I have to say

07:48.029 --> 07:53.199
it. Because, you see, if you are doing wrong
I can’t ask you that: “All right, you

07:53.199 --> 07:58.300
go to hell,” I can’t say that. I have
to tell you: “This is wrong, you should

07:58.300 --> 08:02.629
not do this wrong”, and you should come
round.

08:02.629 --> 08:08.759
I’m of course, concerned about you, every
one of you, if you have problems I try to

08:08.759 --> 08:16.479
find solutions and things, whatever is there;
because I want you to be happy people, joyous.

08:16.479 --> 08:22.029
Now you should have reward of all your punyas
of last lives, that’s what you have got

08:22.029 --> 08:26.969
it. You must know ours is a different society
than others is. Otherwise we’ll be like

08:26.969 --> 08:37.660
Islamic fundamentalist or Christian fundamentalist,
or Sahaja Yoga fundamentalist!

08:37.660 --> 08:42.460
So the freedom is there all the time. Also
you can read books, why not now? That way

08:42.460 --> 08:48.200
Austrians are very, very much there. You see,
they meditate very – every day they meditate

08:48.200 --> 08:53.110
in the morning time, and I have seen they
are the ones who are producing lots of good

08:53.110 --> 09:01.770
results. Like, they’re finding out books,
you see, about this Koran now. They are reading

09:01.770 --> 09:07.300
Koran, finding out what’s in Koran and Bible,
this, that, they are trying to find out what’s

09:07.300 --> 09:13.440
wrong with this; who edited Bible, why this
wrong thing was put there, and they use Me

09:13.440 --> 09:18.650
as a model. I would never say such some things,
that how could Christ say that? But that’s

09:18.650 --> 09:25.360
how they are just trying to read books; and
we have to be scholars, we have to be real

09:25.360 --> 09:30.180
scholars, read books; and it’s not that
you should be mediocre people.

09:30.180 --> 09:37.620
We must also, whatever we are doing, so for
example, we had Pat there who came out of

09:37.620 --> 09:41.720
the drugs and all that. I said: “Pat, you
must get to something, seriously.” Then

09:41.720 --> 09:50.250
he took to plumbing and other things. I said:
“Go to the end of it, you should be masters

09:50.250 --> 09:55.200
of this. You must have masterly knowledge
about these things.” I would encourage you

09:55.200 --> 10:00.320
as much as possible that you should not just
be a mediocre, there should be no mediocrisy

10:00.320 --> 10:05.380
. You must read more books, you must understand,
you should have intellectuals who can explain

10:05.380 --> 10:13.340
Sahaja Yoga. Only one or two people can talk
about Sahaja Yoga, the rest of them cannot.

10:13.340 --> 10:15.560
It’s not proper.

10:15.560 --> 10:21.590
So open out yourself. All the time if you
have fear that whether we’ll be in Sahaja

10:21.590 --> 10:25.770
Yoga or not, you might be thrown away, then
you will never prosper. You should have no

10:25.770 --> 10:32.880
fears. So there are so many books you can
read, find out from other books, find out

10:32.880 --> 10:43.460
from other things; and grow, you have to grow
in that is. In anything you do, I was telling

10:43.460 --> 10:48.710
that if you are doing say art work or paintings
or anything, so you have to become masters

10:48.710 --> 10:54.090
in that. Just mediocrisy, is something you
do, what is there so special? You all can

10:54.090 --> 11:02.350
shoot into a very higher atmosphere because
you have powers to do that. You can do it,

11:02.350 --> 11:06.830
because you have got the awakening, you have
got all the powers flowing into you. The more

11:06.830 --> 11:12.790
you’ll use, the more you’ll get it. So
why not do it?

11:12.790 --> 11:17.460
So it’s a wrong idea. So we’ll have not
only the fundamentalism, but also a static

11:17.460 --> 11:27.140
society, which doesn’t grow. So we are enjoying,
but we have to grow, we have to learn more,

11:27.140 --> 11:31.320
we have to understand more, think more. There
are so many things to be done, I mean. How

11:31.320 --> 11:39.790
many of you read newspapers, now raise your
hands, let’s see? Everybody must read newspaper

11:39.790 --> 11:48.650
and discuss the world problems. You know,
what you think will work out. Discuss what’s

11:48.650 --> 11:57.180
going on. You must read newspapers and understand
what are the world problems today, what’s

11:57.180 --> 12:05.110
happening where. Wherever your attention would
be it will work out, it works out. That’s

12:05.110 --> 12:11.320
why I read, you see, what’s happening now
in Israel, and what’s happening with Mr.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.860
Baker there, all of them.

12:14.860 --> 12:19.690
So you see, in the same way you should be
well-equipped, you should know everything

12:19.690 --> 12:24.830
about what’s happening where, what is what.
Don’t read scandals, that has no meaning,

12:24.830 --> 12:29.360
but read something substantial, their editorials
and things like that. Also you should get

12:29.360 --> 12:35.510
hold of books. We really need intellectuals
who will really face tomorrow’s world to

12:35.510 --> 12:44.250
tell them what is Sahaja Yoga. But not to
show off. Some people have a habit of showing

12:44.250 --> 12:49.110
off they have this knowledge, they have that
knowledge, just jump on the stage. Not that.

12:49.110 --> 12:54.600
But it’s a deep understanding within yourself.
You must try to have deep understanding within

12:54.600 --> 13:00.200
yourself, whatever you are knowing. Now, you
have to bring it to the pattern of Sahaja

13:00.200 --> 13:05.850
Yoga, what these people are saying, all right,
this is the pattern of Sahaja Yoga.

13:05.850 --> 13:10.130
Also in this Shiv Puja I’ll tell you certain
tricks about it. But whatever it is, you must

13:10.130 --> 13:16.360
take to writing, you must have books here
in every ashram, you must have books, you

13:16.360 --> 13:23.620
must have reading, you must discuss among
yourselves and talk. I told you I’d never

13:23.620 --> 13:30.460
studied English language, you see, because
somehow My father put us in the vernacular,

13:30.460 --> 13:36.400
and so I couldn’t even study Sanskrit or
English. But I was a reader, and in My family

13:36.400 --> 13:41.960
people are like that. You see we had a huge
library, and then My father would just ask

13:41.960 --> 13:46.540
us: “All right, remember this chapter in
Gita?” Then he would discuss, talk about

13:46.540 --> 13:52.360
it: “What is this?” So the brain also
develops, and attention goes to something

13:52.360 --> 14:00.240
sensible. That’s how it should be. You should
all get out of this kind of thing. But not

14:00.240 --> 14:04.510
that: “Read Number One, the page, verse
Number One”, then you put your finger, then:

14:04.510 --> 14:11.190
“Now another one”: not that way. But your
light of the Spirit should fall on to the

14:11.190 --> 14:18.920
thought, and you should see for yourself what
is happening, how it is going to be brought

14:18.920 --> 14:25.029
to your Sahaja Yoga flavor.

14:25.029 --> 14:30.630
So I want you really to be very, very bold.
But those people who just want to show off,

14:30.630 --> 14:34.910
and want to take the charge or want to take
the stage and all that, I’ll put them right.

14:34.910 --> 14:44.000
But you don’t worry about them, you just
see your own development, how far you are

14:44.000 --> 14:57.540
working it out. There’s so much to be learnt,
so much to be understood.

14:57.540 --> 15:05.830
You
should not feel guilty also, for nothing at
all. I mean, whatever I say, you start feeling

15:05.830 --> 15:13.430
guilty. It’s very wrong. I’m not saying
it to punish you in any way! Just saying it

15:13.430 --> 15:23.950
that you should be really free of these fears,
absolutely free of these fears.

15:23.950 --> 15:33.560
You do not know, we are the creator of a new
world, new age and a new society. We are very

15:33.560 --> 15:49.440
great people, not ordinary. It’s a big revolution
we are playing into. Like just now they told

15:49.440 --> 15:55.430
me that from Austria, I told them that they
can publish – they wanted to have a demonstration

15:55.430 --> 16:01.529
against Catholic Church. I said: “You don’t
do it. You just type something, publish it,

16:01.529 --> 16:08.860
and put it in the – go to some remote village
and distribute it there.” So they did it.

16:08.860 --> 16:14.210
Nobody knew who did it, all that; and after
that, now, there’s going to be a demonstration

16:14.210 --> 16:23.860
from that village against Catholic Church…

16:23.860 --> 18:30.399
…So if you have any questions, anything,
you can write it down and

18:30.399 --> 18:59.450
send it over to Me, and I will see about it;
if there are sensible questions about. Also

18:59.450 --> 19:09.009
I am going to work out something for the children.
Something, how to make them more sort of contented

19:09.009 --> 19:17.330
among themselves and not to make them so wild
as has been described, the “wild West”!

19:17.330 --> 19:25.450
So I’ll talk to you about the children,
also, one day, and I’ll tell you what is

19:25.450 --> 19:33.230
to be done.

19:33.230 --> 19:41.330
So now can I take your leave? Now I am getting
afraid of you people!
