00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.460
Work starts at 4 o'clock and by the
time we finish it's late from home today.

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.181
Yesterday I told you that I
will tell you about Kundalini.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.730
Can everybody is
able to see this chart?

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.790
Those who cannot see come and sit on
this side. Come here and sit here nicely.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:45.545
Those who cannot see, please
come to this side. Move a bit this side.

00:00:51.377 --> 00:00:54.627
Now you can see it. [Inaudible]

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:04.147
[Shri Mataji says in Marathi that,
“Wind is very strong, right.”] [Inaudible]

00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:18.037
[Inaudible] Yes!

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:29.452
[Inaudible]

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:34.947
Sit down, now you see, sit
in front of me. Yes, all right.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.050
Come this way, one side.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:12.192
I told you yesterday that the nature of
which human beings are made has done

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.856
wonderful things within us and
that is why we have been created.

00:02:20.648 --> 00:02:27.319
The things which I am
going to tell you now

00:02:27.343 --> 00:02:34.968
are not described in
current modern scriptures.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.968
As I told you current
modern sciences only

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.900
knows those things
which are comprehensible,

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:50.288
or can be actually visualized, and
this vision of human beings is not

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:55.683
yet having light of Spirit. Still human
beings are not enlightened [matured).

00:02:55.844 --> 00:02:58.337
Things which now I
am going to tell you can

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.854
be known only after
enlightenment [maturity].

00:03:01.637 --> 00:03:04.495
Whether these things
are really existing or not

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.377
existing within us, that
you yourself can see.

00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:13.356
First thing is that human
beings get situated

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.373
[settled]. Firstly, his
existence is formed.

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:21.635
Whole universe also
initially gets its state.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.662
If it does not get its
state cannot happen.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:37.300
The condition that’s get created is
due to power of God that’s within us,

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.819
this power which we call as energy [shakti]
of Sadashiva or energy [shakti] of Shiva.

00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:53.573
Due to this energy our
existence is created.

00:03:53.597 --> 00:04:01.774
Rishi-munis named this
shakti [energy] as ‘Mahakali’.

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:11.657
This energy comes in us through our
right side and settles on our left side.

00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:23.596
As it has been shown here. “(You show, show
Ida Nadi, channel. Come here, this, show that)”

00:04:26.887 --> 00:04:33.527
The channel carrying this is
called by Ida Nadi [Ida Channel].

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:40.348
So, all these things are very minute. These are
subtle things. These cannot be seen from outside.

00:04:40.448 --> 00:04:46.058
But due to this channel only,

00:04:46.058 --> 00:04:49.507
left sympathetic nervous
system is being manifested in us.

00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:51.644
left sympathetic
nervous system.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:05:02.912
So, like this as condition is there,
the way in which our existence

00:05:02.936 --> 00:05:10.849
is also there. If there is no
existence we reach to death.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:17.814
It means that when this power is
not there within us, we get destroyed.

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:22.088
Therefore, many people know
this as ‘power of destruction’.

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:29.992
When sun sets, the spell of
darkness sets in. In the same manner,

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:35.703
as existence of one power or not existence,
both are representing same power,

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:40.830
This power must be said to
represent both set and existence.

00:05:46.685 --> 00:06:00.195
Another power which is moving
in us due to which we create,

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:07.398
due to which we think, which retains body,
due to which we keep this body moving,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:15.857
this energy is called by
‘Shakti of Brahmadeva’ and this

00:06:15.881 --> 00:06:21.056
‘Shakti of Brahmadeva’ is
called as ‘Mahasaraswati’.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:25.232
This energy (I am talking
in English because we

00:06:25.256 --> 00:06:29.776
get confused in Hindi
language in left and right.)

00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:35.161
passes through our left side
and settles in our right side.

00:06:38.098 --> 00:06:42.059
The channel carrying this
energy, which is very minute, very,

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:45.978
very minute is called as
‘Pingala Nadi’ [Pingala Channel).

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.391
The channel which is first [Ida]
is also called as “moon channel”

00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:52.106
and this second channel [Pingla]
is also called as “sun channel”

00:06:55.064 --> 00:07:03.144
Due to this channel within us,
right sympathetic nervous system,

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:06.602
this is subtle channel
but the material channel

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:10.597
which can be seen with
eye, which is active channel,

00:07:12.287 --> 00:07:16.707
that right sympathetic
nervous system is manifested.

00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:22.026
This channel, I told you,
is responsible for physical

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.133
and mental work is performed,
due to which we think.

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:31.935
First channel which is called
by ‘Moon Channel’ or ‘Ida

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:37.654
Channel’ activates
Subconscious [Supt Chetan] in us.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.643
As you are now listening to my
discussion; at this moment at present,

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:47.730
you listen to my talk and immediately
you throw it in subconscious mind.

00:07:48.575 --> 00:07:51.418
You are listening this in
conscious mind and from

00:07:51.442 --> 00:07:54.285
conscious mind you move
this in subconscious mind.

00:07:54.285 --> 00:08:00.910
And due to this mind; conditionings
[sanskar] get developed within you;

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.922
may be those are good
conditionings [susanskar] or bad

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.493
conditionings [kusanskar]. That
is the conditionings of the brain.

00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:13.189
Due to this channel our past is
created, ‘bhav’ is formed. Means

00:08:13.213 --> 00:08:20.791
whatever has happened in past
which is called as ‘bhutkal’ [past tense],

00:08:22.026 --> 00:08:29.506
whatever is over gets collected and
stored in us due to this channel only.

00:08:30.964 --> 00:08:42.184
and the very minute recording
or collection is kept in Kundalini.

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:46.962
Kundalini Shakti [energy] is only
the residual Shakti of Mahakali.

00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:55.481
The power of Sadashiva is
always there, as if it were a seed.

00:08:55.505 --> 00:09:01.315
It is from this seed that both
these powers are awakened

00:09:01.815 --> 00:09:04.183
and at the end absorbed
in it only. And that’s why it is

00:09:04.207 --> 00:09:06.791
called as ‘Sadashiva’ because
this energy is always present

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:17.851
and other energies gets awakened
from this and gets absorbed in this only.

00:09:20.858 --> 00:09:28.121
Other than this there is
one more energy in between

00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:35.408
in us: the channel carrying
this energy is called as

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.573
‘Sushumna Channel’. Some
say it as ‘Sushmna’, some say

00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:41.702
as ‘sushumna’. It’s having
different pronunciations

00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:48.625
but Sushumna is proper pronunciation
which can be sung in Mantras also.

00:09:50.342 --> 00:10:01.542
So, this Sushumna Channel is carrying our
activity of ascent, evolutionary processes.

00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:07.231
Due to this channel, we became
from amoeba to human beings.

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:25.359
Through all these 3 channels whatever
is achieved, whatever is worked out,

00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:30.703
whatever a being obtains, whatever is
happened that is stored on our central

00:10:30.727 --> 00:10:36.500
nervous system which enters in us through
rear side of brain going to downwards,

00:10:37.309 --> 00:10:40.967
today whatever is having
human beings’ consciousness,

00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:44.649
like now at this moment
whatever you have obtained,

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:50.178
that is settled completely in the Central
nervous system, your conscious mind.

00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:56.578
So this way, I have
told you 4 institutions.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:04.340
The central system which we
call as ‘Shakti’ of Shri Vishnu.

00:11:07.992 --> 00:11:12.245
By Shri Vishnu’s power firstly
Dharma gets established in us.

00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:16.522
Through retention of Dharma
only our ascent gets developed.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:25.458
Like if you see periodic table in
chemistry, you can understand

00:11:25.528 --> 00:11:34.918
how properly neatly God
Almighty has arranged all elements

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.138
there in it and how He
has given different types of

00:11:42.162 --> 00:11:47.300
energy or special Dharma
has been allotted to them.

00:11:48.072 --> 00:11:51.429
They have 8 valencies
and this you can ask

00:11:51.453 --> 00:11:55.302
any specialist of chemistry
or medical science

00:11:55.321 --> 00:11:58.834
and from these 8
valencies some of them have

00:11:58.858 --> 00:12:02.371
either fulfilment with
8 or with 4 valencies.

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.950
In case; if they are complete
and due to lack or excess of 1

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:11.943
or 2 or 3 [electrons], transactions
take place in between them.

00:12:11.952 --> 00:12:16.605
This has been created very
delicately. This retention also, this

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:21.282
retention of Dharma also takes
place due to Shri Vishnu Tattwa.

00:12:21.353 --> 00:12:25.745
As gold is having
quality that it never gets

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:30.673
spoiled, it never becomes
black, untarnishable.

00:12:31.697 --> 00:12:36.379
This retention of Dharma
is due to Shri Vishnu

00:12:36.403 --> 00:12:40.877
principle, that is
active in Nabhi Chakra.

00:12:43.678 --> 00:12:48.578
When this principle is spoiled
then our ascent is stopped.

00:12:51.608 --> 00:12:55.653
This principle mostly we
have to practice in Sahaja

00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:59.478
Yoga and mostly we
have to consider this only.

00:13:02.673 --> 00:13:09.503
Earlier I told you that Kundalini is
residual conscious of Mahakali power.

00:13:11.722 --> 00:13:14.699
It is having collection of whatever
we have done till this time,

00:13:14.723 --> 00:13:17.652
what mistakes we had done or
what religious acts we had done,

00:13:17.652 --> 00:13:24.440
what we had gained, whatever kind of
conditionings we are having good or bad,

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.117
all our diseases,
problems, all not just of

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:31.817
this life but of many
lives are taped in this

00:13:34.807 --> 00:13:37.791
and this is your Mother
who has absorbed all your

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:41.298
conditionings in her and is
moving with you every time.

00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:52.748
That’s why this is called as Sahaja Yoga; But it is
settled on your triangular bone in 3 and 1/2 coils.

00:13:52.908 --> 00:14:00.378
Why it is having 3 and 1/2 coils is topic of great discussion.
If I start to talk on this then time will fall short!

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:10.289
You can see with your eyes whether
this Kundalini is there within us or not.

00:14:10.813 --> 00:14:21.103
When Kundalini gets awakened you can see
how it vibrates on this triangular bone.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:27.610
When there is catch in Nabhi chakra then
specially these vibrations can be seen so strong

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:35.300
that any small child also can see
this. This does not require any proof.

00:14:35.984 --> 00:14:40.264
For this we have made a film
also which we will show on BBC TV.

00:14:40.693 --> 00:14:43.933
Kundalini resides here only
at this place and no where else.

00:14:43.933 --> 00:14:49.506
You can read some of the books have been written- one Irwin
Sahab has also written such a big book about Kundalini.

00:14:49.506 --> 00:14:53.755
Till now he doesn’t know that where exactly
is Kundalini residing? Then why to write?

00:14:53.755 --> 00:15:01.657
Who has given them rights to write such a big book? If he
is British that does not mean whatever they feel can write.

00:15:02.676 --> 00:15:09.316
By reading books and without experience and observing,
he had written may be Kundalini is in stomach

00:15:09.316 --> 00:15:14.081
or may be little bit below
this or may be above seat.

00:15:17.744 --> 00:15:24.574
All things made by God are never
this way or that way. Truth is one.

00:15:25.429 --> 00:15:30.782
All this confusion is there only in human
brain that whether it is here or there.

00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:38.283
Things which have been created by God are just at that place
only and not at any other place. You can see this with your eyes.

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:46.255
This Kundalini residing at triangular bone
has been moving with you for many lives.

00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:51.941
Even after death she is wandering above
your head and when you again take birth

00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:55.286
then enters in you
and resides inside.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.810
Death and rebirth are work
of very great compilation.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.381
A dedicated lecture shall have to
be given to do justice with this topic.

00:16:07.688 --> 00:16:14.968
But we don’t have any connection with death at this moment. Today
we are just related with present and we will discuss only about it.

00:16:17.134 --> 00:16:26.014
As left side channel, Ida Nadi is
related with our subconscious, our past;

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:35.885
in the same manner channel from right side which is
called as Pingala Nadi is related with our future,

00:16:35.885 --> 00:16:44.580
and the channel which is in our middle is
related with present, now, at this moment.

00:16:51.209 --> 00:17:01.749
See this there is gap between these due to
which human beings cannot stay in present;

00:17:01.862 --> 00:17:07.322
either he goes ahead or stays behind but
cannot stay in present. Cannot stay in present.

00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:17.114
Now see how Kundalini gets awakened. When
you hold your hands like this in front of me,

00:17:17.524 --> 00:17:24.664
then energy or vibrations flowing through me enters through
your hands, through fingers because these fingers also,

00:17:24.664 --> 00:17:30.088
see these fingers – they have not shown this in chart but
another chart has shown this – these are also having centres

00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:36.561
on right and left. On right hand and left hand are
also having these centres and all these fingers,

00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:44.332
its edges, you can say ends, at
that place are centres [chakras].

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:52.371
And when these chakras or centres
are awakened then you can feel on them

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:59.613
that your which chakras are caught up and also which
of other’s are catching. With this left sympathetic

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:06.527
and right sympathetic, Chakras of both sides
you understand and when you know chakras

00:18:06.527 --> 00:18:09.764
Then you can cure any
disease due to these chakras.

00:18:10.312 --> 00:18:16.532
Like yesterday one girl came, suffering from [inaudible]
got spontaneously cured and started moving nicely.

00:18:16.532 --> 00:18:23.510
She was having multiple sclerosis which is incurable,
nobody can cure this. Why did she got cured by Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:31.670
Because in this first diagnosis is there, which chakra is being
caught up. Mooladhara Chakra is caught up. Heart chakra is caught up.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:37.388
If you awaken Shri Ganesha on Mooladhara Chakra
and in Heart [Chakra], Shri Shiva is pleased.

00:18:37.388 --> 00:18:41.945
Then immediately vibrations will come there
because his chakras which are there inside

00:18:41.945 --> 00:18:46.774
which are his basic, are cured,
then that person will be cured.

00:18:46.774 --> 00:18:52.582
Diagnosis also will be done by human being. That
person who gets realized, he himself will diagnose,

00:18:52.582 --> 00:18:58.040
will give treatment, give medicine
and can give self-realization to others.

00:19:01.424 --> 00:19:09.214
The first chakra is below Kundalini. God
almighty has kept this here with proper wisdom.

00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:31.675
So, this chakra is adorned due to Shri Ganesha. It is
called by Mooladhara Chakra and above this is Mooladhara.

00:19:33.366 --> 00:19:39.196
Triangular bone [sacrum] is called as Mooladhara. Some
people call it by Kumbhkund. Many names have been given.

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:49.718
But Shri Ganesha resides on Mooladhara Chakra and it’s
very necessary to understand this Mooladhara Chakra.

00:19:51.343 --> 00:19:59.143
Our sex is controlled by this chakra and
Shri Ganesha has been kept above this.

00:19:59.335 --> 00:20:06.525
Shri Ganesha is an innocent child. That’s why he
has been positioned there because he is so much pure

00:20:07.696 --> 00:20:16.596
that no dirt can touch him. That’s why is being
seated there. Because small child is having

00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:22.211
so much innocence that He is all above all such
things, that’s why Shri Ganesha is seating there.

00:20:23.641 --> 00:20:33.411
Siting there Shri Ganesha protects Kundalini which is ‘Gauri
Swaroopa’ means She is married but still did not meet to husband,

00:20:33.582 --> 00:20:39.192
still virgin. In virginity only She has
created Ganesha and kept Him here.

00:20:39.192 --> 00:20:48.779
See such a beautiful situation is this and She is
residing there waiting for husband, waiting to meet Shiva.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:55.360
For the protection of her chastity, for her
protocol, Shri Ganesha is installed there.

00:20:56.363 --> 00:21:00.033
Now on this I will tell you what
‘Tantric’s’ have committed mistake.

00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:06.266
Because I am Mother, I will not say that they do
this deliberately because this can be greatest sin,

00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:15.481
But this can happen by mistake only. Initially when they
started doing exploring “manan,” for not having so much purity

00:21:15.522 --> 00:21:23.122
might be that they took Shri Ganesha’s
trunk as Kundalini and due to this

00:21:23.122 --> 00:21:30.837
it might be they considered Kundalini at that place where we
sustain chakra. Where there is Shri Ganesha, there is no Kundalini

00:21:31.108 --> 00:21:39.898
and that’s why they developed such theory that by doing sex
Kundalini comes up. May be initially this mistake has happened.

00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:44.828
Might have happened but being
Mother I cannot blame them.

00:21:45.394 --> 00:21:52.054
They are also my children. But human beings
have never done any mistake more than this.

00:21:52.319 --> 00:21:57.189
See Kundalini is your Mother and
this is so strong to blame on her.

00:22:02.464 --> 00:22:09.704
But by this mistake all Tantric
society was created. In sixth century,

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:16.478
there were riots in our
country and all kings, emperors

00:22:16.478 --> 00:22:25.580
who were filled with filthy life
style were giving more support

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.918
they ruined it to such low
level that our all architecture,

00:22:28.942 --> 00:22:32.626
scripture as much as even in
our all sciences they featured it.

00:22:33.012 --> 00:22:38.272
They started saying that Shiva
and Shakti were homosexual

00:22:38.382 --> 00:22:44.232
and they also started saying that
“Ashwamegha Yagnya” is also unisexual.

00:22:44.232 --> 00:22:46.870
The one who gets blind in
shravan [one season with

00:22:46.894 --> 00:22:49.478
all greenery around],
he sees everything green.

00:22:52.432 --> 00:22:57.612
Such a highest virgin great principle
they brought down to so low level.

00:22:58.411 --> 00:23:01.962
We are actually Tantric, we know
[tantra] and we operate [tantra].

00:23:01.986 --> 00:23:05.811
This is your technique by Which
is called Kundalini is your [tantra].

00:23:06.143 --> 00:23:09.736
But these bad people named
themselves by “tantric”. It is

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.803
like as if one thief has come
and is calling himself as a king

00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:21.070
and due to this confusion human
beings cannot understand that while

00:23:21.094 --> 00:23:24.935
discussing about Kundalini,
why Mataji is saying about purity.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:29.973
Actually, this Kundalini
which is purest thing and

00:23:29.997 --> 00:23:34.480
people get astonished
when we relate it to purity.

00:23:36.454 --> 00:23:39.424
What a darkness ?

00:23:43.776 --> 00:23:50.886
Then when such people who do not value
character in their life, who are not pure,

00:23:50.899 --> 00:23:53.777
those who are spending their
life by wrong ways, those who

00:23:53.801 --> 00:23:56.679
have completely prepared
themselves for their destruction,

00:23:56.679 --> 00:24:02.241
so if such people when try to raise Kundalini then it’s must that
heat will be created inside them. They will get short circuited.

00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:05.890
Problems will come, they will jump
and will be doing all sort of things.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:15.210
Those who have faced such experiences is natural because Shri Ganesha
is survivor of mistakes, he breaks all sympathetic nervous system.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:21.567
We have such people when their Kundalini was raised then
bristles came out from here to here, all over their body.

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:28.925
This, you see, is not due to raising of Kundalini but its
reaction of sympathetic that is passing through both the sides.

00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:38.655
You can see that you cannot raise Kundalini through Ganesha ji. He is residing at
rear side. But I feel that when people come from foreign countries to our country

00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:45.103
they come from bathroom
or from drainage and then

00:24:45.103 --> 00:24:48.988
they write explanation of that [drainage] as
explanation of our country. They are donkeys only.

00:24:49.874 --> 00:24:54.104
If they want to come then they can come from main gate and then
understand what is our culture of our [civilization] country!

00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.030
Such a learned man like Hume, I
admire him a lot. He was also donkey

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:06.582
because he came from same way and he spread
all Tantra and promoted its importance.

00:25:08.443 --> 00:25:14.693
No Indian is remaining with
us to tell them the real truth.

00:25:14.693 --> 00:25:18.868
no one is remaining with us to tell them the real truth, nor
did they try to learn the real meaning of Kundilini system.

00:25:22.372 --> 00:25:28.642
When your Kundalini is awakened, you will be surprised to know that you just become like innocent child 182 00:25:2r8,642 --&gt; 00:25:35,838
because Shri Ganesha is awakened first. At the beginning the vibrations that are flowing through your hands are received by Shri Ganesha only.

00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:41.878
Your hands are towards me. Vibrations enter
through your hands and inform Shri Ganesha

00:25:41.878 --> 00:25:49.269
that now Mother has come and you become like
small child. Because He breaks the way in between.

00:25:54.645 --> 00:25:59.725
Only after that Kundalini rises. Kundalini
never rises till Shri Ganesha do not sanction.

00:26:01.704 --> 00:26:09.084
If you are very impure person then Kundalini cannot rise or
if anybody has damaged your Mooladhara then also cannot rise.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:16.210
Nowadays mostly [false] gurus do this dirty
work. These people break your Kundalini.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.150
People become unhappy with me if I say something
against their gurus, “Mataji, don’t say this.”

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:24.792
Then what? Shall I adorn them with garlands? Or
shall I do Aarti to them who break your Kundalini,

00:26:25.142 --> 00:26:33.352
who destroy your chance to have second birth
and dispel you from your own right to get this?

00:26:39.671 --> 00:26:43.961
These people are just interested in money.
They eat your money. I don’t have problem.

00:26:44.351 --> 00:26:49.431
They crook you; I don’t mind. Whatever they want to
do, they may become thief, they make your women dirty.

00:26:49.431 --> 00:26:52.816
If your women are so stupid, let
them become dirty. I don’t mind.

00:26:52.816 --> 00:26:59.998
But when they trouble Kundalini and make your Kundalini
dirty then they should be called by “rakshasa” [demons]

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:07.725
and they are demons only. I know
such 16 massive demons at least.

00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:13.302
they were killed by Goddess many times and they have born
again and again. They are born in this Kali Yuga [era of Kali]

00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:22.677
and 6 rakshasin [female demons] also have taken birth and people
worship them. Such senseless people that they have no limits.

00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:35.782
This Kundalini, that is your Mother. She is waiting
for the day when her child will get his second birth.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.550
She only gives you second birth. Due to her you are
known as twice born. If you are superficial person,

00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:47.921
if you don’t have any depth in you, if you didn’t
want that, Kundalini does not rise on her own,

00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:54.411
If you have done some mistakes, she
informs that he has done this mistake.

00:27:57.493 --> 00:28:05.823
From your chakras it can be known that you have done this mistake, that you
haven’t done and, in this way, all about Kundalini can be known completely.

00:28:06.342 --> 00:28:18.702
But if you have carefully kept your Kundalini properly like as Kabira
has said, “Das kabir jatan se odhi, jaisi ki taisi rakhdini chadariya”,

00:28:20.209 --> 00:28:25.439
at that time Kundalini of such
people get easily awakened.

00:28:27.717 --> 00:28:33.767
Now after this next chakra above this is called
as Swadishthana. This chakra comes from our Nabhi

00:28:33.986 --> 00:28:40.886
and is moving around [Nabhi]. This
is known as Swadishthana Chakra.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:51.430
Due to Swadishthana Chakra our attention is activated. Wherever
we put our attention there Swadishthana Chakra starts working.

00:28:52.692 --> 00:28:59.092
That’s why when we think too much at
that time Swadishthana Chakra converts,

00:28:59.092 --> 00:29:09.726
transforms fat from stomach so
that it can be used in our brain.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:17.830
Brain is also having fat globules in it.
These fat globules which we use are

00:29:18.184 --> 00:29:25.634
transformed in stomach by Swadishthana
Chakra and transfers them to brain.

00:29:26.996 --> 00:29:39.316
This is the chakra which keeps control on our
liver, pancreas, kidney and some part of uterus.

00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:45.601
This is the centre of creation. Whatever we
think about future, we feel like to create,

00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:51.743
whatever we do planning for
future then this Chakra starts working

00:29:52.692 --> 00:29:59.602
and it enlightens our attention.
It enlightens our [Chitta].

00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:06.459
The person who has bad
liver, his attention is always sad.

00:30:06.846 --> 00:30:13.716
He will not like anything. It’s not
his fault because his liver is not good.

00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:17.747
That’s why it is called as ‘liver’
as it is related with your life.

00:30:19.063 --> 00:30:26.183
the same manner person who thinks too much and do too
much planning his Swadishthana Chakra also becomes worse

00:30:26.183 --> 00:30:32.564
because either it is doing work of thinking
and supplies continuously to brain,

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:42.785
The poor thing, and or will look after all these organs. From
these organs when pancreas becomes bad then you get diabetes.

00:30:42.796 --> 00:30:46.996
Diabetes can be cured 100 percent
by Sahaja Yoga, hundred percent.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:55.250
In this manner due to excessive thinking
right side of a person is doing excessive work

00:30:55.250 --> 00:31:03.636
and left side becomes un supported
or becomes sad, gets neglected.

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:12.319
Due to this when person
thinks too much, works hard;

00:31:12.319 --> 00:31:16.698
does too much physical
efforts then he gets heart attack.

00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:27.818
When he gets heart attack then he should understand
that, “Now I have done too much.” He becomes imbalanced.

00:31:28.175 --> 00:31:34.945
He should understand immediately that now he should pay
attention towards emotions and try to bring balance.

00:31:34.945 --> 00:31:44.475
In Sahaja Yoga after self-realization there is very simple process
to bring balance, raise left side and put it on right side.

00:31:44.475 --> 00:31:49.096
Just now many people came here who were not able
to get realized, their only left side was raised

00:31:49.096 --> 00:31:53.316
and put it on right side only 3 times,
then immediately their Kundalini came out.

00:31:53.316 --> 00:32:01.626
As you can see here that when you think too
much or when you are very busy in work then

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:09.529
your ego gets developed, as shown above.
Which actually goes through your head

00:32:09.543 --> 00:32:17.143
up to here revolving like a balloon and
when you develop conditionings in yourself

00:32:17.143 --> 00:32:24.205
means when you try to press this ego then superego
is awakened in you which is called as superego.

00:32:24.381 --> 00:32:29.501
It comes from behind you to the
right side – that's also an imbalance.

00:32:29.626 --> 00:32:40.036
In this manner two different types of balloons are developed
in you. When one balloon is more developed than another balloon

00:32:40.036 --> 00:32:46.799
then it tries to control another balloon and it exerts pressure
on another balloon. Nowadays ego is more developed in Indians

00:32:47.809 --> 00:32:55.689
because we are developing so we do much planning. We are
very active that’s why due to thinking our ego is increasing.

00:32:55.965 --> 00:33:04.955
Nowadays in Western people superego is increasing because initially
there, ego was so much grown up that it completely controlled superego.

00:33:05.298 --> 00:33:11.188
So, they were disturbed and through ego they started
thinking there should be some control over this

00:33:11.264 --> 00:33:17.544
and they started taking drugs, etc. Due
to intake of drugs superego was increased.

00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:25.509
As superego gave push to ego then ego came here and superego
was expanded. Now wobbling is going on in between these two.

00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:31.313
They are pushing each other from here to there and nothing is at proper
place. All the time wobbling is going on in between two in their mind.

00:33:31.313 --> 00:33:40.684
They are having very different worries. As you know that those who are
very wealthiest countries as like Sweden are having more number of suicides

00:33:40.684 --> 00:33:46.584
because in their mind this quarrel of ego and superego is going
on. Living is not in their tract. In one minute, you can see

00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:53.921
in America hundreds of people: somebody’s
nose is moving, somebody’s head is moving,

00:33:53.921 --> 00:33:59.166
somebody’s eyes are flickering, somebody’s mouth is
twisting. They cannot sit in peace for one minute.

00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:06.521
If you see young people, can see
big wrinkles over here due to worries.

00:34:09.156 --> 00:34:17.476
The reason for this is quarrel between ego and superego
which is continuously going on within them and so much

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:21.223
fallacy and confusion is going on in their
mind that they don’t understand, “What is it?”

00:34:21.223 --> 00:34:27.814
and by taking benefit of this, demonic
powers or negativities enter in their brain.

00:34:29.247 --> 00:34:40.477
And that’s why they follow such things so that they can run
away from this and can run away from all problems in this world.

00:34:44.206 --> 00:34:53.676
Swadishthana Chakra is very important. Because those
people who do excessive work either goes to extreme,

00:34:53.752 --> 00:34:57.732
we call this as supra conscious
area which is on right hand side.

00:34:58.316 --> 00:35:03.096
So, when it’s transgressed then we
enter into collective supra conscious.

00:35:03.815 --> 00:35:10.095
This In this manner when they are transgressed on left side then he
enters from [personal] subconscious into collective subconscious.

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:26.049
Upper part of human beings is of collective consciousness.
The person who thinks too much about dead persons,

00:35:26.118 --> 00:35:32.188
about death specially in Buddha Dharma [religion] this has entered. It’s surprising I
don’t understand that why Buddhists have given so much importance to this. Its suprising

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:41.430
That why did Buddhist gave so much leverage to this,
although as per me Buddha must not have considered.

00:35:42.752 --> 00:35:47.692
And Buddha said, to the extent
that, don’t worship any dead things.

00:35:48.254 --> 00:35:54.814
Buddhist people are just opposite to this. If you go to
Ladakh or if you go to Tibbet there Buddhists, many of them

00:35:54.851 --> 00:36:02.301
do tantrism. ‘Pret Vidya’, ‘Shmshan Vidya’, ‘Bhoot
Vidya’, with Mahavira followers is also same thing.

00:36:02.301 --> 00:36:07.058
But these people go to more extremes than Mahavira
followers. But at least Mahavira’s followers,

00:36:07.058 --> 00:36:15.497
due to their going opposite or whatever may be like, but
they will build temple, create caves, will do drawings,

00:36:15.497 --> 00:36:21.497
if not find anything else, then will work
for cloth shops, sell clothes; do such acts.

00:36:21.497 --> 00:36:29.829
and Buddha followers – but Buddha who never talked about
death, surely Mahavira has said about death and hell,

00:36:29.978 --> 00:36:34.688
but Buddha never talked about death – all
are just going on discussing about death.

00:36:37.518 --> 00:36:43.258
In Ladakh there is sign formed about which person is
to be seated, in what way; how person is to be buried.

00:36:43.258 --> 00:36:48.669
how his hand is to kept;
how he is to be managed,

00:36:48.669 --> 00:36:55.115
In which text of Buddha it is written, I know not; but I
can tell you for now that He can not write such a thing.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:37:03.691
All this necromancy, tantrism,
all force them towards left side

00:37:03.691 --> 00:37:14.764
and with this you have the equations about whom you
must have heard dakini, shakini, hakini, etc., etc.,

00:37:14.764 --> 00:37:22.050
in this way have seven resonances. With its resonance a person is just
pushed forward in collective subconscious and in collective subconscious.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:28.640
And all those persons
who are dead are there

00:37:28.752 --> 00:37:39.652
who are afraid of their life,
who run away from life, sly being.

00:37:39.828 --> 00:37:47.178
Those who are very wicked in nature are also there, very nefarious people can also be there.
But they don’t have courage to do this work openly. They do this dirty work very secretly.

00:37:48.324 --> 00:37:56.564
Those people who are not satisfied in
this way are also wandering there only.

00:37:57.584 --> 00:38:03.544
Our place is beyond this. When we are
dead then we stay in collective conscious

00:38:03.569 --> 00:38:07.449
and we are waiting for the
day when we will get rebirth.

00:38:08.644 --> 00:38:13.294
We don’t believe that you wander
here and there with unsatisfied emotions.

00:38:13.294 --> 00:38:20.829
These wandering beings in [their] left side
are very bad and when they enter in our body

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:26.160
through our Agnya Chakra then a
person can get infected with diseases

00:38:26.385 --> 00:38:36.935
or becomes mad or many
other different diseases.

00:38:37.403 --> 00:38:46.633
All these diseases are of Ida Nadi and those diseases which
psychologist treats, are due to our left subconscious.

00:38:47.885 --> 00:38:55.815
So, our Freud Sir was only Intelligent according to me,
he was just having one eye and don’t have another eye.

00:38:55.815 --> 00:39:02.037
He just saw one side but he did not saw another side. He
used to say that, “It’s all conditionings and nothing else

00:39:02.171 --> 00:39:07.051
and as it starts only with sex.”
He brought all things in front of it.

00:39:09.066 --> 00:39:16.696
If he would have read at least little bit of Indian
‘Sexology’ then he would have improved little intelligent.

00:39:17.228 --> 00:39:23.218
But his vision was so much one sided, he just used to
see only one side and he himself was very disgusting.

00:39:23.218 --> 00:39:28.018
He was having bad relationship with his own
mother and that’s why he put forth all that filth.

00:39:28.319 --> 00:39:33.919
And this must happen because if psychologist all time
stays with mad people, then he himself will become mad.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.380
All that filth comes in him
that he sees in mad people.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:45.749
This maybe psychologist doesn’t know. And the one who has come with me
here, he is very, very good psychologist there, he himself told this.

00:39:46.192 --> 00:39:51.902
Because if somebody has got TB [tuberculosis] then we
understand that he has got TB, need to protect ourselves.

00:39:51.902 --> 00:39:55.591
But we don’t understand any way to protect
ourselves from these [dead] spirits, possessions.

00:39:55.591 --> 00:40:00.393
We meet them, we talk with them then it might
happen that we also take something from them

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:08.220
and due to this reason, they cannot cure many
people’s diseases because they cannot see them.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:14.684
This is very subtle thing. It resides inside us and
it is there, surely there, and this is settled in us.

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:21.559
Now if you go to right side then in right
side you reach in supra conscious area.

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:28.466
Then from there if you encroach beyond then
you reach in collective supra conscious area.

00:40:28.819 --> 00:40:36.029
At this place those people who are very ambitious
people stay there. They are very ambitious people

00:40:43.639 --> 00:40:50.439
those who always talk about future; When someone’s spirit
gets satisfied then they reach the future location.

00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:57.129
But as Hitler is dead, he must still be
there because he is still not satisfied.

00:40:57.385 --> 00:41:01.535
this place is made for
more ambitious people.

00:41:01.535 --> 00:41:05.659
When you go to supra conscious then one
of these gentlemen [Preit] enters in you.

00:41:07.197 --> 00:41:11.427
When these [dead] spirits enter
in you then they will drive you too.

00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:17.457
You will do all that a mad does.

00:41:17.555 --> 00:41:24.075
He will run around like a mad person. You will just see that either
he will get a heart attack or he will go mad. Then he gets adsorbed.

00:41:24.075 --> 00:41:32.156
You must have seen, many children, those studying and
after that secure 1st. class, 1st. position and then flat.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:39.247
After securing 1st. class, 1st, suddenly [Inaudible- fall
flat] This is quite common and its because of this only.

00:41:39.776 --> 00:41:44.746
Expecting too much of
a thing to the extreme …..

00:41:48.097 --> 00:41:52.207
If it’s too much [Inaudible];
This must not happen [Inaudible].

00:41:52.207 --> 00:41:59.994
‘Hatha Yoga’ or transcendental meditation is this only.
In this, only some ambitious spirit is implanted in you.

00:42:00.571 --> 00:42:06.211
Spirit named “Ram” is filled in you then you
start working. You start working very hard.

00:42:06.211 --> 00:42:11.400
They start working on you. In ten years, your condition will become
like a used up car making ‘khad khad khad’ sounds when running.

00:42:12.008 --> 00:42:16.898
Now, I have been to [Inaudible Milan], there they were the first
to do trans [transcendental meditation]. There who ever did trans

00:42:16.898 --> 00:42:21.375
Today if you go and see, you will hold
your ears not to involve [Inaudible-in it].

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:27.914
Because when you go in trans, you
enter in this Supra conscious area only.

00:42:27.914 --> 00:42:31.424
And these Spirits of Supra
conscious ride on you.

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:36.394
Spirit of Trans rides on you and
whatever is your own is all lost.

00:42:36.394 --> 00:42:41.439
You take somebody else’s load on yourself and roam around. Suppose
if Hitler comes and sits on you, what will be your condition?

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:49.389
It might be you become very successful person. All world may see you
as successful. But after ten years your condition will become such

00:42:49.389 --> 00:42:56.623
that you; not ten, hardly in your one year [Inaudible] Had there
been any Buddhist sitting, that could have been seen within one year.

00:42:56.757 --> 00:43:02.217
In your Delhi there was one ‘Sahab’. Last year when
we came, she came before us and started saying,

00:43:02.217 --> 00:43:08.327
“Mother, my condition is such that I have not stamina, I
tremble while walking; if there is fragrance, it suffocates.

00:43:08.494 --> 00:43:12.774
My condition is that I cannot
go through any temple or masjid.

00:43:12.774 --> 00:43:17.916
If anybody says name of God then my breathing becomes
faster. What is this?” I removed his possession,

00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:28.814
and then she is better. So this is Spirit. And so,
you need to understand that both the things are wrong.

00:43:30.668 --> 00:43:38.698
We have to be in centre, middle way. This has also been told by
Buddha. Same thing has been told by all, that we have to be in centre.

00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:43.919
Now about Nabhi chakra, that’s in the middle,
I told you yesterday for someone else.

00:43:43.919 --> 00:43:50.774
that Nabhi Chakra of our country is spoiled.
One thing about God [Inaudible] is that

00:43:51.244 --> 00:43:56.866
Why God must give you happiness
and peace, Why to give joy and wellness?

00:43:57.804 --> 00:44:01.437
You don’t have even seeking of Him.
You don’t even desire to know Him.

00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:05.283
You are wandering hither and thither, You don’t recognise
Him, you don’t want to know Him; Just loitering all around.

00:44:05.827 --> 00:44:11.157
I ask you on His behalf, “What
justice have you been doing to God?”

00:44:11.171 --> 00:44:17.921
He has created all this nature for you and you are just
fighting head-on. You are quarrelling among yourself.

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:21.755
Even two brothers cannot stay in peace
then why should God look after you?

00:44:21.755 --> 00:44:26.446
Whatever questions have popped
up are all human created questions.

00:44:26.446 --> 00:44:33.806
This is because human being itself has adopted demonic power in
him and forgetting all about God; then why should He help you.

00:44:33.806 --> 00:44:38.534
What is that for him? Today he has created you, tomorrow
he will destroy and will again create another world.

00:44:38.534 --> 00:44:46.085
He has no concern with you. It’s me only that I am Mother and feel
that, “No, children should be saved”, and this is going to happen.

00:44:46.085 --> 00:44:49.992
What do you think, that you will be sitting
relaxed? That thing is going to happen.

00:44:50.703 --> 00:44:57.753
It’s all right that now time has been given, now you get realized
then it’s all right, else Kalki incarnation is going to come.

00:44:57.753 --> 00:45:02.111
and when it will come, he will not see anybody,
he will not give realization to anybody,

00:45:02.111 --> 00:45:06.676
will not give lectures to anybody. Like me He is not
going to meddle with you. “Baba” settle, settle, settle.

00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:11.304
With one sword He will
just cut and finish you.

00:45:11.304 --> 00:45:15.654
And will a situation that you will
not understand that where you are.

00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:24.134
That’s why must understand that now last time has been given
to us and this is the last moment also and we should get it.

00:45:26.501 --> 00:45:31.291
Don’t spoil your life by treading on wrong
path, by hankering after wrong things;

00:45:31.348 --> 00:45:37.998
Because your life is very precious. Through so much difficulties you have
been created. See all chakras have been created by God Almighty within you.

00:45:38.022 --> 00:45:44.912
Firstly, beautiful centre like Mooladhara on which Shri
Ganesha is residing, then Kundalini that you call Mooladhara.

00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:52.000
Then after that the Swadishthana Chakra
due to which you can control whole nature.

00:45:52.122 --> 00:45:58.862
See when we were coming here these people told us that in
Delhi it’s raining a lot. I said, “Don’t worry let us reach.”

00:45:58.862 --> 00:46:06.069
Since the day we arrived rain has stopped.
Suddenly rain stopped. It’s not difficult work.

00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:11.827
We say that even to control sun and all that is not difficult
job. But human beings are very difficult to correct,

00:46:12.691 --> 00:46:20.521
very difficult. Most difficult thing is human being.
Sun, moon, stars all are under gesticulation of God.

00:46:20.521 --> 00:46:26.528
It’s no difficult task. But human beings who are
free, in front of them even God is also bowing down..

00:46:26.528 --> 00:46:31.203
How, by which way he should persuade you that,
“See how beautiful thing He has created within you?

00:46:31.222 --> 00:46:37.032
Through this beautiful thing achieve God, get joy through
this.” But human is not relieved for even 2 minutes

00:46:37.032 --> 00:46:43.116
that he will sit and settle in God, achieve
it, clear in it and give it to others.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:49.441
But they don’t have time though actually they always
have watch. For which purpose God has given you time?

00:46:49.616 --> 00:46:55.296
What for all secrets of nature
which you actually call as science,

00:46:55.296 --> 00:46:59.967
God has opened to tell you? From
where did you get all these powers?

00:46:59.967 --> 00:47:05.560
For what purpose you will save time? Everybody
will save time. We want to save time, what for?

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:14.159
They will say that, “We want to go to pub, that’s why we are saying
time.” What to say! By saving time we want to go to ball room for dancing.

00:47:14.738 --> 00:47:24.448
This time saving; You need to save time so that you can do meditation, settle in
meditation and achieve your Self; That’s what for God has given you all these powers.

00:47:24.913 --> 00:47:31.064
And above this you can see is Nabhi chakra about which I told
you yesterday that how much important is this Nabhi chakra.

00:47:31.286 --> 00:47:35.476
That’s why will not tell you more but human
being gets evolved through Nabhi only.

00:47:35.709 --> 00:47:41.939
When his vision goes to God, he gets his ascent
and then only his sight reaches Almighty.

00:47:42.049 --> 00:47:52.589
So long as his attention is always on money, status, politics,
on all lower-level things then Kundalini cannot rise.

00:47:52.623 --> 00:47:58.963
Now this chakra is very important
within us and it should be cherished.

00:47:58.963 --> 00:48:04.262
And this needs to be well preserved and understood, “How [Nabhi]
Chakra can be properly kept and what must be done for it”.

00:48:04.262 --> 00:48:07.699
And you should understand how your ‘Nabhi’ chakra is going to
work; you must talk to these people about it, they will tell you.

00:48:08.396 --> 00:48:15.516
On top of that, because it is a very necessary
chakra, it is specially created in us.

00:48:16.283 --> 00:48:27.203
When the role of uplift-ment was created in the ‘Nabhi’ chakra, it means
the role of uplift-ment in us, then you know that Dashavataran took place.

00:48:27.203 --> 00:48:34.677
Means one by one incarnations took place. As firstly fish
incarnation took place. Means initially fish came out.

00:48:34.677 --> 00:48:40.490
After fish, when fish touched land then became
reptile. Then incarnation of tortoise took place.

00:48:41.457 --> 00:48:48.397
All these things are in scriptures and in you have seen in
this also. In this way one by one creature were developed.

00:48:48.397 --> 00:48:53.269
Incarnation does not mean that they are
over, they come and evolve you. But this

00:48:53.269 --> 00:49:00.343
Life that evolves from partly form [anshswarup] of God and
tells you, guides you and he gets positioned within you.

00:49:00.903 --> 00:49:08.603
So from this, whatever incarnations took place mostly
took place in Void and from there they kept helping you.

00:49:10.257 --> 00:49:20.667
And since that time many people tried to achieve God but
every time the demonic or satanic people failed their efforts.

00:49:20.667 --> 00:49:30.231
At that time as you know Goddess ‘Shakti of God’ herself incarnated. Like this it is
told about 1000 incarnations took place, in Kalyuga lot many incarnations took place.

00:49:30.231 --> 00:49:41.362
And She did massive work of securing all those people who for their
ascent have been doing ‘Yagnya’ etc in ‘Void’. She protected them.

00:49:41.546 --> 00:49:49.996
Yagnyas were performed with the intention
to enlighten all 5 elements in nature.

00:49:49.996 --> 00:49:55.130
That’s why yagnyas were performed. Now there is no need to enlighten
these elements. All of them are already enlightened in you.

00:49:55.130 --> 00:50:00.002
For this only you get electicity
and you are able to use magnetism.

00:50:00.002 --> 00:50:05.881
Due to enlightenment of all these elements only
you are able to do agriculture and have all these

00:50:05.881 --> 00:50:13.823
new advancements like mass manufacturing materials
etc are also because all these enlightened elements.

00:50:13.823 --> 00:50:24.404
That’s why now there is need to go beyond all your
Dharma’s. You need to attain the extreme of your evolution.

00:50:24.546 --> 00:50:32.766
means you have to get introduced with your own Spirit. This is
your job. All other jobs are finished. Only this is last job.

00:50:33.516 --> 00:50:43.876
Now as I told you this Goddess got incarnated for your protection and she has
1000 names and about them it’s and whatever is expressed for her will be less

00:50:43.876 --> 00:50:55.173
You all know how important is the Goddess divine powers, how it’s
fame, dynamism and how subtle is it? It’s not easy to express.

00:50:55.173 --> 00:51:04.290
Because it sees all that which is not in you and its so
difficult to express it. Means it’s so active, so subtle,

00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:14.685
And its so loving that if one of finger of that is moved
and then all world will be moved, so much power it beholds.

00:51:16.142 --> 00:51:23.202
This Goddess took incarnated many times and
destroyed demons so that you can move around freely.

00:51:24.159 --> 00:51:32.509
Now in the right side of Heart Chakra, in the centre
of it is the place of Jagdamba who is your Mother.

00:51:33.305 --> 00:51:41.355
When you forget that Jagdamba is your Mother
then sense of insecurity gets developed in you,

00:51:42.188 --> 00:51:50.888
and when this happens then you get disease of breathing.
Disease of breathing which is called as asthma and all that.

00:51:52.351 --> 00:51:58.841
So, asthma and in case of women they get breast
cancer. This is also caused due to this centre.

00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:08.081
This sense of insecurity is developed because this abode of Shri Jagdamba
remains destitute and it is cured only with awakening of this abode of Jagdamba.

00:52:09.644 --> 00:52:15.544
All such diseases like lungs cancer, etc. are cured due to awakening of this centre.
Whatever human diseases like cancer etc get cured by awakening the place of Jagdamba.

00:52:16.565 --> 00:52:24.185
But till human being don’t know that we have abode of
Shri Jagdamba in us. To know all means to enlighten.

00:52:24.271 --> 00:52:31.761
I don’t mean that to know means knowledge. There is a lot of difference
in between knowledge and enlightenment. When one gets enlightened

00:52:31.808 --> 00:52:36.188
that Jagdamba resides in us,
then only his this Chakra gets alright.

00:52:36.792 --> 00:52:47.372
The chakra which has been shown on its right side is chakra of Shri
Rama. Here [we] have incarnation of Shri Rama. This is place of father.

00:52:47.707 --> 00:52:56.297
On left side this there is abode of Jagdamba. In the central is abode of Jagdamba
and on left side is abode Shri Parvati who is our Mother. This is abode of mother.

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:04.240
That’s the place of Mother, which is on the left. If you have
a catch on your left then if questioned about your mother

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:08.190
then will get to know that either your mother
is sick or she has been dead or on death bed.

00:53:08.373 --> 00:53:12.713
If your left is absolutely still, means
you going to have heart trouble.

00:53:13.972 --> 00:53:18.752
If left gets a little catch, then I
see that you have heart disease.

00:53:20.044 --> 00:53:26.394
After this the next chakra/centre which is above is
very important chakra, is called as Vishuddhi Chakra

00:53:26.888 --> 00:53:31.788
and through this 16000 nadis or channels pass
from the head. This is the abode of Virata.

00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:41.618
Which is called by primordial master which is all this is
primordial being and in which you all are these small, small cells

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:52.290
which is called as mind in English [Inaudible]. This is
that big wire that God has inserted with in and resonated.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:57.350
When these cells are awakened
then this Great Body is also awakened.

00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:04.322
The Incarnation of God or Goddess
who created you as human being and

00:54:04.322 --> 00:54:12.333
now you know Him and achieve Him. This is
your enlightenment. This your creator and

00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:16.543
For the reason this Chakra has importance,
specially from Sahaja Yoga point of view.

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:25.179
This Vishuddhi Chakra is the place of Shri Krishna. We
cannot understand Shri Krishna now as He is ‘Almighty’.

00:54:25.632 --> 00:54:34.582
Shri Krishna was very Great Diplomat. If you want
to learn from him learn politics and diplomacy.

00:54:35.261 --> 00:54:39.263
The complete Geeta is full of His
diplomacy, that you can understand.

00:54:39.263 --> 00:54:45.393
Because he was such a Great Diplomat that he thought
that these are foolish and these foolish people

00:54:45.393 --> 00:54:51.959
cannot understand straight way if you tell them [cannot take out ghee with straight
finger so it’s better to bend it]. That’s why he told you all things in puzzled ways.

00:54:51.959 --> 00:54:56.427
This I will tell you in brief as there
are many things to be told now.

00:54:56.631 --> 00:55:04.361
Krishna has already told you in Geeta To
find him, know him, and for that (unclear).

00:55:05.072 --> 00:55:13.002
You just find yourself, know in your quiet mind,
Know the people above you - in the first chapter

00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:23.897
This is also extreme because if he could understood (unintelligible) then he said to Him,
"You are saying know yourself, on the other side saying fight, I am not understanding."

00:55:24.574 --> 00:55:30.304
What he meant was that, when you have become a witness. Then
what is (unclear - lawful) and what (unlawful -unclear)?

00:55:30.304 --> 00:55:37.356
But when Arjun asked such a question, he responded with great respect as a father.
Diplomacy has been done with him which (unclear - should?) also be done with you.

00:55:37.436 --> 00:55:43.460
We are Mother and hence we are telling you clearly that you are
being befooled, because if you want to be an idiot, then what?

00:55:43.618 --> 00:55:54.858
Father's way is different, Mother's is different. He
fooled you in such a way; Take it that there is a son,

00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:01.740
and he is sitting in the horse-cart and wants to drive it.
And the horse tugged behind, then the father came and said,

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:07.975
"Son, your work will be done only when you tug the horse in front, only then
will your cart move." So the son said, "No, I will do it by keeping him behind."

00:56:08.885 --> 00:56:16.365
So the father came and explained to him, he did not understand, so he said, "Okay,
You keep driving, keep driving all the time but keep your mind on the horse."

00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:22.189
What he said to you that was to
keep your attention on the soul.

00:56:22.189 --> 00:56:27.116
Whatever deeds have been done, they will have done that
one condition. Reach up to. I am very dizzy (indistinct)

00:56:27.116 --> 00:56:31.907
Whatever deeds were got done; is a great confusion.
[Inaudible] Keep whole buden on God. This cannot happen.

00:56:31.954 --> 00:56:39.324
This diplomacy, that puts absurd conditions - absurd conditions.
If you think that whatever we do, we are great karma yogis.

00:56:39.324 --> 00:56:47.372
Leave God alone, you have no faith in Him. Keep doing
it. It can never be yours because you have been befooled.

00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:54.201
As long as you haven’t attained yoga, you will do any
work. Never think that you have got any result from it.

00:56:54.201 --> 00:57:01.494
When you ascent then you will see another kind
of The language is 'happening' or 'coming'.

00:57:01.494 --> 00:57:07.337
Speak in third language 'It is rising, it is running' It
is happening', 'Kundalini is rising, they have transcended.

00:57:07.337 --> 00:57:10.819
Even if you have your own son, you will still
say, "Mother, what to do, he cannot ascent."

00:57:12.135 --> 00:57:17.965
Whoever has to get it, they get it and who can’t be they
can’t get. 'Karmanye Vaadhika Raste Faleshu Maha Kadachin'.

00:57:17.965 --> 00:57:22.675
All this is done in Sahaja Yoga (unclear) that
Karma: Look, we are raising this Kundalini.

00:57:22.675 --> 00:57:28.451
Brought it till the top, then Kundalini dropped. what do
we do? If Kundalini does not hold then what should we do?

00:57:28.451 --> 00:57:38.437
Faleshu Kadachin. Now leave your work to God because It
does happen. There is no question of its being, it can’t be.

00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:46.823
You have come in inaction now. Things are flowing from
your hands. There is the sun, sitting in inaction but

00:57:46.823 --> 00:57:50.624
Lighting the whole earth that you are
seing, you can see greenery all around.

00:57:50.624 --> 00:57:57.582
Its for Him that every leaf is greener but
He too is in inaction. Inactively active.

00:57:58.148 --> 00:58:05.138
Himself is inactive and active from within. Seeing
own inactivity and releasing from inactivity.

00:58:06.033 --> 00:58:13.833
This can happen only after ascent but When
(unintelligible) happened. keep running (unintelligible)

00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:18.210
But Mother, its different. She
said, "Son is now tired of running.”

00:58:18.481 --> 00:58:26.831
" (Unclear) This is what I will
say, (Unclear) this is the difference.

00:58:27.639 --> 00:58:35.529
even then what to do? (Unclear)That
thing is something (unclear).

00:58:36.929 --> 00:58:46.037
It is the same in Bhakti Yoga, Bhakti Yoga also.
In Bhakti Yoga it is said Pushpam, Phalam, Toyam -

00:58:46.037 --> 00:58:52.732
Whatever flowers, fruits and water you give us
We will accept that; But what will you give us?

00:58:52.856 --> 00:59:01.436
So they say in it that [Inaudible] - this is
too much, see, no one has paid attention to

00:59:01.436 --> 00:59:05.523
the amazing word that has been used, everyone
is listening to the sermon on Geeta (unclear)

00:59:05.523 --> 00:59:12.435
There is a very good word which you did not understand.This
is his wonder. But what does the word 'do exclusive devotion'

00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:19.091
mean exclusive? when there will be no one second.
Means, it will happen only after you have transcended.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:26.110
This is the catch. Do exclusive devotion. How to
do exclusive? Unless you are you cannot do it.

00:59:27.447 --> 00:59:36.147
Absurd condition should be imposed, this is diplomacy. This is it. Do any thing in
such a way that the one who has the abnormal condition will get confused by the other.

00:59:37.951 --> 00:59:43.681
Unless there is exclusive devotion, your devotion
will be No. You cannot be exclusive unless you ascent.

00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:49.373
The meaning of your giving is that
yes, you get realised This is its point.

00:59:49.373 --> 00:59:54.062
If you understand that even in Geeta Krishna
has described the whole Sahaja Yoga only.

00:59:54.142 --> 00:59:59.832
This leela they have done is, in this leela
In that - Radhaji was actually Adishakti -

00:59:59.832 --> 01:00:04.816
When from the river – Yamuna did they came from, the whole
water vibrated. Now when the Gopis went there to draw water,

01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:13.281
Krishna used to bang them with little stones. That vibrated water
used to flow down on the entire Kundalini, ‘dhud, dhud, dhu’'.

01:00:13.303 --> 01:00:17.703
He used to raise it up. look at His
amazing feats (unclear) since childhood.

01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:28.479
When he was the youngest, just four years old, he hide the clothes of
Gopis; And then also He used to awaken their Kundalini, sitting up there.

01:00:30.139 --> 01:00:35.219
And were looking where the Kundalini was;
What it is? Did such people sit there then?

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:40.082
At that time someone in Gokul would say, "Brother Sit like
this" and give a lecture, would anyone listen (unintelligible)?

01:00:40.215 --> 01:00:50.225
Raas, that too was this. 'Ra' meaning power and 'S' means ‘with’. ‘Ras’,
‘ras' meaning 'Ra' means Shakti was made to dance holding her hand in hand.

01:00:50.225 --> 01:00:57.777
One may get tired while dancing (unclear); But
then kept dancing and raising the Kundalini.

01:00:59.037 --> 01:01:03.002
as long as He needed,
used His this power

01:01:04.434 --> 01:01:07.024
Whatever He did
was all Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:07.776 --> 01:01:16.486
When Ram also took Sita along with him without wearing shoes on
feet, that too, so that the whole of Bharatvarsh be vibrated.

01:01:16.486 --> 01:01:24.832
roamed bare feet, made everyone vibrate; Created this whole drama.
What has happened is that we awaken our land by walking on our land.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:29.290
Came eight thousand (hundred) years ago.
When the ime came today, when we came, we saw

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.358
that you all are now English.
What to do with the British now?

01:01:35.951 --> 01:01:43.241
All those feelings are gone, all that
beauty is gone, that simplicity is finished,

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.810
that purity is gone, now we Holding
our head wondering what to do now?

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:50.971
Now when the time has come to offer the
urn, you have made yours this condition.

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:58.865
Even now in our villages by the grace of God
simplicity is quite good and you guys too

01:01:58.865 --> 01:02:03.683
If understand this thing and get rooted in
it, Sahaja Yoga can be established very well.

01:02:05.982 --> 01:02:15.022
Doing one thing (unintelligible), you will be
surprised, how the whole surroundings have changed.

01:02:15.584 --> 01:02:27.124
Now if asked whether communism or democracy is better?
Capitalism is good, or communism is good (unclear)?

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:32.630
I said that this biggest capitalism is that first
your power has awakened, all your own wealth.

01:02:32.638 --> 01:02:39.578
And without giving you do not get peace, this is the biggest communism.
You are not going to get peace without giving, this is your communism.

01:02:39.578 --> 01:02:43.798
And both things we
get in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:43.798 --> 01:02:50.550
In this one gets joy in just keep giving. Then there is no fun
in how much money you have saved, how much assets you have,

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:54.330
how many things do you have, but there the
question is to how many did you transcend?

01:02:56.031 --> 01:03:03.191
Enjoys this, remains busy in this, in giving vibrations
and in giving he accumulates through meditation.

01:03:04.011 --> 01:03:10.961
The entire health of a person changes from top
to bottom because this is a living process.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:15.322
Just like if a tree gets
damaged, it may be set by human.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:21.770
But if its upper globe, you may understand- If
it’s pillar gets damaged, you can not fix it.

01:03:22.357 --> 01:03:27.207
But you can fix a tree because
you are alive; But completely

01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:33.223
one must understand and grasp what is important.
One should not waste one's time on useless things.

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:38.008
Just today a lady had come, her healthwas so
bad. I said, "What do you do?" She said, "Upvas."

01:03:38.008 --> 01:03:43.660
We said, "Are you crazy?" When you went it was all good.
God created everything. What is the point in fasting?

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:52.115
Some fall ill due to overeating and some due to fasting. Oho, What
is kept in it? Stay in the middle. No one should go to extremes.

01:03:52.115 --> 01:03:58.979
Some religious person will rise beyond ‘Gunatit’ and then when
Kundalini will cross the Vishuddhi Chakra and reach Agnya Chakra,

01:03:58.979 --> 01:04:03.655
then you will know that you
are going into thoughtless state.

01:04:03.914 --> 01:04:13.004
I have given a lot of speeches today and you know that for the last two or three
months I have been giving speeches three-three, four-four times continuously.

01:04:13.004 --> 01:04:20.665
And very successful Vidya. Tomorrow there is no program here but in the
evening I will try because I will tell you completely about these chakras

01:04:20.727 --> 01:04:25.557
and what are the benefits of Sahaja Yoga, I
will tell you about this also in the evening.

01:04:25.592 --> 01:04:31.042
Hope you all will come. Let's meditate for a while
because only in meditation there is achievement

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:36.991
and in achievement itself lies all its main reasons
and the main purpose, everything else is fine.

01:04:37.489 --> 01:04:42.909
However, even through speech, your Kundalini may
be awakened a little and that's why we do it.

01:04:42.909 --> 01:04:50.873
and hopefully you get it and once you get it you settle in it - it's
not that came for two minutes and left; This is not a movie show,

01:04:50.873 --> 01:04:56.349
or a play, or anything like that That you
have gone and gone - one has to settle in it.

01:04:56.349 --> 01:05:03.660
You yourself are an actor in this. For an actor Its not that
he does it only for one show. You yourself are on the stage.

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:07.204
The stage is completely readied
for you. You come and act.

01:05:07.204 --> 01:05:13.189
It is not that you came and saw, directed good things
and went away. You yourself get on the stage and work.

01:05:19.037 --> 01:05:26.387
For the evening after today's speech (unintelligible - meditation
will be at 5 o'clock?) and we will finish by 7 o'clock.

01:05:27.703 --> 01:05:31.363
Because I have to go from here,
will take a lot (unclear - time?)

01:05:31.363 --> 01:05:37.801
Although we do not wear the clock and especially in this we
don't pay attention; our clock is always in reverse mode,

01:05:37.844 --> 01:05:41.684
and our all this keeps (unclear)
happening by devoting to this.

01:05:41.684 --> 01:05:47.562
Free lancer, what to do? all in the same way things
keep going and this is how things get accomplished.

01:05:47.562 --> 01:05:52.947
So please excuse us if we ever come late, that’s
necessary because its auspicious time is late.

01:05:52.947 --> 01:05:59.323
Our events are done at the auspicious time. The one in which we were right now (unintelligible)
- One, we also have fifty programs.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:05.763
One Sahab started saying, there is a sir, "There is a very good land at the
sea beach; Mother, it will be very nice there, but just take a look once."

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:11.630
And on the same day a gentleman organized a puja asking everyone to come and
attend the puja. It was his birthday that day and there were many programs

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:17.266
And that Sahab took me somewhere near the sea. while walking there
for three- four miles they broke some of our legs ( got tired)

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:26.400
and after that it was too late to come back. We had come comfortably. When he came
to say that, everyone was sitting, it was 2 o'clock. The puja started at 2:30.

01:06:26.753 --> 01:06:32.873
So everyone said, "Mataji, puja is taking place at 2.30, now when will we have
dinner?" I said, “What if there is no food for a day? What disaster has happened?”

01:06:32.873 --> 01:06:37.759
I said, "Okay, find out when you yourself were born."
Then he said, "I don't know." We said, "Just find out."

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:42.322
You were born at 2:30, that's why it was 2:30, did
the puja. And it was found out that it was 2:30.

01:06:42.322 --> 01:06:48.409
So we take all the Panchang when we move and And
that ephemeris is so good that its so accurate.

01:06:48.831 --> 01:06:59.411
Just now someone
(unclear) asked that (unclear)

01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:07.872
That day is ‘Amavasya’ [No Moon day], or it is ‘Navami’ yes, it
is Navami. Yes, So he said, "Start the havan in the morning."

01:07:07.872 --> 01:07:13.493
We said, "Yes, yes will, will," like this Kept postponing,
kept postponing. While doing so it was four o'clock.

01:07:13.983 --> 01:07:18.493
So he said, "Mataji we are thinking
of performing Havan since morning."

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:22.414
I said, "What, you guys will meditate, Meditate,
what kind of problem is there on this day?"

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:27.258
Then I said, "Okay, find out when, at what time did Navami
start ?" Because the intention was to do it on Navami.

01:07:27.258 --> 01:07:33.437
So he said, "From four o'clock." I said, "Just see." We have
no will plan. Say us to read any almanac, we don't know.

01:07:33.437 --> 01:07:38.200
But everything remains our calendar, we follow our
own Panchang and you people should also learn this.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:49.495
many resolutions then 'Sankalp Vikalp Karoti'. such people get
hurt And then people start saying, "Mataji, look at our...."
