00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.400
It is really very kind of you to have invited
Me to this beautiful meeting of such seekers

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.650
who look so truthful. When I read about Unity
Church and what they were doing, I felt this

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.970
is the place where it is going to trigger
first, because here founder himself was a

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.989
realized soul. He was a realized soul. But
perhaps he did not realize that others were

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.989
not realized up to his level and whatever
he talked was the truth, nothing but the truth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But you cannot imagine about truth, you have
to become, becoming is the main point. Unless

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.289
and until you become the truth, whatever you
talk about it becomes talk, talk, talk. And

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.820
we have had talks after talks, after talks.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.820
Now the time has come for us to become. What
do we become? What do we have to expect after

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.420
Self-Realization. As he has told you, I would
like to tell you this way that we have heard

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.899
that God's love is all-pervading. The divine
love is all pervading energy. We've heard

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.460
about it, we've read about it. Now what happens
to us, that we are awakened in such a manner

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.460
that we started feeling that power. Our sensitivity
or our awareness becomes so enlightened that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.219
we start feeling that divine power around
us. It exists. For example if I say there

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.069
is big music going on here, and big plays
and dramas going on here, you won't believe

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.980
till I put a television here and say, "Now
see for yourself." In the same this all-pervading

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.980
power is still imaginary for us, or we can
say is not our own experience.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.900
Still people believed it because it was told
by great people, great incarnations like Christ.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.170
But what it means, what it is, we have not
felt it, and that's the first thing that should

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.049
happen to you, is to feel that. That means
that our feeling is not so much yet developed,

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.049
or is not enlightened, or is not evolved to
that extent that we can feel. In our evolution,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.709
say from animals to this stage, how many feelings
we have developed, which the animals don't

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.400
have. For example if you want to take an animal
through a dirty lane, he doesn't feel any

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.870
dirt, or filth, or doesn't smell anything.
He just walks through. Take any horse or any

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.870
dog they have no problems. But for human beings
to go through that will be an impossibility.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.379
Our feelings, experiencing power is so much
developed that we can feel the beauty, we

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.569
can feel the colors, we can see the beauty
of this place. They cannot feel.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.569
But now the feeling that has to come to us
is the feeling of that all pervading power,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.730
the divine power which in Sanskrit is called
as Brahma. That divine power is the desire

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:02.290
of God. God desired because He loved us. He
is complete. He need not have created us at

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:12.079
all. What was the need for Him to create us?
But He's love, and He's compassion. And He

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.930
wanted to give His compassion, to express
His compassion, and that's why He created

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.670
us with what care and with what delicacy.
That one has to just see. We take ourselves

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.560
for granted, our evolution for granted, everything
for granted.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.070
As he said that you did not pay anything to
become human beings, you did not pay for anything.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.160
For example everyday, you see the flowers
becoming fruits. How much do you pay to the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.660
tree for it? You see a seed sprouting, how
much do you pay to the seed for getting sprouted?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.380
It's all so spontaneous, it's living. And
we are talking here about the living God,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.380
who lives, who does all the living things.
What do we do? We do nothing. We do just dead

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.410
work. Like something is dead, supposing a
tree is dead, we make a chair, we can go,

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.160
"We have made a chair." It's a dead from the
dead. We have not done something living so

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.160
far. Have we been able to convert even one
flower into a fruit? And these thousands and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.760
thousands, and billions and billions of things
are happening around us. That's the work of

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.640
the living God.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.640
And also this evolution that has to go to
its epitome now, to its last stage that is

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.640
your Self-Realization. Supposing I start collecting
some nuts and bolts and start collecting some

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.130
sort of a machinery. You will say, "What this
machinery is meant for? Why are you making

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.180
it, why this evolution? Why did we evolve
to this stage of a human being? What was the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.020
need? What was the purpose? Anybody would
ask, "Why? Why there should be a machine made

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.120
like this?" And that question is not asked
by scientists so far because they have no

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.350
answer for it. They are very honest. Because
they have no answer, for the 'why' they don't

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.310
ask that question. Whatever is presented to
them they see it and say this is it, this

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.530
is so, so.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.530
Now to get to God you don't have to go to
Saturn or don't have to go to Moon, is within.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.440
He's within you, expressed within you, in
your heart as spirit. Is all written in the

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.090
Bible. I mean I am not telling something new.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.980
Christ has said, "You are to be born again."

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.690
When I came nine years back in America, I
gave speeches where I said, "You have to be

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.180
born again." And it's a happening, it's a
becoming, it should happen, it's actualization,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.750
is a real baptism that you should feel the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.110
your head. It's actually should happen to
you.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.970
So they took over and they said, "All right,
we are born again,"

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:04.470
Again self-certification. Is all certifying
yourself 'we are born again, we are this,

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:10.780
we are that.'You are nothing but your spirit,
and you have to become the spirit. Unless

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.650
and until you have become it all this certificate
is not going to help you nor you are going

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.840
to feel satisfied because you are seekers.
You are a special category of people born

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:27.150
on this earth at this special time. This is
a very special time, is an extremely special,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.770
because this is the blossom time, and this
is the last judgment.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.330
Only through Kundalini awakening you can judge
yourself otherwise there is no way of finding

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.330
out. Because when the Kundalini awakens, which
is settled down here in the triangular bone

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.150
then your centers get awakened. When they
get awakened you get this special sensitivity

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:59.140
even on your fingertips. Now these five fingers,
six and seven all of them get enlightened.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:05.860
Once they get enlightened, you can feel not
only the all pervading power but you become,

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:11.490
as he said, the collective conscious being.
You become again I say you become. Is not

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.890
that I say, "We are all brothers and sisters.
We must love each other." It's not that way.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.000
But you just become. Means you start feeling
the another person within yourself.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So much so I was coming to Houston. And there
is an Indian Sahaja Yogini who has come from

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:28.960
India.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.680
And she told Me, "Mother, why the heart is
catching so much in Houston?"

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.330
I said, "Do you know there are heart specialists
here who transplant heart who have got...

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:44.330
Also there is Dr. Kuri who is doing operations
on the heart patients, and there must be many

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.449
heart patients in this place. And that's why
you are catching on the heart."

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:49.819
And she said, "It has become stiff my finger
is."

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:53.370
I said, "All right. There are mantras by which
you can put it right."

00:08:53.370 --> 00:09:00.060
But it affects everyone, and everyone can
feel it within themselves. You become the

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.759
other person.

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:04.740
Like people say, "Mother, you take money or
what?"

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.019
I said, "This is something one should understand,
you are part and parcel of My being. I can

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:15.639
feel you within Myself. Now supposing My finger,
is something wrong with My finger. If I try

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:22.639
to help it, am I helping anybody other? Who
is the other? Who is the other person?"

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:28.800
That's the thing. Is a real unity, is the
complete integration of being when you feel

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.870
everyone within yourself. You start feeling
them on your fingers. You start feeling yourself

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.490
also within yourself, trying to know what's
wrong with you. But in that case you don't

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.720
feel bad. You don't feel bad at all that you
have this problem or that problem because

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.930
you are no more involved. "

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:55.399
Today I'm just introducing this method which
I called as Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja, Saha means

00:09:55.399 --> 00:10:02.399
"with," ja means "born," spontaneous yoga.
Means it is a in-born right of every seeker

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:09.439
to get this union. Now today it has reached
the stage of Maha Yoga, means thousands can

00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:14.899
get realization. It's a fact, it's a truth,
people can get it. But it's nothing so difficult.

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:20.990
You see, when the blossom time comes how many
flowers become fruits. In the beginning may

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.259
be only one flower or two flowers, but when
the blossom time comes people have to see

00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:32.920
that. And in the same way you have to face
that a time has to come where thousands must

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.240
get realization, millions must get it; billions
must get it. As soon as possible, it is for

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:46.240
you. Please try to spread this message that
you are to become the spirit. This is a very

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:55.350
important time which we miss. For example
say our machine is not yet connected. Say

00:10:56.449 --> 00:11:03.350
a television is not connected what's the use
of moving the knobs? You won't get anything.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:10.259
On the contrary, you may spoil the television.
Or say a telephone, when we pray to God also

00:11:10.259 --> 00:11:12.069
we telephone without connection.

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:19.069
We have to have the connection. That's very
important. And that's what it was when Christ

00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:25.160
said that you are to be born again. As it
is, you know, Christ was not allowed to live

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:32.160
more than three and half years in that horrible
country. He was crucified for saying what?

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:38.430
He told the truth. He just told the truth
that you have to become the spirit, which

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.110
is a fact; you have to become the spirit.
I mean it is such a simple thing to understand

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.509
that we have not yet found out our absolute.
We do not know why are we here, what is our

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:54.019
absolute sense. Unless and until you find
your absolute, you will live in relativity.

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:57.930
You don't know whether this person is right
or that person is right; whether he is a saint,

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:03.790
or he is a satanic force, or what sort of
a vibrations he has got. Even to such an extent

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.749
that I was surprised, in Spain that some people
told us that for us vibrations means heat.

00:12:09.749 --> 00:12:16.629
I said, "Any machine which it goes out, creates
heat, friction, it creates heat. How did you

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:17.879
believe that it is heat?"

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:20.220
They said, "You feel very heated up."

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:27.220
To understand one thing mentally is different
than to understand it spiritually. Spiritually

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.449
means you become the spirit, the absolute.
There is no other opinion about it. For example,

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:39.910
there is a gentleman sitting here, and you
get ten children who are realized souls. There

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.160
are many realized souls these days born in
America; I must tell you. Many children are

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.730
born realized. And those children if you put
them together and ask them what's wrong with

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:54.089
this person, they will all raise this finger,
saying this is the finger, that's burning.

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.399
It's objective, just they say this is the
finger that's burning. Even if you close their

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:02.879
eyes, they'll say the same thing. There cannot
be two opinions about that person, and that

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:09.879
means he's suffering from the trouble that
is in this center called as cervical plexus.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.370
You see this one in Sanskrit is called as
'Vishuddhi Charka'. But in the gross it manifests

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:24.329
as cervical plexus. Now in the universe, America
is placed at this point. is a very important

00:13:24.329 --> 00:13:30.990
point because it has sixteen sub plexuses.
And you'll be amazed that the Saturn, the

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:37.360
Saturn is the body of this plexus, Saturn.
And now they have discovered that it has got

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.300
sixteen planets, and one that was caught up
by them, even the ring and all that is already

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.910
told about this. So all these things they're
finding out was found out long time back and

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.079
was described from a subtler level.

00:13:49.079 --> 00:13:56.050
Now this is a very, very important thing one
has to know that America itself God has created

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.869
with a special purpose. Abraham Lincoln and
all these people, great people who talked

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:08.730
about the fraternity, and the collectivity,
and all that. Because this is the center of

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.749
collectivity, this is the center where people
feel the collectivity. Even your Unity Church

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:20.749
is the outcome of that unconscious guiding
that you have to become the collective beings.

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:28.769
And this collective being is placed here at
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is important because

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:36.329
it has got sixteen sub plexuses and that controls
all our lymphatic systems, and our ears, eyes,

00:14:38.019 --> 00:14:43.569
nose, and all these important thing, and neck
also. Also from here arises the ego and the

00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:49.660
superego which is shown from there. But actually
they start coming up from here. When man raised

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:56.170
his head from animal stage like this, this
center started developing in a very peculiar

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:03.170
way. And in that condition this ego and superego
started evolving and forming a cup like this.

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:10.259
About this I'm going to tell you tomorrow,
all about these centers, and about the chakras,

00:15:10.259 --> 00:15:11.230
and all that.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:17.920
But today I want to tell you about the truth.
The truth as it is that God loved us, in His

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.509
divine love He created us. And first thing
that He has produced, or first thing that

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:30.509
He created for us is His divine love, this
all pervading power. And that divine power

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:38.129
also resided within us as this Kundalini.
Now this power within us is the power of desire

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:50.749
to be one with God, which is not yet manifested.
It is called as a sleeping desire, or we can

00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:59.929
say a sleeping energy because it has not yet
manifested. Supposing I create a machinery

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:06.929
and do not put to the mains, it doesn't work.
So though I've put all my effort and everything

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:12.860
to create the machinery, unless and until
I put it to the mains it is still in a sleeping

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:18.449
state. So it is also called as a residual
energy, meaning it has created the whole universe

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:24.199
of the human beings but it has not been yet
manifested. That's why it is called as a residual

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:27.149
energy. This energy is within us.

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:32.850
Now I would say that when I say something
to you or if I tell you something, you should

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:38.410
not also take Me for granted because I may
be telling you lies, gossip But that doesn't

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.269
mean that you should deny Me. Like a scientist,
you should have an open mind when you come

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:49.040
here. It's an hypothesis for you. And once
the hypothesis is proved then you have to

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:55.139
accept it. And that's what one should come
with that attitude. I would not say that people

00:16:55.139 --> 00:17:02.129
have ego or rationality too much, but it should
be logical. Logically you must reach a point

00:17:02.129 --> 00:17:08.350
to understand that there are very many things
we do not understand. For example, medical

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:15.350
science cannot explain that the law is, the
health of a person or a human being as he

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:26.959
is always reacts to any foreign thing that
enters into the body, anything that enters

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:34.380
into the body. And when a lady conceives the
fetus is not thrown out. Not only but it is

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:45.130
nurtured and thrown out at the right time
when it is [mature?], when it is perfectly

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:51.480
matured enough to get out from the mother's
womb. How it happens they cannot explain.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.870
Even they say that acetylcholine and adrenalin,
these are two chemicals, ordinary chemicals

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:02.340
as you know as all chemicals are. But in the
human body they cannot say why they augment

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:09.330
and why they relax. They cannot explain the
mode of action of these two. They cannot explain.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:14.680
Psychology, now take psychology. I mean science
has created the stage for Sahaja Yoga. It

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.770
has created because they cannot jump on to
it, so they have definitely created a state

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:26.290
from where somebody has to tell them how to
jump. Psychology now for example Jung, a person

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:33.290
of his caliber, went all out to find out what
was universal unconscious. And he studied

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:40.490
so many dreams and so many patients and found
out that there is an universal unconscious

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:49.660
which sends dreams which gives us universal
symbols. Whether you are in India or here

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:57.210
or anywhere else you get the same symbols.
For example, he said that if you see a particular

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:04.210
type of triangle which is downward facing,
the apex is downward then it means that you'll

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.580
be murdered. If you see, the same triangle
upward that means you will murder someone.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:17.580
So the unconscious is giving you a guidance.
He also said very clearly how he treated some

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:25.490
patients with this understanding that there
was a lady who came to see him, and the daughter

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.970
was with her.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:33.930
And she said that, "I always dream," the daughter
said, "that my mother is a witch while my

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:40.930
mother is very kind to me, I don't know how
to understand this dream that says that my

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.740
mother is a witch, and she is just [draining?]
me?"

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.480
So he studied her and he asked the mother,
"Do you spoil your daughter very much?"

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.340
She said, "Yes, I give her lots of money,
and I give her everything, and I give her

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.120
all the freedom, and I say, 'Do what you like
with yourself', I'm not bothered about her."

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.110
And the daughter was very young about 15 years
of age. So the unconscious was giving the

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:09.640
warning to the daughter say that, "Do not
take to these things, be careful. If she's

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.420
spoiling you, be careful."

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:17.000
Then another dream, just to match with it,
he said, "There was a gentleman who always

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.880
saw in his dream that he's bowing to his son,
all the time bowing to his son." And like

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.930
a king the son was sitting, and he was just
going and bowing to him."

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.070
So he came to him and told him, "I don't know
why I get such a dream."

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.570
He said, "What is your relation with your
son?"

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:39.270
He said, "The son is just, I would say because
he was born to my first wife, and my second

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:45.360
wife is against him, and that's not good relationship,
and you see I cannot afford to be very friendly

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.310
with him.," and all sorts of things he, the
relationship was not so good.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:56.310
So then he said, "That's the thing that your
son is very much liked by God. He is a saint.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.150
He is a good person. And why you are troubling
him? So the unconscious giving you all the

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.630
time the information that you just don't do
that."

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.610
And that's how he calculated what kind of
a symbol expresses what. And it was amazing,

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:17.480
though he got his realization very late in
life, the way he discovered that there is

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.920
universal unconscious.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.440
This universal unconscious is nothing but
this all-pervading power. Now it is unconscious,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.690
means it is not in our central nervous system.
We are not conscious of it. So we have to

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:35.140
be conscious of it. How do we get conscious
of it is that, first we have to get connected

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:41.170
to our Spirit because spirit is the expression
of that universal unconscious within us or

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:46.640
you can say the link. Unless and until you
get your Self-Realization you cannot be linked,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.580
you cannot be linked with this universal power
which is within us as Kundalini and which

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.960
is without all over.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:02.960
It is most surprising to understand that God
who has created us with such care with such

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:10.070
love, especially as a human being which is
the most beautiful thing God has created.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:15.250
We may or may not think so. We may not. We
may have self-pity; we may have guilt, all

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.770
these nonsensical ideas. But you don't know.
You're special thing that God has created.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:26.220
And on top of that the highest human being
are not these politicians, or these great

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:33.010
successes, and geniuses, and all that but
who? These are the seekers because they have

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.940
to enter into the kingdom of God. It is their
right first to enter into the kingdom of God.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:44.940
They are a very, very special category. And
this is very well described by a great poet

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:52.670
William Blake, who says that these are men
of God. And he described the modern times

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.310
and Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:01.320
He says, "These men of God will be born in
those days, and they will become prophets,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:07.060
and they will have powers to make others prophets."
And that's the thing he said.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:13.860
Then when you go to any seeking or any one
you must know, "Have you become your own master?"

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:20.130
You must have the mastery. Supposing you want
to learn a car driving, a simple thing like

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:25.360
that, you should know how to drive the car.
Supposing you go to somebody for any seeking,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.160
you must know, "Have you been able to drive
yourself all right towards seeking?" For example,

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.750
I've seen people who just start jumping. When
I went to India, there was gentleman who was

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.450
sitting, and he put his feet forward like
that.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.090
So people said, "You can't put your feet towards
Mother. That's not proper."

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.870
He said, "Oh, God. If I put my feet backwards,
I will start jumping like a frog."

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.980
I said, "How? Why? What has happened to you?"

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:56.100
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by my guru,
and he says after Kundalini is awakened you

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.080
start jumping like a frog."

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.890
And he showed Me in the book this fellow had
written that you start jumping like a frog.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.600
Can you imagine? It was written in the book.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.860
I said, "Are you going become now frogs or
earthworms? Are you going to jump like that,

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.270
like a monkey or a frog? Are you going to
bark like a dog?" You are going to become

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:23.810
a super human being. You are not going to
be driven by these forces, these are all negative

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.480
forces, which control you and make you mad
like this.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.540
You have to understand everything when you
get your realization, every word of it. It's

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:39.450
so logical; it's so practical as he says.
It is so practical, and it is so wonderful.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:45.890
Gavin Brown who came here first, was one of
the first Sahaja Yogis I had in London. And

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:51.350
you know English people are rather difficult
to crack, I mean, rather difficult people.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:56.410
But they are first class. I mean that's the
good thing because they do not get exposed

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:02.880
to so many nonsenses that some people who
are open can get you. And once they get realization

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.580
they're really top class people.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:11.000
Now this gentleman when he got realization,
he said, "Mother, you said we can be collectively

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.340
conscious. I can't believe it. How can I become?"

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.600
I said, "If I tell you about the television,
you won't believe Me till I put it to the

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.870
mains. You see anybody will think it's just
a box. But you are a great instrument, and

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.770
you have started working."

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.670
He said, "All right! I am rather worried about
my father. He didn't telephone to me all these

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:27.920
days."

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.870
I said, "All right. You just telephone to
him and find out." I said, "First of all see

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.450
your vibrations."
He said, "Mother, I'm getting a burning here,

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.010
a terrible burning."

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.640
Now these are the centers for your father,
right hand side, these are the centers.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.220
So, I said "All right. That means, this center
that means he must be down with a very bad

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.520
bronchitis."

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.280
He telephoned, and the mother came in, and
she said, "I am sorry your father is down

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.150
with very bad bronchitis."

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:57.150
This telecommunication, this divine power
knows everything. It understands everything.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:05.180
It knows you very well because it has created
you. It organizes everything, it cooperates

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:12.900
everything, it puts everything into integration,
it works out everything. It works out so many

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.490
things, even material things it works out;
even getting a ticket, it will work out. It's

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:24.520
so helpful; all the angels are there. Just
to see all that, to witness it itself is so

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:30.750
great. From lowest to the highest, it works
out everything for you. And the whole, the

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:37.750
sum total, the unity of it is that it is love.
So it is so kind, it is so compassionate,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.840
it looks after you. It, you see, hobnobs with
you little bit, you see, gives you little

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.650
lesson here and there, but it never allows
you to be ruined. It gives you little lessons

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:54.110
if you do wrong; it teaches you little bit
then again it brings you back. It is so loving,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:59.010
so kind. Specially for people who are just
realized, are like small little children like

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:05.340
seedlings. It looks after. It guides you very
much, it helps you so much. It's such a wonderful

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.510
thing to be with it, and the whole thing looks
like a fun, like a drama.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:16.510
I went to see a gentleman called Harban in
New York, and he had three children born realized.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.610
One was about seven, another was about five,
and the little one was about three years.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.530
And all one better than the other with sparkling
eyes just waiting for Me.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:33.170
And when I reached there they said, "Mother,
aren't there three eyes we have got?"

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.970
I said, "Yes, where?"

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.520
"One here, one here, and one there. And daddy
doesn't believe me."

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.060
And this one of these gurus has told him wrong
that there is only one eye. No there are three,

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.210
three are centers here actually. And they
argue with their father.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.460
And they said, "Mother, aren't you tired?"

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.760
I said, "Why?"

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.320
"We are tired now because we are watching
the story bit too much. We should finish now."

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.160
Just imagine. Small children of seven years
and five years are talking like this. My own

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.700
grandchildren are realized souls, and they
are so wonderful that the one who was three

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:14.040
years of age went to school, and everywhere
these days they are selling God. So in the

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.700
school they gave some papers they are saying
that, in the paper was saying so, that if

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.510
you come to a particular hotel and pay about
100 rupees, you can get your transformation.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.940
So she looked at Me, she said, "Transformation
is not possible till you get your Kundalini

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.280
up there, up here."

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.390
I said, "It's true. It has to happen but they
are saying like this."

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:41.310
But the elder one says, "It is not possible.
They are saying, 'You can give a course.'

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.110
How can you give you course? My father has
done fourteen courses. His Kundalini has not

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:49.670
risen as yet. If by courses if you can raise
the Kundalini then my father's Kundalini should

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:49.920
have been there."

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:55.730
You see they understand these things so clearly,
so clearly. If you talk to them, you'll be

00:28:55.730 --> 00:29:00.290
amazed. The another granddaughter of Mine,
she was five years of age, and she went to

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.940
Ladhak with her father. And there she saw
one Lama sitting like this with a [unclear]

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:11.730
dress he was wearing. And she told me he was
wearing a maxi. She couldn't understand the

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:17.330
dress was the dress of saint so called. So
she went there, and she looked at him, and

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.430
she couldn't bear when... You see when everybody
was touching his feet. And the father went

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.530
and touched his feet, and when mother went
and touched his feet she just went and stood

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.200
before him.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.180
And she said, "You are not even a realized
soul, in Hindi [unknown Hindi word], you are

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.110
not even a realized soul. What do you mean
by getting everybody's salutes? You are not

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.890
even a realized soul, and you have no business
to do that."

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.300
She stood up like that. And these two, my
daughter and son in law were so embarrassed.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.740
She said, "You get down from there, you are
not a realized soul, you should not allow

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.090
anybody to touch your feet."

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:51.230
Can you imagine a five-year-old child saying
that? It happens. These children are coming

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:56.390
up within ten years you'll see. They are the
edifice, they are the complete structure,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.690
but you are the foundations of these great
work, you are the foundations.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.370
So you must get your realization, that's the
main thing. You must get your realization.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:10.740
Once you get realization, all other things
which I've described that, what, I solve your

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:16.530
alcoholism, and other problems like mental
stress, and all that goes without saying.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:21.750
You see once you get your realization everything
will work out. So first of all you must get

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:27.340
your realization. And as you get realized
all these problems get mostly solved by themselves

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:34.340
because, why do we take to alcoholism or to
drugs? Either for seeking or for escaping.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.600
Because you are so bored with yourself and
with others that you take to these things,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.910
absolutely it is the expression of boredom.
You don't know what to do with yourself, you

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:48.370
don't know why are you here, why you are existing,
and why these boring people are around you.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.970
You just get fed up with it. And you are bored
with the matter. You don't understand. Now

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.120
you've bought your Hoover, you bought you
fridge, you bought your house now, what to

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:03.120
do now? What to buy? So that's how you start
taking to these things, and you develop these

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.600
habits then because everything forms a habit.
Anything material forms a habit, even a car.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:13.670
Even a chair can give you a habit that you
can't sit on the ground. So these things form

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:18.010
a habit, and you are becoming habituated,
and that's how you get into it.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.750
But as soon as you find your spirit, you know
you are beauty, you are so enjoyable, whole

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:30.050
thing is such a fun, such a fun, because you
become a witness. And then these things drop

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:35.100
out, just forget about it. You just forget
about, you don't have to remember that you

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.650
have to take any drugs.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.670
And some people told us that, "Mother, we
just forgot. And the drug was lying with us,

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.020
and we forgot that we were druggists and chemists."

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:48.020
They were just relieved of that problem. And
how we cure the cancer, how we cure other

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:54.310
diseases, and how imbalances work out within
us. All these things I will tell you tomorrow

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.320
and explain to you in all details. But just
now is a day, is a very great day of Lalita

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:05.190
Panchami. In India we say that this is first
day of the Holy Ghost permeating this power

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:11.250
all over, and is very great day. And when
I came to Houston the vibrations were so great.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.350
I said, "Oh God. This is the place where something
has to happen."

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:20.350
And I'm very anxious that you first get your
realization, and then we'll talk about it.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:25.160
Because if you come in this room there's darkness
and you are blind, you can't see anything.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.390
What's the use of explaining any color or
anything? First let us have the eyes, let

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:33.620
us have the light, and then we'll talk about
it. It's much easier to talk about that.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:40.460
But in any case I would like you to ask Me
some questions about this part of the lecture.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.370
May God bless you all.

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:51.370
[Shri Mataji and audience laughing]

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:07.870
Shri Mataji: They are real seekers.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:27.660
Seeker says, she is feeling it, she thinks.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.140
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes I know you are great
people over here. You must feel it, very,

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:40.090
very good. I know you are feeling it. Tremendous,
it's tremendous, I am just one with you. It

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:45.180
should happen to all of you. It will take
hardly any time, but don't be adamant like

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.940
small children are: "I won't eat." You see.
If you are hungry, you'll just have it. I've

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:55.060
done the cooking. You just have it and enjoy
it. You don't have to bother as to how I have

00:33:55.060 --> 00:34:02.060
done it. I've really done it, no doubt.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:17.520
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:25.250
Question: "When the Holy Spirit comes down,"
he says in fact, "does that just happen one

00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:37.179
time?"
Shri Mataji: All right. You see the whole

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:44.179
working of this is the other way round. First,
this Kundalini rises, you see, above, because

00:34:45.609 --> 00:34:49.700
you see, when you put your hands towards Me
or anybody who is realized soul who knows

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.480
the job, you see - She knows, because She
understands everything. So the information

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:59.910
goes through your fingers because these fingers
are actually sleeping centers, the manifestation,

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:06.589
the gross manifestation of these centers.
So the information goes down to Her there,

00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:12.769
and then She rises just like a primule or
the sprouting in a seed. She rises as you

00:35:12.769 --> 00:35:18.630
put a seed in the Mother Earth the seed knows,
and the seed starts sprouting. In the same

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:24.319
way She sprouts and this germinating power,
first time. Now this one, as I am going to

00:35:24.319 --> 00:35:30.059
tell you all about it tomorrow very much clearly,
but may be one thread out of it might be able

00:35:30.059 --> 00:35:35.630
to pierce through because if there is problem
in the centers, if there's physical, emotional,

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:42.140
mental, any problem then the centers are constricted,
then She just goes gradually and awakens one

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:49.140
center after another, expands it, and She
makes this bone become soft, just like a child.

00:35:49.839 --> 00:35:54.599
As Christ has said you have to become children
to enter in to the Kingdom of God. This bone

00:35:54.599 --> 00:36:00.259
becomes, this really becomes softer, and this
becomes softer, and through that She pierces,

00:36:00.259 --> 00:36:05.059
and you can start feeling the cool breeze
in the first shot. You start feeling the cool

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:12.059
breeze in the first shot. Then what happens
when She pierces this, all pervading power

00:36:12.789 --> 00:36:19.789
starts pouring down through that, and it goes
on falling on both the systems here, which

00:36:20.249 --> 00:36:27.249
I will explain tomorrow, by which these centers
also expand. So the system is built in this

00:36:28.509 --> 00:36:35.509
way that first this has to open. When it opens
then this all-pervading power falls on these

00:36:35.599 --> 00:36:41.849
two channels which manifest actually left
and right sympathetic nervous system which

00:36:41.849 --> 00:36:47.160
I'll explain to you tomorrow. And then by
relaxation, by relaxing that, you will feel

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:52.749
relaxed after that very much, these centers
open out much more. They are thronged. together.

00:36:52.749 --> 00:36:56.569
They open out and then more threads of Kundalini
can rise.

00:36:56.569 --> 00:37:03.249
So in the beginning is the sprouting, it takes
place, and then some people it is a very great

00:37:03.249 --> 00:37:08.089
experience. I've seen some people get it in
such a big way. But then the Kundalini goes

00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:11.930
to attend to the problems of a person, but
you know She is attending because you can

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.059
feel it on your finger. You can feel the throbbing.
Supposing you have a liver problem She'll

00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:20.749
go and throb there, and you can see the throbbing.
You can actually with naked eye see the throbbing

00:37:20.749 --> 00:37:25.450
there also in some people. If there is an
obstruction in the second center or in the

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:31.240
third center then you can see the actual throbbing
just like a heart. 'Lub, dub, lub, dub,' it

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:36.999
goes on. You can feel it with the stethoscope
also. The rising throbbing and here also you

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:40.940
can feel the throbbing when it comes. With
your hands you can, with your fingers, you

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.730
can feel the throbbing and then that throbbing
stops when She pierces through. But She can

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:52.079
come down to look after other centers and
She... Then we have to learn. Then the divine

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:58.940
technique has to be learnt how to keep it
raised, how to increase it, how to do. Before

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:04.670
realization there is no technique, there is
no technique. Once you have got the seedling

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.519
then you have the technique how to make it
grow. Before that there's no technique, is

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:11.779
a living process, is all built-in, you are
just pushed through.

00:38:11.779 --> 00:38:16.740
For example in machine, as I said, is very
good example, you put it through. But supposing

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:21.940
there is something wrong with the plank or
something wrong then the little bit you have

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.089
to correct it. Then you take a screw and screw
it up. But you know everything there then

00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:32.369
how to screw it up, how to screw, which bolt
is missing, whatever is done, it's very simple.

00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:36.490
And that technique one has to learn which
is not at all difficult. Anybody knows it

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:42.930
because you just know. Wherever the Kundalini
is stops, immediately you say, "It is stopped."

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:45.190
Like people will come and say, "Mother my
Agnya is caught."

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:50.549
So I will say, "All right. It means that I've
got ego." If Agnya is caught that means you

00:38:50.549 --> 00:38:54.920
have got ego. But that person won't say that,
"My, I have caught up with my ego. Such a

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.569
big ego is on my head." But they will say
that Mother my Agnya is caught. Now this is

00:38:58.569 --> 00:39:03.869
the center of Christ which is a very important
center, about which I will be telling tomorrow,

00:39:03.869 --> 00:39:08.390
which is very important, which we have missed
the point that He is to be awakened within

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:13.700
us. He is to be awakened. Unless and until
He is awakened we cannot enter in to the limbic

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:18.589
area, our attention cannot enter into it.
And that awakening takes place through the

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:24.619
Kundalini's awakening, She enlightens that.
So the whole mechanism I'll explain to you

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:31.619
tomorrow, and you will see the whole thing
working it out. All right?

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.559
Seeker: Yes. Thank you. [unclear]

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:49.559
A Seeker just going to tell everybody an experience
and you [not clear].

00:39:53.999 --> 00:40:00.999
Mother: All right.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:11.380
Seeker: All right. Thanks a lot. The seeker
is describing his experience but it is not

00:40:26.809 --> 00:40:28.700
very clear.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:35.700
Mother: Ya, that's it. You know what happens.
You become thoughtlessly aware because Christ

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:40.410
is awakened. If Christ is awakened within
you, here you see the point, is very important,

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:47.410
He sucks your ego and superego. He sucks your
conditionings. He sucks your karmas on which

00:40:47.579 --> 00:40:50.759
these gurus are making money now a days. See,
they tell you, "These are your karmas, you

00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:57.759
have to suffer." Then why are they there?
You see, this saying if people had told Indians,

00:40:57.859 --> 00:41:02.089
it would have been a very different history
but the Christians who went to India - I mean

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:06.339
they were very funny people. You see they
never told this fact that Christ is to be

00:41:06.339 --> 00:41:10.400
awakened at Agnya Chakra because they were
just waiting for Him.. They knew that this

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.230
has to happen. When this happens what happens?
You become thoughtlessly aware - peace. That's

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:20.910
the first thing that happens, that's in Sanskrit
called as nirvichara samadhi. They say is

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:26.660
the most difficult thing but I don't think
it's most difficult. I mean if you don't put

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:31.049
seed in the mother's land, naturally to pull
out the seed is very difficult, isn't it?

00:41:31.049 --> 00:41:36.349
But otherwise it's so naturally built-in.
So it happens. That is not another mind. Is

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:41.819
the thoughtless awareness where you are beyond
the mind. The English language doesn't have

00:41:41.819 --> 00:41:46.539
a proper concept of a mind. I don't know whether
they mean it the intellect or they mean as

00:41:46.539 --> 00:41:51.349
the emotions because mental patience and all
these words they use. But if you mean minds

00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:58.349
by intelligence or by what you call awareness
it goes beyond this awareness, human awareness

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:04.680
and takes you to another awareness called
'thoughtless awareness' that is 'enlightened

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:11.329
awareness.' Even with this you can cure people,
even with this. But once it jets out and once

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:15.799
it is stationed that's the second stage in
which you can give awakening to others just

00:42:15.799 --> 00:42:21.549
like this. Under your finger it will move.
You'll see it move. You can do it from tomorrow,

00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:27.420
today if you get realization, yes. You can
do it. You just feel it here. It's there.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:34.420
Ya, most of you have got it, just see.

00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:40.910
Shri Mataji: Put your right hand towards Me
perhaps.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.049
Seeker: ...heat...

00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:47.799
Shri Mataji: Heat? Yes some heat has to come
out because lots of frictions are inside.

00:42:47.799 --> 00:42:52.039
Like this, you put another hand towards Me,
like this. Heat has to come, you see, because

00:42:52.039 --> 00:42:56.799
there is lot of frictions. But heat is jetting
out. Now there is a chimney created. That's

00:42:56.799 --> 00:43:02.059
all right.. You should accept that part. It's
still on. It will work. You put your left

00:43:02.059 --> 00:43:05.720
hand towards Me and right hand there, left
hand. But you can put both the hands towards

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:12.720
Me. Now, we'll, it's very simple. By asking
few questions, you can achieve. Close your

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:22.450
eyes. Just close your eyes, and put your left
hand towards Me and right hand on your heart

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:37.670
because the spirit resides in the heart. And
now ask a question, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:47.650
Just ask the question. "Mother, am I the spirit?"
Ask that, put the hand like this as if you

00:43:54.670 --> 00:44:01.670
are asking for something. Like this, not that
but like this. Say, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:09.140
Keep your eyes closed. Ask the question in
your heart, "Am I the spirit?" Then you can

00:44:09.499 --> 00:44:16.499
ask another question: "Mother, am I my own
guru?" Ask three times. You will feel a little

00:44:29.319 --> 00:44:36.319
cool. Now put another hand towards Me closing
your eyes and just say, "Mother I forgive

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:45.710
everyone." That is very important. We must
forgive. Just say that. Saying is very easy.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:52.940
Actually what do we do? We do nothing. It's
a myth. When we say "we forgive" we just do

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:59.940
nothing. When we say "we don't forgive" we
torture ourselves for others. Why should we

00:45:00.049 --> 00:45:06.150
torture ourselves? We should say, "We forgive
everyone," so we have no loads on ourselves.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:13.150
This is a self-torture system. Now say, "Mother,
we forgive him." Say it again and again, will

00:45:15.289 --> 00:45:22.289
be good idea to relieve you of the problems.
Now, again put your right hand on your heart

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:34.210
and ask the question, "Mother, am I my own
guru? Am I my own master? Am I my own teacher?"

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:48.160
Because you become, you become your own teacher.
Once you become that discretion power, you

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:55.160
don't have to ask anyone. You know it yourself.

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:06.160
Now another problem, which Western people
have, is to feel guilty. I don't know from

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:11.739
where it has come. Why should you feel guilty
or why should you suffer? Christ has suffered

00:46:11.739 --> 00:46:18.700
for you, isn't it? Or there is something left
for you to suffer? Why should you suffer?

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:24.339
Why should you feel guilty? He's there to
look after you. He has already promised that

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:31.339
all your sins, blasphemy, everything will
be forgiven. So just say, "Mother I am not

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:38.430
guilty." Really, say it twice. That's very
important. Just say, "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:46.630
This is self-torture again to say that, "I'm
guilty." What's the use of feeling that you

00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:53.999
are guilty? The whole system is wrong to torture
yourself all the time saying that you are

00:46:55.599 --> 00:47:02.599
guilty. You are not guilty. Christ has suffered
for you, you don't have to suffer. If you

00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:15.869
ask for suffering, you will have that. So
you have to say that, "Mother I'm not guilty."

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:27.920
Now last of all, you have to say, "Mother,
please give me my realization," you have to

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:34.720
ask for it. Nobody can force it on you. It's
your freedom. If you want it, you can have

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:40.569
it. If you don't want to have it, you can,
just don't have it. For example, somebody

00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:44.440
asked Me very mischievously, "How do we go
to hell?" I said, "Take two running jumps

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:50.430
and you can go there." [Audience laughing]
Very simple.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:56.089
So if you want to have realization, just say,
"Mother, I want to have realization. Please

00:47:56.089 --> 00:48:02.789
give me my Self-Realization." You have to
humble about it, you're asking for the ultimate

00:48:02.789 --> 00:48:08.519
and it will just work out. Now don't think
about it. Just, it will go beyond thinking.

00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:15.519
You just become thoughtlessly aware. It will
work out. Now feel your, on the right hand,

00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:22.809
with the right hand you can feel your cool.
Ask for it, "Mother, please give me my realization."

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:34.599
I cannot challenge your freedom that's given
to you. In your glory of freedom, you should

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:42.190
ask for a greater freedom, for a greater liberation,
for real liberating. See. There? You start

00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:50.769
first feeling on the head, then you start
feeling on the hands also. Just keep it like

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:59.710
this for a while. Close your eyes. It will
work out. It will work out. And also to say

00:50:14.339 --> 00:50:20.400
that, "If we have done any mistakes in our
seeking, please forgive." without feeling

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:27.400
guilty, of course, without feeling guilty.
Don't feel guilty. That's a big problem. And

00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:49.460
also know that God is responsible for you.
He has to be responsible about creation, and

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:56.460
He has to come in a very special way to give
you realization. He has to save His creation,

00:50:58.749 --> 00:51:05.749
He has to save you. You are His creation,
all right? Got it? [Mother laughs] All of

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:11.910
you?

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:18.910
Those who didn't get also will get, slowly.
See, like one fruit becomes then another becomes,

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:29.319
like that, yes,. you can feel each other also,
you can feel each other, vibrations. It works

00:51:33.869 --> 00:51:40.869
out. Close your eyes and enjoy. Closing of
the eyes is important because when the Kundalini

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:49.700
rises, see, the pupils of the, they dilate,
of the eyes. It's better to keep the eyes

00:51:50.869 --> 00:51:57.869
closed. Otherwise the Kundalini may not rise.
It's just the opposite of mesmerism. Hm. Good.

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:08.170
You have found it. Now to believe that you
have found it is very difficult because guru

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:15.749
shopping is on in America, I think. You see
they are all busy shopping, and this is a

00:52:15.749 --> 00:52:19.380
temple you enter into. And then you can't
believe this is a temple, there's still the

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.910
guru shopping is on. So now you have to stop
this rat race for one minute, and see for

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:30.910
yourself. You've got it. Otherwise, you will
not grow. You have to become your own guru.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.680
You don't have to go to anybody else. It's
you who knows everything now. You'll know

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:42.309
gradually now. You'll be amazed how much you
know.

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:45.299
Like in America they said, "Mother, are your
disciples all scholars?"

00:52:45.299 --> 00:52:46.049
I said, "No."

00:52:46.049 --> 00:52:49.079
They said, "They are such scholars. They know
about so many things."

00:52:49.079 --> 00:52:54.049
I said, "You become the knowledge. Truth is
the knowledge." You become the knowledge,

00:52:54.049 --> 00:53:01.049
just become.".

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:06.109
Those who haven't got can raise their hands.
Some of the Sahaja Yogis can go and help them

00:53:06.109 --> 00:53:11.539
also. Because they can talk to you, it's better
to talk to you.

00:53:11.539 --> 00:53:16.799
Shri Mataji: Not to think bad. Because some
people don't get it if they have physical

00:53:16.799 --> 00:53:17.049
problem.

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:20.349
Shri Mataji: Or mental problem, doesn't matter.
Those who have not felt, it's better to be

00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:25.640
honest about it because you must get it. It
is your right to have it all right? Now let's

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:32.589
see, can you go and help them? Can they come
on the stage I can help them, those who haven't

00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:34.749
got? How many are there?

00:53:34.749 --> 00:53:40.009
Shri Mataji: If they could come here on the
stage and be seated all here in the front

00:53:40.009 --> 00:53:47.009
line then we can work it out. You must get
it. You must get it, all of you.

00:53:50.509 --> 00:53:57.390
Shri Mataji: On the stairs will be all right.
They will work it out. On the stairs

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:04.390
Shri Mataji: Just sit down anywhere, they
can come round and see for yourself.

00:54:05.509 --> 00:54:11.499
Shri Mataji: Anywhere. I would like to see
all of them because those who are realized

00:54:11.499 --> 00:54:17.890
are really great, I feel that. And also those
who have to get realization. Now can we remove

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:18.140
this?

00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:24.279
Shri Mataji: [unclear] Can you get the light.
I'll work out with the light maybe. St. Michael's

00:54:24.279 --> 00:54:31.279
method this one is. You will also learn very
soon. [unclear] Too many...

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:39.059
[Now follows an ongoing conversation of Mother
with single different seekers who came on

00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:46.059
the stage not always clearly audible. Also
Mother speaks to the total audience through

00:54:50.859 --> 00:54:53.309
the microphone.]

00:54:53.309 --> 00:55:00.309
Shri Mataji: Just watch it. Watch my hand,
without thinking. Just watch My hand without

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:10.210
thinking. Can you get [unclear] please? You
can sit on the chair. Put your hand [straight?].

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:30.640
You 
got it. [unclear]. You may not feel today
but if [Siddhi?] can feel it then tomorrow

00:55:39.559 --> 00:55:46.559
you can feel it yourself. Because of the sensitivity
in the hand, you know, may not be so good.

00:55:48.369 --> 00:55:54.759
You got it too. You got it, yes, I know. You
sit down. Those who have got it should sit

00:55:54.759 --> 00:56:01.759
down, sit back. Because we'll have to get
one by one. Got it, see yourself. [unclear]

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:13.160
Just see. Higher. Good. Al right. You got
it. Just put both your hands towards Me. Like

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:26.670
this, like this, ya. See. All right? Got it
now. All right. You have got it also. Can

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:38.680
you feel him? Yes him. Hmm? [unclear] Are
you feeling? Not on the head? Just see here.

00:56:55.039 --> 00:57:02.039
You got it also now. You got it now. Watch
your hands, watch your head also. You got

00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:04.069
it. Just see yourself.

00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:08.410
Shri Mataji: Is it? [unclear] I would like
to be closer to you also. Who is this? Most

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:15.410
of you've got it. I think in the Nabhi. Hmm.
Those who haven't really got it. [Mother laughs].

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:30.690
Let's see this gentleman behind the [unclear]
got it. You, you only. Just see him. No, no,

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:38.710
no. This one with the [unclear]. He's got
it. He too has, the one...

00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:48.390
Shri Mataji: Yes. You can feel it, just feel
it. You see, it's a very small thread, it's

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:55.869
very subtle. Some people get it in a big way
but it's very subtle. Ha. Now. All right?

00:57:55.869 --> 00:58:02.869
Now this gentleman? What about you? Just put
your hands like this, let's see. Watch Me,

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:15.900
watch Me here. Got it now. All right? [Mother
laughs]. It's very simple, just go on feeling

00:58:17.779 --> 00:58:24.779
[unclear] it. Start's now, what about you?
Feeling it or not? In the Nabhi; You have

00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:38.589
been to some gurus or someone? No one? You
have got. You have got. You got it. All right.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:01.019
[Mother laughs]. You didn't go to any spiritualist?
Did you?

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:03.849
[Seeker says something but unclear]

00:59:03.849 --> 00:59:09.989
Shri Mataji: Ah, they can be very dangerous
also, these spiritualists, I'll tell about

00:59:09.989 --> 00:59:16.289
all of these people tomorrow. You got it,
there, with the red? All right? Good. [Mother

00:59:16.289 --> 00:59:19.880
laughs]. One by one, how you get it, you see
now. Everybody has to get it, everybody's

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:24.529
going to get it. All of you all are going
to get it, so don't be worried. Just don't

00:59:24.529 --> 00:59:31.529
be worried, that's the main point. He should
get it, [unclear]. Most of you have got it.

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:53.349
Hmm. Now? Got it?

00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:55.319
Seeker: Warm...

00:59:55.319 --> 01:00:02.319
Shri Mataji: Warm, warmth will go away, will
become cool. It has opened out, you see never

01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:11.069
warm coming out from here. [unclear] Now.
Better? Hmm. You got it too. Now just feel

01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:29.809
it. You all got it. All right? Feels great.
Look at that. How it's happening. Just like...

01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:36.809
[Mother laughs]. What about you? Did you feel?
There. No. Just see him. It will work out.

01:00:37.999 --> 01:00:42.670
Just watch My hand. Don't think about it,
all right? It is the beyond, it triggers into

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:49.670
the state.. All right. We work it out. Somebody
here, this side. Hmm, should be cool. It will

01:00:56.950 --> 01:01:03.950
cool down, it will cool down, little bit.
You put your left hand on your liver, left

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:14.430
hand, this side. Now put your right hand towards
Me. Cool? All right? Hmm, That. Right. You

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:27.700
have a little liver problem. Liver. Little
liver. You see.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.660
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.460
Shri Mataji: What is happened?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.940
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:41.759
Shri Mataji: Is it? That's the heart. Now
put your right hand and go on saying with

01:01:41.759 --> 01:01:48.190
your left hand towards Me that, without feeling
guilty, "Mother please forgive me if I have

01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:54.890
done any mistakes," and say that, "I'm the
spirit." If you just say that, it will work

01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:57.019
out. All right?

01:01:57.019 --> 01:01:59.140
Seeker: All right.

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:06.140
Shri Mataji: Just say. Go on saying. She has
got it at the end there. All right?

01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:08.130
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.239
Shri Mataji: Now he'll feel it, he'll feel
it. It takes time because our fingers are

01:02:11.239 --> 01:02:13.859
not used to this. We have not felt it before.

01:02:13.859 --> 01:02:15.309
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:19.420
Shri Mataji: Hmm. I told you, you had liver,
that's why, that's why the heat is there.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:25.749
Doesn't matter, the heat is going out. It's
good, it's clearing out, it's so clear. You

01:02:25.749 --> 01:02:29.819
don't have to tell Me about you suffer from.
I just know, all right? And you will know

01:02:29.819 --> 01:02:31.420
too. Are you feeling?

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.420
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.989
Shri Mataji: You have pain? You have pain
in the back.

01:02:37.989 --> 01:02:40.920
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:47.749
Shri Mataji: All right! Not now, all right.
Good. Most of the, you've got it now. What

01:02:47.749 --> 01:02:54.749
about you? I tell you. [unclear]. The lady
behind. Hah. You got it? Did you feel? Yes,

01:03:04.999 --> 01:03:11.999
try to feel it. It's there. It's again very
subtle. You have got it. What about you have

01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:23.039
got it now. don't worry now. Tell me [unclear]
put your hands like this, got it. Fine. Got

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:30.049
it now. It's cooler, very much cooler, see.
It was hepatitis, it was hepatitis. I could

01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:37.049
see that, you see, and the hepatitis is cured
as well, it's that. The heat had to go away.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:44.690
You see so much accumulation of heat in the
liver. You see liver is the one which sorts

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:52.089
out your all poisons, you see. But that shows.
Tomorrow I'll be telling you all about diseases

01:03:52.289 --> 01:03:56.759
and things like that, and if there are any
doctors it will be good idea for them to come

01:03:56.759 --> 01:04:01.459
and see. [unclear] my child.

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:07.049
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:04:07.049 --> 01:04:14.049
Shri Mataji: Now can you put your left hand
on your navel, left hand, yes. You got it.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.549
Seeker: ... got very bad damage here... from
a guru ...

01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:28.390
Shri Mataji: Which guru you went to?

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.759
Seeker: ...Maharishi...

01:04:30.759 --> 01:04:37.759
Shri Mataji: Sakshat Narakasura Mardini Om
Sakhsat, Narakasura Mardini Om Sakhsat Narakasura

01:04:38.339 --> 01:04:42.390
Mardini. You must understand [unclear], my
child. It's very simple to find out these

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:46.180
things, isn't it? He is going to teach you
to fly. Are we going to become birds now?

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:52.910
Why not make you fly himself? Put him on that
Leaning Tower of Pisa. That's the best. If

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:58.989
he can fly even one inch, you can photo. Horrible
people they tell you all stories.

01:04:58.989 --> 01:05:01.209
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:05:01.209 --> 01:05:06.969
Shri Mataji: All right, just. Sakhat Narakasura
Mardini Om Sakshat, Narakasura Mardini Om

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:12.450
Sakshat. Keep your eyes open. Just say, put
your right hand on your heart and say, "Mother

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:18.619
I am sorry for this..." You see, after all
you are a seeker - you have made mistakes,

01:05:18.619 --> 01:05:19.869
all right?

01:05:19.869 --> 01:05:24.259
[seeker asks something to Mother, not clear]

01:05:24.259 --> 01:05:31.259
Shri Mataji: He's horrible I tell you. He
has given epilepsy to people, you won't believe,

01:05:32.849 --> 01:05:38.700
epilepsy to people. The head of their academy
in Scotland came to Me with epilepsy, daughter,

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:45.059
his wife, all of them got epilepsy. Horrid
person. If you want to read about him. This

01:05:45.059 --> 01:05:52.059
lady went to some broker News of the World,
and she's published all about it. Horrible

01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:59.410
people. [unclear] Such a seeker, you'll get
it. Don't you worry.

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.819
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:06:01.819 --> 01:06:05.259
Shri Mataji: You are going to get it. Whatever
let them try. I know all their tricks and

01:06:05.259 --> 01:06:12.259
the trades, all right? Ha, you got it, now,
all right. Now close your eyes. Enjoy yourself.

01:06:15.119 --> 01:06:15.749
Yes please?

01:06:15.749 --> 01:06:20.719
[Seeker says something, not clear] Seeker:"What
is this sensation on the whole of the hand?"

01:06:20.719 --> 01:06:23.959
Shri Mataji: You get a cool breeze and [NOT
CLEAR]

01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:27.729
Seeker: Cool breeze coming up from top of...

01:06:27.729 --> 01:06:31.329
Shri Mataji: Like a jet.

01:06:31.329 --> 01:06:34.930
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:40.420
Shri Mataji: Yes, heat would be there in the
beginning. You see the heat of the body has

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:47.200
to come out. He's all right now, this gentleman.
We just see this gentleman. Are you better?

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.430
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:57.430
Shri Mataji: Hmm. You better forgive him.
Better forgive him. All right? Just forgive.

01:06:59.619 --> 01:07:06.619
Just forgive. Ha. Keep your eyes open, you
better [NOT CLEAR] watch [NOT CLEAR]. Ha!

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:17.430
All right? She got it? This one. Now who have
not got it? This gentleman, look after you.

01:07:27.329 --> 01:07:31.299
It's very good. Are you a science stud? Are
you a science stud?

01:07:31.299 --> 01:07:32.900
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.719
Shri Mataji: Then what? What have you studied?

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:40.229
[Seeker says something, not clear]

01:07:40.229 --> 01:07:47.229
Shri Mataji: Let him ask Me, builder of the
builder, you see,. All right. Good.

01:07:50.579 --> 01:07:52.479
[People taking, unclear]

01:07:52.479 --> 01:07:59.479
Shri Mataji: Smoke. All right? All right.
Keep it down, keep it out. That's all. You

01:08:01.009 --> 01:08:08.009
won't smoke now any more. All right! Got it,
all right. [Mother laughs loudly]. With a

01:08:15.059 --> 01:08:22.059
package it was hiding there. He's found it.
As soon as he took out the packet, you see,

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:29.819
he's all right. [Mother laughs]. Otherwise,
he was breathing heavily, see. Great. Great.

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:36.819
Smoking, you'll give up. Just put in little
will-power. Think of Me that time. It will

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:46.940
go out, all right? You too, you have a liver
problem? Hmm. You put your left hand on the

01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.029
liver. I'll tell you tomorrow about liver,
everything. How to get it all right, on that.

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:58.029
Higher. I will tell why you get livers also,
everything, tomorrow. I hope you'll bring

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.719
up paper and a pencil also to note down few
points, and also I think they can give you

01:09:06.719 --> 01:09:13.719
My tapes later on if

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:59.730
you want to have the tapes. Hah. Good. All
right? Throw away this

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:43.840
in the sea. Just throw away. It will go away.
It will go. Are 
you all right? Did you feel, this gentleman.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:32.349
Did you feel? Not yet, all right! Those who
have not yet felt again raise your hands...
