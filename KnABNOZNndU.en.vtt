00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:09.400
I am just pointing it out

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:12.541
how, in the modern times, you have to be very careful

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:19.253
that you should not try to attract the attention of others.

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:24.636
Instead of that, what you have to do is to pay attention to others

00:00:24.837 --> 00:00:29.157
in a very subtle way, not with any expectation

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:34.911
that if you are paying attention to somebody, that person should pay attention to you.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.824
It’s a very big struggle,

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:45.143
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people try to, say, become very popular

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:53.286
or become very outstanding, or something of a very great qualities,

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:58.014
to show off that they are something better than others.

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:03.691
A person who is really in connection with the Divine, is least bothered

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:08.877
about how people pay attention to that person,

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:15.653
but automatically the attention of such a person is on others,

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:19.068
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

00:01:19.269 --> 00:01:23.301
You cannot make out that the attention of such a person

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:29.500
is on you, but it works and it works beautifully.

00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:35.102
We have to understand that we have now come to the realm of the Divinity.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:40.199
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are divine people.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.718
We are very powerful people, but if we fritter away

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.678
our attention, we become very, very weak people.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:54.675
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja Yogis”, “we have done

00:01:54.863 --> 00:02:00.952
so much of realisation of others” or “we have helped so many people.”

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:05.012
All this consciousness if it comes within you, then know

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:09.342
that you are still not fully developed Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:09.543 --> 00:02:15.439
There should be no consciousness of what you are doing or what you are committing.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.711
There is no need to boast about it. There is no need to advertise it.

00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:28.229
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen by everyone.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.177
But even that desire is not needed

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:38.392
because you are doing just for the satisfaction of your Spirit.

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:43.339
So then, when we come to our heart:

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.075
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you know very well.

00:02:47.276 --> 00:02:54.987
Now, when it is the heart, which has to work over your brain and which can work,

00:02:55.188 --> 00:02:59.847
what becomes of you is nothing, but you become a source

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:03.405
of love and compassion. A source, I am saying.

00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:09.275
You do not assert on others. You do not say that, “I’ve done so much for you

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:18.639
and what are you doing to me? What is this that I should have so much expressed,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.627
in so many ways, and here you are,

00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:26.204
you are forgetting me and not doing anything for me?”

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:31.910
So the expectation of reward if it is there,

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:36.362
then you must know is your mind which is giving you these ideas

00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:43.152
and is working it out that way that you just now put attention

00:03:43.353 --> 00:03:47.085
to the amount of love the other person has given you

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:54.686
for whatever you have given to another person. It's very subtle.

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:03.850
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now yourself as just a source of love,

00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:07.991
which is just flowing.

00:04:08.192 --> 00:04:13.546
In that, you do not say that you have to have this or that,

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:21.137
or you have to achieve this goal, or you have to become that. It's finished now.

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:28.213
Once you have become the source, then how can you become something?

00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:34.432
The thing is, those who are receiving from the source want to have

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:46.393
some sort of a reward or some sort of a recognition.

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:52.804
In this subtle way if you move, your mind is very clever.

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:57.931
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever, intelligent people.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:05.757
But this mind... You have to be very careful because this mind can cheat you.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:12.370
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja Yoga?

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:17.136
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:26.740
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then, you have to ask yourself that,

00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:35.265
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:42.069
What do I want to achieve? Why I am in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:05:42.815 --> 00:05:46.994
If you ask this question, you will see you’ll just dissolve,

00:05:47.195 --> 00:05:52.476
you'll become thoughtless because there is no desire left now.

00:05:52.677 --> 00:05:55.823
There is no ambition left, no competition.
