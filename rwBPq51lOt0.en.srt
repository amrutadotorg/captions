1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:07,263
When Warren talks about other gurus I can't help laughing.

2
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:11,135
It's beyond me to understand

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,647
why people get stuck up with them, it's really beyond that

4
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,697
because it is so obvious

5
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:25,306
that God cannot be bought,

6
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:30,349
you cannot pay for God, it is absolutely obvious

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:33,567
for any intelligent man, it should be obvious.

8
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:42,205
How much did you pay to become a human being from say monkeys,

9
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:48,124
or what did we do, did we cut our tails or anything to become human beings?

10
00:00:49,696 --> 00:00:52,374
We have become by the grace of God.

11
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:56,452
What can we pay for the grace of God?

12
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,474
It is very simple you cannot,

13
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,974
God doesn't understand money.

14
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:08,356
It is human beings who have created money and all these things

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,331
and economic wants and all this economic problem.

16
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,323
God doesn't understand any economics that you have made.

17
00:01:14,797 --> 00:01:15,760
He doesn't understand!

18
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,911
This is all your own doings.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,275
Your own projections and complications

20
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:25,137
and you are entangled into it.

21
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:26,953
It is as simple as that.

22
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:30,698
I mean, you have seen these people

23
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:36,882
who live on other people's money,

24
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:40,874
I call it OPM, are parasites.

25
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,880
You won't live on other people's money; will you, any one of you.

26
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,761
So they do not have even a simple self-respect.

27
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,893
Not only that, but these parasites are thriving.

28
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,778
It is so obvious, so very obvious,

29
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,255
that we like befooling.

30
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,101
The more one is able to befool us, the better we are.

31
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:15,015
I went to Calcutta once for a program

32
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,222
and I had many programs,

33
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:25,349
but one of them was in a very posh place as they call it, in a

34
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,001
hotel they arranged the program. I said this hotel people, you see.

35
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,775
These rich people they will not be interested in Sahaja Yoga.

36
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:32,835
They have been too rich.

37
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:34,944
From all over the world

38
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,536
overly rich people can never understand this you see,

39
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:44,156
they want somebody who will take money from them,

40
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:45,844
and they can show off their money.

41
00:02:47,744 --> 00:02:49,842
And we had a program and there were two halls.

42
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,603
I told them take a very small one because I know them too well,

43
00:02:57,229 --> 00:02:59,841
and the bigger hall was occupied by another fellow

44
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:04,764
who was with some sort of a show on,

45
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:09,611
stuff, and we were amazed that, except for two people,

46
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,954
most of them who came inside went to his program

47
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:18,800
and after eight days he was arrested in Poona for robbing people.

48
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,619
But all of them went to his program and not to mine.

49
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:28,066
When it was written not a single pie will be charged and it's all-free

50
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:29,335
and all those things

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,424
and he looked so dishonest for me from his own photographs, if you

52
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,495
could see him, he was so dishonest to look at

53
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:40,583
and people could not see that, I mean it was so simple to see.

54
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,388
See, that shows that you have lost every sensitivity

55
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,228
to know what is plastic and what is real.

56
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,556
It makes me laugh sometimes, the way

57
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:58,056
today only I was discussing in the aero plane with somebody

58
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:01,393
He was seriously telling me how much he was tortured by

59
00:04:02,147 --> 00:04:04,713
another group where he paid three thousand pounds

60
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,252
just to get some sort of a horrible mantra which has no meaning

61
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,808
and where he worked very hard for days together

62
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,122
and he broke his back and he broke his every part of his

63
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:23,629
bone in the backbone area, and all sorts of things he did and

64
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,498
I mean he became so nervous,

65
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,010
recluse,

66
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,809
they are even frightened of a garlic, if they see one garlic, I mean

67
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:37,297
after getting realization you have to become a person who is absolutely powerful

68
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,184
in control of yourself

69
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:41,898
not aggressive but not to be

70
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:45,230
such a cowardly recluses

71
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,299
and he told me all these things and I did not know what to do

72
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,589
because it was such a description

73
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,089
They don't know whether to laugh or to cry

74
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,953
really because this thing behind it

75
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:06,246
is all hocus pocus absolutely hocus pocus,

76
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,853
I think this world must have started after the fact that I'm coming into this world

77
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,958
absolutely absurd is to say that you will fly or

78
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,264
you will see the light and all these nonsenses,

79
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,382
and on top of that

80
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,002
the suffering of a person,

81
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,010
of a person who is a genuine seeker,

82
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,955
who is a seeker of the truth.

83
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,119
He is a man of God

84
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,361
and he's being tortured like this you see

85
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:37,966
makes you so unhappy.

86
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:42,188
You just don't know what to say about the whole thing that's happening.

87
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:43,782
You have to wake up

88
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:48,068
to your self-esteem and know that you are created human beings

89
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,120
for a special thing,

90
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:53,834
and not to be bounced and cheated by these horrible fake people.

91
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:59,028
One has to understand the innate nature of God

92
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,528
to understand what should happen to you

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,288
as realized souls, if you become abnormal and freaky

94
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:09,594
then it is not that you have got your realization,

95
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,781
on the contrary a person

96
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:17,266
who is realized becomes extremely normal, is the most normal person.

97
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:24,185
Apart from these things there are some reasons

98
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:28,234
built-in within us which make us so stupid.

99
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,617
Really built-in I should say, because we have come from matter,

100
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:38,010
we are gross, our origin has been gross,

101
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,123
we came from matter and we grew up

102
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:45,555
to see that there is something beyond the matter

103
00:06:46,055 --> 00:06:48,506
that is the spirit and we are the spirit,

104
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:51,582
but we get dominated by this matter,

105
00:06:52,082 --> 00:06:55,813
we really get dominated by matter, all through in our ventures,

106
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:59,458
for example, if you are sitting in a chair,

107
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:03,045
for example you make a chair out of some matter, you cannot sit on the ground,

108
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,966
you form a habit of matter, matter starts growing on you,

109
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:13,497
you become such a slave, such a slave of matter

110
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,264
that you cannot get over it,

111
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,586
any matter you start using, for example you use a car

112
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,016
then you cannot do without a car,

113
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:24,924
you use electricity which is a material power,

114
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,524
if it fails everything goes out,

115
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,601
you cannot do without it.

116
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:33,114
So matter is all the time trying to overpower the spirit,

117
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,994
but the beauty is, through your evolution,

118
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:41,187
you evolve to a stage

119
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:44,481
where you are a human being and you start seeing the matter

120
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:49,137
cannot dominate your spirit. This should be the self-estimation,

121
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:54,568
there should be understanding that you are the spirit and not the matter.

122
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:01,695
When you see this simple point

123
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,512
then you understand that you cannot purchase God.

124
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:13,300
Then another point also one understands that it is not the way,

125
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,950
materially uses somebody you should accept

126
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:23,177
but spiritually, if he does something spiritually to you

127
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:25,367
then you should accept

128
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,417
for example seeing the light,

129
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:31,828
say they say you see the light, why see the light myself, yes

130
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,488
but to see the light I have to be away from the light,

131
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:39,966
do you see the point?

132
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:44,091
You have to be the light.

133
00:08:49,816 --> 00:08:53,807
So it's a very simple thing, if you understand it's commonsense,

134
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,432
that if you have to be the light,

135
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,857
then you have to be inside the light,

136
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,732
part and parcel of the light.

137
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,632
But to see the light you have to go further.

138
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,807
Actually from this distance I can't even see

139
00:09:09,307 --> 00:09:12,450
if I have to really see the light I have to go much further to see this light.

140
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,435
All these things that they are talking

141
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,270
and telling you is such a camouflage

142
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,525
and they have been very good at befooling you.

143
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:34,575
It is impossible to convince people who want to be befooled.

144
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:41,315
It is impossible. It is easy to befool them

145
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,937
because they are anxious to be befooled, so alright,

146
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,987
but those who want

147
00:09:50,787 --> 00:09:53,905
that they should really realized it, they should get it

148
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:58,143
then their attitude is very different, they would like to go and see.

149
00:09:58,643 --> 00:09:59,953
what the disciples have got,

150
00:10:00,878 --> 00:10:02,878
these people who have paid so much money,

151
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:05,729
there have been people for fifteen years, twenty years, go and see them,

152
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,252
what have you got?

153
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:14,004
If they say, "alright, I am feeling very much better in health",

154
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:18,754
you look at the face and you will know that they are not.

155
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,844
Supposing they say "I feel relaxed", so what?

156
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:26,769
What is so great that you are feeling relaxed,

157
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,766
so called relaxation, you can feel relaxed even with the dope

158
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,023
even going to a pub you might feel relaxed,

159
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:38,274
in some company you might feel relaxed, so what?

160
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,779
What is so great, is that something God's work?

161
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,611
Just to relax you?

162
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,911
Some people say

163
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,230
"I feel better" this might be ego pampering.

164
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,991
But what powers did you get yourself? If you become the spirit

165
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,067
then you have to have powers of the spirit flowing through you, isn't it?

166
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:04,578
It should be a common, logical conclusion.

167
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,428
'What is the power, you have got?

168
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,903
What have I got from them?

169
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,828
They have taken all my purse, my money.

170
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,712
Thousands of pounds have gone to him, everything done?

171
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:25,836
What did I get from him? "We should have an understanding,

172
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,108
but this nobody asks

173
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,608
because there is a big mafia in all these organizations,

174
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:36,385
you are not supposed discuss, you are not supposed to talk.

175
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,692
You are put in different compartments; it's a big secret going on,

176
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,196
If you tell some Indian, he just laugh,

177
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:47,346
because he knows the meanings of these words,

178
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:49,009
are so stupid.

179
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,059
Some of the words of the mantras means

180
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:55,970
this showing this, some of the words means scorpion,

181
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:03,438
some of them means the serpent,

182
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:08,681
all kinds of things, and some of them means the siren.

183
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:14,056
In a very ridiculous way

184
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,651
these people have befooled you.

185
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,901
A sort of a respite they are taken I think,

186
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:21,939
or is it a respite

187
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:29,810
of the satanic on the divine people who have come on this earth to seek God?

188
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:33,114
Is that attack of these negative people

189
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,996
who are trying to divide you completely and

190
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,146
ruin your images on this earth,

191
00:12:40,071 --> 00:12:43,197
you have to be aware of that. We are very vulnerable

192
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:44,383
because you are seeking,

193
00:12:46,358 --> 00:12:48,765
you are more vulnerable because you have no self esteem,

194
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,265
you treat yourselves so cheaply.

195
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:57,223
You do not judge into what lions' den you are entering into

196
00:12:57,723 --> 00:12:59,723
and you get be so badly hurt,

197
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,648
with all your sincerity, with all that,

198
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,134
you do not give a second thought to think that

199
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,182
even if there are thousands of them going

200
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,334
before I going there I should find out

201
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,484
what sort of a nonsense is going on there.

202
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,830
If you go there as an ordinary visitor,

203
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,403
you will immediately find out

204
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:20,903
that this is a fake and a false thing going on,

205
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,495
you have been warned in the bible

206
00:13:27,695 --> 00:13:28,706
it has been warned

207
00:13:28,752 --> 00:13:31,467
that there will be fake and false people coming on this earth.

208
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:39,208
Now there are another type of people also,

209
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,366
I will cover

210
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:44,358
the chakras later little, because giving little introduction to the subject

211
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:46,783
about how to avoid this thing,

212
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:52,028
who are bound by ritualistic ideas, as he said about Christianity,

213
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,259
of giving very subtle forms of things.

214
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,683
But we must see what it is doing,

215
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:04,120
like Church of England,

216
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,781
can you imagine, Church of England owns the whole of Soho.

217
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:12,861
And the question was raised, "how can you own this Soho,

218
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:15,096
where all the prostitutes are earning their livings?"

219
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,979
And the answer came in

220
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,551
that Christ looked after Mary Magdalene, who was a prostitute, see,

221
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:28,063
you can see, and the people accepted this answer.

222
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:36,207
Then the whole thing of a ritual starts, you see,

223
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:38,539
"come along here and sit down,

224
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:40,851
and bring the child and we will baptize it."

225
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,644
It's a joke,

226
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,541
it's a very big joke.

227
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,288
Baptism is a living process within you,

228
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:55,070
it's a living happening.

229
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,599
Did Christ baptize anyone of them?

230
00:15:02,432 --> 00:15:05,799
Did He put His hand on anybody's head and say "you are baptized by Me"?

231
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,785
Ask the question, did He do it?

232
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,641
Then how are these people doing it?

233
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,883
They have taken Christ into their hands

234
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:21,520
as if they found Him somewhere in the storm somewhere.

235
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,394
What right have they got to say they are baptizing?

236
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:33,934
It is a living force of God, which resides within you

237
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:37,596
He said that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames."

238
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:39,790
Let them explain this point only.

239
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:43,610
Then they say He is Alpha and Omega

240
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,915
what does that mean?

241
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,088
For all practical purposes what does that mean to you?

242
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,856
For that you have to read Devi Bhagvatam.

243
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,975
What was Christ? Who is He?

244
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:01,302
How He is Alpha and He is Omega

245
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:04,932
Why He came on this earth? Really, what was His purpose?

246
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:07,796
There is nothing there. Just some few people who were not realized

247
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,934
saw Him and wrote it down, finished.

248
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:16,757
How can that become such an authority for anyone whatsoever,

249
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:17,837
that you are fighting.

250
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:23,090
It's very deep; it is because it is so narrow it is extremely deep.

251
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,320
You have to widen to see.

252
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,820
For example, you are standing on a well

253
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:28,969
which is very narrow,

254
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:32,205
and just hardly you can see anything inside,

255
00:16:32,212 --> 00:16:33,782
you can just see something flickering.

256
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,363
To see the complete vision of that well

257
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,215
you have to increase the narrowness of it,

258
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:45,701
and that this we are not prepared to do because, you see Bible is the last one.

259
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,125
Now I would say any other person

260
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:50,752
would come and say, "what is the authority of Bible?",

261
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:52,185
now what authority will you give?

262
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,127
if say Christ is the authority of Bible. Take it like that,

263
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:56,641
Christ never wrote Bible,

264
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,380
He never wrote a word, so how you do connect?

265
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,493
Could be some journalist, who could write about Him,

266
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,517
could be anything absurd.

267
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,398
If they Hindu say the Gita,

268
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:16,505
ask them "who wrote Gita?"

269
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,084
Krishna never wrote Gita; never did he write it?

270
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:25,781
So what is the authority of it?

271
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,814
Nothing! Gita has no authority as such,

272
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:34,112
how do you say that Gita was the one written by Krishna?

273
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:37,291
He had nothing to do. Anybody, supposing you see me today

274
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,221
and you write about me, you can write anything,

275
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:41,464
anything you feel like,

276
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:44,776
like a journalist came

277
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:46,455
just to sort of

278
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:48,784
find false with me. She was paid by some fake guru

279
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:52,254
and she wrote that I eat betel nuts, which I have never eaten all my life

280
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:57,072
I wish I could because that pleases some people,

281
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,382
but I never eat I mean, I should have eaten but

282
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,348
I never eat and she said that she saw

283
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:04,557
betel nut, I don't know from which angle she saw me eating betel nuts

284
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:08,504
If she had written Bible about me

285
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,545
it would have been something funny

286
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:15,217
than that is not the authority either.

287
00:18:15,793 --> 00:18:17,791
Moreover they did not have tape recorders to

288
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,607
tape anybody's lectures or anything,

289
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,912
even His photograph was not there,

290
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,867
that is today all these things are available

291
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:27,457
so what is the authority?

292
00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:34,909
This is the problem with us is that

293
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:38,486
we accept certain thing as an authority because we think we can control

294
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:40,759
people

295
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,206
by this misappropriation of authority to ourselves.

296
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:51,702
And there have been people who have said

297
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,718
"I am the Christ". I said "alright, walk on the water"

298
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:58,747
first sign of Christ is see will He walk on the water because

299
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:01,112
He was Omkara itself, He is Omkara

300
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,313
He can walk on it, He has no body as such He can walk on the water,

301
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:07,176
alright, "walk on the water", and first step

302
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,863
maybe in the water, the second he will go down.

303
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,483
All such hocus pocus could be found out. If somebody says

304
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,602
"that, you give me money I will make you fly",

305
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:19,104
let him go off this leaning tower of Pisa

306
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:22,589
what it is meant for, after all it must be used also sometimes,

307
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,109
and throw him down, see how far he goes with flying.

308
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,295
Have a nice show for him.

309
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,820
That's how you can find out these people whether it happens or not.

310
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:44,756
So this is how I find in this country also in wagon of negativity

311
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:49,715
of these people who are here to spoil your chances of realization.

312
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:53,379
And it's very difficult to give realization to people

313
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,057
who have been to these people,

314
00:19:56,214 --> 00:19:57,424
have been initiated,

315
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:00,788
have been really spoiled in their Kundalini is rather difficult.

316
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:07,950
I have worked day in and day out to neutralize it,

317
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:14,694
and I have been working. But the interest in your Self can only come

318
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,582
when you will have self esteem

319
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:20,593
that is very important and that is the center of Vishudhi chakra.

320
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,175
This center.

321
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,932
I came up to the Heart chakra the other day

322
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,862
And now today I'm going to talk to you about the Vishudhi

323
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:35,786
Vishudhi is this centre placed at the back of the backbone here

324
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:40,087
which has given a human being a specialty,

325
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:46,049
which separates him from animals, that he raises his head upward.

326
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,494
By raising his head upward

327
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,254
he has been able

328
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,983
to create a new dimension for his brain.

329
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,945
And this new dimension is a dimension by which

330
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:05,921
he creates ego within himself.

331
00:21:10,946 --> 00:21:13,566
Before becoming a human being

332
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:19,580
I hope you can see all of you. Can I? Can you move this?

333
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:24,450
Before becoming a human being

334
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:28,349
your brain was flat

335
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:31,894
and all covered with the super ego.

336
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:37,478
At the most like dogs, or you can say the horses,

337
00:21:37,978 --> 00:21:38,818
they have the super ego.

338
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:46,608
And when you became a human being,

339
00:21:49,763 --> 00:21:52,520
a locking system took place by which

340
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:58,261
you started developing, or you can say a twist took place by which

341
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:00,348
you started developing your action.

342
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,953
For example an animal

343
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:09,380
does not know how to make a chair out of wood,

344
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:13,010
an action

345
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,352
physically, at the most it might carry this chair which is made,

346
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,934
put it there and mimic you sit on that.

347
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,314
but it cannot make anything with his hand

348
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:30,021
maybe it can weave a small little nest or something like that

349
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,315
for it to live at the most.

350
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:39,200
So you with your action can overpower the matter.

351
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:43,186
You have been able to achieve

352
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,801
great heights in overpowering

353
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,661
all the five elements by using them as

354
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:55,725
power for your everyday use also

355
00:22:56,404 --> 00:22:59,913
like, electricity, magnetism, sound, everything, ether.

356
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:02,660
But

357
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:08,160
animals

358
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,629
when they come in contact with human beings

359
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,374
they also can be conditioned

360
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:18,517
as far as

361
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:22,746
their understanding of relationship with human beings is concerned, but

362
00:23:22,806 --> 00:23:24,847
it is not that they could be made to act

363
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,349
on to some matter, and this

364
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,794
action, the physical action

365
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,294
has given a by-product

366
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,111
which is called as ego.

367
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,156
This is the beginning.

368
00:23:41,578 --> 00:23:43,578
Then the second action is

369
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:45,720
the thinking.

370
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:49,141
The animal doesn't think of the future,

371
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,641
he doesn't have any insurances.

372
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,334
Animal is not bothered about insurance,

373
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:57,726
of what will happen to my great grandchildren when I die,

374
00:23:58,445 --> 00:24:04,577
what part of my house will be going to which of my children,

375
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,077
he is not bothered about all these things

376
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:09,577
and he does not even have

377
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,941
such a sense of possession as human beings have,

378
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:16,091
so it so happens

379
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:18,508
that we start developing our ego

380
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:20,719
when we start planning for the future,

381
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,400
thinking of the future, going into the future

382
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,442
and also when we use our physical being

383
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:32,464
to create something or to do any physical work

384
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:35,886
If an animal

385
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:41,624
goes and attacks a cow or something, say a tiger,

386
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:47,214
and brings it home for his family,

387
00:24:47,714 --> 00:24:51,010
he is not proud, he is not egoistical like human beings are.

388
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,820
While human beings, if they earn about say

389
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,024
five hundred dollars they become very egoistical,

390
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,033
they think we have earned such a lot of money

391
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:04,912
and we have done so much, we have every right to dominate the wife

392
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:06,024
and vice versa.

393
00:25:07,662 --> 00:25:10,299
But an animal doesn't think he has the right to dominate,

394
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,672
see whatever he does in the nature of his own personality,

395
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:20,230
he doesn't do it as an idea that he has to do this

396
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:24,161
and he is very important and he doesn't have this ego,

397
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:27,279
so he does not even think that this is karmas

398
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:30,386
that I have to face for it and I have done something wrong

399
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:34,416
I've killed a cow so I must go a Brahmin and pay him a lot of money

400
00:25:34,476 --> 00:25:35,867
"because I have done such a sin",

401
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:39,125
these ideas do not come into the heads of an animal

402
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:42,354
because he is not used to that dimension.

403
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:45,829
A new dimension of karmas to which human beings are

404
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,109
because of this two creations,

405
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,336
because of ego, you feel you have done bad karmas or good karmas

406
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,410
if you had no ego you would never have felt that.

407
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:00,321
These two things starts at this point

408
00:26:00,353 --> 00:26:02,668
and you see it very clearly should start from there

409
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:06,101
but it's put down there, actually this start maneuvering

410
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,856
from this point,

411
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:11,442
and you start developing ego and super ego in your head

412
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,305
and you developed a triangular brain

413
00:26:16,303 --> 00:26:20,457
a prism like brain and when such a brain has developed

414
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:26,305
then a new problem starts that through this prism

415
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,406
whatever energy passes into it

416
00:26:30,418 --> 00:26:31,850
most of it goes out

417
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:34,966
according to the parallelogram of forces

418
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,978
that I have no time just now to tell you.

419
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:41,531
Because of that your attention is all the time outside

420
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:44,382
you can only do something outside

421
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:46,367
you cannot take your attention inside.

422
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,060
Now supposing I say, "you put your attention inside"

423
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,990
because you have to go inside you cannot do it

424
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,261
you just can't do it.

425
00:26:54,761 --> 00:26:56,291
your attention is always outside

426
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:58,851
"I have to do this this, I have to go there, I have to get it"

427
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,792
But you cannot put your attention inside, that's not possible.

428
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:05,979
I cannot just order you that you put your attention inside,

429
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,876
some happening has to take place within you.

430
00:27:09,376 --> 00:27:12,436
Supposing something is suddenly falls of then your attention goes there

431
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:16,166
In the same way when the happening of the Kundalini awakening takes place,

432
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:21,693
then your attention goes through that

433
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:25,373
which is awakened there and you just start seeing the awakening,

434
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:27,518
or, you can say, the feel the awakening,

435
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,063
but it is such a quick thing,

436
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:32,024
a split of a second,

437
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:33,902
that sometimes you miss everything

438
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:36,759
except that you see the cool breeze has started flowing through you.

439
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,876
Sometimes you do feel, it's here,

440
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:42,190
it's here, so many people feel that way also

441
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,060
it's come up now, and it's here throbbing,

442
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,475
now its alright, it has started working.

443
00:27:48,461 --> 00:27:51,305
It depends on what sort of runway you have,

444
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,379
if the runway is horrid,

445
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,501
then you see you go on feeling all the bumps and the dumps and everything.

446
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:01,827
Sometimes the runways are so badly spoiled

447
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,226
that it takes sometimes months for the Kundalini to rise,

448
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,456
but now I think

449
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,369
in Sahaja Yoga we have developed such methods and techniques,

450
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:15,512
of such permutations and combinations,

451
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:19,434
that nowadays it's much easier to raise the Kundalini

452
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:22,501
than it was, about say, ten years back.

453
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:27,104
Then I had about twenty disciples

454
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:30,858
with whom I worked for two years to give them realization.

455
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,099
In London I had six disciples for four years I have worked on them

456
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:38,909
to give them realization. But today we have thousands in UK

457
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:41,195
and we have lots of them in Sydney also

458
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,009
And in India also we have thousands.

459
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:45,594
Where they just get it in a second,

460
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:49,511
but it is a different thing now because it has evolved so well.

461
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:53,412
But this happening is a living happening,

462
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:57,360
this you cannot do, you can jump, you can stand on your heads

463
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,177
take off your clothes, wear some badges, wear some clothes, you can do all that

464
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,952
but you cannot make

465
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:06,170
the Kundalini rise in the sense you see the pulsation there at the

466
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,542
triangular bone, you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini there,

467
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:12,031
actual pulsation, you can see the rising of the Kundalini.

468
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:13,510
You see it.

469
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,141
You also feel the cool breeze rising,

470
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:24,209
you can also with a stethoscope feel the sound, lap lap lap lap

471
00:29:25,252 --> 00:29:27,830
coming up to here which Kabir has very clearly said

472
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,101
/?/

473
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:36,946
at the apex of the /?/ zero apex of your head.

474
00:29:37,446 --> 00:29:41,468
You hear first the anahata. Anahata is this

475
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:43,698
sound of the heart without percussion,

476
00:29:45,027 --> 00:29:47,312
and that is how you feel the Kundalini there

477
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,946
and then it breaks through you feel it

478
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,046
actually on your fingers,

479
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:54,117
it is an actualization of the experience.

480
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:56,617
This is what the baptism is.

481
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,429
When Warren  said that

482
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,586
you have never had your real baptism,

483
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:04,666
do not be angry.

484
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:07,310
Because it is a fact,

485
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,753
you have not got your realization.

486
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:14,835
Christ has said that you have to be born again, hundred times He said,

487
00:30:15,406 --> 00:30:17,406
so now they are started saying we are born again,

488
00:30:17,906 --> 00:30:19,228
it's again self certification.

489
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,811
First of all is to use your baptism,

490
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:24,838
now there is this another thing started, that we are born again.

491
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:30,433
Now they come and ask, these people they change from one to another.

492
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:34,100
That how is it through Christ,

493
00:30:35,971 --> 00:30:37,984
you have to get trough and you will see,

494
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,876
only in Sahaja Yoga you will understand that,

495
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:43,250
ultimately you have to pass through the gate of Christ only,

496
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:46,218
to enter into the Kingdom of God. It is a fact,

497
00:30:46,718 --> 00:30:48,503
what He said, He never told lies.

498
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,789
He told the complete truth,

499
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:55,139
nothing but the truth. But the way you interpret it,

500
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:57,426
the way you understand it, it is so narrow,

501
00:30:57,926 --> 00:30:59,484
that you do not want to accept it.

502
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:05,787
This is the gate about which He has talked

503
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:09,119
and this is the greatest thing He has done to us.

504
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:16,528
Now this Vishudhi chakra is the centre of Shri Krishna.

505
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:19,499
If I say this is the centre of Shri Krishna

506
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:22,642
you may start doubting me.

507
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,934
You should doubt me also,

508
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:28,118
it is not problem, with Indians because they know it is the centre,

509
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,696
they know about centres they know where Krishna resides.

510
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,838
and they know there are sixteen petals to this

511
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:36,949
and that they know that he is

512
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:40,728
called as the complete incarnation of the sixteen petals, and all that they know,

513
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,928
I do not have to quarrel with them.

514
00:31:43,785 --> 00:31:47,726
And the centre here of Christ

515
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,673
is actually a little bit confusing because it is called as Mahavishnu.

516
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:54,596
In Indians literature is called as Mahavishnu,

517
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,898
not as Christ, and He is also

518
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:01,581
is Bodha not Buddha, but Bodha,

519
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:03,852
which they got a little bit confused

520
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:10,821
in our old scriptures it is a difference of language.

521
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
In one of my lectures on Christ

522
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
you will find out about His origin,

523
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:20,403
why He was called Jesus, why He was called Christ

524
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:24,587
and what is the origin of these things,

525
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:27,205
why He arrived, who was His mother

526
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:31,416
and everything you will find out from that lecture that I have got for you.

527
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,246
It is better that you go through that lecture

528
00:32:34,404 --> 00:32:36,752
and see for yourself. We have lots of these tapes

529
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:42,314
already in Sydney they can sent it over to you, you can look at it

530
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,528
from that angle I mean in this

531
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:49,354
small little time I cannot elaborately talk about Krishna,

532
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:51,322
and about Christ,

533
00:32:52,237 --> 00:32:55,074
but the only thing I have to tell that

534
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:57,532
there is a very great relationship between both of them,

535
00:32:58,032 --> 00:33:01,456
and Krist is the word that comes from the word Krishna,

536
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,956
and Kist in India is means

537
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,969
the agriculture and Krishna

538
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:09,364
also come from Krishi which also means agriculture.

539
00:33:10,232 --> 00:33:12,983
Agriculture means the one where you sow,

540
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:20,163
and they are the sowers of the seed. They have sown the seed in the fields.

541
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:27,266
So the sowing of the seed is done by Shri Krishna,

542
00:33:27,566 --> 00:33:29,566
and the Gita that he has described

543
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:33,854
is also another very interesting thing about which we are very much confused.

544
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:39,606
Krishna never wrote Gita, first of all,

545
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:44,450
it was never written by an absolute Brahmin or anything who was a born brahmin,

546
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:48,710
it was written by the illegitimate child of a fisher woman.

547
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:56,888
How can he write, a man like that that you are born as a Brahmin

548
00:33:58,218 --> 00:34:01,469
you are to be born as a Brahmin what he was meaning,

549
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:03,969
that when you are born as a Brahmin

550
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,741
then you have the aptitude to see God.

551
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:09,241
For example you are all Brahmins in his own words.

552
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:10,966
That means you are the seekers of God,

553
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,870
all the seekers of God are Brahmins

554
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,430
and the seekers of power are /?/,

555
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,234
and the seekers of money are /?/,

556
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:25,540
it meant the aptitude, but Hindus as usual

557
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,148
have made like all others, have made a mess of all that philosophy.

558
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:33,349
According to them if you are born a Brahmin,

559
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,461
even if you are the greatest crook of the world, you are a Brahmin.

560
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:44,050
And even if you are a person who is a

561
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,937
very highly evolved person, if you are not

562
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:50,639
born in a Brahmin family, then you are good for nothing.

563
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,377
This caste system is such a horrible thing in India,

564
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,596
which has no explanation at all in the scriptures because

565
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:02,832
it is written that in everyone resides the spirit,

566
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,332
there is spirit in everyone of you,

567
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:07,945
how can you have caste system you can have aptitudes,

568
00:35:09,117 --> 00:35:12,638
but as usual people have escapes for everything,

569
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:16,813
this point that everybody has the spirit within yourself.

570
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:22,360
Gita has described it, that everyone has the spirit within,

571
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,673
but one has to know when he says there is spirit within you

572
00:35:26,902 --> 00:35:30,794
that means his meaning the human being have the spirit, not the devils.

573
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:37,320
Because Krishna himself has killed so many devils in his lifetime,

574
00:35:37,577 --> 00:35:40,157
his one of the powers was /?/, means killing

575
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:43,487
He used to kill so many devils so there are devils also

576
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,072
on this principle that there is spirit in everybody

577
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,229
why did he kill so many devils?

578
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:51,509
The devils do not have spirit in them.

579
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:54,127
There are devils, and devils and devils,

580
00:35:54,441 --> 00:35:56,441
for example say, Hitler

581
00:35:56,625 --> 00:35:59,113
if he comes to ask for a realisation,

582
00:35:59,313 --> 00:36:01,313
do you think he can get it or he should get it?

583
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:06,520
His greatest reward would be

584
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:10,497
a rigorous imprisonment into hell

585
00:36:10,997 --> 00:36:12,997
or all his lives to come.

586
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:26,307
how can you be so sure that he wasn't Krishna casting out devils, more devils?

587
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:28,254
he was not

588
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:33,801
how can you be so sure that Hitler was not Krishna casting out devils?

589
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,371
For that you must get your realization. That's why,

590
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:41,886
you see, the surety will only will come then you become your absolute.

591
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:43,644
Just now, you cannot be sure.

592
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,964
For example I'll tell you, when you get your realization,

593
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:50,486
you get your vibrations, alright? Now with these vibrations

594
00:36:50,715 --> 00:36:53,291
you can find out what is true and what is not true.

595
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:55,322
Now you may say this maybe is all the myth.

596
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:59,994
For example we had some Brahmins in one of the programs I had first arranged,

597
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:03,144
and I didn't know they had a fight with this organizers

598
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,697
but they said, "She is not a Brahmin, how can have they a program here", or something like that.

599
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:08,440
And they were sitting in the front row

600
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:11,229
I did not know that they had a quarrel I just asked them

601
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,098
I said,

602
00:37:14,957 --> 00:37:20,633
"who is Brahmin among you, who thinks he is a Brahmin, just come forward",

603
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:25,362
so five, six of them, you see, like great wrestlers came and sat before me,

604
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,576
I said "alright please be seated" very arrogant

605
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,906
I said "sit down", I said "put your hands towards me like this"

606
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,853
and they started shaking their hands,

607
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:37,357
they got little frightened. I said, "why are you shaking?",

608
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:41,665
they said, "because we are Brahmins, and you are the power, that's why we are shaking."

609
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,861
I said, see your neighbors, "they are also shaking"

610
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:46,997
"yes yes they are also shaking, they might be also Brahmins."

611
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,669
I said, "please ask them what are they",

612
00:37:49,223 --> 00:37:52,837
they are some people, they said "these are the people who had come from a lunatic asylum".

613
00:37:56,146 --> 00:37:58,346
These were the only two people where shaking there,

614
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,846
I said "now relatively you can see now

615
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,909
that when you thought you are the Brahmin, you are mad too to believe into such a thing".

616
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,501
Now to believe that Hitler was also good,

617
00:38:12,412 --> 00:38:14,412
is a typical sign of escaping,

618
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,022
in life horrible things,

619
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:26,669
you see, just to have an idea that everything is fine,

620
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:29,187
is the best way of jumping into the devils' den.

621
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,021
And that's what has happened with people, that they never doubted anyone.

622
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:39,776
And I don't know from where do people get these ideas

623
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:42,239
everybody's life, even Christ,

624
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,915
he too a hinter in His hand and He was whipping all the people.

625
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:52,412
He was love, He was compassion, no doubt, but He did whip them,

626
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:56,194
He also said that "don't throw pearls before the swines".

627
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,489
His compassion had a special purpose, which I will tell you just now, why

628
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:03,989
He got himself crucified also,

629
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,826
which is a very important thing,

630
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:09,937
but when we just say that everything is fine, everything is good,

631
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:13,577
the reason is we do not want to face the reality.

632
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:19,184
Because, perhaps maybe we cannot understand

633
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:20,932
that there could be anything bad,

634
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,915
but after realization, you will discover

635
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:26,272
that yourself there are problems,

636
00:39:27,112 --> 00:39:30,689
yourself there is something wrong with you, leave alone others!

637
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:34,337
There are problems within you which you have not seen and faced.

638
00:39:35,087 --> 00:39:39,226
Perhaps there are problems within you, which you have not wanted to see in others

639
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:41,906
because then you will not be able to justify them.

640
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:44,602
But after realization you get out of yourself.

641
00:39:44,977 --> 00:39:46,238
Like this sari I am wearing,

642
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:48,236
if I am not identified with it,

643
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,648
I see a spot I would like to clean it,

644
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:52,636
I see it I want to clean it

645
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,049
I don't say it is a good thing to have the spots there,

646
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:57,445
but supposing I am identified, I'll hide it.

647
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,675
I'll say, "oh, there's nothing, nothing wrong, everything is alright".

648
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,614
There are evil doers, not one,

649
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,863
but so many these days, that you have not at all any idea, if you had

650
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:12,416
you would not have lost so much.

651
00:40:15,132 --> 00:40:15,738
Beg pardon.

652
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:25,798
Would you be able to just leave your questions till the end. Mataji will invite questions at the end.

653
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:26,228
Alright?

654
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,189
Now the thing is

655
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:35,084
whatever happens to us in our consciousness,

656
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:38,426
is only limited to our human awareness,

657
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:41,833
whatever we see in our human awareness,

658
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,845
at the time when Krishna came, we got our human awareness,

659
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,731
in that what do we have? only two points,

660
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:52,863
one is our super ego, which is our conditioning,

661
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,871
another is our ego,

662
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:58,515
which we have achieved as a myth that

663
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:03,170
we have done this, I am this, I am that, I like this, you like this.

664
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,706
So we are only two things, either super ego, or ego.

665
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:10,818
We wobble between the two.

666
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:17,085
The third thing, which should be within us, is our spirit in the heart.

667
00:41:18,423 --> 00:41:23,704
And for that the central point is the point, by which we balance,

668
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,190
between these two, between the desire and the action.

669
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:35,302
We go on balancing in the center, by understanding what is the best.

670
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:36,959
For example a person drinks a lot,

671
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:39,271
he kills himself by drinking.

672
00:41:39,876 --> 00:41:41,876
He certainly not read any book

673
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,913
to know that drinking is bad, he knows that this is bad

674
00:41:44,942 --> 00:41:46,905
his father is killed because of drinking, so

675
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:53,988
he takes a life which is very much with moderation towards it.

676
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,186
You start learning by so many experiences,

677
00:41:57,686 --> 00:42:01,960
right and wrong, how to be in the centre, that's all you can learn with human awarenes,

678
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:04,614
if you can only learn how to be in the centre.

679
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:09,364
Now, you have to go beyond this human awareness

680
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:11,864
to be the awareness of the spirit,

681
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:15,325
and when you become the awareness of the spirit,

682
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:17,580
that you should become

683
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:21,312
that you should ask for, that should be our goal,

684
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,117
when you become that then the whole picture becomes different.

685
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:30,285
Because you can feel it yourself, and understand

686
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,372
what is right and wrong.

687
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,665
On your vibratory awareness, which is a new dimension within you.

688
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:41,395
Even children. Say, take ten children who are realized souls.

689
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,366
If you ask them what is the matter with another person,

690
00:42:46,506 --> 00:42:49,204
they will immediately raise the same finger and say this is the matter.

691
00:42:50,158 --> 00:42:52,297
And you ask the person "have you got a very bad

692
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,797
cold, cough or something bronchitis", and he will say, "yes".

693
00:42:57,618 --> 00:43:00,584
If this hand is shows that means all the left side,

694
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:02,628
that means he suffering from emotional trouble.

695
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,963
You do not know anything about your chakras at all before realization.

696
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,661
One must accept this one has to accept

697
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:15,208
whatever it is there is nothing wrong in it, it is only your ego which stops that,

698
00:43:15,376 --> 00:43:16,126
not accepting.

699
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:21,104
And then once you get your realization you start feeling your

700
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:24,839
different centres, you start feeling it actually you start feeling it

701
00:43:25,614 --> 00:43:28,014
and you start feeling the centres of others.

702
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:31,682
Anyone who wants to know whether this person is evil or not

703
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:33,348
is only to ask the question

704
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:36,491
and you can feel it, you can't even bear some of those,

705
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:39,580
horrible vibrations you get from people.

706
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,556
Some of the Sahaja yogis try for

707
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:45,630
asking for some devilish people and they got

708
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:48,240
actual blisters, especially Mr. Hitler,

709
00:43:48,478 --> 00:43:49,439
whom you are supporting now.

710
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,376
actual blisters on a finger, actual blisters.

711
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,753
This is what it is. After realization

712
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:03,322
your real absolute self comes in because you become spirit

713
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:04,293
which is in the heart.

714
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:07,649
The spirit resides in the heart

715
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,550
but this is the place of its' seat.

716
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,050
There are seven seats in the head,

717
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,804
and the seat of the spirit is here.

718
00:44:15,955 --> 00:44:18,746
When the Kundalini goes, it is just a very

719
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,225
small thread of Kundalini rises because there are lots of problems

720
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:25,946
and a very small through the Brahma nadi, the centre most

721
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:29,456
channel, which rises and opens this

722
00:44:29,642 --> 00:44:31,872
when it opens it the grace comes down,

723
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:33,757
and when the grace comes down

724
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:37,140
you get completely relaxed, because it falls on the both the sides

725
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,388
on the ida and pingala nadi, which are manifesting our left and right
sympathetic nervous system.

726
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:49,343
By which you first feel relaxed, thoughtless, and then

727
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:51,634
when it is little bit established

728
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,594
you start feeling the cool breeze,

729
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:56,094
because your spirit has started manifesting

730
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,615
and you just feel a cool breeze,

731
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:00,624
like a wind coming into you.

732
00:45:01,124 --> 00:45:03,124
First you may feel tingling, heat,

733
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:04,437
all that is going out,

734
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:07,656
sometimes people a little bit shake also, because if the nerves are not

735
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,896
properly built up,

736
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,465
if they do not have the strength to bear it,

737
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,630
then it sometimes happens that you shake a little bit, doesn't matter.

738
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,163
after some time you start sustaining it.

739
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,730
It takes time in some people

740
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,230
in some people it doesn't take time at all.

741
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:29,869
It is the quality of your central path of Sushumna is important.

742
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,648
If it is very simple,

743
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,079
there is no problem, then the Kundalini takes no time

744
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:39,579
She is anxiously waiting, She is your mother,

745
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:43,353
She is the pure desire within you, the power

746
00:45:43,504 --> 00:45:45,749
to become one with your spirit.

747
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:49,420
Unless and until you achieve it, whatever you may try,

748
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,800
you do anything you like, you spoil your Sushumna,

749
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,938
but you'll have to get it otherwise your seeking will not be over,

750
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,425
you have to reach the place where you should say "I have found it."

751
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:03,231
If you have not found the spirit,

752
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:07,476
you will never be happy with anything sort of thing you do.

753
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:11,008
Anything you do. Be kind to yourself.

754
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:14,590
Be gracious to yourself and get your realization.

755
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:17,507
This is the simple thing as a mother I would like to tell you.

756
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:21,646
There is nothing to be done except by getting realisation.

757
00:46:22,006 --> 00:46:23,353
But if you are an adamant person,

758
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:26,486
and if you are employed by some of the gurus to come here,

759
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,597
or you are running a

760
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,176
lawyers job for other gurus and all that, you cannot get realization.

761
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:35,904
I am sorry if you cannot get it, I cannot help it.

762
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,499
But you have to identify with yourself

763
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:40,737
and see to it that you want to have it

764
00:46:40,905 --> 00:46:43,855
then only you will get it, if you do not have a desire to have it

765
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:46,357
you will not get it, at any cost.

766
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:49,006
You are not to be forced into it,

767
00:46:49,286 --> 00:46:51,500
your freedom is completely respected.

768
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,762
If your freedom is not respected, how are you going to enjoy

769
00:46:55,826 --> 00:46:57,561
the freedom of your spirit.

770
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:02,751
So it is completely in your hands, to be free

771
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:06,124
to accept, whether to get realization or not.

772
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:09,828
Now this chakra of Vishudhi is very important

773
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:14,473
because there are sixteen sub-plexuses which are looked after by it,

774
00:47:14,571 --> 00:47:16,571
for example ear, nose, throat,

775
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:22,674
all these things are looked after by this centre of Shri Krishna,

776
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:29,469
and this centre has got two sides, one is the left, and one is the right side,

777
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:35,156
I have to talk about it because most of the people in the West

778
00:47:35,429 --> 00:47:37,922
somehow suffer from the left Vishudhi,

779
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,422
one of them is the reason maybe smoking,

780
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:45,294
right is more affected by smoking, but later on it goes to the left also.

781
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,653
But I think. The more important is that,

782
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:52,665
you people have developed a theory, I don't know how,

783
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:55,132
that you have to be guilty for everything.

784
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:57,894
Maybe it is from your childhood,

785
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:02,192
you are brought up this way, don't spoil the carpet, don't spoil that,

786
00:48:02,377 --> 00:48:04,377
don't do this and don't do that,

787
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:08,228
maybe your confessions in the churches maybe, I don't know what to blame

788
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:13,632
but it is a very good indulgence for people to sit down "so I shouldn’t have done this

789
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:17,379
I should not have done that" criticizing yourself and analyzing yourself.

790
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:23,020
This is also a very good escape of egoistical people.

791
00:48:24,726 --> 00:48:27,664
They are egoistical they dominate others,

792
00:48:27,832 --> 00:48:30,026
and then they sit down and weep on their left Vishudhi.

793
00:48:31,103 --> 00:48:33,611
This left Vishudhi is such a dangerous thing,

794
00:48:34,356 --> 00:48:38,358
that it creates problems of the worst nature in human beings.

795
00:48:38,858 --> 00:48:42,271
For example, if you have say,

796
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:44,771
any cancerous growth within you

797
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:48,651
and if you have left Vishudhi, it is going to be difficult to cure you.

798
00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:53,446
Because the escape of the Kundalini has to be through the Vishudhi chakra,

799
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:58,258
and the Vishudhi chakra on left hand side is very

800
00:48:58,308 --> 00:49:02,018
important for the escape of all these tensions of the cancer.

801
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:06,036
And if you have this kind of a bad habit of sitting down and indulging

802
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:10,155
into this kind of a nonsensical thing, like sitting down like Lord Byron

803
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:15,123
and reading some sort of a tragedy and making it a tragedy out of you, it is a drama going on!

804
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:19,322
 What is there to be tragic about you? What is wrong with you?

805
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:23,674
You are very rich people, you have everything, still why do you want to cry and weep

806
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:27,338
all the time you are in a crying mood, why? God has given you so much.

807
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:32,097
do you ever said that, count your blessings one by one?

808
00:49:32,693 --> 00:49:36,613
How many blessings you have got? You don't know. You are specially blessed people, especially

809
00:49:36,688 --> 00:49:40,650
in this Australia, I think you are specially blessed. But you want to show that you are

810
00:49:40,725 --> 00:49:44,238
extremely miserable. The worst at this are the French I would say.

811
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:46,155
Because when I went to France, they said,

812
00:49:46,322 --> 00:49:49,646
"Mother never say that you are a happy person because they will think you are not sensitive",

813
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,841
I said, "Really?",

814
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,727
you think this French are very sensitive people, to what?

815
00:49:57,102 --> 00:49:58,173
Not to holiness,

816
00:49:59,944 --> 00:50:00,918
not to purity,

817
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:05,031
they are sensitive to God knows what. Ten feet you walk and you find a prostitute

818
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:06,040
standing on the road,

819
00:50:07,623 --> 00:50:11,432
and about ten feet you walk and you find three alcoholics lying on the street,

820
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:14,760
these are sensitive people? Are they sensitive to their spirit?

821
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:17,588
What are they sensitive to? And what are the crying about?

822
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:20,443
This a very good thing that in the night you drink a lot,

823
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:23,215
sleep with ten women and in the morning you feel guilty.

824
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:28,110
Who has asked them to go into this kind of a mess

825
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:32,561
and then to come and sit down and cry "Oh I'm so guilty, I have done so wrong and so wrong."

826
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:37,269
That is why I have to talk about it, that this centre,

827
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:41,461
is very important also because it is the sister of Shri Krishna,

828
00:50:41,524 --> 00:50:43,128
Vishnumaya who rules it.

829
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:46,128
The relationship between brother and sister

830
00:50:46,295 --> 00:50:49,403
is absolutely gone haven in this country.

831
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:50,938
In all the Western countries,

832
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,126
for us Indians we do not understand,

833
00:50:53,272 --> 00:50:54,599
really we cannot understand.

834
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,310
And we cannot explain what it is, the other day only

835
00:50:57,435 --> 00:50:58,993
we had a very interesting talk,

836
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,097
because two Indians have come with me, very

837
00:51:01,264 --> 00:51:02,649
very great Sahaja yogis they are,

838
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:04,560
they said "Mother, why did you say

839
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:07,757
why did they said, that the girl cannot hold the hand of a girl?"

840
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:12,452
I said, "you won't understand." They said, "no, no, but we would like know,

841
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:15,452
we went to say we should close all our girls' schools

842
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:16,757
girls schools in India?

843
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:20,853
I mean a girl can easily hold the hand of a girl, it is much better."

844
00:51:20,895 --> 00:51:21,624
 I said " why

845
00:51:21,854 --> 00:51:25,098
this people say, you see is rather difficult for you to understand."

846
00:51:25,509 --> 00:51:27,509
Now, he said, "but one thing I can't understand

847
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:33,506
that if a girl holds the hand of a man will that be a holier relationship?"

848
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:35,697
See the accept.

849
00:51:37,301 --> 00:51:38,749
They think will it be holy

850
00:51:39,811 --> 00:51:41,811
to hold the hand of a man, it won't be.

851
00:51:43,722 --> 00:51:45,530
But the girl is a holy relationships.

852
00:51:46,189 --> 00:51:48,189
To this holy relationship is lost,

853
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:52,180
in the so called ventures of the brains, you see

854
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,551
like, you see if you go and see

855
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:58,860
the zoo. If there is a wombat,

856
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,617
it behaves like a wombat, you see,

857
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,351
if there is a monkey, it behaves like a monkey,

858
00:52:04,681 --> 00:52:07,761
if there is a tiger, it behaves like a tiger,

859
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:09,816
but a human being if you put him in the zoo,

860
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:13,738
you will see, he will eat up all the fruits,

861
00:52:14,142 --> 00:52:18,299
he will cut down all the trees, he will go to all the depths of it,

862
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:22,511
and he will break his nose, he will lose his ears,

863
00:52:22,629 --> 00:52:26,408
he will spoil his eyes, he cannot sit quietly.

864
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:30,559
You will give him a tree, he will eat the fruit,

865
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,203
he will eat the seed

866
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,289
he will have a bark inside himself,

867
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:38,312
he will have all the roots inside himself,

868
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,766
he will do whatever is possible, it's so horrid with this brain the way it is moving,

869
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:45,457
all the time in this direction, that direction, that direction

870
00:52:45,649 --> 00:52:47,649
it wants to bang on all the sights.

871
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:48,504
For what?

872
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:52,537
it cannot sit right, you see, when he is sitting

873
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:56,678
for five minutes he thinks it is a jail, it is so boring,

874
00:52:56,743 --> 00:52:58,954
so he must go and do something very important.

875
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,264
And what is the important thing he does?

876
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,350
Is to really ruin himself.

877
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:06,876
He must go to a pub, he must go to a friend,

878
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,460
he must go somewhere

879
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:11,128
he will really ruin himself for his holiness

880
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:12,855
and all his sense of self esteem.

881
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:17,956
That's why we have no sense as to what is a sister.

882
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,072
the relationship of a sister with other women.

883
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:27,729
This is so much missing that to talk about it in England was impossible; they said this is a Victorian

884
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:29,368
even an early lady talking

885
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,772
you see, they brand it, you are Victorian, you are Georgian

886
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:36,285
or you are...anyway everything moves according to the kings that rule that

887
00:53:36,444 --> 00:53:37,267
horrible England

888
00:53:37,437 --> 00:53:40,365
and the kings themselves being so horrible,

889
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:44,692
and the kings themselves were such horrible things.

890
00:53:44,779 --> 00:53:46,779
I mean. I don't know how they were for them.

891
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:50,250
So you are branded a Georgian or this or that,

892
00:53:50,337 --> 00:53:53,669
whatever you say, they cannot see the integration of anything,

893
00:53:53,776 --> 00:53:57,724
they just, one center they will catch "oh this is absolutely Victorian",

894
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:00,585
I said "alright, doesn't matter, but is good

895
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:04,810
whether you like it or not". As if Victorian everything to be condemned,

896
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,074
there must be something good about it also.

897
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:10,609
This is how the whole outlook is of the people

898
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:13,492
all the time trying to brand others, what about yourself?

899
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:16,366
What brand are you to give to yourself?

900
00:54:16,493 --> 00:54:18,493
That's the point nobody wants to see.

901
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:19,968
What brand am I?

902
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:23,771
What is my brand? I’m a brat. That's what you are.

903
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:26,930
You see, sometimes I feel so many people the way they think

904
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:31,087
they have no sense, like in the night like nocturnal animals would

905
00:54:31,253 --> 00:54:33,154
dash into that and that into that,

906
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:37,172
that's how they have broken themselves completely like mad, for what?

907
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,816
Keep quiet. Be in the centre.

908
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:45,331
You had to just wait, it was going to happen, this is your own,

909
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:47,828
you are the people who are searching the truth,

910
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:51,008
for which it is all created, the whole scene is there,

911
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:54,529
you are just get it, why are you breaking everything that

912
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:57,903
God has given you, it is such a beautiful being He has created,

913
00:54:58,052 --> 00:55:00,403
you are the most beautiful person,

914
00:55:00,903 --> 00:55:04,611
have you seen that when you go to the zoo all the animals are looking at you?

915
00:55:12,465 --> 00:55:15,022
In the same way they are looking forward to you,

916
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:18,297
what have you got to give to them, I don't know.

917
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:21,818
But once you have your realization

918
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:26,174
then you will know the meaning of your being, then you will know what you are.

919
00:55:26,382 --> 00:55:28,382
And this is what one has to establish.

920
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:32,042
We have really done lots of wrongs to ourselves

921
00:55:32,334 --> 00:55:34,748
by not understanding really, self estimation.

922
00:55:36,831 --> 00:55:39,395
One must know that you are a diamond,

923
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:42,749
that you are the spirit,

924
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:46,347
that you have to rise into the Kingdom of God,

925
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:49,496
you are specially made for this purpose,

926
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:54,062
right royal people you are,

927
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:56,861
that you have to climbed up there, instead of that

928
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:59,454
you are lost into your egos and super egos

929
00:55:59,537 --> 00:56:03,829
and frantically what you are doing is completely destroying

930
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:05,892
all the chances of your ascent

931
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:09,084
which is so easily to be done. It is such a living force

932
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:13,746
which is going to work out, it is not going to harm you in any way

933
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:16,163
it is for you only,

934
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:20,147
it is all there, it is Sahaja, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

935
00:56:20,355 --> 00:56:23,888
and it is going to work out, only thing we have to know

936
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:26,923
that you have not to treat yourself so shabbily

937
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:29,994
and with such hatred towards yourself.

938
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:34,590
There is no need to have such a low opinion about yourself.

939
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:41,668
This is the left side, the right side of course is of the people who talk big,

940
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,674
you see, who say this

941
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:50,474
who say, the great politicians, things who just

942
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:54,430
talk down people, when they speak they just dominate

943
00:56:54,472 --> 00:56:57,749
and by their speech they control people.

944
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:03,035
This centre, right side people have who are hot tempered and

945
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:07,443
who lose temper and frighten people with their tempers, you see, they say such horrible things

946
00:57:07,464 --> 00:57:10,798
that people are just frightened of them and just to keep them quiet

947
00:57:10,881 --> 00:57:12,005
they manage somehow.

948
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:14,609
This type of people have the right Vishudhi

949
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:19,055
they also have when they have the colds, coughs and all that it is a balance come to them,

950
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:23,957
when they have to talk too much also they have to have this problem of right Vishudhi

951
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:25,989
and sometimes some people

952
00:57:26,052 --> 00:57:27,820
suddenly lose their voices, you see

953
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:32,312
when they talk too much also they lose voices because the balance is created within them.

954
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,768
Now the centre one is of Shri Khrishna.

955
00:57:36,997 --> 00:57:41,398
Shri Krishna is the one who creates the witness within us,

956
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:44,845
He is the one who refuted all kinds of

957
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,277
formal ritualistic things in religion.

958
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,208
But He didn't become a hippie, that's one thing one should understand,

959
00:57:52,479 --> 00:57:54,479
that He didn't go to another extreme.

960
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,589
You see when He said that all these junks and formal things that are there,

961
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:03,022
He didn't say that you take to drugs, another nonsensical formal thing,

962
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:06,673
He said that if you have to get over these things,

963
00:58:06,965 --> 00:58:08,965
you have to see it as a drama,

964
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:12,591
the whole thing is a joke going on, it is a drama going on,

965
00:58:12,883 --> 00:58:15,355
but for that you have to become,

966
00:58:15,522 --> 00:58:19,540
it's not a question of your achieving it by rational thinking,

967
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,879
you have to go beyond your mind to achieve it,

968
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:26,120
and that going beyond is done by the Kundalini.

969
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:30,077
Now He did not do it does not mean He was not in it,

970
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,013
He was very much there, like a painting you have first you have the background,

971
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:37,377
then you have another color, then you have your third color,

972
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,836
now the fourth color, and now the time has come

973
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:42,107
for the whole picture to be ready.

974
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:46,792
Everybody has played their part, a very important part in our evolution,

975
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:49,774
everyone is needed, among you may be many

976
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:52,170
who might be having a problem with Shri Krishna

977
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:55,965
especially Hare Rama Hare Krishna people, they suffer

978
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:59,034
mostly from throat cancers, you can go and find out.

979
00:58:59,388 --> 00:59:02,541
Because they go against Shri Krishna,

980
00:59:02,791 --> 00:59:06,046
by taking His name so vainly on Oxford street, they will stand

981
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:08,088
with those things they get in the market,

982
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:10,867
put them here, attached it here, and go on dancing.

983
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:14,060
Making mockery out of Shri Krishna's dignity

984
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:18,672
like that and apart from that they take a name unauthorized.

985
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,900
Who has given them authority to take the name of Shri Krishna?

986
00:59:23,317 --> 00:59:25,126
They spoil this chakra doubly

987
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:28,268
because if you take to mantras you spoil left Vishudhi very badly.

988
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:32,058
All those who have taken these so-called mantras

989
00:59:33,246 --> 00:59:34,873
have spoiled their left Vishudhi,

990
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:41,238
because these mantras are not like one mantra to someone.

991
00:59:41,446 --> 00:59:44,573
I mean, are we only one chakra, or part of a chakras?

992
00:59:45,406 --> 00:59:48,006
And that too like Tinga means this,

993
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:50,867
and all these things, where are they within us?

994
00:59:53,784 --> 00:59:55,784
They ran short of the names I think

995
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:58,774
so they started getting hold of any names that they felt like,

996
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:01,709
or they were sinister to give such horrible names to you.

997
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:03,959
Left Vishudhi you catch so badly.

998
01:00:04,459 --> 01:00:07,615
Mostly people who take to mantras you will find when they speak

999
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:12,216
their lower jaw moves like this, they have difficulty in talking.

1000
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,525
They cannot talk properly.

1001
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:18,145
This is one of the things you will find with them

1002
01:00:18,645 --> 01:00:22,458
they have pain in the left hand side, they have pain at the back,

1003
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:29,951
this is the beginning of it. Any mantra given to you has to have logical meaning.

1004
01:00:30,076 --> 01:00:33,355
It's a big science of mantra, it is not something nonsensical,

1005
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:35,855
that you come here, I will give you a flower, finished.

1006
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:38,211
It is a big science, you see how many deities there are.

1007
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:43,920
You must know where the problem is, it is like a Kundalini

1008
01:00:44,795 --> 01:00:49,336
rising in its living power you know that here is an obstruction,

1009
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:52,758
and you want to get rid of that obstruction, then you say there

1010
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:55,071
the password, and you pass trough

1011
01:00:55,425 --> 01:00:58,729
but then Kundalini has not started, what is the use of having a mantra?

1012
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,648
The Kundalini is frozen out there,

1013
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,944
and you are saying a mantra for a chakra, now it would be something like this,

1014
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:08,090
"that I am frozen in England"

1015
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:10,590
and I'm saying a password for a bridge here.

1016
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:16,571
It is absurd. Because you are so naive about it,

1017
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:19,024
our Indian modern

1018
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:22,342
people also who think they are very westernized and sophisticated,

1019
01:01:22,842 --> 01:01:24,842
they also are equally naive,

1020
01:01:25,342 --> 01:01:27,784
they don't want to read anything about the scriptures,

1021
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,656
they are not translated in English

1022
01:01:30,656 --> 01:01:32,656
they do not know anything about mantra Vidya

1023
01:01:33,571 --> 01:01:35,240
the mantra has to be

1024
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:38,804
connected with your development in your Kundalini.

1025
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:40,888
Not only that, but it should relate

1026
01:01:41,219 --> 01:01:42,458
to the movement of the Kundalini.

1027
01:01:43,896 --> 01:01:46,504
It should be given by a person who is a realized soul.

1028
01:01:47,296 --> 01:01:50,731
Jagrut, awakened, mantra has to be awakened.

1029
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:57,316
And that you will find in Sahaja Yoga that it is such a temporary thing.

1030
01:01:57,816 --> 01:02:01,936
For example, the Kundalini is stopping at this point, now what is the mantra for this point,

1031
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:08,074
Lord's prayer, or "I forgive", to make it shorter.

1032
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:13,035
That is the weapon Christ has given us of forgiveness, at this point,

1033
01:02:13,264 --> 01:02:14,430
which stops your thinking.

1034
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:18,279
If any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it, you have to have realization first,

1035
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:22,527
then only because the Kundalini has reached there, you know that it is stopping there

1036
01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:25,367
then you have to say that, alright, this is Lord's Prayer,

1037
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,810
you say Lord's Prayer, it opens out.

1038
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,533
What is the mantra over here?

1039
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:33,156
It's Allah Akbar, you put these fingers are of this center,

1040
01:02:33,427 --> 01:02:36,809
put them here and say "Allah Akbar" three times, it will open out

1041
01:02:37,892 --> 01:02:41,650
But you have to be a realized soul, to begin with or the one who is telling you has to be a realized soul.

1042
01:02:41,963 --> 01:02:45,930
There has to be some authority from God, not from theological college or anything.

1043
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:51,509
It is a mockery, to get knowledge of God in a theological college.

1044
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,134
I mean you must enter into the Kingdom of God

1045
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,280
to know what He is, what He is like,

1046
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,868
what is His whole vidya, His knowledge.

1047
01:03:01,201 --> 01:03:04,306
Divine knowledge is very different from the knowledge you have.

1048
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,642
Have you ever known that this is the Vishudhi chakra before?

1049
01:03:12,392 --> 01:03:14,624
You have never known this before, it is not written anywhere.

1050
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:18,713
Some things had to be told by me also,

1051
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:21,046
so this was left for me to be told.

1052
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:23,903
Now this chakra,

1053
01:03:25,653 --> 01:03:29,319
of Vishudhi chakra, gives you the witness state

1054
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:32,571
that Krishna has described that you become the sakshi

1055
01:03:32,696 --> 01:03:34,924
I would like you to also listen to my tape

1056
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:37,472
on Shri Krishna which is very good,

1057
01:03:37,805 --> 01:03:44,195
recently I spoke about Him in a very detailed manner about Gita also.

1058
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,012
You can have all these tapes brought down here to Melbourne,

1059
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,678
and listen to them, but only listening to them is of no use

1060
01:03:52,991 --> 01:03:57,007
is no use it will give you ideas and you will start behaving again in a funny way.

1061
01:03:57,507 --> 01:04:02,000
I do not want you to make the same pickle out of me as you have pickled out
other people.

1062
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:06,931
Put it to practice. Because when I spoke in America

1063
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:08,212
they were all taping me down,

1064
01:04:09,004 --> 01:04:11,503
and everybody said "Mother you should not allow them to tape

1065
01:04:11,711 --> 01:04:15,518
because you see these are all writers and this and that and they will use your knowledge

1066
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,464
and spread the thing, I said "let them do it,

1067
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:20,928
 after all Kundalini I have to awaken, the cannot do it

1068
01:04:20,949 --> 01:04:22,949
if they could do I would be very happy to sit down

1069
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,802
let them do it, I will be very happy."

1070
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,746
Anybody who says that "why should you" I said "very good you come along and do it"

1071
01:04:28,871 --> 01:04:30,871
I will be very happy to settle down,

1072
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,390
because I gain nothing, what is my gain?

1073
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:42,539
Anybody who is willing to do it, I will be very happy to retire, absolutely.

1074
01:04:42,602 --> 01:04:46,766
Because by God's grace I am a married woman, and very happily married,

1075
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:49,201
I have my own children and grand children,

1076
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:51,135
why should I bother my head,

1077
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:53,364
of going around the people travelling like this?

1078
01:04:54,114 --> 01:04:59,560
Yesterday in Sydney, here in Melbourne today, again go back Sydney then to India, why should I do it?

1079
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:00,791
For what?

1080
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:07,106
Only because I love, because I know this is my mission, I have to do it, I'm suppose to do it

1081
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,606
this is the job I have,

1082
01:05:09,856 --> 01:05:12,546
but if anybody else can do it I will be very happy for them to do it.

1083
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:19,244
Now when it comes to all these awakening, and all that,

1084
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,348
it is the thing that happens to you,

1085
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:24,577
it is the thing that moves within you,

1086
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:28,323
and you have to feel the movement, it is not a blind lane

1087
01:05:28,386 --> 01:05:32,244
where you just pay some money into a counter and say "now we are entering to the blind lane"

1088
01:05:33,098 --> 01:05:34,099
And do what you like.

1089
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:37,333
Somebody says you jump, somebody says you do this and do that. Nothing.

1090
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:38,666
Everything is logical.

1091
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:41,205
First your Kundalini must arise,

1092
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:43,881
if it does not arise I cannot give you a certificate,

1093
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:48,008
you cannot give a certificate, nobody can give you a certificate, nothing artificial.

1094
01:05:49,404 --> 01:05:52,691
So in America when I went and told them all they had tape recorders and all that

1095
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:56,749
something bad has also come out of it, it is Born Again.

1096
01:05:57,145 --> 01:05:59,821
All these things have come from there, only from my lectures.

1097
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:02,719
Because I told the Christians, when they called me,

1098
01:06:02,927 --> 01:06:07,250
thinking they'd be Christians in the churches, you see they thought this is bonafide

1099
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:12,475
because I was baptized according to them, so I should be baptised by these people

1100
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,600
so I'm alright, I was bonafide.

1101
01:06:14,675 --> 01:06:16,330
They called me in the churches, you see

1102
01:06:16,705 --> 01:06:18,705
and they also collected a collection for me,

1103
01:06:18,755 --> 01:06:19,702
very interesting.

1104
01:06:23,702 --> 01:06:27,529
But best part of it, some of them

1105
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:28,837
caught up certain words

1106
01:06:28,887 --> 01:06:34,667
I said you are to be born again. You are to be born again, so they have got now a cult called Born Again, finished.

1107
01:06:36,945 --> 01:06:40,018
It is very difficult to talk to these mad people,

1108
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:42,345
anything you tell them they make a cult out of it.

1109
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:44,146
Anything you don't they want to pickle up,

1110
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:46,877
you see it is such a difficult thing with human beings.

1111
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:48,927
They don't want to take to reality,

1112
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:52,353
they want to have their ego everywhere asserting by which

1113
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,149
they pluck out all that is living

1114
01:06:54,224 --> 01:06:58,320
and make that dead, ugly and say "this is mine, this is mine, this is mine."

1115
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,148
Absurd. But this is what happens to us. Now about Christ,

1116
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:07,554
I think

1117
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,530
greatest message of Christ is His resurrection,

1118
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:17,686
this is resurrection, that He showed what Krishna has said in His lifetime,

1119
01:07:18,186 --> 01:07:22,073
that the spirit doesn't die, it cannot be killed,

1120
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:28,769
it cannot be blown out, it has to rise, and it rises.

1121
01:07:29,644 --> 01:07:32,452
Whatever you may try, it is eternal,

1122
01:07:32,952 --> 01:07:36,042
and that is what Christ has proved by His resurrection.

1123
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:39,436
But by His resurrection He has achieved a great thing,

1124
01:07:39,936 --> 01:07:41,266
which Hindus do not know

1125
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:44,651
and the Christians have not carried the message because they also do not know.

1126
01:07:45,826 --> 01:07:47,826
But the greatest thing He has done,

1127
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,201
to our awareness is that,

1128
01:07:50,426 --> 01:07:52,926
that if you pass through that centre

1129
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:57,077
your karmas are sucked, your sins are forgiven.

1130
01:07:58,827 --> 01:08:01,173
This is the beauty He has created within us,

1131
01:08:01,298 --> 01:08:05,751
by which our ego is sucked in self, He sucks in our ego, He is the sucker of our ego.

1132
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:10,827
And all the Christian nations are the greatest ego orientated people.

1133
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,845
It's very difficult to talk to them.

1134
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,020
First thing they will do is to box your nose.

1135
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:18,888
If not crucify you.

1136
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,480
They are extremely aggressive people, extremely aggressive and very ignorant.

1137
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:27,755
They are so naive, so naive,

1138
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,089
In India

1139
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:32,372
it is not so difficult to talk to them because they know what is knowledge.

1140
01:08:32,447 --> 01:08:36,469
I mean they know what is Kundalini, they know. They know what is the rising of the Kundalini,

1141
01:08:36,494 --> 01:08:38,135
they know who can do this,

1142
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:44,565
it's not difficult to talk to them, because the people are so naive in spiritual life,

1143
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:49,304
and then they are so ego orientated, despite the fact that Christ

1144
01:08:49,452 --> 01:08:52,519
is the one who is the sucker of your ego,

1145
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:54,414
He is the one who sucks your ego,

1146
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:56,914
so there is no karmas after realization.

1147
01:08:57,414 --> 01:09:02,219
You become the spirit, spirit does not have any karma, it is a myth,

1148
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:05,461
it is sucked and this is what Christ has done for us.

1149
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:09,265
So, when Christians, so called, came to India,

1150
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:13,258
they converted people in such a crude method

1151
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:15,557
by putting a loaf in a well

1152
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:20,722
which the poor Indians ate - they are naive as far as Christianity was concerned -

1153
01:09:20,803 --> 01:09:23,003
they said this was the meat of the cows,

1154
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:25,084
you are all finished, you are Christians,

1155
01:09:25,168 --> 01:09:27,584
so the whole village became Christians.

1156
01:09:28,084 --> 01:09:32,114
Like that they tried all dirty tricks on Indians and they all became Christians

1157
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:34,178
so Indian Christians are the worst of all,

1158
01:09:35,517 --> 01:09:39,927
poor things, they think they are so condemned forever, now they can never be reconverted,

1159
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:44,794
they can never be realized, they cannot be resurrected, they are doomed people,

1160
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:48,836
who have eaten the cows' meat, not they, but their forefathers might.

1161
01:09:50,913 --> 01:09:52,320
It is such a wretched state.

1162
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:57,768
But if any realized soul had come

1163
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:03,112
they would have seen that this is what

1164
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:07,591
Christ was supposed to do, which is written in the Devi Bhagavatam,

1165
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:13,789
that He is the support of the universe.

1166
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,420
But the narrow visions of Christians

1167
01:10:19,339 --> 01:10:23,491
and the narrow visions of Hindus, and the narrow visions of Muslims

1168
01:10:24,813 --> 01:10:28,633
have made such a mess, that the time has come to get the whole picture,

1169
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,393
the complete integration,

1170
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:33,397
of all these great incarnations, who are within you

1171
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,662
and to understand them in reality,

1172
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:36,859
what they are,

1173
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:40,747
and becoming yourself such a wider personality as a collective being

1174
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:46,787
About Christ, I don't know, I must have spoken

1175
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:51,729
hours and hours, about Krishna I must have spoken for hours and hours.

1176
01:10:52,095 --> 01:10:55,423
In England also we have got about 300 to 400 tapes

1177
01:10:55,604 --> 01:10:58,472
on different subjects which you should get them and listen to them.

1178
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:03,268
But again do not make it a big library for you please

1179
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,471
it is to be actualized, it is to be felt, it is to be practiced within yourself.

1180
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:13,009
It is not for giving you any big knowledges.

1181
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:20,636
We have a book called Advent, which is written by a French Sahaja yogi.

1182
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,985
Which is a very beautiful book,

1183
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:26,961
but we do not sell it to people who are not realized, we do not,

1184
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:31,009
because it is very difficult for a person who is not realized to bear the truth,

1185
01:11:31,509 --> 01:11:34,939
that is why they crucified Christ. That is why they tortured Mohammed.

1186
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:38,760
That is why they tortured all the saints, because they could not bear the truth,

1187
01:11:38,857 --> 01:11:40,437
their ego could not bear it.

1188
01:11:40,702 --> 01:11:43,820
So we do not give those books to people who are not realized,

1189
01:11:44,253 --> 01:11:46,774
if you are realized then you can order for you a copy,

1190
01:11:47,022 --> 01:11:49,577
you can get the book, but otherwise you cannot get it.

1191
01:11:49,658 --> 01:11:53,575
I am sorry we have certain experiences,

1192
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:55,791
and we deal on those experiences

1193
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,291
that unless and until human beings are realized

1194
01:11:58,623 --> 01:12:01,194
they are not going to value the Divine life,

1195
01:12:01,912 --> 01:12:04,214
they value anything else but their divinity,

1196
01:12:05,402 --> 01:12:09,117
and here you do not pay a single pai, so there is no binding force.

1197
01:12:09,147 --> 01:12:12,373
Like many people say, I said "why are you still doing these things?",

1198
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:15,009
they said "we have paid for it, so let us go through it",

1199
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,140
even if it is hell you go through it?,

1200
01:12:18,009 --> 01:12:21,267
that's the mentality. Now here there is nothing paid,

1201
01:12:21,566 --> 01:12:24,210
there's on attachment, it is your freedom seeking

1202
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:27,650
which is the attachment, if you are really a seeker

1203
01:12:27,965 --> 01:12:30,539
you will go deep into it and have the blessings,

1204
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:34,798
have the beauty of that spirit

1205
01:12:35,097 --> 01:12:36,340
which is within you,

1206
01:12:36,538 --> 01:12:39,840
which you can have. The time has come, this was the time was promised,

1207
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:45,058
this was talked about in John's Revelation.

1208
01:12:45,642 --> 01:12:50,834
Also in many of the Indian scriptures it is described.

1209
01:12:51,552 --> 01:12:56,524
But the best is William Blake, who has described it very beautifully

1210
01:12:57,443 --> 01:13:01,482
in his book called "Milton, even the place where I lived first,

1211
01:13:01,646 --> 01:13:05,871
Surrey Hills, he has said, the first beacons will be lit in Surrey Hills,

1212
01:13:06,086 --> 01:13:08,086
he has also said where our ashram is,

1213
01:13:08,368 --> 01:13:13,037
that in the ruins of Lambeth Way, the foundations will be laid

1214
01:13:13,285 --> 01:13:15,536
come to Lambeth Way and he says

1215
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:18,136
that it will be a Jerusalem one day

1216
01:13:18,636 --> 01:13:20,636
England will be a Jerusalem

1217
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:22,606
That's what he has said

1218
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,345
it is a very interesting book "Milton" if you can get

1219
01:13:25,476 --> 01:13:28,300
hold of it please read it, it's all described

1220
01:13:28,364 --> 01:13:30,364
He describes everything even the vibrations

1221
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:33,799
that Her looms vibrate the sinuous

1222
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:38,143
it's a Jerusalem now, because people come for Sahaja Yoga.

1223
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:40,391
There are some very good

1224
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:42,891
Muslims we have young people

1225
01:13:42,988 --> 01:13:44,988
who just found in their own country

1226
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,220
that fundamentalists are taking

1227
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,277
the rule and they are behaving in such a fanatic manner

1228
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:53,342
they thought that if God is

1229
01:13:53,372 --> 01:13:55,573
such a fanatic nonsense then better give Him up

1230
01:13:56,073 --> 01:13:59,430
and they wanted to become communists and they have taken to communism

1231
01:13:59,544 --> 01:14:00,219
to a point.

1232
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:04,398
When one of them came down to London and somehow he happened to come to us

1233
01:14:04,663 --> 01:14:05,902
there he got his realization

1234
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:08,269
after realization he knew

1235
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:12,024
that it's one extreme is fanaticism, another extreme is deny of God

1236
01:14:12,138 --> 01:14:14,138
God is there but in the center.

1237
01:14:14,386 --> 01:14:19,403
He went back, he got 500 people realized who are Muslims

1238
01:14:19,551 --> 01:14:21,035
and now they come to London

1239
01:14:21,418 --> 01:14:23,553
his mother wanted to go to Mecca.

1240
01:14:23,919 --> 01:14:25,242
Mecca is also

1241
01:14:25,406 --> 01:14:28,030
according to us is a very great pilgrimage no doubt

1242
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:30,312
because Mohammed Sahib was really very great

1243
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:32,896
and he was the incarnation of Primordial Master

1244
01:14:32,943 --> 01:14:34,943
which can be proved on your Kundalini.

1245
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:38,308
All things that I'm saying can be proved on your Kundalini

1246
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:41,810
and you can see for yourselves absolutely practical for you to see.

1247
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,642
Now when he came to

1248
01:14:45,142 --> 01:14:48,453
his mother wanted to come go to Mecca she told

1249
01:14:49,473 --> 01:14:51,205
that now why I do want to go to Mecca

1250
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:53,873
now Mecca has shifted to London, better go to London

1251
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:56,943
that's what it is one has to realize

1252
01:14:57,443 --> 01:15:00,144
that when we talk of anyone

1253
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,071
like Christ or Moses or Abraham

1254
01:15:03,303 --> 01:15:07,178
or Mohammad or anyone, you should know they are all related to each other.

1255
01:15:08,114 --> 01:15:10,732
While we are identified with one or the other.

1256
01:15:11,467 --> 01:15:15,495
Let us identify ourselves with all of them to understanding of Kundalini

1257
01:15:15,592 --> 01:15:17,916
you'll be amazed, when the Kundalini rises,

1258
01:15:18,047 --> 01:15:20,821
if somebody's a Muslim he has to take the name of Nanaka

1259
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:22,868
otherwise the Kundalini doesn't rise.

1260
01:15:23,368 --> 01:15:26,807
All the fanatics have to give up their fanaticism

1261
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:28,435
before the Kundalini rises.

1262
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:31,261
And even if their Kundalini rises and gives them realization

1263
01:15:31,392 --> 01:15:34,017
then again suck back into their fanatic paunches

1264
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:37,370
So all these things will only disappear,

1265
01:15:37,417 --> 01:15:39,283
all these relative things will disappear

1266
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:42,551
as soon as you find your absolute, that is your spirit.

1267
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:47,432
About the spirit, I'm sorry I cannot talk in such a small time,

1268
01:15:47,714 --> 01:15:51,636
but there's a very good tape on Sat-Chit-Anand,

1269
01:15:51,733 --> 01:15:54,358
is that is the spirit and it's best is

1270
01:15:55,043 --> 01:15:58,243
to listen to that because I would

1271
01:15:58,491 --> 01:16:00,997
do no honor to your spirit if I

1272
01:16:01,161 --> 01:16:03,719
just finish it in two minutes or three minutes like that.

1273
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,469
It's a very wide subject and very beautiful.

1274
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:09,569
Most enjoyable to know about your own spirit,

1275
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:11,633
about yourself, that, truly you are

1276
01:16:11,915 --> 01:16:14,567
not this body, not this mind, not this ego.

1277
01:16:14,731 --> 01:16:16,731
Neither these conditionings and these

1278
01:16:16,812 --> 01:16:20,448
old ideas you have, conceptions. You are what you are.

1279
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:22,386
Thank you very much.

1280
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,540
Now I'm going away to India

1281
01:16:25,603 --> 01:16:28,624
on the 8th, and tomorrow there's a good program

1282
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:34,204
in Sydney and 8th I'll be leaving up and

1283
01:16:34,285 --> 01:16:37,575
then I'll be in India for a short time and going back to London.

1284
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:39,773
Maybe next year I'll be coming here.

1285
01:16:39,904 --> 01:16:42,767
I would request you that you must attend your

1286
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:44,864
collective programs because

1287
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:47,463
the message of Sahaja Yoga is collectivity.

1288
01:16:47,611 --> 01:16:49,778
If you take my photograph and meditate at home

1289
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:53,209
after some time you'll find you'll lose vibrations. You will not grow.

1290
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:55,292
You have to grow collectively.

1291
01:16:55,521 --> 01:16:56,527
It's very important

1292
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:00,590
that all of you should grow together collectively.

1293
01:17:00,771 --> 01:17:02,283
Collectiveness must be developed

1294
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:05,364
otherwise you must work it out, how it works on others

1295
01:17:05,461 --> 01:17:09,280
and how you cures others and how you help others, is to be seen.

1296
01:17:09,612 --> 01:17:11,612
Some people will be coming from Melbourne,

1297
01:17:11,642 --> 01:17:13,642
or from Sydney to Melbourne,

1298
01:17:13,974 --> 01:17:16,864
in the beginning till you understand Sahaja Yoga

1299
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:18,451
and then they will go away.

1300
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,042
Of course there is no money, nothing involved as you see,

1301
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,240
we have started in a very small way.

1302
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,260
Now when next time I come

1303
01:17:27,341 --> 01:17:29,171
I'm sure Melbourne will be

1304
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:31,268
a seed of very good Sahaja yogis.

1305
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:34,506
Not doubting, but understanding,

1306
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:36,939
doubting doesn't give you much chance,

1307
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,120
you see, what is there to doubt, is nothing but

1308
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,916
your ego is doubting something.

1309
01:17:41,148 --> 01:17:45,458
There's nothing to doubt, just come and see this is a new university into which you have entered,

1310
01:17:45,488 --> 01:17:47,488
you don't have to pay anything - that's all.

1311
01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:53,025
When you have to pay, you do not doubt and ask questions, I know you'll go head
long, but here

1312
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:55,378
you are free, you have freedom to doubt

1313
01:17:55,576 --> 01:17:57,929
but do not pull it too fast

1314
01:17:57,993 --> 01:18:00,644
because it you will spoil your chances of realization.

1315
01:18:00,725 --> 01:18:02,509
May God bless you.
