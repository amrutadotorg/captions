00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.997
The vibratory sound which was produced when God Almighty began to create this universe is called Brahmnaad  (ब्रह्मनाद), or Omkar

00:00:19.997 --> 00:00:39.993
This vibratory sound, which got spread in the world, was a sound of purity.

00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:59.989
First of all, God transmitted purity in this universe – purified the whole atmosphere.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:16.119
First, He purified. This purity is called chaitanya, which you know today.You can know and can feel it and can also get the experience.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:24.117
The same Omkar today in the form of chaitanya, is making you pure.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:32.240
We worship Shri Ganesh in every puja,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.702
and today you have very nicely organized to worship Him only!

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:53.351
But when we worship something, we have many different forms of desires.

00:01:53.351 --> 00:02:02.031
Some people are desirous: some ask for money, some ask for their work to be done properly,

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:12.295
some say to have recognition, some ask for fame and to get honour,

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:22.506
some ask for good jobs, some for business, some ask their house should be built.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.505
These are all desirous attitudes.

00:02:24.506 --> 00:02:32.501
So, people worship Ganesh for such things.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:37.773
Siddhi Vinayak  here was awakened by Me many years ago.

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:44.648
People now go to the Siddhi Vinayak and ask for different things.

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:46.560
But He is the Siddhi Vinayak.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.993
He is not giver of ‘things’.

00:02:49.993 --> 00:03:01.777
For that, there are many others sitting in this world doing miracles, who will give you diamonds, give you emeralds, and take away everything from you.

00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:09.901
Omkar itself is formless; it has no shape.

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:18.816
So to begin with, the form of Shri Ganesh was formless.

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:22.391
Today we worship Him in a form,

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:30.882
but Sahaja Yogis should know what the ultimate goal of our life is.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:33.270
What do we want?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.297
Have we accomplished that?

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:41.646
Have we fulfilled our destiny?

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:46.097
Why did we come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:46.097 --> 00:03:55.602
Did we come to get good health or get good business or get the honour or win in the election?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:04:00.751
Everyone asks for this; what is so special about it?

00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:06.121
But Sahaja Yogis should think that today we have risen to a new level,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:10.657
we stand on a new height, so what are we expecting from this?

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:15.201
And what is our wish?

00:04:15.201 --> 00:04:26.394
So now we have to come to this: the Ganesha whom you worship today in the form, you have to achieve Him in a formless manner.

00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:30.977
You have to attain Him within yourselves, He has to be settled within ourselves.

00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:33.632
It is not that you go to offer Him flowers; everyone does that.

00:04:33.632 --> 00:04:44.271
You offer Him flowers, His puja is offered, Mother’s puja is also offered; Gauri puja is also offered!

00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:53.271
But you can accumulate His power within you. You can manifest its result.

00:04:53.271 --> 00:05:02.715
You can purify your attention, your mind, your intellect, your speech, and you can also purify others.

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:05.673
I made you like this Ganesh only.

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:10.884
By making you self-realized the same way I made Ganesha.

00:05:10.884 --> 00:05:12.884
There's no difference.

00:05:12.884 --> 00:05:17.376
Exactly in the same way, made in the same way. But how high is Ganesha !

00:05:17.376 --> 00:05:29.937
So, when you worship Ganesha, you should think that we have to rise towards the formless.

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:35.520
One has to be one with the formless. We just run after the form only.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.092
Recently, one Sahaja Yogi came to Pune from Borivali.

00:05:41.092 --> 00:05:49.269
He said to Me, “I missed Krishna Puja as I couldn’t come to Pune and I missed this puja too.”

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:50.360
I asked, “Why did this get missed?”

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.625
He said, “I bring Ganapati to my brother’s place

00:05:55.625 --> 00:06:00.246
and we have three days of festival, so I came here and my puja there is missed.”

00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:07.553
Means ignorance is still there.

00:06:07.553 --> 00:06:16.466
–  By missing the puja here, and you buy Ganapati for some 10-15 Rupees and go there.

00:06:16.466 --> 00:06:18.624
So it means, you can buy Ganapati!

00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:22.222
You can’t purchase Me, but you can purchase Ganapati!

00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:29.280
And on top of this, there are so many things are done here in the name of Ganapati. That is why it is raining in Pune these days,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.310
so that all the paths of Ganapati (procession) would be closed

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.993
and it should rain until Ganapati is immersed (the statue immersed in the water).

00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:39.730
There would be no need for immersion as it is, He would be immersed by Himself in the rainwater!

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:51.864
The tales I heard about Ganapati festival there, I was completely speechless that they make Shri Ganapati sit there and they drink alcohol in front of Him.

00:06:51.864 --> 00:06:57.519
They sit there and drink alcohol; sing dirty songs; perform dirty dances in front of Him.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:05.196
And all dirty types of women stay there and do all kinds of (dirty) business. This becomes humiliation of Ganapati.

00:07:05.196 --> 00:07:12.522
Lokmanya Tilak had suggested to make Ganapati festival as a social event

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:21.165
where people would get a platform to organize a grand type music performances,

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:27.970
or series of lectures or such programmes to bring awareness in the society.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:38.080
But the way it is organised now, it would turn a good person to bad.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.007
The bigger the statue of Ganapati, greater is the sin there!

00:07:42.007 --> 00:07:47.542
Doing sinful things in front of Ganapati, will He spare them?

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:53.155
He will not spare these people.

00:07:53.155 --> 00:07:57.770
Till I am sitting here, it is going to be okay, but then these people won’t find a place to hide

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.476
because He knows where the work is to be done and where the efforts are needed.

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:07.889
I am afraid what is going to happen.

00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:13.295
This place is called Punyapathanam (पुण्यपठणम) and already there is a demon sitting in this city of Pune.

00:08:13.295 --> 00:08:15.382
Many more are assembled there.

00:08:15.382 --> 00:08:21.175
Besides, there are so many misconducts in the name of Ganapati, what to say to this?

00:08:21.175 --> 00:08:24.013
Because they are not connected to God Almighty.

00:08:24.013 --> 00:08:27.774
They do puja to Ganapati and request, “Ganapati, please be seated here!

00:08:27.774 --> 00:08:32.766
You are sitting (here) because we have purchased You and brought You here. So, You are in our hands now!

00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:38.544
(so we can do what we want with you)!”   So you are allowed do anything in front of Him because it is just made of clay and that you have bought Him,

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:40.950
and (do ‘visarjan’ विसर्जन) immerse Him in water whenever we want.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:49.526
Man's arrogance has brought him down to such a level that he commits all kinds of sins in the name of God

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:57.331
—in such a way that you are seeing that any temple you go to, there they make bhoots dance in the temples of the goddesses.

00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:02.808
It is done shamelessly. They don't know what calamity they would face.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:08.361
Today we talk a lot about religions, but no one cares about the condition of religion.

00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:12.388
Now what is the use of bringing religion into the politics when the religion didn’t remain a religion at all?

00:09:12.388 --> 00:09:16.468
It is the same in every religion.

00:09:16.468 --> 00:09:20.324
If it is about one religion, one can say that: it is bad or that is bad.

00:09:20.324 --> 00:09:22.324
But every religion is moving in the same direction.

00:09:22.324 --> 00:09:30.135
So when you worship Ganapati, you should know that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:33.336
You are yogis.

00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:43.188
What the sages and great people did not get, you have got it easily today.

00:09:43.188 --> 00:09:53.163
Everyone's got it, brought you on the right way, got everything.

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:58.992
But when I say something, you never look at yourself. You think that I am telling this to someone else.

00:09:58.992 --> 00:10:04.013
You do not think that we are one of them, and where is our vision?

00:10:04.013 --> 00:10:09.506
What do we think? “Mother, I am buying this house, and please bless it.”

00:10:09.506 --> 00:10:14.974
Well, if you are there, and you are blessed, then what more?

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:21.790
Then: “Mother, please bless the key of my vehicle.” So they are standing with a key.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:28.176
I will give such a blessing that your vehicle will not run at all.

00:10:28.176 --> 00:10:37.674
And then, forcing Me, that: “You come to my house. If you do not come to my home then this will happen.”

00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:44.181
And then there, what we will hear is: “My business is like this, my this thing is like this, my that thing is like that.” These are not the characteristics of Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:49.993
Those who do Sahaja Yoga should remember that we have to enter into the formless.

00:10:49.993 --> 00:10:57.918
That is, you are not going to be formless; but you are fully going to become an instrument of the formless while being in the form.

00:10:57.918 --> 00:11:12.214
Radio is better than you. Say, when someone makes a radio with his own hands and connects it up, then music can be played on it.

00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:16.218
The radio doesn’t throw dust, does it?

00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:27.278
So first of all, we have to awaken Ganesha within us. Not just worshipping, but if we have to awaken it, then first of all we need to see if we are pure.

00:11:27.278 --> 00:11:30.492
There should be purity within us.

00:11:30.492 --> 00:11:41.978
So the first thing for purity is to pay more attention to our fundamental values.

00:11:41.978 --> 00:11:49.154
Nowadays because of the cinema and other new things, even our eyes have been spoiled.

00:11:49.154 --> 00:11:57.257
And that innocence, that constant unconditional love has disappeared from this world.

00:11:57.257 --> 00:12:00.279
No one can even think that someone can love like this.

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:16.918
And among all this, people think how to do so that both Sahaja Yoga and our (dirty) business can be managed side by side.

00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:23.122
And among all this, people think how to do so that both Sahaja Yoga and our (dirty) business can be managed side by side.
Like yesterday, one lady came to Me and said, “My husband is madly in love with another lady.”

00:12:23.122 --> 00:12:28.966
I said, “Leave him.” “But no,” she said. Her husband says: “I am a very good Sahaja Yogi. I have got kaivalya
(कैवल्य - ultimate realisation/liberation);

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:33.294
my relation with Mother is a separate thing, and my relation with this lady is a separate thing.”

00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:37.025
You cannot get into the boat by climbing over the crocodile.

00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:48.582
And those who are still engaged in such activities and these things, it is appropriate for them to leave Sahaja Yoga and free us.And to take a break from us.

00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:51.208
Whatever will happen to them, will happen, but Sahaja Yoga will be defamed for no fault of its own.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:13:05.378
If your attention still gets entangled in such things, then it should be understood that you have not found the basics of Ganeshji. The very basics !

00:13:05.378 --> 00:13:13.507
In Maharashtra, this is not appreciated – they don’t understand the tendency of men going behind women.

00:13:13.507 --> 00:13:15.173
This is considered to be some weird thing.

00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:22.301
Just get married to someone right here, and accept her as your wife: this is how it is.

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:24.366
There is no madness of (running after) women here.

00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:27.307
But I have heard that it is a lot in South India, too.

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:33.739
There was a king, and it is heard that he had twelve thousand wives. It is surprising!

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:39.829
And among them, some used to walk, some used to go in palanquins, and some on horses and some on elephants.

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:43.070
Then he had desire to get one more wife.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:56.040
So he tried to get a woman, and when he tried for her, she refused, saying, “I don't want to be with you.”

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.235
So he attacked her kingdom.

00:13:58.235 --> 00:14:04.686
At that time, a Muslim king ‘Tughalaq’ was there, who gave a befitting reply to that attack

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:08.163
and this king was defeated and his twelve thousand wives also ran away.

00:14:08.163 --> 00:14:11.619
So he was destroyed because of one woman !

00:14:11.619 --> 00:14:24.933
So, our Sahaja Yoginis should also understand how we should keep our energy fully alive within us.

00:14:24.933 --> 00:14:35.017
And how we should be very proud of our virginity, of our virgin state, of our Gauri state.

00:14:35.017 --> 00:14:36.546
Because this is the power of a woman.

00:14:36.546 --> 00:14:40.575
If this power of a woman is taken away, then such a woman is of no use.

00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:44.638
And that is why no one even respects such a woman and does not even accept her.

00:14:44.638 --> 00:15:02.671
However nowadays, we see in the world that the majority of people, the majority, – people believe in such women who are famous this way, must say, full of filth, in whom purity is not even touched.

00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:08.927
So these who are the majority, they are going on the same path towards their hell.

00:15:08.927 --> 00:15:14.471
The majority will go there, and I can see today only that what would be the condition of this majority.

00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:20.523
However, you are not a majority, you are a minority, and your situation is different.

00:15:20.523 --> 00:15:27.500
So you should know that engaging in such kind of work does not suit you at all.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:33.839
And even now I see some people having their attention wandering here and there.

00:15:33.839 --> 00:15:41.343
This is the first thing we should know, that the morality we have, at least our morality should be right.

00:15:41.343 --> 00:15:50.519
Now the second thing, which is especially in Indians, which is lacking in foreign countries is morality.

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:58.061
But the materialism is strong there. But they are not interested in material things.

00:15:58.061 --> 00:16:00.886
They do not find material things interesting.

00:16:00.886 --> 00:16:08.651
But the eyes of Indians can not rest until they read all advertisements in every shop.

00:16:08.651 --> 00:16:14.241
They will read every advertisement even by turning back their heads again and again,what is available here, what is available there, what to buy here, what to buy there.

00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:19.152
And also when they go abroad, they are in the mood of shopping!

00:16:19.152 --> 00:16:26.183
It is very shameful thing and also when they go to foreign countries from here after getting married,

00:16:26.183 --> 00:16:30.351
they become so materialistic people, that no one can understand, what their materialistic mentality is.

00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:42.183
It is also seen in Ganpatipule  that people there are like, “see, we have got one thing but we have not got this other thing till now, so please give it too.”

00:16:42.183 --> 00:16:49.348
How frivolous it is! Everything should be at your feet / not important.

00:16:49.348 --> 00:16:59.332
Then as soon as you put your attention on the formless, all materiality becomes worthless.

00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:04.331
How can you be a Sahaja Yogi unless this honorable state comes within you?

00:17:04.343 --> 00:17:10.128
Look at Tukaram, it is okay to stay according to the position you are in.

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:14.732
Just as King Janak was. As he was a king, he used to live like a king.But he knew the worth of everything, he did not give importance to material things.

00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:25.731
And as long as you are bound by this materialism within, then your very first step cannot enter into the temple of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:25.731 --> 00:17:34.664
All right, this is Mother, She wants to give; because in this way I can show that I love you.

00:17:34.664 --> 00:17:38.274
But that doesn't mean it's a big thing for Me.

00:17:38.274 --> 00:17:47.300
Many times things / feelings can't be said with words; you don't understand My glance.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:56.333
Then through (giving) things only I want to show that I am with you and you are with Me. You are My children.

00:17:56.333 --> 00:18:01.551
But it doesn't mean that you stick to materialism like mad.

00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:13.373
And sometimes it is extreme, that even if you give something to someone, that person says, “Sir, I do not wear this thing, I do not want this thing, I want another thing, I wear like that.”

00:18:13.373 --> 00:18:15.096
You are really great!

00:18:15.096 --> 00:18:23.029
We have such great people, who (Shri Ram) ate the berries tasted by  Shabari (a tribal woman)

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:27.236
and who (Shri Krishna) dined with Vidur (son of maid).

00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:32.961
Such people are (examples) for all of us.

00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:36.256
They are not hidden from you.

00:18:36.256 --> 00:18:42.230
So it is cheapish to behave like this.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.521
If the Mother has given even a small thing (gift), consider it very high and keep it on the head.

00:18:46.521 --> 00:18:52.248
If you don’t come to this point, then all your fashion and all other things are useless.

00:18:52.248 --> 00:19:05.951
Among all the qualities of Shri Ganesh, the main thing one has to do is to purify one’s attention.

00:19:05.951 --> 00:19:09.203
The method of purifying your attention is to watch where your attention is.

00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:15.192
If your attention is on God Almighty, it is pure because vibrations are flowing in you.

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:19.452
What is the use of that attention if it is roaming here and there?

00:19:19.452 --> 00:19:30.300
Unless your attention is pure, you cannot attain the knowledge, because only in the attention all your vibrations are flowing.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.408
You know everything through attention only. The one who has a pure attention can work only by thinking about it.

00:19:35.408 --> 00:19:41.095
Work can be done only by paying attention, and sometimes even that is not needed.

00:19:41.095 --> 00:19:51.207
The power you want to attain, whatever you may call it as ultimate goal,

00:19:51.207 --> 00:19:53.796
you may you call it your aim,

00:19:53.796 --> 00:20:01.791
is this chaitanya, which you want to settle within yourself, which has this power. When you have this power, you can do many things.

00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:05.930
But neglecting that, why are you after these useless things?

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:15.581
If all your attention is indulged in how much money we can get by following Sahaja Yoga;

00:20:15.581 --> 00:20:18.572
otherwise,  what things we can get?

00:20:18.572 --> 00:20:24.806
If the attention rises a little higher, then it starts thinking how to cure our sickness.

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:30.184
After that, if the attention rises more, then at the most it starts thinking how to get to see [darshan] Mother.

00:20:30.184 --> 00:20:39.195
Now people come from everywhere – sometimes from Aurangabad, sometimes from Sangamner – and from anywhere.

00:20:39.195 --> 00:20:44.723
People come and settle from Delhi, or from Calcutta.

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:52.724
We came deliberately, muddamun (मुद्दामून) is a word in Marathi – there is no synonym for it –

00:20:52.724 --> 00:20:59.984
muddamun  (very very deliberately). Why did you come? I do not have time.

00:20:59.984 --> 00:21:04.710
Why did you come deliberately? Then you fight that we came to see Mother!

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.106
You can see Me in the heart itself.

00:21:07.106 --> 00:21:11.038
You have been given such power; it’s more than enough to see to that power.

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:17.875
I am also that power [shakti] only, right? You have not got Me in formless; that is why you need to see Me.

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:22.950
But you waste My time by sitting for hours and talking about all sorts of things. What is the need?

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:27.081
In being the embodiment of power, you can become the power yourself.

00:21:27.081 --> 00:21:34.112
But when will these hindrances go away and when will we understand that we ourselves can become the embodiment of that power?

00:21:34.112 --> 00:21:41.433
And we have so many powers within us, we should be absorbed in them, due to which all the work gets done without doing anything!

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:46.008
But this thought does not come into mind easily.

00:21:46.008 --> 00:21:51.277
Not only ignorance is there; if only ignorance, then I would say it is okay, there is ignorance.

00:21:51.277 --> 00:22:00.630
It is not only ignorance, but it is greed that is holding us, and another is, attachment -maya –

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.610
this is my boy, this is my son, this is my daughter.

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:19.550
And when you think like this, you should think that we are also sons of Mother, daughters of Mother, and now we are Her children only.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.608
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, your life has changed.

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:29.195
You have moved to another lineage, your home has changed, your gotra (usually each human is the descendent of some specific Rishi’s family) has changed,

00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:36.314
your caste has changed, your religion has changed, you have completely changed to a new person, new human.

00:22:36.314 --> 00:22:43.023
Why is it so? Because your Mother has given you the awakening.

00:22:43.023 --> 00:22:47.273
So all of you have completely changed.

00:22:47.273 --> 00:22:56.822
Like by establishing one Ganeshji (within us), our thousands, millions of works are done

00:22:56.822 --> 00:23:06.285
because He has complete faith in Mother and He is completely surrendered to Mother.

00:23:06.285 --> 00:23:18.444
So until that purity will not come in our heart, till we do not achieve that purity in our mind, that surrender will not come.

00:23:18.444 --> 00:23:27.267
It is like this: that unless you go to the Ganges and don't immerse the pitcher in it, and if there is no space inside the pitcher, how will it be filled with water?

00:23:27.267 --> 00:23:31.242
This is a simple logic.

00:23:31.242 --> 00:23:37.733
So it is necessary that we purify our attention,

00:23:37.733 --> 00:23:44.857
and after purifying it, only that pure attention we can offer it to our Mother. Impure things will only hurt Me.

00:23:44.857 --> 00:23:54.224
And when attention is pure, then you are surprised to see that you become fragrant like a flower

00:23:54.224 --> 00:24:06.549
and seeing you I also feel cheerful, that: Aha! That’s My son standing, that’s My daughter standing!

00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:18.848
All other things do not make Me happy; like you are standing with very nice clothes or a suit, or with haircut, or with lipstick, etc. That doesn't make Me happy at all.

00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:22.984
On the contrary, I feel that they are leaving now, now they are moving away from the path.

00:24:22.984 --> 00:24:31.948
To achieve this kind of modernisation is going away from Ganesha. What is the need?

00:24:31.948 --> 00:24:38.592
He is ancient, and I am also very ancient.

00:24:38.592 --> 00:24:47.169
So if you are My sons and daughters, then you have to follow and live with the culture we consider to be ancient.

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:52.256
And the picture looks very bad outside (India) - people themselves tell Me that.

00:24:52.256 --> 00:24:57.215
Those who are foreigners, for whom it is necessary (to dress properly) in their society,

00:24:57.215 --> 00:25:01.646
they tell Me if I give them permission, they would roam around wearing saris and, will roam around wearing kurtas and pyjamas.

00:25:01.646 --> 00:25:05.029
But here we have the opposite.

00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:19.634
So the culture of Ganesha, the culture of which the innermost abiding quality is beauty.

00:25:19.634 --> 00:25:32.759
Now you see that He is so fat, His belly is so big, He is huge, Ganesha looks so fat. But what is His beauty? What is that attraction (towards Him)?

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:36.603
Why did Lokmanya Tilak (freedom fighter) chose the idol of Ganesha?

00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:39.892
Actually, people in Maharashtra keep doing “Vitthal, Vitthal” from early morning till evening.

00:25:39.892 --> 00:25:42.741
Vitthal also left from there!

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:47.132
Here all have this attraction towards ‘Vitthal' and all consume tobacco!

00:25:47.132 --> 00:25:54.549
But why did Lokmanya Tilak choose Shri Ganesha only,

00:25:54.549 --> 00:26:01.102
and why only Ganesha creates all the beauty in the whole creation?

00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:05.790
After all what is His unchanging characteristic, that without it, Shri Rama, Shri Krishna,

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:13.227
Jesus Christ or Buddha, or any other person couldn’t have formed this beauty. What was that essence in Him?

00:26:13.227 --> 00:26:25.026
He has the childlike nature in Him;

00:26:25.026 --> 00:26:33.329
the nature of a child in which innocence is there, which is full of innocence– he is filled with complete innocence.

00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:37.903
This is the thing that is most attractive and beautiful!

00:26:37.903 --> 00:26:44.640
It is not your cleverness or your make-up; this is not attractive, it lasts only for few moments.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.914
In front of you people will say good, behind they would speak ill.

00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:55.053
But the innocence which is essense of Shri Ganesha is the beauty of this creation, in the whole world.

00:26:55.053 --> 00:27:07.614
The aesthetics of the world is the work of Shri Ganesh.

00:27:07.614 --> 00:27:15.368
His childlike behaviour, similar description of Shri Krishna, also, which is very pleasant.

00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:21.019
Surdas has described how He used to dance, how His anklets used to make melodious sound,

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:29.388
how He used to fall, and surprisingly how He used to be very happy to see Himself in the mirror, whereas He is the doer of the world.

00:27:29.388 --> 00:27:42.067
How He made His mother see the whole world by opening His mouth and, He was behaving like a child!

00:27:42.067 --> 00:27:44.161
The same has been said about Shri Ram.

00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:48.110
People did not tell about the childhood of Jesus Christ,

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.491
but you can know about His childhood in the form of Shri Ganesh.

00:27:51.491 --> 00:28:02.860
And that is why it is big mistake of people where they did not talk about the childhood, as such people do not have joy and happiness; weeping and sobbing became the (their) religion.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:08.400
As you see that Jains religion, there is crying and weeping,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:15.378
Buddhists are of crying type, Muslims are also of crying type: so much so that only God can save them!

00:28:15.378 --> 00:28:20.369
And Christians, too, do a lot of crying and weeping.

00:28:20.369 --> 00:28:27.992
Jesus Christ crucified Himself on the for all and asked for forgiveness for all the sins of the people at once.

00:28:27.992 --> 00:28:38.944
Now you will be surprised that there is such a place where they cannot dramatize the crucifixion of Jesus,  so they hang someone else and take round that hanged person in a big procession.

00:28:38.944 --> 00:28:45.966
Tell Me, can you get Jesus Christ by doing such a spectacle?

00:28:45.966 --> 00:28:58.821
So that joy, in order to get that joy, first of all you should become like Shri Ganesha.

00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:01.466
But who pays attention towards it?

00:29:01.466 --> 00:29:12.053
Even after this puja today, you will think that Mother told us that we should become innocent like Ganeshji, even if someone deceives you.

00:29:12.053 --> 00:29:18.447
Many people tell Me that, “Mother, You are very simple, You are very naive, people cheat you.”

00:29:18.447 --> 00:29:25.951
The one who can cheat Me is not yet born, but I am.. (inaudible)

00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:28.248
Let me see what kind of swindler you are,

00:29:28.248 --> 00:29:31.852
otherwise how I will know what swindle is?

00:29:31.852 --> 00:29:33.349
Because I don't even know what is ‘swindling’!

00:29:33.349 --> 00:29:38.788
When they deceive Me, then I know that those are deceits and this is swindling.

00:29:38.788 --> 00:29:42.731
Then by putting attention there, the swindler finishes and cheating also ends.

00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:56.552
So it is necessary that man accepts the innocence.

00:29:56.552 --> 00:30:01.454
It is said also for Shankara (Shri Shiva), that He is naive, He has innocence.

00:30:01.454 --> 00:30:05.318
Which gods do not have innocence?

00:30:05.318 --> 00:30:16.884
It is said for the Goddess, that when She got furious and thought of destroying the whole creation – She was completely fed up –

00:30:16.884 --> 00:30:22.027
then there was an outcry in all the people, as the Mother got upset, what would happen to us now?

00:30:22.027 --> 00:30:28.234
And everyone felt that the world would collapse and will not be created again.

00:30:28.234 --> 00:30:31.879
At that time, Shankarji (Shri Shiva) got an idea,

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:38.854
to put Her own child under Her feet, saying “if You want to start destroying it, then destroy this child”.

00:30:38.854 --> 00:30:44.593
And such a big tongue came out of Her mouth: “Oh my God!  I am destroying My own child!”

00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:57.572
So, actually the children make us feel the love, joy, unity, and what we call concentration as well as integrity.

00:30:57.572 --> 00:31:07.231
Everyone has said that the world becomes one because of children.

00:31:07.231 --> 00:31:13.271
When a child is in trouble, all the parents have attention on that child to save the child.

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:20.895
Because we are universal in a way.

00:31:20.895 --> 00:31:24.461
The biggest thing that is universal, that children should be allowed to flourish.

00:31:24.461 --> 00:31:30.651
It is a universal power and its awareness, its experience, is within all of us.

00:31:30.651 --> 00:31:35.478
That's why Jesus Christ has said that if you want to enter into the kingdom of God,

00:31:35.478 --> 00:31:37.331
then you should become like little children.

00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:42.763
This is the real worship of Ganesha, when you have that innocence.

00:31:42.763 --> 00:31:49.806
And their actions like spontaneous dance, the effortless fight, and their spontaneous talk, how beautiful they are!

00:31:49.806 --> 00:31:54.388
Everywhere you get His Darshan and you see.

00:31:54.388 --> 00:31:58.386
But here you get attached. In children there is absolutely no attachment.

00:31:58.386 --> 00:31:59.554
They make everything like a game.

00:31:59.554 --> 00:32:07.519
You take them to the airport, they will find something as running, jumping, making a game of something.

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:11.235
Everything is a play for them and they leave it immediately, too.

00:32:11.235 --> 00:32:12.346
They have no attachment.

00:32:12.346 --> 00:32:17.838
There is no falsehood with them, that: “this game is mine.”

00:32:17.838 --> 00:32:23.054
When this happens, then one should know that the child is no more that childlike.

00:32:23.054 --> 00:32:28.345
If you ask for something, a child would bring you three times.

00:32:28.345 --> 00:32:33.147
If playing a game, he would leave and run away, to play another game.

00:32:33.147 --> 00:32:37.931
He does not know if he should stick to it or be happy.

00:32:37.931 --> 00:32:46.577
That innocence, in that innocence there is a deficiency of one thing that they have no knowledge, which is fulfilled in you;

00:32:46.577 --> 00:32:48.373
there is innocence without knowledge.

00:32:48.373 --> 00:32:54.521
But you have found the knowledge, and its crown is your innocence.

00:32:54.521 --> 00:33:01.455
Even after acquiring such a great knowledge, if we cannot achieve that thing,

00:33:01.455 --> 00:33:09.139
if we cannot get the reverence of Ganesha and His surrendering power, then it is useless to do everything else.

00:33:09.139 --> 00:33:16.890
In My opinion, this is like a machine in a way: you come, chant Ganesh mantras, and then do this.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:21.237
I think that in every puja, so many times we worship and say His mantra.

00:33:21.237 --> 00:33:26.008
It is okay to say His mantra, but I think worshipping Gauri will be good.

00:33:26.008 --> 00:33:30.013
She guides, She is Kundalini, She lifts you up.

00:33:30.013 --> 00:33:33.863
You can see Ganesha only in His form.Right now, you are unable to see Him in the formless

00:33:33.863 --> 00:33:40.095
because till now you have not operated Kundalini (Gauri) and have not taken shelter under Her (Gauri). You want to see only Ganesha.

00:33:40.095 --> 00:33:54.360
Today is the day of Gauri; it is such a coincidence that in Sahaja Yoga, puja is always done with convenience,

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.792
not on muhurat (मुहूरत - the particular precise time to start any auspicious thing according to the astrology).

00:33:55.792 --> 00:34:05.688
It should be convenient: it should be Sunday, otherwise, not everyone can attend, and the time on Sunday should be such that there is no movie.

00:34:05.688 --> 00:34:16.521
Till today I have never seen any movie on Sunday and I do not know whether there is movie or not.

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:21.859
But there is movie on Sundays, so it is good to do the puja in the morning:

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:25.124
“Mother, you should finish soon because then it will be the movie time.”

00:34:25.124 --> 00:34:31.341
If this is our attitude, then what is the use of doing Ganesh Puja?

00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:44.964
If our attention is engaged in such things, then please understand that we cannot cure it. There is no cure for this.

00:34:44.964 --> 00:34:53.908
So, you should keep watching your attention at all times what thoughts are arising in it.

00:34:53.908 --> 00:35:06.592
As Namdev has described, it should be like a small child holding the kite string in one hand and same time, he is talking, playing,

00:35:06.592 --> 00:35:12.334
laughing, joking—but his attention is completely towards the kite.

00:35:12.334 --> 00:35:22.146
Similarly, a yogi should keep his whole attention on the kite, towards your spirit.

00:35:22.146 --> 00:35:27.493
Otherwise, all these powers which are given to you cannot be fulfilled.

00:35:27.493 --> 00:35:31.019
There cannot be any development or eruption of it.

00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:34.397
Many people ask, “Mother, why does this happen?”

00:35:34.397 --> 00:35:48.247
As you know, any Sputnik-like things which are sent into the space,

00:35:48.247 --> 00:35:56.517
their mechanism is like this that they are put one inside the other, and when the first one reaches certain limit,

00:35:56.517 --> 00:35:59.204
it explodes and pushes the next one further.

00:35:59.204 --> 00:36:02.666
Then the second one explodes and the next one inside is pushed further,

00:36:02.666 --> 00:36:08.241
it accelerates its powers, it gets a boost immediately.

00:36:08.241 --> 00:36:11.609
Why doesn't such an explosion take place within us?

00:36:11.609 --> 00:36:20.013
Because still we are like Ganapati (statues) which can be bought for 10 paise. That is the reason.

00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:23.277
If there is a real Ganapati, then it should explode

00:36:23.277 --> 00:36:27.909
and people should know that each and every person is so great!

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:30.982
That doesn't happen. We indulge in our own things.

00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:37.161
(we are involved) In our own matters, we think about ourselves and all the time we think that: “What is our benefit in this by coming to Sahaja Yoga?”

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:46.246
In fact, it is total gain, totally beneficial.

00:36:46.246 --> 00:36:52.014
Because the moment you sit on your throne, the whole kingdom is yours,

00:36:52.014 --> 00:36:58.087
but instead of sitting on the throne, you go to every door and beg, then you are only a beggar.

00:36:58.087 --> 00:37:01.596
What is the use of offering you to sit on the throne?

00:37:01.596 --> 00:37:08.891
And even after sitting on the throne you ask Mother if She can give a little more money, then what is the meaning of this thing?

00:37:08.891 --> 00:37:11.658
And even after sitting on the throne you ask Mother if She can give a little more money, then what is the meaning of this thing?

00:37:11.658 --> 00:37:16.657
If we want to awaken the power of Ganesha within ourselves,

00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:23.522
then first of all we should know that we should focus our attention towards the formless, towards Chaitanya,

00:37:23.522 --> 00:37:26.548
and see the chaitanya which is flowing from inside us.

00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:34.124
Those whose chaitanya is impure will say that “I have got a bhoot [evil].” How come? Ganesha can never get any bhoot.

00:37:34.124 --> 00:37:40.106
I have given you a place in My body. No one would have done this.

00:37:40.106 --> 00:37:42.768
And I take the trouble for your cleansing.

00:37:42.768 --> 00:37:45.029
But why can't you people cleanse yourself?

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:49.498
And people will come and say, “Mother, my Agnya has been caught, I have got ego.” Why did it happen?

00:37:49.498 --> 00:37:56.741
Why do you have ego when the doer is God Almighty?

00:37:56.741 --> 00:38:07.232
It is because we do not see our faults, put it in others and say that this is your work, and it is because of you.

00:38:07.232 --> 00:38:10.727
Shri Ganesh is opposite of this!

00:38:10.727 --> 00:38:19.445
If He comes to know that I do not have attention on Him, He puts everyone right. I'm telling you

00:38:19.445 --> 00:38:24.616
He is such an expert, smart, alert, skilled.

00:38:24.616 --> 00:38:29.238
He knows who is sitting where. And how (is that person)? I also know everything; not that I do not know.

00:38:29.238 --> 00:38:33.420
But I want to keep you safe – but not Him.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.461
He says: why let such useless people follow Mother? He himself would settle them.

00:38:38.461 --> 00:38:47.628
But the biggest thing that I still don't understand is that after all this, your speech is not pure.

00:38:47.628 --> 00:38:51.070
Many people use abusive words, still in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.010
They scream, shout, speak loudly.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.346
There is no love or sweetness in it.

00:38:57.346 --> 00:39:00.729
It means even your speech is not pure.

00:39:00.729 --> 00:39:09.780
And on the top there is pompous show, one can say like showing off that we are smiling a lot,

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:15.185
we are laughing a lot, we are feeling very happy, and from inside I can see that their hearts are not clean.

00:39:15.185 --> 00:39:24.085
That gravity of the real joy has totally different glow.

00:39:24.085 --> 00:39:26.819
And that cannot be hidden from Me.

00:39:26.819 --> 00:39:31.313
Whatever makeup you put on and come, I will know how deep you are in the water.

00:39:31.313 --> 00:39:35.792
But why is that needed? Why do I even test you?

00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:39.000
What is the reason that I test? Why do I work so hard?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.587
The reason is that I want all of you to shine.

00:39:41.587 --> 00:39:50.154
But as long as you do not have your own benevolence in your mind, until you do not pay attention to the fulfilment of your ultimate goal,

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:54.062
you will be indulged in useless things and will continue to trouble Me with that;

00:39:54.062 --> 00:39:59.128
people argue with Me, “Mother, we worship you so much, how did it happen like this?”

00:39:59.128 --> 00:40:03.028
Why, don’t you have any flaws? Are you complete?

00:40:03.028 --> 00:40:08.724
Do you say that you have got your Self-Realization?

00:40:08.724 --> 00:40:16.367
When we think of such things, then our attention goes upwards,

00:40:16.367 --> 00:40:23.207
and our hands outstretch towards Chaitanya; at that time chaitanya starts flowing in us

00:40:23.207 --> 00:40:27.339
and it is so happy to find its place there.

00:40:27.339 --> 00:40:32.009
Just like a flood comes, the whole body gets illuminated.

00:40:32.009 --> 00:40:38.247
It is a very easy thing to illuminate one or two people,

00:40:38.247 --> 00:40:42.961
but I want that we should become like this collectively.

00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:47.490
Because it is the need of today, otherwise just think [of] where this society is going.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.997
Fraudulent people are coming up.

00:40:49.997 --> 00:40:59.923
People are in trouble from all sorts, and apart from this, there is so much immorality which indicates the dark Kali Yug.

00:40:59.923 --> 00:41:06.130
What do you want your children to do in this?

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:14.483
Or you want that you have come to this world for some special great work and you should do that work.

00:41:14.483 --> 00:41:17.137
All done; you had money problem that got solved,

00:41:17.137 --> 00:41:22.088
job problem was solved, and many other problems were solved; what next?

00:41:22.088 --> 00:41:25.490
The greed is not getting over yet.

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:30.950
And for that, too, bothering Me all the time. Is not at all appropriate.

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:34.589
Only questions related to Sahaja Yoga should be asked to Me,

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:37.385
and asking any other question is wrong.

00:41:37.385 --> 00:41:41.591
And there is no need to talk a lot to know that question in the end.

00:41:41.591 --> 00:41:44.848
Asking calmly will automatically give you the answer.

00:41:44.848 --> 00:41:52.609
Otherwise you will have to install My loudspeaker every time: “What did the Mother say in this?” So what is the difference between you and others?

00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:55.995
A gentleman came to Me, started saying that “God speaks to me.” I said, “How?”

00:41:55.995 --> 00:42:03.050
He said, “I have Gita, I open it, whichever page that opens, I consider God is saying whatever is written in it.”

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:06.524
I said, “Very good.” The same situation looks with Me.

00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.938
Open the page: what did Mother say? Said like this. Now this.

00:42:09.938 --> 00:42:14.199
You have creative power within yourself, you have reflecting power within yourself.

00:42:14.199 --> 00:42:17.279
You have that power within you which can make the world shine.

00:42:17.279 --> 00:42:26.028
Then why do you want again and again that Mother says something on this matter? You yourself can answer the question.

00:42:26.028 --> 00:42:30.635
I have seen that I am the only one to answer.

00:42:30.635 --> 00:42:36.680
People only bring problems in front of Me; “There is such a problem in this,” “There is such a problem in that.”

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:41.260
But (I) find no one saying, “No, there is a solution for this Mother, we shall do it, You don't worry.”

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:45.676
We also need such people who can say that we shall do it, it is not a difficult task.

00:42:45.676 --> 00:42:59.723
Every man should know that whatever we are saying today – materiality, objectified, or whatever is being said –

00:42:59.723 --> 00:43:02.747
– as soon as energy is transmitted in it, that thing becomes something else.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:07.658
As this thing [mic] is useless [without power transmission]; as soon as the power is transmitted in it, you are listening to Me.

00:43:07.658 --> 00:43:14.581
Similarly, anything which we say that is useless, as soon as power is transmitted in it, it becomes amazing.

00:43:14.581 --> 00:43:19.108
You love your children. Well, infuse power into them and those children will become wonderful.

00:43:19.108 --> 00:43:25.876
It will happen. If you love your home, let's infuse power in it, it will become a temple.

00:43:25.876 --> 00:43:36.762
If there is any defect in your intellect or you bring many questions to your mind all the time, you infuse power in it, the answer to everything will come in front of you.

00:43:36.762 --> 00:43:39.465
What is the need to ask Me?

00:43:39.465 --> 00:43:47.528
Above all, Dnyaneshwarji, While reading his books I am surprised, he never saw Me in physical form,

00:43:47.528 --> 00:43:54.141
but he realised the power that had been given to him and in the form of that power he took things to such new heights.

00:43:54.141 --> 00:44:01.359
If you are still satisfied with the physical form, then you cannot move forward.

00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:09.318
You have to achieve Me in the formless so that the creative powers within you increase.

00:44:09.318 --> 00:44:17.208
This is what we believe, as people say, Shri Ganesha as our Mahaguru.

00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:27.212
The reason is, by the transmission of His powers, we ourselves become gurus.

00:44:27.212 --> 00:44:30.016
How many times do we say that we are our own gurus,

00:44:30.016 --> 00:44:39.438
but I don't see how many people who can stand on their own feet and say, “Yes, Mother, this the thing, for which we have answers.”

00:44:39.438 --> 00:44:42.601
“Only we know its answer!”

00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:47.761
And when they start giving the answers, they are such answers that the whole world becomes silent in front of them!

00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:58.208
But those who actually give answers are so egoistic, so stupid and so low that I don't understand if they are Sahaja Yogis or where they are going.

00:44:58.208 --> 00:45:05.053
People without devotion suffer losses, that is one thing.

00:45:05.053 --> 00:45:11.864
There are losses also, and they have to learn. They have to take many lessons; understand that.

00:45:11.864 --> 00:45:22.558
But even after that, after going through all, if you continue to study in schools all your life, how will you get a job?

00:45:22.558 --> 00:45:29.008
If you keep failing every year then you cannot get a job.

00:45:29.008 --> 00:45:33.404
Why should God Almighty make you His servant?

00:45:33.404 --> 00:45:39.193
Because you say, “Lord, make me your instrument.” See, He also thinks who should be made instrument!

00:45:39.193 --> 00:45:43.901
What is the need to make such “defective” people His instruments, who create disaster every time?

00:45:43.901 --> 00:45:47.164
His car just can't move like this. (He can’t make things work like this).

00:45:47.164 --> 00:45:55.494
We have all the power within us to become His instrument, we have the awakening within us.

00:45:55.494 --> 00:45:59.195
No one knew about Him as us.

00:45:59.195 --> 00:46:02.740
No one has even written about Sahasrara; that too we know.

00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:06.473
The whole thing is like an open book in front of us.

00:46:06.473 --> 00:46:12.658
But that doesn't mean it is enough just to read a book or that you become powerful just by saying mantra.

00:46:12.658 --> 00:46:23.092
The permanent base of the mantra is purity ; and its “reach” : as is said that “where is the glance?”

00:46:23.092 --> 00:46:27.649
Until there is harmony between the two things (the base and the reach)

00:46:27.649 --> 00:46:31.203
– as if there is a kite in hand and its flight is upwards.

00:46:31.203 --> 00:46:35.884
Similarly, unless in your life, you see where is your flight!

00:46:35.884 --> 00:46:39.487
Many people say that, “Mother, when we will have God’s Realization?”

00:46:39.487 --> 00:46:42.252
Can I give such a guarantee in writing?

00:46:42.252 --> 00:46:46.432
And second time, went there and started backbiting to someone.

00:46:46.432 --> 00:46:52.941
A person who cannot even control simple anger, how will he do Sahaja Yoga?

00:46:52.941 --> 00:46:57.859
Krishna condemned the anger first of all.

00:46:57.859 --> 00:47:05.066
Said it is the worst. “Krodhadhavati sammoha” (क्रोधधवती सम्मोह): Anger is the worst thing. It brings hypnosis.

00:47:05.066 --> 00:47:13.548
So to awaken the power of Ganesha within us,

00:47:13.548 --> 00:47:21.600
we should think that we have to be pure and in that purity we should take His beautiful form which is innocent form.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:25.303
No! Otherwise, they would say, “Okay, we are Ganesha. We take parasha (a battle-axe, one of the weapons of Shri Ganesha) in our hands and go around hitting.”

00:47:25.303 --> 00:47:30.533
You don't have that power.

00:47:30.533 --> 00:47:35.749
That parasha is not in your hand.

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:41.014
The day that power comes in your hand, then the parasha will be given in your hand.

00:47:41.014 --> 00:47:45.859
Right now the one you are hitting is (actually)your own ghost is hitting you.

00:47:45.859 --> 00:47:55.688
You are the ghost, if you are screaming, shouting and getting angry, hitting others – it can never be Ganesh power.

00:47:55.688 --> 00:48:01.158
Because you don't even know who you're yelling at. Why are you screaming? What are you doing?

00:48:01.158 --> 00:48:11.952
The person who is mad like this should leave Sahaja Yoga and go to lunatic asylum. His place is not here.

00:48:11.952 --> 00:48:18.380
Today's speech has the (sharp) edge of that same parasha.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:28.675
You understand, it is My right, you do not have the right to go about using this parasha around the world.

00:48:28.675 --> 00:48:33.863
– Cut off your nose, cut off your ears. You can't cut anyone else.

00:48:33.863 --> 00:48:41.856
In Sahaja Yoga, the person who does this, the world spits on a such person; laughs at him, jokes about him, condemns him behind his back.

00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:45.456
And such people get away very quickly from Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:45.456 --> 00:48:51.587
Your speech should be very beautiful and clean.

00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:56.470
Must be good, must be sweet. But there should not be deceit behind it.

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:03.679
Like businessmen: “Brother, you are very good, please have paan (betel leaf), eat this and that, and empty your pocket before leaving!”

00:49:03.679 --> 00:49:13.032
From the heart, (whatever you say) it should be said from the heart.

00:49:13.032 --> 00:49:20.167
And when the thing is spoken from the heart, it is very beneficial because the heart absorbs everything.

00:49:20.167 --> 00:49:23.705
The same thing becomes eternal forever.

00:49:23.705 --> 00:49:27.237
The rest of the things are superficial, the thing of the intellect remains superficial.

00:49:27.237 --> 00:49:32.373
But whatever touches the heart, that which is heart-touching, it settles in the heart.

00:49:32.373 --> 00:49:34.759
Always remember this thing,

00:49:34.759 --> 00:49:46.580
that though the place of Shri Ganesha is on the Mooladhara, but when He comes in your heart, then in the form of the spirit He becomes chaitanya [full of vibrations].

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:50.413
The spirit is Shri Ganesha,

00:49:50.413 --> 00:50:00.785
and when the same Shri Ganesha gives light through our heart, then He only is the chaitanya.

00:50:00.785 --> 00:50:07.623
There is no need to worry at all for the one who has placed Shri Ganesh in his heart.

00:50:07.623 --> 00:50:13.379
He is said to be immersed in niranand all the time.

00:50:13.379 --> 00:50:17.594
He doesn't know about any other thing neither does he care.

00:50:17.594 --> 00:50:20.555
And Riddhi-Siddhi, all are there at His feet.

00:50:20.555 --> 00:50:25.902
Without his knowledge or even thinking about it; all the work is done automatically.

00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:29.297
This experience is proven. I am not saying this like that.

00:50:29.297 --> 00:50:33.630
This experience is proven. You know it, you know about Me; why shouldn't it be about you?

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:42.402
Right now, I am only walking behind you, becoming Riddhi-Siddhi for you,

00:50:42.402 --> 00:50:45.268
but everyone has their own time of reckoning.

00:50:45.268 --> 00:50:50.277
You should also not leave your destination and turn to the other side.

00:50:50.277 --> 00:50:56.229
Keep your eyes elevated on where you want to go and what you want to achieve.

00:50:56.229 --> 00:51:02.930
This had never happened till today, and if you forget what is happening then it is not My fault.

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:09.883
And there is no need for Me to punish for this: Shri Ganesh is sitting there with a parsha.

00:51:09.883 --> 00:51:16.784
So look towards yourself, match that seriousness within you,

00:51:16.784 --> 00:51:19.214
with that depth which is the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:51:19.214 --> 00:51:26.992
That depth of bliss, as deep as an ocean of joy.

00:51:26.992 --> 00:51:33.562
Just on seeing such a deep soul a person becomes elated, filled with joy.

00:51:33.562 --> 00:51:36.593
Then your vision only will work.

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.624
My troubles will be greatly reduced.

00:51:38.624 --> 00:51:45.428
This state will have to come, and today you should worship with this one determination, that: we are going to bring this state.

00:51:45.428 --> 00:51:52.432
And today especially Gauri is worshipped, Kundalini is worshipped, who gives us power and drive,

00:51:52.432 --> 00:51:59.932
who gives that power to Ganesha, due to which He is ongoing.

00:51:59.932 --> 00:52:08.464
And now by coming into the form from the formless state and from the physical form of you people, it can bring you into the formless, that is the Gauri shakti.

00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:15.180
So we are the worshippers of shakti, and who is not powerful, is weak.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:19.578
The person who does not worship his power and who does not awaken that power in himself

00:52:19.578 --> 00:52:24.924
and does not get engrossed in it, and does not give its light, for him it's pointless to call himself a Sahaja Yogi.

00:52:24.924 --> 00:52:31.683
This way many monkeys and donkeys can be found on which I should label Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi.

00:52:31.683 --> 00:52:34.145
Sahaja this, Sahaja that.

00:52:34.145 --> 00:52:36.690
(By doing that) Will they become that?

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:43.946
So it's not a matter of labelling; it's about the inside.

00:52:43.946 --> 00:52:45.895
It is a matter of the innermost heart.

00:52:45.895 --> 00:52:49.280
It should be received from the heart, it should enter the heart.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:56.688
And whatever is there in the society, in the politics, in the external, external things,

00:52:56.688 --> 00:52:58.561
they should not be allowed to enter inside.

00:52:58.561 --> 00:53:01.517
“Because everybody does it, so we also do the same”.

00:53:01.517 --> 00:53:06.390
This is Sahaja Yoga, you have your own personality in it.

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:12.021
It's not that it's individuality; it's not individual, it's personality.

00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:14.907
It is our personality. We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:14.907 --> 00:53:17.643
Why should we do things because the the world does it?

00:53:17.643 --> 00:53:29.893
We're not going to do it. As long as you do not move forward with this courage, Sahaja Yoga cannot raise any mountain (do anything higher) here

00:53:29.893 --> 00:53:32.540
– maybe we are able to make some swamp or bog.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:41.493
Mother's intentions are many and I have done a lot of hard work, I have not lacked any hard work,

00:53:41.493 --> 00:53:47.490
but now I want you to pay attention here and keep yourself content.

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.094
But it does not mean that you show you are very content by bringing a smile on the face.

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:55.731
No. (We should) weigh (and check) the satisfaction within us. Are we really satisfied?

00:53:55.731 --> 00:54:10.861
I hope you all will meditate completely and devote everything towards meditation.

00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:14.188
Then only the work will be done.

00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:17.974
And when these powers come within you, then you will be surprised, that:

00:54:17.974 --> 00:54:25.642
“Mother, we have become higher than all the mountains, greener than all the trees, we have become greater than this earth.”

00:54:25.642 --> 00:54:31.184
Like Tukaram said, that “I am small in appearance, but I am as big as the sky.”

00:54:31.184 --> 00:54:35.243
Unless this is happening within you, what is the use of coming into Sahaja Yoga?

00:54:35.243 --> 00:54:41.229
Please pay attention to today's talk and pay attention towards it.

00:54:41.229 --> 00:54:52.081
And with all your heart you do the puja to Shri Ganesh today praying “with the help of Gauri Maa and with Her power, may we enter in the state of formless

00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:57.017
where we would be completely in the joy and, that it flows everywhere in our beings in such a way

00:54:57.017 --> 00:55:01.385
that people in the World realise what wonders Sahaja Yoga has done!”

00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:05.834
Achieving this wonderful state to the fullest is called excellence.

00:55:05.834 --> 00:55:07.770
That thing should come in you.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.839
You yourself should judge whether you have achieved excellence in Sahaja Yoga or not.

00:55:10.839 --> 00:55:17.319
And everyone can do it. It doesn't require anything to read, write, or anything or a book.

00:55:17.319 --> 00:55:20.204
Only pure desire is needed, which we should keep within ourselves.

00:55:20.204 --> 00:55:24.662
I hope you get it in the puja today.

00:55:24.662 --> 00:55:29.395
You go out with this great power, not without it.

00:55:29.395 --> 00:55:37.013
Whatever small thing comes in your mind, that it should be fine or that should be fine, leaving all of this behind, get the supreme superpower today. Everything is going to be fine automatically.
