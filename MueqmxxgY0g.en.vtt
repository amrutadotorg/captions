00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.970
Now, any questions?

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.970
Question from a yogini: I have a question.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.970
Something that I’m encountering in my life,
and I and this guy who I introduced to Sahaja

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.970
and we went together.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.970
He became very frightened after the first
meeting and he became very much against Sahaja

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.970
Shri Mataji: Me?

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.970
Yogini: Yes, saying that You were bad.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.970
And I, continually I have had great results
with another woman who has experienced.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:21.760
And he, on the contrary is very much against
it and we were involved a lot with channeling

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
and a spiritual, you know, man that channels
spirits.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.760
And I seem to think that he is still involved
with that in some way.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.760
I seem to think that is what is holding him
back.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:58.510
Something is holding him and I don’t know
that if it is my place to help him or just

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:10.659
be a light or … I don’t know what to do.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:42.830
Shri Mataji: Now to be very frank, no American
is afraid of anything.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.350
Every world is afraid of them.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.840
It’s a wrong idea they have.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.299
It’s very surprising that the people who
give sense of insecurity to everyone always

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.830
say, “I’m insecure."

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.850
Very surprising.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.770
That’s the way they can just say.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.020
I haven’t met any American who is insecure.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.620
On the contrary they are extremely aggressive
people – very, very aggressive for nothing

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.620
at all.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.569
I’ll give an example.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:24.069
The other day we had gone to one lawyer and
we were waiting for the lift to come down.

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.850
When the lift came, such a hefty, tall man,
six foot at least seven inches, very hefty

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.420
man was in that.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.480
And we were standing for the lift to come,
we didn’t know there’s somebody inside

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480
there.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.870
As soon as the lift opened, he says, “Who
are you, like a bunch of thugs standing here?”

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.140
Can you imagine?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.410
We were amazed.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.099
There was no need.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.989
He had a chance to say something to us, he
just said it.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.030
“So please,” we said.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.560
“It’s all right."

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.610
What could you do?

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.390
This is the kind of fear they have.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.250
Russians and Americans.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.209
Both are just the same, I would say.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.770
Let them fight it out among themselves.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:27.239
But to say that an American is frightened
of something, that’s the biggest joke.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.040
They are not frightened.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:41.849
On the contrary, they always fall into problems
because they go to something which is challenging. I’ll give a [UNCLEAR]

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.720
All the false gurus take money from you.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.400
All right.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:57.800
Now they say, this one, recently somebody
told Me she paid so much money to the gentleman.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.620
He took her into a room all alone.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.500
She’s not frightened!

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.980
I mean an Indian woman would be frightened
of a man who takes her into a room alone.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.129
She says, “No, no, no.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.510
You’d better do whatever you like."

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.739
She’s not frightened.

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.750
She went inside the room.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.959
He said, “Now take out your clothes."

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.970
She took out her clothes.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.970
Not frightened.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.580
He said, “Now you sit here, and jump.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.770
Jump, jump, jump!”

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.880
She started jumping.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.920
Not afraid that she’ll break her bones or
hands or feet or anything.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.170
Just started jumping.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.170
“Haah!

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.240
I feel very fine.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.520
I feel very nice."

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.860
What are they afraid of?

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.130
Doing stupid things they are not afraid of,
doing nonsensical things they are not afraid

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.340
of, but to do sensible things they are.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.060
That’s basically wrong thing.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.300
You know in Brighton we had a nude, a nude
– what do you call that?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.740
– swimming pool.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.870
When it’s such a cold time there.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.690
I don’t know why in a country which is so
cold people want to take out their clothes.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.720
Some sort of – I can’t understand.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.130
I mean in the night we sleep with all our
clothes on in a place like India.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.990
What is the need to take out clothes, I still
don’t understand.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.070
All right.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:26.320
So, there was a, one swimming pool they started,
a very big venture, you know.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.790
All the television, everything focused and
everybody watching, is for the women and men

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:32.870
who become nude.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.490
What is so great?

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.490
Anybody can become.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.160
But, there was an old lady, of My age, walking
into the water.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.770
It’s very cold, you know.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.850
I was wondering, “This woman will get cold
or something like that and pneumonia."

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.600
They said, “How do you feel?”

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.280
“Oh, I feel very hot."

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.640
This stupid woman was feeling hot, you know.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.169
This is what it is.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.140
“What’s wrong?”

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.690
To do something stupid, nonsensical they have
no fear.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.900
How is it you think all these gurus have prospered
with all their tricks where people have become

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.100
mad, have become lunatics; they’ve lost
their money, sold their children out.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.100
How?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.199
For Sahaja Yoga, they’re frightened.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.199
Why?

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.199
You see the point?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.570
See the point?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.800
This is exact is the character.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.080
Such people cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:40.650
We have to have people of strength, people
of character, people of dignity.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.400
We can’t have such people who go after this
thing.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:50.870
Like the other day, one boy came and he asked
Me all stupid questions and he was saying

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.699
that, “You see, what about flying in the
air?”

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:55.229
I said, “It’s all right.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:57.460
But supposing you are suddenly dropped down.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.910
What will you do?”

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.300
He’s willing to fly in the air.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.430
Supposing, you see, he has no wings, nothing,
no parachute.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.330
How will he come down?

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.160
Even the children understand the joke.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.009
So this is what it is.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:22.870
To be like a clown, they have no fear at all.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:31.790
But to be sensible, balanced and dignified,
they’re afraid.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:41.820
We are not here to ask for elections, are
we?

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:53.360
Sahaja Yoga is difficult – for people who
are stupid, naturally, people who want to

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.780
have a life of destruction.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:08.300
It’s for people who want to evolve, people
who want to become more compassionate, affectionate,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:17.330
and humble – which is very difficult.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.889
Here the training is, if you are humble, anybody
will trample on you, you’ll be finished,

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:22.889
you’ll be killed.

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:23.889
All right?

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:28.120
You have to be aggressive.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.560
To say an aggressive person is afraid of another
person, then you’d better change the meaning

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.419
of the word “aggressive."

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.909
I would not say only Americans, even English.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:44.970
In English language, “I’m afraid."

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:45.970
What are they afraid?

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.970
Everybody is afraid of an Englishman.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.569
If he comes in your house, be careful.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:53.869
He’ll create problem between husband and
wife.

00:08:53.869 --> 00:09:00.899
What is there to be afraid?

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:11.929
Afraid of that is Divine, of that is blissful,
that is

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:13.209
such an advantage to you?

00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:15.560
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but blessings, blessings,
blessings.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.439
Nothing to sacrifice, nothing to give up,
nothing to sell out.

00:09:21.439 --> 00:09:31.089
Even small, small things like children, their
problems, this, that is looked into.

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:41.439
Somebody who cares for you, Somebody who manages
things, Somebody who makes you powerful and

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:44.059
confident and secure.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:45.950
What is there to be afraid of?

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:52.970
But the brains are upside down.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.800
They are not afraid of a tiger, but afraid
of a cow.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.160
What do you say to such a person?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.040
Say, “What are you afraid of?”

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.809
“Afraid of a cow."

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:07.050
“And what you’re not afraid of?”

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.839
“Not of a tiger."

00:10:09.839 --> 00:10:11.230
“All right.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.319
It’s all right.

00:10:13.319 --> 00:10:14.319
Sorry.

00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:15.559
I’ll go to some other place."

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:16.680
That’s what you have to say.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.779
I mean, this is what it is: people are just
upside down.

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:25.839
Their value system is upside down.

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:28.720
Example I’ll give you, very simple example,
this Mr.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.420
Hart lost his election because they said he
had some relationship with some woman somewhere.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.129
It’s so common in this country.

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:40.170
What is there that he should lose?

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:46.179
I mean, if he had done something else, like
if he had taken some money of the government

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.829
or must have cheated them, then it’s all
right.

00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:51.239
But on a point which everybody does!

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:54.699
It would be tomorrow, “Why did you eat a
sausage?

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:58.019
That’s why it lose you."

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.350
It’s absurd.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.879
They’re upside down.

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:03.319
Brains are upside down.

00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:04.829
See, what is the logic?

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:08.459
So those who say they’re afraid, you say,
“You’re right.

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.369
You go and bang your head with something.

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.550
That would be better for you."

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:19.889
It’s all stories, I tell you, is the way
they put you down.

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:29.410
There’s nothing to be afraid from a fragrance
of the flower – it’s like that.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.829
There’s … we have a guru who cannot bear
any flowers.

00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:34.160
No fragrance.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.189
But if you take the water from the gutters,
he’s very happy.

00:11:38.189 --> 00:11:41.049
Now, what do you say to that?

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:44.269
I mean we are not here to please such people,
are we?

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:46.149
You know there’s a guru like that.

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:49.970
He can’t bear … He got how many Rolls
Royces?

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.379
Sixty-three Rolls Royces.

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:57.579
And they used to take gutter water for him,
instead of giving flowers.

00:11:57.579 --> 00:12:05.699
And there are many Americans who did it, thousands
and thousands and thousands.

00:12:05.699 --> 00:12:10.739
Imagine, to buy sixty-three Rolls Royces out
of American money.

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:14.239
What do you say to them?

00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:24.279
But they’re afraid to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.889
See?

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:29.609
This is self-deception.

00:12:29.609 --> 00:12:31.290
There’s nothing hiding in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.100
We have to say what one has to say.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.470
We have to face what one has to face.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.000
You should not have any conditionings about
it.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.389
You should not have any ego about it.

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:49.300
Try to understand that this has to be understood:
that we have to be ourselves.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.189
We have to grow.

00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:54.509
Whatever is wrong within us has to go away.

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:57.410
But it’s only possible when you become the
Self.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.911
Like, if I have something wrong on My sari,
I can only see it if I have eyes, otherwise

00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:05.319
anybody says, “You’re wearing a sari which
is dirty”, I might be angry.

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:10.569
If I’m identified with the sari, I’ll
be angry.

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:12.120
But if I see, “Oh God!

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.959
I’d better clean it."

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:20.899
So it’s a vicious circle how to open their
eyes, because to open their eyes is very difficult,

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:24.269
impossible, because they are afraid.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:28.930
They’re afraid of the light, happy with
the darkness.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:32.609
Now you cannot please them.

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:44.519
Also, you must know that if you put the whole
American people together and all the Western

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:54.249
people together, we have manifold more people
say in India and other countries who will

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:55.699
become realized souls.

00:13:55.699 --> 00:13:59.779
God doesn’t bother from where they come.

00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:08.680
If they want to accept such horrible gurus,
let them have it and go with them.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.790
As they say, “Take two running jumps and
go to Hell!”

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.549
That’s the attitude of the Divine, I really
tell you.

00:14:16.549 --> 00:14:24.709
But not Mine, because I am the Mother so I
have to make the compromise between the nonsensical

00:14:24.709 --> 00:14:30.439
people and the Divine, which is nothing but
sense.

00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:35.179
There, that is common sense.

00:14:35.179 --> 00:14:37.620
So what I have to do is to: “All right.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.620
Doesn’t matter.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.620
Let’s try.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.620
Let’s try.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620
They’ll come along.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.620
They’ll be all right.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.949
They are created by God, that’s why they
are loved."

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:47.459
But not because you are seeking any elections.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:51.329
You must realize it.

00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:54.749
We are not the only human beings living.

00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:57.149
We are not the topmost people.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:02.129
Let’s see where we have gone.

00:15:02.129 --> 00:15:07.919
I don’t want to condemn anyone as such,
because they are all My children, but I would

00:15:07.919 --> 00:15:10.180
like you to see where are we.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:15.209
We must understand, we are getting destroyed,
our children are getting destroyed, our society

00:15:15.209 --> 00:15:17.079
is getting destroyed, the whole thing is getting
destroyed.

00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:18.079
Where are we?

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:20.249
What’s the use of calling ourselves great?

00:15:20.249 --> 00:15:29.149
Now AIDS, you’ll be surprised, there’s
a war on AIDS – what is the war on AIDS?

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:42.629
Once upon a time, you see, these tourists
used to bring their clothes and their, what

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:49.680
you call, sleeping bags and everything, and
sell them in the border of Nepal.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:55.059
My daughter lives there.

00:15:55.059 --> 00:16:00.540
Once they got the news of AIDS, not that they
don’t purchase this, but they’ve thrown

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.379
everything, whatever they had in the house
and burnt it up.

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:08.179
This is the situation.

00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:13.799
Nobody wants to kiss an American these days,
to be very frank.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:17.649
I’ve been warned.

00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:19.070
That’s what you are.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.070
That’s what we are going.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.910
Let’s see where are we going, relatively.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:27.889
But we think still we are great.

00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:30.730
Then who can help you?

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.589
You are just holding on now to something.

00:16:36.589 --> 00:16:38.179
Any moment you’ll fall down.

00:16:38.179 --> 00:16:43.829
Supposing that is the situation, then try
to understand you are in a difficult situation.

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:53.100
I want to warn you again, just like Vishnumaya,
be – not only that you should understand,

00:16:53.100 --> 00:17:01.069
but be in possession of this understanding
that we have to save others.

00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:08.360
If they are afraid, tell them, “What are
you afraid of, stupid fellow?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.819
Come along."

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:15.299
They like it, I tell you.

00:17:15.299 --> 00:17:16.299
“But I am afraid …”

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:19.959
Then you also very sophisticatedly say, “Oh,
I am sorry you are afraid.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:21.980
What are you afraid of?”

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.100
All right?

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.919
That’s how it will work.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:30.419
Otherwise it is not going to work out.

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:32.669
I’ve tried all tricks.

00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:37.659
Nothing works out unless you tell them, “Better
join Sahaja Yoga otherwise you’ll be destroyed

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:38.659
tomorrow.

00:17:38.659 --> 00:17:40.970
You’ll get cancer, you’ll get AIDS, you’ll
get this.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.279
If you want to save yourself, come to Sahaja
Yoga."

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:47.320
That’s what they understand, and that’s
what the gurus do to them.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.940
“If you do not jump, I’ll throw you out
of the room."

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.520
So they start jumping.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.030
It’s a fact.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:03.240
Till they break their bones, they jump.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:13.559
So you should know that you’re Sahaja Yogis
and that you are building up a new society

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.250
of people who can save others.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:22.600
For that you have to know how far people have
gone, how you have to pull them out, how you

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.429
have to work it out.

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:38.309
Any style of compromise, any style of explanation,
discussion – try everything, because after

00:18:38.309 --> 00:18:41.840
all, I don’t want them to be destroyed.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.030
But don’t think what they say has any sense
in it.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:53.789
You must have a higher understanding than
they are because you know that they are catching

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:56.330
on the Agnya and they are afraid.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.700
All right?

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:06.789
Some of them do say – I’ve heard – that,
“Supposing we get transformed, then we cannot

00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:10.070
enjoy the life of every day life."

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.980
What are you enjoying?

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:18.670
On the road you are walking, when I came in
Los Angeles, they told Me, “Mother, do You

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.370
know, serious things have happened."

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.230
I said, “What serious things?”

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:28.389
“On this road three people were killed last
week."

00:19:28.389 --> 00:19:30.110
I said, “How?”

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.830
“Just they shot."

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:37.330
“What’s so great about us?”, you should
ask.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.610
“Aren’t you worried about this may happen
to you – to happen to your children?

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.500
They’ll be killed.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.760
Anybody can kill you.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.419
What are you doing about it?”

00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:55.950
Talk like that as if you understand the problem.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:02.580
You express your concern, your heartfelt concern.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.370
Definitely they will understand.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.980
Because they told Me that “In Sahaja Yoga
it’s very bad because we’ll be transformed

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.340
and then we’ll not enjoy."

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:18.000
So this is what you’re enjoying on the street
– go ahead.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.120
Enjoy the fear, the scariness of it.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.160
You can’t make your children play in the
front door.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.320
That’s what you’re enjoying?

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.289
They enjoy, if they’re stupid they say,
“We … this is our fundamental right to

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:38.110
be stupid."

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.960
But you have a fundamental right to enjoy
joy, to meet joy.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.020
Have you met joy?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.080
That’s your fundamental right: to be the
Spirit.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.179
Have you become the Spirit?

00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:57.159
It’s fundamental right – what sort of
a fundamental right it is to be stupid?

00:20:57.159 --> 00:21:03.049
And they say it openly, shamelessly, without
any respect of yourself.

00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:09.230
They have no respect of themselves, so they
have to first have their own respect.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:14.970
For that, they have to understand that they’re
human beings at the epitome of evolution.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.850
They don’t have to become worms now anymore.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.879
All this you can talk to them the way I’m
talking to you, all of you, and tell them,

00:21:22.879 --> 00:21:24.040
“See, now this is what it is.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.389
What is happening?

00:21:25.389 --> 00:21:27.690
What are we doing about it?”

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.690
All right?

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.200
Even then if they say so, all right.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.000
Don’t waste your energy.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.160
We have to work it out together.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:50.740
Try any tricks that are possible; you are
permitted.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:22:00.299
But in Sahaj Yoga there’s no need to tell
lies, no need to do any harm, to torture someone.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:03.159
There’s no need at all.

00:22:03.159 --> 00:22:16.490
But better bring to their understanding, in
their vision, what is going to happen to the

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.490
country.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:18.490
That’s your job as Sahaj Yogis.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.610
I don’t want anything from you, as you know.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:29.809
But, you have to understand that Mother has
given us realization, that we have become

00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:33.279
Sahaj Yogis – for what?

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:38.940
We have become Sahaja Yogis to be the light,
to show them the light, show them the darkness,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.049
show them the way they will fall down and
will be destroyed.

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:44.049
That’s our job.

00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:45.049
All right?

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:46.049
May God bless you.

00:22:46.049 --> 00:22:47.049
Any other question, please?

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:48.049
Question from a Yogi: I was wondering if You
could talk about what we could do to form

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:58.480
a school for our children here in America.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:10.549
Many of us now with small children [???????]

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:16.740
Shri Mataji: That has been My primal problem
here.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.690
I know, it’s terrible, I know!

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.690
You see it’s going to be very difficult
for you to have your children sent to these

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.990
schools because the atmosphere is so bad.

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:37.330
For the time being I only feel that you must
develop your children in such a manner that

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:46.340
they become strong, self-confident, and also
they have good examples before them, as you

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.600
people are – to begin with.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:57.580
And you will find many Indian families are
here, but what I have seen is that the children

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:05.500
of at least sixty percent of Indian families
don’t learn bad things, normally.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.400
This is My own experience.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:15.730
The reason is because the Indian family people
are all the time talking to their children,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:23.519
having a nice family meetings together, taking
them out, telling them about good things,

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:31.380
of sharing; because those people who are here
from India have had that kind of a training,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.360
so they are trying to train their children
in the same way.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:44.899
Now the families which are so-called “advanced”
here can beat you hollow in nonsensical things.

00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:49.629
Because when it comes to advancement, they
don’t know how to relate it to anything

00:24:49.629 --> 00:24:50.629
else.

00:24:50.629 --> 00:25:01.190
But those who are not that way, those who
have been going through a lifestyle, still

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:12.620
maintain their own ideas and their own behavior,
their own principles.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:19.059
They are imbibed by children, and they just
think, “These are another category of people;

00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:24.590
these are not our style, these are different."

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.659
They don’t change.

00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:29.990
I’ve seen many families like that.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:34.950
In the same way, first of all you must pay
full attention to your children, talk to them,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:41.320
bring them up in such a manner that they have
another value system.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:47.549
I mean, I can say about My own daughters or
grandchildren, you put them anywhere in the

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:53.549
world, they will never become like others,
because they have their roots.

00:25:53.549 --> 00:26:00.080
So you must try to make their roots very strong
into great principles.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:10.350
Then they won’t be that much in difficulty.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:19.960
Like as I was discussing today … people
that … see the … as I said that Indian

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:27.730
society has built up itself in traditional
… now ages it has built in traditions and

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:28.730
things.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.100
So it must have made mistakes, trial and error
and all that.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.399
But it has reached certain really some very
fine points.

00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:43.960
One thing about children in India, say, we
don’t tell them, “Don’t touch this!

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.019
Don’t take this!

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:48.080
Don’t open this!”

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080
Never.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:55.330
We also don’t allow them just to behave
like a bull in a china shop.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.610
Supposing now I want to have a Diet Coke.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:58.610
All right?

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:04.120
So I tell a child, “All right, go and get
one tin of Diet.

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.220
Now bring this glass.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:13.200
Slowly, because it is very good, so beautiful,
you have to use it very carefully.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.200
Now keep it there.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.039
Now open the can.

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.649
Put it in there.

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:22.970
Now you have bring it and give it to a friend
or anyone."

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.330
So the child carries it very carefully.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.419
But supposing it falls down, doesn’t matter!

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:31.980
He’ll have another one.

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:41.129
So the child develops the deftness of handling
it, the respect for it, and not the sort of

00:27:41.129 --> 00:27:45.039
a fear of it.

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:47.490
The cooking, same way.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:52.039
Today there was a big complaint about the
way people cook here.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:28:04.230
And in the discussion then I reached a conclusion
that the mother cooks that way.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:11.470
So what mothers says, all right, she … the
child doesn’t sit in the TV room if mother

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.970
is cooking, in Indian homes.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.840
Is the child is in the TV room?

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.559
No, is with the mother.

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:19.429
The mother says, “All right.

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:22.429
Now what you do, we’ll cut some vegetables.

00:28:22.429 --> 00:28:23.429
I’m cutting.

00:28:23.429 --> 00:28:24.429
Now you’d better do it.

00:28:24.429 --> 00:28:27.951
Now whatever is left out, which is not to
be used for cooking, we’ll have to put it

00:28:27.951 --> 00:28:28.951
in this thing.

00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:32.190
Now, this has to go into the wastepaper basket."

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:38.690
And Indian kitchen is all the time clean,
spic and span, every minute.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.320
Every room is spic and span.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.320
House.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.909
Outside, what can we do?

00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:46.640
It’s the government, the management nonsense.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.499
I mean the people here think they’re very
clean; I think they are not, only the government

00:28:50.499 --> 00:28:55.220
is.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.480
The clothes are hanging here – this, that.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:03.480
In Indian homes, even in the poorest of poor
you go, everything looks spic and span, clean.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.659
Because the child is told to keep it.

00:29:05.659 --> 00:29:09.120
Now the child has, say, a paper in his hand.

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.070
He won’t throw it everywhere.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.450
Carry it, take it to the … How?

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.080
because the mother will say, “All right,
now this paper is here.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.100
Where should it go?”

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.289
All the time the mother and the child are
together, or the father.

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:24.289
All the time.

00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:25.289
Wherever.

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:28.399
It’s not that the children can’t go to
this place.

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:30.059
Here the beginning itself is wrong.

00:29:30.059 --> 00:29:33.980
When the little child is born, you put him
in another room and the parents are sleeping

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.169
in another room.

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:39.240
It’s the worse thing that you can do to
a little baby.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.559
That’s how the child will become very insecure,
unhappy, abnormal.

00:29:45.559 --> 00:29:57.009
In the subconscious, the child will have a
very funny feelings.

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:01.809
After marriage, after having children the
parents have to accept parenthood.

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:10.360
They are still in the bridal dresses, or the
men are still thinking they are romantic heroes

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360
going around.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360
You are parents now!

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360
Otherwise don’t produce children.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.690
If you produce children, be parents.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:23.820
That doesn’t mean you should become absolutely
boring type people.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:29.360
But, take interest in your children; keep
them with you all the time; talk to them;

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.409
tell them how to behave.

00:30:31.409 --> 00:30:37.100
I mean the behavior here of children is abnormally
funny I find.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:45.029
For that, one has to blame the training.

00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:48.309
And all the freedom is to be given to children.

00:30:48.309 --> 00:30:54.549
Now the carpet is more important than child;
a door is more important, wall is more important

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:55.549
than the child.

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:59.610
Then what happens, when the children grow
up I’ve seen, when they go to somebody’s

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.929
house they start using everything as if their
own.

00:31:02.929 --> 00:31:08.679
In their house they are very comfortably seated.

00:31:08.679 --> 00:31:15.299
And also every way you have restrictions on
children, which sometimes shocks.

00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:20.590
Like I’ll tell you the example of My own
granddaughter, she was telling Me that “Naani,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.090
I’d invited some girls for my birthday party.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.429
And you know they liked it very much.

00:31:27.429 --> 00:31:30.260
And she asked me, ‘Can I have some more?’

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.460
I was surprised.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:36.539
It was all Mummy had made for them, and she
had such a lot inside, and she was enjoying,

00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:37.539
they were eating.

00:31:37.539 --> 00:31:40.289
So they came and asked, ‘Can I have for
some more?’

00:31:40.289 --> 00:31:45.830
They’re not beggars; they are children.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.309
They should rule all their wants.

00:31:48.309 --> 00:31:50.190
They should ask for.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.279
But then you’ll get some toys, put them,
the toy is with the child.

00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:57.059
The child doesn’t know the parents.

00:31:57.059 --> 00:31:59.789
Toys, fill it up with the toys.

00:31:59.789 --> 00:32:03.169
Then by the time you go in the garage, there’s
no place.

00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:11.119
All the toys are kept there, you see.

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:15.690
So the whole training system is wrong.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.429
You must take your child with you.

00:32:17.429 --> 00:32:18.629
You must take him out.

00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:20.190
You must show everything.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.960
Who else is going to teach them?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.620
I see a mother who is, say, a person who has
done, say, M.A.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:35.659
in Botany, and the child doesn’t know what
is a leaf and what is a flower.

00:32:35.659 --> 00:32:39.769
Involve them with yourself.

00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:44.000
You go to work, tell them what happened, “You
know, today this thing happened in the work,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.029
this is what."

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:46.870
They are something separate from you.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.000
How can they grow?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.679
At this time, they depend on you for all their
nourishment.

00:32:53.679 --> 00:32:54.909
Every time.

00:32:54.909 --> 00:33:01.399
And in that you have to teach them how to
share things.

00:33:01.399 --> 00:33:06.299
But I think very little time is spent with
children, which should be much more – much,

00:33:06.299 --> 00:33:07.299
much more.

00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:09.980
Continuously it should be.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.730
I mean even My girls who are – one is forty
years of age, even now she comes and sleeps

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.649
with Me in the morning time.

00:33:17.649 --> 00:33:24.590
She must hug Me, sleep with Me; and when I
come, she cries like a little baby, what to

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.590
do?

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.159
I did the same with My mother.

00:33:28.159 --> 00:33:33.080
But I knew everything about My mother, and
I knew so many things that she liked and what

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.940
she didn’t like and what should not be done.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.240
And there’s such an attachment to the mother
comes in, and father.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.499
You don’t want to lose that love.

00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:50.490
Once My daughter asked Me, when she was in
college, “I want to wear sleeveless blouses."

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.019
I said, “Go ahead.

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:53.019
No harm”

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:54.809
She said, “But why don’t You wear?”

00:33:54.809 --> 00:33:55.809
I said, “I feel shy.

00:33:55.809 --> 00:33:57.360
I feel shy to expose My arms."

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.059
Then she said immediately, “Then this is
no criteria – because I’ve asked You,

00:34:03.059 --> 00:34:04.600
You should say ‘yes’ to me?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.200
No, that’s not good."

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.470
She, herself, corrected herself.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:19.490
So first a complete integration of the children
with yourself.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:25.571
Now, the films – they have films for children,
for adolescents then I don’t know what else

00:34:25.571 --> 00:34:26.659
is there.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:31.790
No, all the films should be for everyone.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.790
But if you have to show filthy stuff, then
you have to have it after twelve o’clock

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.020
in the night.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:42.040
Why to see filthy stuff?

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.890
Whatever you’re children cannot see, why
should you see?

00:34:46.890 --> 00:35:00.829
It’s not something very mature, is it, that
you want to see and the children can’t see.

00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:07.930
So the whole shifting starts, like a mother
is seeing the very mature thing is about God,

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.300
is about some great Incarnation, of some philosophy.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.809
Children are also sitting.

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:19.970
And they start asking, “What is collective
consciousness?” at a very young age.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.450
“What is Chaitanya?

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.450
What is Omkara?”

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.710
The whole attention moves to something else.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:30.080
Otherwise you show them the thing for the
children in that they show you this doll coming

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.670
today, that doll.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.740
“Mommy, I must have that doll!”

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.450
Get them the doll and be finished with them.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.530
That’s wonderful.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:41.900
Bring their attention out of all these things.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.880
See these all medias, everything, are working
on your children morning till evening.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.520
Now they have a doll in America which even
have a birth date.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:58.570
And then you have to join a club, and for
that club you have to pay so much, so much

00:35:58.570 --> 00:35:59.570
dollars.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:06.349
Then you become a member of that, and they
write to you, “What is the name for the

00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:12.020
child and when was she christened, and this
and that."

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:16.940
They are playing upon your children.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.000
And you are happy as long as children don’t
trouble you, and when they trouble you in

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.240
England – I don’t know in America what
do they do – they kill their children.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:29.670
Then the children kill them.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:34.140
Whole thing is upside down.

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:44.450
India it might happen if they become developed
and advanced.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.520
So we are different people; we come out of
it.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.050
Now let’s start another way.

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:52.570
Let’s not identify ourselves with that nonsense.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:56.930
Let’s be something extraordinary.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:01.940
Let’s make our children something different.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:08.990
That’s what is to be given to your children,
not money, wealth, toys.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.110
No!

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.220
Personality.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.339
Roots.

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:14.850
You are their roots.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:20.710
If you are shifty like this, how do you expect
your children to be all right?

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.420
You have to nourish them.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.770
All right?

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:32.380
So first of all, the education of the child
starts with the father, mother and the family

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:34.740
– and the respect for elders.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:40.680
Supposing your father is there, your mother
is in the house, and if you will ill treat

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:46.030
your parents, they will ill treat you, naturally.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:55.049
There is a very interesting story: There was
an old lady and she had a father-in-law who

00:37:55.049 --> 00:38:04.160
was very old, and the son always used to carry
his broth in a bowl made of ordinary clay.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.920
And she used to treat him like a dog, the
daughter-in-law.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:17.820
One day that broke, and this boy fell down
and it broke and he started crying.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.490
So the mother thought he’s very badly hurt
the way he was crying.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.230
He said, “No, I am not hurt, but this thing
is broken."

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.100
“So why are you crying for that?

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.530
We can get another one."

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:28.590
“Sure you can get another one?”

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:29.670
She said, “Yes."

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:38.109
“You know because I was worried how will
I give you food when you will be old.

00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:47.500
That’s what I was worried, that when I have
to send you food, how will I manage?”

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:53.240
Then she understood.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:00.680
How you treat others, how you behave towards
others, how you live neatly, clean ways and

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.290
things – that’s what children learn.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:10.460
Greatest thing, more than precepts, are practices.

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:15.910
Here the husband, wife will quarrel in the
presence of children, beat each other.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.400
Can you imagine?

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.480
I’ve seen that.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.070
I mean if you see any film these days, it’s
the quarrel between husband and wife – put

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.109
this way, that way, that way, this way, this
way, that way.

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:31.530
That’s all, get fed up with it.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:37.740
No respect, no love, no affection.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.500
Or some sort of a destruction.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:46.480
Then the children, themselves, don’t want
to see any picture.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.160
You see, when My daughters were small, I would
only take them to religious picture like Shri

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.420
Rama’s life, this, that, and all that.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.200
So they developed a taste for that.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:01.710
So when they went home to My mother’s place
they said, “We will not go to this picture.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.360
If there is any Ramas, Hanumanas, then we’ll
go."

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:11.400
So My sister said, “You see, first of all
we can’t leave them alone in the house.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.440
You can’t take them to any picture, they
don’t like any other picture but that of

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440
God’s pictures.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.099
So, I mean there are not so many, so what
to do?”

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:23.140
I said, “All right, why don’t you also
see with them the same?”

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:32.579
She said, “But there are some nice social
pictures, but they don’t like it."

00:40:32.579 --> 00:40:38.780
So what sort of books you give them, what
sort of things you talk to them – always

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.089
be with them, keep them with you.

00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:41.369
That’s the best.

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:45.920
Or even if they have to go to some school,
it should be a school where there’s love,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:50.150
affection, good company, they talk of Sahaj
Yoga, sort of a thing.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:55.789
I wish you could start a school of Sahaja
Yoga in America.

00:40:55.789 --> 00:40:58.760
But you know how difficult it is to start
anything sensible?

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.490
Everybody is afraid.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:07.320
But if you want to start a school of nonsensical
things, they’ll give you grants.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:13.849
It’s very difficult, even in England – same
thing, can’t start a school.

00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:22.299
If you want to start some sort of a disco,
it’s very easy.

00:41:22.299 --> 00:41:26.049
Many schools are closing down in England.

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:31.270
Actually, there was a school for sale.

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:34.380
I wanted to buy in My own simple ideas.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.110
They said, “Mother, first think why it is
closed."

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.110
I said, “Why?”

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:42.520
“Because of the different rules and regulations,
it is closed."

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:52.910
I said, “Then, you’re great grandchildren
might be able to go to that school.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:57.530
It will take so much time."

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.780
So first thing I’ll say, you should look
after your children.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:05.690
Tell them when it is wrong, you must tell
them, “This is wrong, it should not be done."

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.910
Like your child doesn’t respect others,
you must tell them.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:18.480
If he doesn’t do, if he spoils something
or does something wrong to others, then you

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.480
must tell him.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:24.089
If he doesn’t share things, you must tell,
“You must share your doll.

00:42:24.089 --> 00:42:26.759
You must share this."

00:42:26.759 --> 00:42:34.100
But when it comes to correcting him for nonsensical
things, you should not.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.600
You’ll see, it will change.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.109
Then later on, of course, we have to think
of school and all that, trying to do something.

00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:47.040
Let’s work it out, maybe, then we’ll take
over.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.500
Basically they should be all right.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.839
Otherwise, they come to India and slap all
the teachers.

00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:53.410
What’s the use?

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.980
It’s not easy.

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.960
Western children are not easy, you know, to
manage.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:09.980
Actually, then definitely they’ll be frightened
of western children coming to India – rather

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:12.160
difficult.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.900
Because you must discipline them.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:20.940
And the main thing is, they should like the
discipline, they should want the discipline.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.180
That’s how you should be.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:27.200
This stupid idea of freedom, means license,
should go out.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.619
They should like it.

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:39.240
I remember My parents, the way they disciplined
us, we would like it.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:46.339
Any child would remember that, “Oh my father,
very particular."

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:51.890
But here they’ll call a twelve-year-old
son – I know a friend of ours, such a shocking

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:52.890
story!

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:56.220
The lady come to -friend means in the official
way.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.950
She came to London and she said, “Have you
seen the pubs?”

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.359
I said, “No."

00:44:02.359 --> 00:44:04.710
“Wonderful, interesting pubs in London."

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.119
I said, “Really?”

00:44:06.119 --> 00:44:08.940
She had a list of them.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.200
She said, “The best is this one."

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.859
I said, “What is so special?”

00:44:12.859 --> 00:44:16.500
“It’s called as the Hermit’s Pub."

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.490
“So what is great?”

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:25.080
“You see, a man died in this place, and
people did not know for months together.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:32.319
Then the smell started coming out, so they
came in, took him away and buried him.

00:44:32.319 --> 00:44:37.359
But all the cobwebs and all the smell is still
retained.

00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:41.320
And that’s the most expensive pub in London."

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.490
I said, “Oh God.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.660
What’s this going on?”

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:52.170
This lady said, “You know, we are very free
with our children.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.760
We allow them to do what they like."

00:44:54.760 --> 00:45:00.770
And she had two sons, I think – one was
twelve-year-old and one was eleven-year-old.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:04.030
And these husband, wife were sleeping upstairs,
in America.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:12.079
These two children were having a party, and
the father had given them alcohol, beer, all

00:45:12.079 --> 00:45:13.880
open drink.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.359
“Oh, enjoy, we are one!”

00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:23.140
And these children of that age group started
drinking, and then I don’t know what happened

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.170
to them, they put fire to some alcohol and
the whole house was burnt.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.060
One child ran out, eleven-year-old.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:37.980
The mother, father, one son all died and so
many children.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:45.740
This is no freedom.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:53.599
You have to teach your children discretion;
you have to teach them.

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:56.050
This is what one has to learn.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:46:00.751
So I think before starting a school for children,
let us start a school for parents.

00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:01.751
What do you say?

00:46:01.751 --> 00:46:02.751
All right.

00:46:02.751 --> 00:46:03.751
What is next?

00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:13.220
Ursula: Shri Mataji, You had suggested that
we can try many tricks, or different tricks

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:26.950
for approaching seekers to find our brothers
and sisters.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.950
And in Australia, when someone has …

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:29.950
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:30.950
I can’t hear you.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:31.950
Just come here.

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.950
Yes, Ursula.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:33.950
What is it?

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:42.890
Ursula: You had suggested that we could try
many tricks to find our brothers and sisters,

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.710
and different ways and approaches.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:55.020
And in Australia, each idea seems to be … they’re
so enthusiastic and they, they support the

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.240
idea.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:11.013
And this is, I don’t know if it’s just
my feeling, but there’s a feeling here that

00:47:11.013 --> 00:47:14.180
when there’s a suggestion or an idea we’re
very “Oh, no."

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.430
One person may say, “Yes, good idea."

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.760
Another person may say “No, no."

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.500
And then you don’t want to do anything wrong,
so you just don’t do anything, you just

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.500
wait.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.500
And then nothing happens.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500
Shri Mataji: Among Sahaj Yogis, you mean to
say?

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500
Ursula: Among Sahaj Yogis.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.900
Shri Mataji: See, it comes from the individualistic
attitude about ourselves.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:33.700
I mean anything you tell them, they cannot
live collectively, that we know in the West.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.630
I know what I have to go through when we have
to organize their programs with three hundred

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.280
people coming, this and that.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:55.200
But … this individualism is so much, like
every bathroom has a different tap.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.750
You’d better ask somebody, otherwise you’ll
land up into difficulties.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:07.760
Even the ties have to be different; everything
has to be different.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.099
Now, if there’s something fundamental, then
you can ask your leader.

00:48:14.099 --> 00:48:15.920
But if it is something mundane, all right.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.920
You want blue color?

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.920
I have blue.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.089
You want red?

00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:20.160
Have red.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.910
Like that you can solve your problem.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:27.412
If it is something fundamental, then you should
ask your leader.

00:48:27.412 --> 00:48:39.619
But if it is something which is not fundamental,
which is very simple, let them have their

00:48:39.619 --> 00:48:41.690
own way, then gradually they’ll grow into
it.

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:45.010
Because this is the basic problem of this
country is.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.890
So-called individualism makes them feel that,
“Oh, this mine.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:51.130
I’ll do it the way I like."

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:54.430
Now say a motor car has a different handle.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:59.480
Now a person who’s sitting inside must know
what sort of a handle it is.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.680
Tomorrow something happens, you can’t even
open it.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.020
Otherwise, they’re not at all individualistic,
I’ll tell you how.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:10.490
Like in India, supposing I’m wearing this
sari.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.640
Maybe there’s another sari like that.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.100
If another lady’s wearing the same sari,
she’ll go and change and come back.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.090
She won’t wear the same sari.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:26.400
But, here when fashion, if somebody’s … now
that our Princess of Wales has this kind of

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:30.619
a hairstyle, all English girl’s have the
same hairstyle.

00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:33.859
You don’t know from one to another.

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:36.390
So what is so individual about them?

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:40.390
If some fashion starts, now this is the fashion,
very fashionable.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:41.529
What is fashionable?

00:49:41.529 --> 00:49:45.819
Is to cut your hair this way and make a punk.

00:49:45.819 --> 00:49:47.300
So everybody is a punk.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:52.760
Suddenly you find Sahaja Yogis walking as
punks, you want to know who is who.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.059
So what is the individual character there?

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.930
Where is the individuality?

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:05.609
On principles you should be individuals – on
principles, and not on artificial things.

00:50:05.609 --> 00:50:07.980
Now this one has a principle.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.059
Supposing I’m wearing this sari.

00:50:10.059 --> 00:50:16.530
It’s made by hand, it’s one designed by
one person.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.289
So I’m giving importance to one person.

00:50:18.289 --> 00:50:22.190
Now he might have made two or three or four
at the most.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:32.309
Now if somebody repeats the same sari, that
means I have not encouraged that man so much.

00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:37.520
Like you can have the same sari made out of
a, say, machine.

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:43.950
Then you’ll start, “All right have ten
saris like this, twenty saris like this, all

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:45.480
made by machines."

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:51.510
But here, because we want to have a sari separate,
it has to be made with hand.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:54.150
In principle, see?

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:58.030
How it helps!

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:04.520
This is what it is.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.710
In principle you should be collective; in
principle you should be individualistic.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:13.619
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t want you dressed
up the same way.

00:51:13.619 --> 00:51:17.890
I mean I don’t want Americans to go about
like something Chinese.

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:24.270
Let us have our own dress, dress up the way
we like, everything.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.309
That’s all right.

00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:28.359
It’s nothing important.

00:51:28.359 --> 00:51:31.510
But in principle, we have to be the same.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:38.980
One principle nourishes the tree – the sap.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:40.480
It has many flowers, fruits.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.020
It has many leaves, it’s all right – outside.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.960
So in principle you have to be collective.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.960
All right?

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.960
For mundane things, why to fight?

00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:06.140
But in any case, somebody who is an elder,
who knows better, who’s wiser – listen

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:09.130
to that person.

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:14.670
We always have an awe, and a respect for elders.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:19.559
Like I see, thank God, you have now Sherayu,
supposing – take one case, individual case.

00:52:19.559 --> 00:52:23.400
She’s come all the way from India, now she’s
staying.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.390
She knows quite a lot about pujas, things
like that.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.309
She knows how to do many things.

00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:33.540
You should be prepared to know from her.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.470
Otherwise sometimes it’s very embarrassing
the way things happen.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.839
Now she’s here, she can teach you.

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:39.359
There’s nothing wrong in learning.

00:52:39.359 --> 00:52:41.150
She has learned many things from you.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.359
But there’s no respect, I think sometimes,
for her, at all.

00:52:44.359 --> 00:52:46.720
She’s an auntie somewhere sitting on the
shelf.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.630
No, she’s here for a purpose, one should
learn, respect.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:56.440
But that doesn’t mean you be her slave or
anything, but you gain something out of her.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.260
Another person who comes here should learn.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.720
Like from Americans, we have to learn a lot.

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.660
Tell Me what.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:10.500
Yogini: I don’t think we’re doing much
about communication.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:14.099
Shri Mataji: The communication is not there
because of individualism.

00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:16.369
But, that’s not so.

00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:22.880
There’s no individualism at all, because
I’ve seen, once the fashion starts, everybody

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880
looks the same.

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:29.520
The other day I came, I saw ladies looking
like men with muscles like this, walking like

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.520
that.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.809
I said, “What sort of creature is this?”

00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:35.809
One came, two came, three came, five came,
ten came.

00:53:35.809 --> 00:53:37.410
“What’s this going on?”

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:38.619
I didn’t understand.

00:53:38.619 --> 00:53:41.180
They are all walking like that, like Draculas.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.190
I said, “What is this?”

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.701
“Oh, this is fashionable."

00:53:45.701 --> 00:53:46.701
What is fashionable?

00:53:46.701 --> 00:53:48.869
“They’re developing their muscles."

00:53:48.869 --> 00:53:52.410
What’s the principle?

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:57.119
(continued on second cassette)

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:59.480
That’s it.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.400
So, in such things we do not argue.

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.000
Means in stupidity we don’t argue, but in
sensible things we argue.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.089
In sensible things – we have to understand
what is sensible.

00:54:12.089 --> 00:54:17.060
After all, we are realized souls; we are not
like other people.

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.079
We must understand what is good.

00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:21.200
When I say something, you agree.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.830
I don’t know how.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:26.830
You like it.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.230
I may say something also which may not be
so palatable, but you like it.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:34.180
See, think must have it, it’s a medicine.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:41.240
In the same way, one should see to things
which you may not like so much, because maybe

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:51.069
you’re conditioned, but see to the sense
of it, the common sense, the balance.

00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:57.029
You can understand, and you have something
very great called vibrations.

00:54:57.029 --> 00:55:01.039
But even that also, I have seen, horrible
things they do.

00:55:01.039 --> 00:55:08.269
Some people went – husband, wife – went
to stay with some lady because her husband

00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:09.750
had gone to India.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:14.130
Threw all her furniture out, all her carpets
out, everything out.

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.519
I said, “Why did you do it?”

00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:17.519
“Very bad vibrations."

00:55:17.519 --> 00:55:18.519
I said, “Really?

00:55:18.519 --> 00:55:22.440
Now will you please pay for all that – for
the bad vibrations."

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.070
I mean anybody else’s things, who are you
to decide good or bad vibrations?

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.430
You look after your own vibrations.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:35.960
So they also sometimes use the vibrations
just to, sort of, express their ego.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:45.720
So let us try on ourselves, everyone, “Am
I doing it just for ego’s sake?

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:48.470
Am I quarreling because of ego?

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.299
Am I saying ‘no’ for ego?”

00:55:51.299 --> 00:55:54.590
As far as possible, try to concede.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.950
You’ll feel much better.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:02.990
You’ll learn much more.

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:08.380
I mean, I’ve learned so many things since
I’ve been abroad, I mean, I didn’t know

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.380
so many things.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.420
I don’t know even now.

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:17.339
For example, I didn’t know how to operate
a TV.

00:56:17.339 --> 00:56:21.440
Even now, I don’t know much about it.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.440
Really.

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:28.029
I didn’t know how to operate a telephone
of a particular type.

00:56:28.029 --> 00:56:32.449
So, I had to learn.

00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:40.030
I had to learn how to book a ticket, which
I don’t do even now, but still I have to

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:41.030
learn.

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.930
So many things I have to learn, and whatever
I can learn I would like to learn.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:53.980
Cooking I know, but I never knew how to wash
utensils because in India they, I mean normally

00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.980
you have servants.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:59.500
But I learned it – your style with fairy
liquid.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.510
I had to learn.

00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.039
There’s nothing wrong in it.

00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:08.100
So one must try to learn, than to argue.

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:14.619
Ursula: In Australia, the enthusiasm and the
joy that they have!

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:23.640
And if someone has an idea for something,
there’s just so much support for that, that

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.900
they all go out to help each other.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.340
It becomes a very big, collective effort.

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.480
Shri Mataji: But Australia, Australians are
very wise people.

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.520
They understand wisdom.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:37.279
That’s what we have to be – wise, very
wise.

00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:43.269
And if any Indian is there, they try to ask,
“how do you do?”

00:57:43.269 --> 00:57:48.819
Particular things, on principle as a puja
things, they’ll ask an Indian.

00:57:48.819 --> 00:57:51.200
But booking the seats, never ask Indians.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.690
They’re no good.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:58.569
Cooking, kitchen, cleaning – very good.

00:57:58.569 --> 00:58:00.059
Maintaining house – all right.

00:58:00.059 --> 00:58:02.640
Looking after children – all right.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.920
But driving a car, an Indian?

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:06.000
Save Me.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.779
I would never sit in a car which is driven
by an Indian in America.

00:58:12.779 --> 00:58:14.630
Because crazy the way people drive.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:19.710
You know this fellow won’t know how to do
it.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:26.900
So it is just wisdom and discretion one has
to use, and not to fight.

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:31.200
It happens, I’m happy, I’ve seen this
in Australians.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:38.029
They were declared as people of – people
who were criminals, the children of criminals.

00:58:38.029 --> 00:58:40.320
They are so sensible.

00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:46.780
Discretion must be used, that’s important.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.940
It’s sad.

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:59.710
But it will be all right, I’m sure one day.

00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.390
Never argue on things which doesn’t involve
any principle.

00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:07.050
It’s the best way; it’s the happiest.

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:13.700
Even now, you see today it was so warm.

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:17.140
I wanted to wear a cotton sari, you see.

00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:18.180
But My children said, “No, must wear this
one."

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.180
I said, “Wore it."

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.180
I was perspiring, this, that.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.160
All right, doesn’t matter, what’s the
difference, perspire for a while.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.609
Came out with this sari.

00:59:24.609 --> 00:59:28.359
They liked it, so it’s all right to please
them.

00:59:28.359 --> 00:59:32.170
Nothing, no principle is involved in it.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:37.940
When you think about others, then you will
get rid of this problem.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:44.440
But so many people try to preach also Sahaja
Yoga to others.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.460
They should not.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.530
It’s a very serious thing, they will start
teaching.

00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:53.839
It need not be taught that way – then people
don’t like it.

00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:59.910
But your own behavior, in your own character,
in your own responses, people should see “this

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:01.769
person is like this."

01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:04.089
And they should imbibe it.

01:00:04.089 --> 01:00:14.460
That’s the point, I think what we lack is
discretion.

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.500
If you are discrete, you will learn very fast,
it’s not difficult.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.539
Ursula: We still can be very judgmental of
newcomers.

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:28.740
If they have particular problems, we get all
… it’s hard.

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:33.200
Shri Mataji: The newcomers.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.320
Agreed.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.010
With the newcomers, you should not be harsh
with them.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:43.680
You should be kind, you should try to understand
this thing.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:50.390
But, you know still, I tell you sometimes
… The other day I had some boy who had come,

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:51.390
all right?

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.529
He asked Me at least twenty questions.

01:00:53.529 --> 01:00:57.539
I answered them properly – this thing, that
thing.

01:00:57.539 --> 01:01:09.990
And he got so pampered, he sent Me news, “I
don’t want to become Sahaja Yogi."

01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:17.960
I mean, but for Me, anybody would box his
nose, for such an answer.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.640
You see, you have to take it in a stride.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.420
Situation is so bad; situation is very bad.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.530
Must understand we are on a warpath, whatever
is possible, we can do it.

01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:35.170
But every country has improved so much.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:42.329
So what’s wrong here is: people don’t
want to learn; people don’t want to understand

01:01:42.329 --> 01:01:48.650
the sacrifice of giving up your ego, giving
up your decisions.

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:51.260
“All right, let’s see, let’s see."

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.260
Like that.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.309
That’s why it doesn’t grow.

01:01:54.309 --> 01:02:00.450
Now one thing I must say, in America if you
have My program, hall will be full, I won’t

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:04.380
be able to enter in, and when I get out, I’ll
be pushed out like a piston.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.609
I’ve seen it.

01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:10.349
It’s the people are so much I don’t know
how to get in and how get out.

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:11.470
It’s terrible!

01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:15.950
And when I go away, they just disappear.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:25.860
Because, there’s something lacking – of
course, I agree – among Sahaj Yogis, that

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:26.860
we have to see.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:31.650
After all, nothing special about Me as such,
I mean, they just see My photograph and come

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.190
to the programs and sit down there.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:37.599
Even if I have three days program, it goes
on increasing.

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:43.869
While there are Sahaj Yogis who may not even
be able to have one person in the hall.

01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:45.759
What’s the reason?

01:02:45.759 --> 01:02:47.640
They don’t know Me.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:48.640
All right?

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.450
So there’s something lacking in us, also,
when the newcomers come in, how we treat them,

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:55.680
we talk to them, how we appeal to them.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.210
Once in awhile of course there will be somebody
who will rude.

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.210
Doesn’t matter.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.490
But try to be nice to them.

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:08.430
On the whole I think the newcomers – I won’t
tell all these things to a newcomer if he

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:09.430
comes.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:13.250
If a newcomer come I say, “Oh, very nice.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.150
How are you?

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:16.420
This, that."

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.690
You see?

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:19.599
Settle him down.

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:26.089
Any other fundamental differences you find,
you can ask Me – fundamental.

01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:45.160
Yogi: I’m just little curious about, well,
future little bit.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:04:18.640
Are You going to manifest Yourself in some
different way as Shri Kalki?

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:40.619
Or are You going to sort of let the change
happen a little more gradually?

01:04:40.619 --> 01:04:42.960
Shri Mataji: Direct questions.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.750
You tell Me, what should I do?

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.820
Tell Me, what should I do?

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:50.150
Any other form won’t be suitable.

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.180
Try any other form.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:58.940
Take Shri Krishna’s form, You have to take
the Sudarshana and just kill off all those

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.259
who don’t believe in Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:02.259 --> 01:05:04.779
Is it all right?

01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:07.930
Take form of Jesus Christ.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:14.190
Hang Yourself nicely, finish with everyone.

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:17.569
Then think of Kalki.

01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:21.970
Finish everything.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:27.180
After doing all this work, beautifully creating
all this world so beautifully, don’t you

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:32.690
think One should manage it, try to manage
it, as far as possible?

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:34.300
That’s My style.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:38.470
Which one would you prefer?

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:40.579
(Laughter from the yogis)

01:05:40.579 --> 01:05:43.279
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

01:05:43.279 --> 01:05:47.329
Voice from the crowd: He likes Your style,
Mother.

01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:48.670
Shri Mataji: Aha!

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:49.670
That’s it.

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:52.250
You see that’s what – nothing else.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:57.809
Of course you should know that Kalki’s acting,
everybody’s acting, everybody’s acting

01:05:57.809 --> 01:06:03.349
but is on a low key, as they say.

01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:10.209
One has to be very careful; it’s a very
delicate job.

01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:12.940
So many are lost.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.960
These gurus have taken over so many.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:21.100
It’s a very, very delicate job.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.820
All right?

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:33.760
But if necessary, I can do something.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.069
Now, any other question?

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:49.029
What time is your dinner?

01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:50.940
Any other question?

01:06:50.940 --> 01:07:11.220
Yogi: Mother, it seems that many of us here
don’t really know about the Hamsa Chakra,

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:19.250
in terms of understanding how it relates to
the Vishuddhi and what we can do to strengthen

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:20.410
our Vishuddhi.

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:28.680
Shri Mataji: Hamsa Chakra stands between Vishuddhi
and Agnya as you can see clearly positioned

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680
like that.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:36.740
But from Vishuddhi there are many nerves which
pass through Hamsas and end up here.

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.300
They don’t all go to the brain.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:48.839
Or we can say that at this time, at this point,
all our reactions which are what you call

01:07:48.839 --> 01:07:53.680
reflex reactions finish off.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:08:03.250
So supposing now I get some dirty smell, I’ll
close My nose like that, or if I can’t hear,

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:09.349
I’ll just pull My ears like this; or if
I see something dirty, or if I see something

01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:12.380
jarring, My eyes will close automatically.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:17.089
If somebody tries to put a pin through Me,
immediately I’ll … spontaneously, it’s

01:08:17.089 --> 01:08:26.890
all built in, within My system, and your system,
too, that you react with reflex action.

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.810
Same thing may not happen to animals.

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:30.420
Animals are different.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:36.160
Some animals have certain reflex actions,
some have some reflex actions; but we are

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.790
different and our reflex actions we are all
practically just the same.

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:43.750
There’s not much individuality.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:48.340
There isn’t much difference in our reflex
actions.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.660
At the most, with conditioning somebody might
say “Yah!”, somebody might say “Oh!”,

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.430
somebody might say something – that’s
different.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:59.590
But the reflex actions are just the same.

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:07.040
So up to the reflex action, we don’t have
to use discretion.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.010
Then starts our discretion part.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:14.820
Discretion starts when we are using these
two nadis which meet here, without going to

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.820
the Agnya.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:27.540
So when these two nadis meet here, what happens
we start seeing through our experiences.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:33.140
First would be a reflex action, automatic
reflex action.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:39.000
The second is when, supposing a child, if
you tell the child, “Now this is hot; don’t

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.710
put your hand there”, he won’t listen.

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:42.870
Put the child.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:47.430
With experience, he will develop reflex actions,
the conditionings of it.

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:50.760
So thus reflexes are built in within us.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:58.130
Also, they are built in within us with, we
should say, with other conditionings like,

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:07.200
you see, in a country supposing there’s
racialism, or in a country like ours there’s

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.530
a caste system.

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:14.060
Then person react according to what they have
learned from childhood.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:20.630
All these conditionings could be of the present
day, when you are born.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:24.790
You could have been, yourself, born in last
life in, say, Africa.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:31.560
Today you are born with a white skin, so you
have started sort of calling that African

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.790
you have become.

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:39.950
All these conditionings can be built in, into
your Hamsa Chakra, which have come from your

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:48.200
training of the mind, you can say the experiences
of the mind, the experiences of the society,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:54.520
of your knowledge, of your education, the
way you’re conditioned can be built in here

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.960
– in the Hamsa Chakra.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:02.830
And it reacts to things which has no meaning.

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:06.200
If you were … “I hate someone!”

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.200
Why?

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:14.870
Because that person wears a blue jean, or
something; or you can say a green shirt.

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.110
Now this is built in your mind.

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:22.870
Or sometimes this falling in love, also, comes
from the same kind of a conditioning.

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:29.690
Supposing you had met somebody who had, say,
blue eyes and was kind to you.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:34.130
So you have fascination for a person who has
blue eyes.

01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:40.970
There’s no pure idea about beauty; there’s
no pure idea of happiness; there’s no pure

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:42.970
idea of esthetics.

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:46.200
All is condition.

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.140
For some people, this is beautiful; for somebody,
this is not beautiful.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:59.830
So this is the place where these interchanges
take place between both the nadis, and here

01:11:59.830 --> 01:12:05.690
the Hamsa lies outside the path of Kundalini.

01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:12.310
They sort of come out here, out of the path
of Kundalini.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:13.960
It’s very surprising.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:20.250
When the Kundalini moves, She goes from Vishuddhi
direct to Agnya.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:25.730
Now, how can we improve our Hamsa then?

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:32.940
It’s a big problem, because if our Hamsa
is sick, is over-conditioned.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:37.390
The Kundalini cannot work on it; it just gives
up.

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:43.570
Now, so for Hamsa we use all these physical
things.

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:48.800
Like I said, put the ghee in the nose.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:54.920
Keep it in a way that it is nourished properly.

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.430
Because Kundalini, if it tries to too much
attack the Hamsa, it will have problem.

01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:07.930
Problem because, as it is most of our time
we spend in such a manner that your Hamsa

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:14.960
things become – what you call the epithelial
cells, the linings – become dried out.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:29.040
When the Kundalini rises, She may try to create
a problem more for that dryness – maybe.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:36.990
So it is kept out, but it has an effect in
the sense that even if there is a light outside,

01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:40.600
it can fall inside.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.950
So it’s not the Kundalini directly that
affects your Hamsa.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:57.230
It is like when the Kundalini awakens, you
yourself see now that a person is, whether

01:13:57.230 --> 01:14:02.710
he is fair complexion or dark complexion,
he is a human being.

01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:08.910
You reason it out and Hamsa clears up.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:15.200
Then you see yourself that, “Oh, I’m very
egoistical."

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:22.260
You start seeing yourself through your Agnya,
start seeing that, “I’m so conditioned."

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:31.340
So you reason it out, and that’s how you
correct your conditionings.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:33.270
This is what is Hamsa Chakra.

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:41.340
So Hamsa Chakra cannot be done if just you’re
a realized soul, but is an effect, is the

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.180
symptom of your Kundalini awakening.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:54.560
Some people think that you develop discretion
just as the Kundalini rises.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.180
Is a wrong idea.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:58.180
No.

01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:03.740
That has to be deliberately seen that you
build up that discretion within yourself.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:11.240
But once it is built – for example My discretion
is absolute, I just know what it is.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:18.640
You see My conditioning here is absolute,
is one with the Kundalini, one with reality.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.390
But for human beings, it has to be reflected
by understanding.

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:28.010
Like a child who touches something hot, then
it is hot.

01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:31.080
Now this is hot, because it’s heated up.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:35.170
So you see a person is catching on the right
heart.

01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:36.170
Right.

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:40.510
He’s catching on the right heart means he’s
got a right heart, and he is suffering from

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.830
such and such thing.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:43.940
You have to see it yourself.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.930
Now if you tell the person, “Are you suffering
from, say, asthma?”

01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:50.750
He says, “Yes, how do you know?”

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:55.910
“I know it because I’ve learned it through
my finger which was burning, that’s why

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:57.350
I know it is."

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:04.000
But supposing somebody has an asthma and in
that plays the part your Kundalini, you will

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.990
get asthma immediately.

01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:08.560
You see the point?

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:14.630
The conditioning cannot come to us unless
and until it passes through, or sieves through,

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:16.710
our reasoning and understanding.

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:19.180
Are you understand the point?

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.240
It cannot work.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.470
The reason is, it filters your collective
consciousness.

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:35.850
Otherwise, you go near a person who has AIDS,
and you become collectively conscious that

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.270
he has AIDS.

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:47.310
And if you imbibe all that into you as a conditioning,
you will get it.

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:49.000
But you are separated.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:56.030
Like person who reads a – there’s a very
nice story about this, Jerome has written.

01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:59.950
Like one man, he went and read Materia Medica.

01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:06.020
Went and told doctor that, “Doctor I have
all the diseases except for one, which is

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.020
housewife’s knee.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.950
He said, “How is it you haven’t got it?”

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.250
“Because I am not a housewife."

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:16.300
So he got conditioned into all the diseases.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:22.740
That’s how many people get diseases, but
thank God there’s a filter.

01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:28.610
If somebody has a disease, you don’t get
it, because you can filter it.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:32.750
But Hamsa Chakra could be affected by baddhas.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:40.420
That’s one problem, if some baddha passes
through the nose, you might; some viruses

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:44.400
pass through the nose, you might.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.100
Affected, means it can get sick.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.980
But one must understand the discrimination
between the two.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.130
Say there’s a virus infection outside.

01:17:55.130 --> 01:18:08.240
It can pass into your Hamsa Chakra and can
give you a problem of sinus, this, that – physical.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.750
But you won’t become like a person who has
given you virus infection.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.460
So there is a filter.

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:23.770
But supposing there’s a person who is very
hectic.

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:27.914
And you come in contact with that person – he’s
very hectic, so your Swadisthana can take

01:18:27.914 --> 01:18:28.914
over.

01:18:28.914 --> 01:18:31.790
You can become hectic with that person.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:36.450
Being with that person, you can become hectic.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:44.290
But as far as the Hamsa is concerned, with
anybody you live, your Hamsa doesn’t carry

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:47.490
the complete impact of that because there’s
filter.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:55.120
So now, if you have to develop the discretion,
you have to learn, you have to understand.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.420
It doesn’t come automatically.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:07.660
But with children who are born realized, their
Hamsa is so developed that they know it – what

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.040
is right, what is wrong.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:17.990
Because their Hamsa is so much trained that
way, they don’t have to use much understanding.

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:25.750
But those who are now growing up, have become
now Sahaja Yogis have to know through their

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:27.022
own experiences their Hamsa.

01:19:27.022 --> 01:19:29.360
It’s a filter, also.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:41.100
But for a child, he knows what is right, what
is wrong, because his Hamsa is developed.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.000
In India, when the child is born he’s massaged
nicely.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.900
Oiling is the best way to have a good Hamsa.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:59.700
Oil his hair, oil his body, put some drops
in the nose, everything.

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:13.120
They try in the ear, in the nose and that’s
how they build up.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.310
So what I have to say that physically you
should help your Hamsa Chakra by using ghee

01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:27.310
and all that, and mentally you should use
it by learning things, in experience – what

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:44.730
to do, how to do it, how to work it out, how
to establish.

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:49.890
That is how Hamsa Chakra grows and makes you
discrete.

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:54.660
That’s why tradition is very important.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:01.450
Tradition gives you the growth of the Hamsa
Chakra and then you go on discarding whatever

01:21:01.450 --> 01:21:04.020
is wrong out of that tradition.

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.140
Then again, you keep whatever is good.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.040
Give it to your children, to your children,
to your children.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:19.530
So the discretion comes to a person who is
traditionally built up better than a person

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:22.530
who has no traditions.

01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:34.100
Now, for example, this morning I was discussing
that people take, fill the wash basin and

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:37.670
wash their face, in the West.

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:40.860
In India, we cannot conceive of it, cannot
even think of it.

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.080
I mean, people don’t know it can be done.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.730
Because in traditional way it has come out
that if you’re washing your face and again

01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:55.870
the water goes into there, then all the dirt
is in it, again you’re using the same water.

01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:57.210
So you cannot have completed.

01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.940
So always use running water.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:02.120
Traditionally we’ve learned it.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:09.930
So it’s so much in our heads, in our discretion,
that we cannot even think of such a thing.

01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:13.430
Simple thing that Mooladhara must be cleaned
and washed.

01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:19.750
Any Indian, you take it, he knows that is,
because they must have had some problems before.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:26.270
Whether he is in the North, he’s in the
South, East or West – ask him.

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:30.990
Auspiciousness is another thing.

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:34.670
It’s so much imbibed in the tradition.

01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:43.100
But if you have a tradition, say, of doing
things which are absurd – also you can have

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.210
traditions like that.

01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:48.900
Like very primitive people have all kinds
of traditions which are very absurd.

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:55.780
I was told that if you go to Ladakh what they
do, somebody dies, they keep the hand of the

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:59.940
dead person in the house all the time like
that.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.120
They think that that helps.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:08.250
But with tradition which is wrong by discarding
that, they will understand that is wrong.

01:23:08.250 --> 01:23:14.620
So the more traditional you are, the ancient
you are, you learn many things.

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:21.660
Like we have seen English are, in a way, very
traditional, so they – supposing theirs

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:28.690
a lady coming down and you are coming with
the lady, then the man will be in front – automatically.

01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:31.980
He’ll just move.

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.630
But if she’s going up, then man will follow
her.

01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:41.370
Just happens, automatically, because traditionally
they have learned that if you’re going down,

01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:44.950
the lady may fall or something, so we should
be in front.

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:52.730
So what you call as the traditional habits
of person gives you this Hamsa.

01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:57.480
And these habits are built better and better
with trial and error methods.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.390
And that’s how you develop it.

01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:03.580
Now for people who are Sahaj Yogis, it’s
much easy to imbibe them, because if you see

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.610
something, “Yes, that’s wrong – should
not do it – finished."

01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:09.110
But you should be so clear cut about it as
you determine.

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.110
It works out.

01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:13.350
You’re Hamsa will be all right.

01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:16.320
But you tell them ten times, still they do
the same thing.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:26.350
Then that means their Hamsa is not willing
to accept.

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:31.500
But you must nourish it, you must look after
it, you must – as I said also this kajal

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:33.680
is also very good for Hamsa Chakra.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:40.610
All kajal and the oil in the nose, ears – it’s
very good.

01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:44.990
All acts for that.

01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:59.870
Even, say, talking to another person, to talk
discretely is to say something which doesn’t

01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:03.720
lose its power of affecting that person.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:09.241
Like if you say something very harsh, then
you should know how to neutralize it so that

01:25:09.241 --> 01:25:12.220
he retains that into himself.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:20.310
All these discretions only come also by tradition.

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:31.120
When you find something that is futile, in
a collective way in a tradition drops out.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:42.290
So the blessings of the tradition is great,
but greater are the blessings of your Spirit.

01:25:42.290 --> 01:25:47.350
And the blessings of the Spirit are such that
through your vibrations, immediately you know

01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:48.580
this is wrong.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.860
But you have to be honest about it and you
just give up.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:26:11.640
You want to ascend, you want to improve your
vibrations, so for that whatever is needed

01:26:11.640 --> 01:27:18.540
you
will do.
