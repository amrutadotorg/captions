1984-0320 Talk At Birthday Felicitation Delhi India NITL HD

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:18.892
On this occasion I bow to all my children, to all the well-wishers, friends who have come here

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.892
to express their kind feelings towards me. Thank you very much.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:48.892
In such circumstances the words cannot express, the deep feeling of gratitude for all of you

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.892
who have so kindly come down here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.892
It is very important for us to realize one thing that the time has come for all of us

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.892
to transform ourselves, all the possibilities of transformation is possible.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.892
We all have to transform ourselves.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.892
We must raise our level from this human level to the higher level of spirit.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.892
Otherwise those who will not will not enter into the kingdom of god and may be destroyed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.892
The time is very precarious and precious and the most opportune time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.892
Today is the day they have put a Sahasrara here, many one thousand petalled lotus

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.892
surrounding the limbic area in our head.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.892
The coconut is called  as Shriphala which represents something like our brain

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.892
and the inside of the coconut is the limbic area. In the same way we have got in our brain

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.892
this limbic area on which many scientists have done a lot of research

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.892
but they cannot go very far with it because they are doing everything from outside,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.892
it is only through Sahaja yoga you can understand what lies in that brain.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:59.892
All the seven centres about which I have told you in the previous lectures lies above this area.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.892
To begin with is the mooladhara lies in the centre of your ,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.892
you can say at this point you  see bone jetting out.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.892
I don�t want to use medical terminology because some people told me they can�t understand,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.892
now around that around that moves this Swadishthana chakra,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.892
you must have seen people who suffer from diabetes always lose their eye sight,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.892
eye sight is first affected when they have diabetics trouble. What is the reason?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.892
The reason is the Swadishthana is in the stomach the centre and the pitha

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.892
or you can say the seat of that Swadishthana chakra is here at the back of your head

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.892
where the lobe which supply the energy to the eye is seated.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:15.892
Around that, around that moves the Swadishthana in the centre is the mooladhara around

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.892
that moves the Swadishthana which is responsible for this over activity

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.892
when we think too much it is over active and the conversion

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.892
of the fat cells from the stomach to the brain is done in such a fast speed,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.892
when we think too much we are futuristic that all other organs are neglected.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.892
So such a Swadishthana which gets hectic, which doesn�t understand what to do , now gets out of gear,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.892
because of that one of the organs being the pancreas gets no energy from the swadistan,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.892
it gets out of order and you develop diabetics. Anything goes wrong with the swadistana ,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.892
spoils the seat of the swadistana around the mooladhara which is in the center.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.892
So by that you get your eyes blinded because it is pushing down the mooladhara

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.892
which is in the center of it. So no use treating the eyes,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.892
best thing is to treat your mooladhara or treat your swadistana

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.892
because swadistana is absolutely augmenting the movement of the mooladhara

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.892
which has to support the optic lobe.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.892
So it is so important to keep our mental being very sensible and balanced. It�s very important,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.892
this is only about one chakra , I have told you but all the seven chakras lie above the limbic area.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.892
All the seven chakras, so every chakra has got its seat over this limbic area

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.892
hence it�s very important how mentally we are equipped.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.892
I don�t know what happens in the north India

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.892
but in the south or specially in the Maharastra area there is a common practice of parents

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.892
all the time asking the children where is your attention ( in Marathi ) where is your attention,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.892
where is our attention, is very important , attention is the most important, where is our attention

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.892
because attention is the one which expresses our conscious mind.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.892
If our attention is all the time running from one place to another and from that place to another

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.892
we develop a temperament which is very hectic, which is irritable.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.892
Which is uncertain cannot sit for five minutes quietly.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.892
I must tell you that in England there is a very big hall called Albert hall

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:24.892
where you can have even 6000 people for any orchestra or for any music program anytime like this

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.892
and you are not even allowed to cough during that 3 hour program if they have ,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.892
you are not even allowed to cough. Let alone going out, moving out,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.892
or getting all these kind  of hectic behaviour. You can not get out of that place.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.892
Whether it is boring, it�s horrible, it�s no good, it don�t like it, it doesn�t matter.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.892
But if you are into the hall then be seated for 3 hours continuously,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.892
you are not allowed to move out not even to cough and I have seen people being lords

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.892
and ladies and prime ministers and all those attending that hall all sitting tight,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.892
respecting musicians, respecting the music, respecting all that  they have created

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.892
because they are so involved with them. But in India despite the fact

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.892
our country has tremendous vibrations , tremendous depth, tremendous dignity.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.892
See imagine the kind of music we have produced.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.892
Even if these people labour for  thousands of years they cannot produce this.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.892
Believe me they cannot produce. You should see any one of their great master playing

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.892
except for three ,four people whom I should say were realized souls,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.892
they could be playing something of a rare quality.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.892
But otherwise they cannot play like this spontaneous music , not one person can do that

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.892
even if he labours for thousands of years. This is the beauty of our music in this country.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.892
The beauty of our arts, the beauty of our things they cannot produce, they just cannot do it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:20.892
They haven�t got that depth, why? Because this mother earth has given us that balance,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.892
that peace, that depth within us that we the Indians can do that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.892
Ask them to make one ornament, I lost once one ornament and asked them if they could make it,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.892
they said they cannot, they just can�t do it.   You make them anything higher, greater and all that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.892
but in fine arts they cannot come near us in any arts. What�s so ever.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.892
Now what is the reason, how is it that the Indians have done it

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.892
and still maintained despite the fact that most of the Indian�s have lost the capacity to respect,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.892
to realise where are we standing on this mother earth .the mother earth

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.892
who has got its kundalini here and Sahasrara also here.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.892
The kundalini is in the Maharashtra and Sahasrara is in Himalayas.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.892
Anybody who comes in between this has to be realized, has to be a great person.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.892
When I say this many people think that are very wrong ideas about Indians, may be but not about India.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.892
India you can be sure, one day when the kundalini will rise in this country will shoot off everyone

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.892
and we will show the what greatness we have. This is why it�s very important

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.892
that we should workout .sahaja yoga in a very deeper way .

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.892
first of all we must know Indians have to, Indians have to be deep, very deep.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.892
We cannot afford to be frivolous, cheap or something slavish. we cannot afford to be slavish.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.892
I have seen people now a days are so much enamoured by foreign things, foreign goods.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.892
What do they have nothing but plastic affluence , absolutely they have nothing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.892
The Sahaj  yogis who got realization they get shock when they go to music centre

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.892
and see people there are buying cheap ordinary music which they would not even care.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.892
so why this disparity is within us may be the slavishness of  so many years .

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.892
but when we were slaves we were much better off but today when we are free

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.892
I don�t know what has happened to us that we have lost that system of dignity,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.892
we have lost our dignity. That�s why I wanted him to play raga darbari.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.892
Darbari raga settles your kundalini in complete dignity.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.892
She rises with complete dignity and glory and goes to the sahasrara and pierces your brahmarandra .

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.892
She is your mother and source of all dignity . She is source of all the chastity that you think .

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.892
she is source of all the pride, you should have .all those qualities have vanished from my great country

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.892
and I cannot understand when that ambe the Chandi is going to rise within.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.892
When are you going to be charmed by the great force that lies within us.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.892
You are great people to be born in this country.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.892
This Sahasrara of yours is there as represented in the Himalayas,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.892
you have Himalayas on your head here which as to be just ignited with your kundalini

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.892
which lies down, but we live in a very cheap style of life extremely cheap which has no dignity.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.892
We take to western life without thinking what are we ,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.892
what is our purpose of coming on this earth at this time .

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.892
We are going to be leaders of the whole universe. All the world is going to fall at our feet for this

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.892
because you know science has failed completely.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.892
They have realized that science cannot take you to far and where are they going to fall back.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.892
Is this country of ours and on you people who are great children of this motherland .

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.892
The Sahasrara lies in the  Himalayas and how do you believe me that it lies in Himalayas .

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.892
If you go any time to visit the ranges of Himalayas .

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.892
who will be surprised the tremendous vibration flow from Himalayas towards the sky .

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.892
You can see lights and lights going up if you are a realized soul ,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.892
otherwise you may not see it�s a tremendous country, its tremendous opportune time.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.892
You are great people to be born at this time to get this .

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.892
Only thing is you should assume your power , assumption,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.892
assumption is only possible if you know your country.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.892
you don't know your country you don't know anything about your country

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.892
You don�t know what beauty it has.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.892
Nowhere in the world sandalwood is produced in the way its produced in this country.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:43.892
Nowhere in the world the clay or motifs smell so well as it smells here .

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.892
Nowhere in the world you get so many types of champas that you get here , beautiful fragrant trees.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.892
Anyone who has visited this country any western man saying alright our gardens are alright

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.892
but we don�t have any fragrance. This country�s fragrance is its magnetism has become fragrant

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.892
why what is happening to us is that we do not know our magnetism our dignity our guru tattwa .

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.892
We have become (eccentric )or we have become absolutely abundant

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.892
if you are dignified your (eccentric ) one track mind of the another side is

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.892
that you are absolutely abundant all the norms of an Indian life .

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.892
So far Sahaja yogis who got realization it is important to go down to your traditions

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.892
to understand that money never gives you happiness nothing gives you happiness but your spirit

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.892
and to get your spirit you must know Indian traditions because these traditions comes from the roots

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.892
and if you have to go to your roots you have to know the tradition of this country.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.892
How these traditions have been built of course there have been many attacks on us

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.892
and so our traditions have been quite mutilated but if you go deep down into it

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.892
you will be surprised how our life has made to get only the self-realization

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.892
to make beautiful mature personality. Sahasrara of a of an indian is the most beautiful thing

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.892
you cannot see it you cannot enjoy it . What am i to do? I am the only one who enjoys Sahasrara

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.892
It has got all the petals, thousand petals like these beautiful colours which opens out

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.892
and I see them dangling like the living flames of beauty and silence.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.892
Inside that you see the agnya chakra all opened out.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.892
It is such a beautiful thing to see the Sahasrara of an Indian, there is no pride,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.892
there is no conditioning, nothing, but just the joy of the spirit flowing into it.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.892
That joy has to come into all of us. Today is the time when Sahasrara has opened out.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.892
It�s the first time it has happened on mass scale

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.892
and on the mass scale nobody has been able to do that though secretly many people

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.892
did very slowly one by one people got realization

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.892
but such a mass scale happening never took place. It took place now.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.892
Now perhaps we must know that you must be great people,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.892
must be that you have done great punyas, that the Sahasrara is opened now,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.892
that your fontanelle bone area or I would say thalu bhag has been opened out like this

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.892
and you feel everywhere the all-pervading power of God.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.892
You understand how to manoeuvre it and how to manage it.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.892
But there are people in this country who talk in the name of yoga

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.892
all kinds of eccentric things one sided, one track of mind.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.892
Now you must know that first thing is to get your realization,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.892
second thing is to know how to manage Sahasrara.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.892
The other day I had a patient who had lost his motor movement. Now, he was cured, how?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.892
Just Sahasrara, working on the Sahasrara. Just putting my hand on the Sahasrara,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.892
I worked it out. It�s very simple because in the Sahasrara everything is brought together.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.892
All the seven chakras, all the three nadis, pass through the agnya chakra like this as you can see

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.892
it is not there today and you can see that if you can control your Sahasrara

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.892
then you don�t have to worry about anything.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.892
Now let�s see what is the connection of this Sahasrara with rest of the body

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.892
as the brain has the connection which the doctor know and you people also must be knowing.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:59.892
But they are the subtler correction. Sahasrara has got the seven pithas or seats of the chakras.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.892
All these pithas have got valayas, it meaning auras.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.892
Now these all auras are expressed in the heart.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.892
So around the spirit all these auras workout. When this Sahasrara gets enlightened , all these auras get enlightened

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.892
by that the person become large hearted man, lion hearted man, a compassionate man

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:37.892
and he starts putting his heart into his belief. Many people believe that this is not good.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.892
We should not do, we should give up. But they cannot because they are not Samarth.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.892
They are not powerful enough to give up what they want to give. When Sahasrara opened out

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.892
you will be surprised you become such a powerful, virtuous, righteous personality.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.892
You can give up whatever you want to give up and you do what you like with yourself.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.892
Sort of you become master of yourself. You can compare Sahasrara with master of a car.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.892
The master is sitting in the car and the driver is driving. But the driver doesn�t know how to drive,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.892
so he uses his brake, then he uses accelerator. Sometimes he makes mistake

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.892
then he somehow or other puts into balance when dharma is established.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.892
Then after putting the balance he becomes expert. He does not think he goes into nirvachara

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.892
and you cross over the agyna chakra through kundalini. You become nirvachara , you don�t think.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.892
Then when it reaches the Sahasrara and pierces through then he becomes one with the spirit.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.892
The master becomes distinct in a way that the driver becomes the master and he watches within himself,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.892
the driver the accelerator and the brake all of them he watches, this is what happens to you,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.892
that you become the Karta you become the master and you start monitoring everything yourself.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.892
Seeing it ah this is mr x come along do this job you are this to do that.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.892
Once the Sahasrara opens all your centres get absolutely filled with the grace of the holy ghost,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:31.892
grace of the Adi shakti starts flowing and all the chakras get filled up with beautiful feeling of contentment.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.892
On the Lakshmi chakra you get contentment. You do not become greedy.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.892
You do not run after other things. Whatever you have you enjoy.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.892
Actually this is a sad thing, whatever you have you never enjoy,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.892
you want to enjoy what somebody else has but when Sahasrara opens up you enjoy whatever you have,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.892
you just go and see in your house how many beautiful things you have, just watch them without thinking.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.892
You will be amazed that you have beautiful things within you

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.892
and you are not enjoying what you have and worry about what others have.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.892
And that is how people are getting crazy with their greed,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.892
then when it opens the heart chakra pure relationships between each other develops,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.892
pure relationships wife is a wife, husband is a husband, sister is a sister, brother is a brother,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.892
such beautiful relationships develop with in you that you become absolutely pure.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:41.892
Purity is achieved when Sahasrara  opens up. Purity is what gives you complete detachment.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.892
You are so pure that nothing can attach, like a soap in the soap you wash everything

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.892
with the soap and soap doesn�t get dirty, everything that is dirty washes out.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.892
You become like that a Sakshi, nothing can attach you alright, you have things in the house,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.892
you have this and that, you are not attached, you become such a generous person.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.892
The purity of generosity is so great that you forget what you do for others and gave them,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.892
there is nothing like other left, you just enjoy giving, enjoy doing for others

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.892
and once you open the door from one side you will be amazed the door from the other side opens

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.892
and you are flooded, you are flooded, you don�t know what to do.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.892
How much I should give, how much I should give still it is flooding. Because this door has to open.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.892
If this door opens then Sahasrara takes a new dimension, absolutely a new dimension of a saint.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.892
The greatest thing of a saint is he never does any adharma. He doesn�t do any wrong, you don�t have to tell him.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.892
So such a saint is born and such a saint start giving light to others.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.892
Actually opening of Sahasrara means opening of light to others.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.892
Those people who come only for treatment I tell them that after all you must also understand

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.892
that god is a meticulous personality. Alright I am compassionate, he is also compassionate

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.892
but he thinks what is the use of curing these people,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.892
what is the use of repairing of those lamps which are never going to give light.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.892
We have to understand our own worth that you have to give light to others.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:32.892
You are the light of the universe and you have to stand up to it and achieve it through deep understanding of your being.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.892
Now in Sahasrara what happens is the integration because all the seven chakras are there.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.892
All the incarnations are explained why they did like this, why they did like that.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.892
For example at the time of Mohammed Saab he found that the people were worshipping all the idols and all that .

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:02.892
They were not worshipping the nirakar , the essence, like they were worshipping the flowers and but not the honey.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.892
So he said better worship the honey and talked of honey.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.892
He talked of honey and it became a talk, human beings know how to make everything into a useless talk,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.892
so they started talking about nirakar, same with Nanak Saab when he came.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:28.892
He came because he found Mohammed Saab was not whatever Mohammed Saab did was not sufficient,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.892
he had to come. It is Mohammed Saab only that came back to teach you

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.892
that see there is nothing like Hindu, Muslim and all that. That you have to realize that is why he came.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.892
We have forgotten why he came on this earth and also he talked about nirakara

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.892
but that also became a talk or just a song or a sort of akhanda path.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.892
That is not he talked, that is not he wanted. Why all this was to just make you aware of the spirit.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.892
Anybody who came on this earth like Buddha came on this earth at that time when he found people were indulging

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.892
into absolutely wrong type of attitudes. He came in the sixth century when tantricas were very powerful.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.892
He saw, he came in sixth century when tantric were very powerful, they has started taking shape

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.892
He was so worried about them, then also he thought talking about iswara people started thinking

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.892
that you are the iswara and that they all became great masters themselves.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.892
In the temple he found people were worshipping god and doing all kinds of dirty things

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.892
even now they do it and they have forgotten that god who is sitting here and we are doing all these things,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.892
actually I have seen, heard many pujaris telling me that mother nothing god never does anything to us,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.892
see we are above everything, and I ask them then why are you suffering from paralysis.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.892
He said paralysis everybody get but I got because I was over doing the puja of god.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.892
They just don�t want to accept that they ask them then why are you suffering from paralysis,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.892
he said paralysis everybody gets but I got it just because i was overdoing the puja of god

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:22.892
they just don't want to accept that they are harmed and they did wrong, absolutely wrong at the lotus feet of the lord.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.892
So all these things to stop, all these things to stop Buddha came on this earth.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.892
He talked of uneaswara waad. He came on this earth but after that he felt that uneaswara waad has  gone to the other side of it.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.892
Absolutely it is madness now. So he came as Adi Sankaracharya.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.892
Just to put it right they came on one side and see they ,they are going to one extreme to pull them they come on the other side.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.892
It is just a movement from right to left and left to right like that he came.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.892
All the integration from all these people can be felt when you open your Sahasrara .

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.892
You are amazed that how they are related to each other.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.892
We are not, they are like Christ has said those who are not against me are with me,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.892
who are those people will the Christians explain? They cannot, they don�t want to know,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.892
they don�t want to talk about the future either, they don�t want to know about it

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:24.892
because they think they are the chosen ones. But once all such chosen ones will have to land in hell.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.892
I think if they go about like this, Jews did the same, Jews could not accept Christ.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.892
They would not accept Christ. They said no no no, our messiah is going to come later on 2000 years back

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.892
and this 2000 years is permanently 2000 see and it is never finishing

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.892
and they said we must suffer we must suffer otherwise without suffering we cannot meet god. This is their theory.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.892
So alright have Hitler, Hitler made them nicely suffer and they suffered and suffered

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.892
and now they have become aggressive people. This is not god�s work. This is not what god is,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.892
god is a thing which is a complete integration within us, of understanding

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.892
how god has sent these paigambaras, his incarnations, his people on this earth to save us

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:18.892
from this illusion, from this Maya of darkness, of ignorance, he sent us all these things.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.892
So we have to understand him, a complete integration has to be established within us is only possible

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.892
if our Sahasrara opens otherwise you are not going to believe me.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.892
Now also the integration of your own physical mental and emotional being is established.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.892
Then the integration of all the universe is established within you.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.892
All the stars everything is established within you. You can control the stars,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.892
the stars come at the time you are doing some work, they are there working out.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.892
You will be amazed that once I was having a wedding of 27 people in Bordi,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.892
and I said that today is the day of 27 constellations to be here,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.892
can you believe that the southern star was there like a cross.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.892
It was there on the sky anybody could have taken a photograph of that to prove

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.892
that how the stars and everything becomes just our supporters, our helpers, they act for us.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.892
Then all the angels, all the angels look after so many miracles the Sahaja yogis will tell you about

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.892
what has happened how sahaja yoga is helped. It happens not because it is not something great

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.892
but it is your own achievement because your Sahasrara is opened,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.892
everything that is created for the goodness of this world at your lotus feet.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.892
Everything that is created for the emancipation of the human beings is at your lotus feet.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.892
Every movement you will feel that is somebody holding my hand and taking me ahead

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.892
and guiding me ahead towards something so great (supreme).

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.892
The whole being will be filled with joy at the Sahasrara name of Ananda is not swananda,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.892
swananda is in the heart but the name of Ananda at Sahasrara is niranand,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.892
surprisingly I am called as Nira in my family. All my family people call me as NIRA,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.892
because my short name is NIRA. And luckily the place we have got for the ashram is also along the river of the Nira,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:39.892
which flows down to the Bhima, which is another tributary of the Krishna river.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.892
But this Nira river goes just like the emblem of Sahaja yoga which we call as pradikshina.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.892
That is the sign of shakti , because shakti goes around the Shiva like that and exactly like that it moves,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.892
so you will be surprised, it is not a coincidence.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.892
It is a reality that such a place we should have there at NIRA   which was the ashram of Shandilya.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.892
Shandilya is my gotra also. To have a place there as such vibrations, tremendous vibrations,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.892
Shandilya Bhoomi has something to do with Punjab.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.892
You will be amazed to know that at the time when Prahlada was born,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.892
before that his mother became pregnant and Indra thought this Hiryanakashayapa is a big rakshasha

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.892
who was ruling in Lahore, so he thought that it is better to take her away from there

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.892
and put her with somebody sensible or marry her off.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.892
So on his way he dropped her at this place near Nira where Prahlad was born.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.892
Then Shandilya told him,  Shandilya muni,  this was 14000 years back Shandilya told him t

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:04.892
hat this boy is going to invoke the Vishnu tattwa so much that he is going to appear as Narasimha.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.892
So you better not take this lady with you, but what you have to do is to just wait and see how it works out

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.892
and when the child grows of some age I will send the child to the father�s place.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.892
So Indra agreed and he went down in the south and got his realization.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.892
There is a place called Chidendra where he got realization.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.892
Now this Prahlada who was living there. now see the miracles are like this.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.892
And when he was five years of age he was sent to his father. And you know what happened,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.892
how Narasimha avatar came in. Now after many years  peswas tried to build a temple

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.892
on the Sangam or the meeting place of Bhima and Nira river,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.892
and they spend 7 crores of rupees just to fill up the area for the temple

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.892
and they couldn�t do much there, then 3 or 4 hundred years back

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.892
one gentleman thought he should build the temple and finish the job.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.892
So when he thought of that he dreamt in his dream he saw a Prahlada himself

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:17.892
and he said that I have already made a statue of a Narasimha with my own hands

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.892
and the statue is made out of sand, and it is lying in the Nira river.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.892
You can go and find that yourself and put that statue in the temple.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.892
So the gentleman went around and saw the statue made out of the sand .

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.892
For thousands of years, he brought that statue and put it in the temple.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.892
That statue has tremendous vibrations. Only a realized soul can see from long distance,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.892
you can feel the vibrations of the statue made by prahalada who in Lahore went

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.892
and because of him Narasimha avatar came and then he ruled in Punjab.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.892
This place has got something miraculous that from the top of the sikhara of the temple

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.892
if you put your finger there you will find a small little dhara of water flowing

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.892
and you can feel it. All these great miracles are still there in our country,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.892
but the trouble is we have no time to know about these things.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.892
We have no time to understand what is so great in our country.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.892
What we do is to go to some of temples and there we find some of these Brahmins looting us

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.892
we just get fed up with that horrible and we run away.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.892
But whatever they may try they cannot remove, cannot remove the greatness of our country.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.892
So today is the day where you are celebrating my birthday, I don�t know what I should say about it,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.892
but only thing I am very happy that Sahasrara has opened in Delhi.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.892
Delhi is the place one has to be very careful about. Here is the place where the rakshasas have ruled,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.892
this is the place makes you very ego-oriented, you might create a Hitler here one day,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.892
is such a horrible place is Delhi. I got married myself in Delhi only.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.892
I lived in Delhi quite a lot because I know the importance of Delhi.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.892
Delhi is the place from where we rule the whole country and in this place

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.892
I have seen people get into the ego trips very fast. Even an ordinary person a peon could be in that ego trip.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.892
So with that ego trip one can do lot of harm to others, because those who have ego harm others,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.892
those who have superego harm themselves.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.892
They can go on harming all the time for their selfish ends this that and they won�t realize that

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.892
there is anything wrong with them. In Delhi if you can work it out with that depth,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.892
I am sure a day will come when definitely say that Delhi has given a new jump,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.892
a new dimension to the whole world, but  Sahaja yoga one must understand though

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.892
it is integration it is a collective work. It is a collective work. It is a samoohik work.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.892
It is not that you sit in the house I was meditating nothing, you are not to go to Himalayas,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.892
you are not to go anywhere but you all if you have to go to a place

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.892
where they are meditating all of you should meditate, the more you meditate the better it is

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.892
because one person has   some defect and another has some defect, all of them put together

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:30.892
feel the real source because all of them are a part and parcel of this brain.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.892
You are the part and parcel of the  Virata of the great primordial being, of Akbar,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.892
you are part and parcel, you are in the brain when your Sahasrara is open.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.892
Now can you imagine one cell sitting at home and the other cell sitting in the shop

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.892
all the cells have to be together and have to work it out being something substantial.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.892
You cannot workout with one cell. You have to have all the cells working together in complete unison,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.892
in complete understanding, in complete love.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.892
So one has to understand that after getting realization, so many of you got realization,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.892
I saw that happening. It is a great thing the greatest present you can give me on this birthday

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.892
Will be that you form a collective understanding of Sahaja yoga.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.892
How collectivity, you may be anything, you may be a big man, small man anything.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.892
See among Muslims they are achieved. Even the king he is with everybody else to do the namaz.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.892
Now what about you, you people must understand that it is a collective happening for the whole universe.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.892
The people who have got realization have to meet together every week for one day,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.892
can�t you spare for something so great. I remember my father was a great fighter for freedom.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.892
Not one minute they could think of anything else but that and there were thousands and thousands of people who did it.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.892
Mahatma Gandhi had that charm that he brought people into such a position that they fought for it.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.892
It is very easy for people to make fight others, but to fight themselves is very difficult.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.892
Moreover here you have to become something. It is not one can give a certificate,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.892
now you are realized soul, now you are alright, alright you are a foreman, a member,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.892
it is not possible. There is no money nothing can purchase it.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.892
You have to become the tree as Krishna has said the tree opens in the head.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:47.892
The jadas of the or you can call them the roots of the tree are in the brain

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.892
and then the whole being is completely nourished by that.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.892
This brain of ours is such a wonderful thing that it can nourish the whole universe.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:08.892
You have to become the part and parcel of the whole, part and parcel of Akbar, which we call the Virat.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.892
Now this is the brain of Virat which is the Sahasrara and in the heart resides the spirit.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.892
But once you achieve that state of nirvikalpa then the spirit resides here at Sadashiva,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.892
at this stage there are seven stages higher than that, but at least three can be easily achieved

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:38.892
if you try the collective method of Sahaja yoga , collective method by which you can correct yourself.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.892
Just watch yourself, face yourself and enjoy the way you are correcting yourself.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.892
For the first time you start seeing yourself am I like this, alright I am going to put this right.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.892
You will see yourself as centres, you won�t feel bad or hurt.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.892
You will correct yourself and thus you will correct the whole society.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.892
No use crying, weeping, saying that is wrong with the society, this is wrong with the society, do this, do that.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.892
Everything can be brought around if you all decide,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.892
even all these people if you all decide to do the collective work of Sahaja yoga

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.892
I can assure you things are going to work out, or going to work out very fast.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:27.892
Very fast but let that kundalini be awakened in Kolhapur, we have a god,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.892
the goddess of Mahalakshmi is the Sushumna nadi expressed is come out of the mother earth

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.892
and there people are saying udhe udhe ambe , udhe udhe ambe, udhe udhe ambe , udhe udhe ambe ,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.892
what is that, she is Mahalakshmi, why are you saying Ambe, all the time Ambe is Mahakali�s power,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:54.892
because kundalini is the power of Mahakali. So they are saying that how the Mahalakshmi,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:01.892
the Sushumna is alright, now let the Ambe get raised means let the Chandi raise,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.892
let the kundalini raise within us and this is what is going to happen to all of us once that starts

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.892
you will be amazed how great you are. Don�t run after petty things of life.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.892
Don�t think that these petty things are going to give any happiness. Open you Sahasrara,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:28.892
I know it is not possible for all the people to get it, but so many in this country can get it for nothing at all

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.892
because this country is specially placed, the people in this country.
