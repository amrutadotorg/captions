00:11.000 --> 00:20.060
Today it’s a great day because Sahasrara day

00:20.060 --> 00:24.150
and Mother’s day have come together.

00:25.060 --> 00:31.010
That’s a very Sahaj happening, I think,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.080
and that is what we have to understand,

00:39.090 --> 00:47.120
how Sahasrara and the motherhood go together.

00:53.130 --> 01:00.060
Sahasrara was definitely opened

01:03.070 --> 01:06.990
and Mother had to do it,

01:09.130 --> 01:16.990
because formerly those people who came on this earth

01:18.090 --> 01:24.950
tried to teach people about Dharma,

01:25.120 --> 01:28.130
to bring them to the central path,

01:28.130 --> 01:32.160
to the straightforward path of ascent.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.960
They tried everything,

01:36.930 --> 01:40.100
whatever way they thought was good for a particular community,

01:40.950 --> 01:44.010
particular area, particular country.

01:44.090 --> 01:50.020
They talked about it and lots of books came out of it.

01:50.130 --> 02:03.090
But instead of all these books creating people of  religious,

02:04.990 --> 02:10.100
spiritual and a united nature,

02:10.100 --> 02:15.090
created people who were all against each other.

02:15.090 --> 02:20.960
Absurd, it’s an absurd thing, but it happened.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.080
So all these books that were written,

02:25.080 --> 02:32.940
all this knowledge that was given, was all misused by human beings

02:32.940 --> 02:41.050
just to get their own power, I should say;

02:41.160 --> 02:48.150
so it was all a power-orientated, also money-orientated, game going on.

02:48.990 --> 02:58.020
When we see the outcome of all these religions, we feel it’s all empty.

02:58.020 --> 03:08.980
They talk of love, they talk of compassion but it is all for a purpose.

03:09.080 --> 03:13.040
It is all a political game sometimes,

03:14.010 --> 03:20.040
because they still feel that they should have power,

03:20.160 --> 03:24.050
not the spiritual power but the worldly power,

03:24.050 --> 03:27.990
so that they can dominate the whole world.

03:28.160 --> 03:34.970
So this domination started working so much in the human mind

03:35.080 --> 03:40.110
that we had lots of wars, killings, all kinds of things.

03:40.930 --> 03:46.930
And when it subsided I felt that now,

03:46.930 --> 03:53.130
maybe, opening Sahasrara might help people to see the truth.

03:53.130 --> 03:59.930
At the level of Sahasrara, you know the truth.

04:00.970 --> 04:08.150
So all kinds of illusions, all kinds of misunderstandings,

04:08.150 --> 04:18.130
all kinds of self-imposed ignorance, they all have to disappear.

04:18.940 --> 04:22.150
Because what you know is the truth.

04:24.070 --> 04:31.070
The truth is not sharp, it’s not harsh,

04:31.160 --> 04:38.050
it is not something which is difficult to assimilate.

04:38.150 --> 04:45.000
People thought truth must be something that would be just very

04:45.160 --> 04:50.130
damaging or could be very harsh,

04:50.130 --> 04:56.110
could create problems between human beings, which it should not have,

04:56.940 --> 05:01.020
it should not have, it was not meant to be.

05:01.020 --> 05:03.930
But whenever they talked of truth

05:03.930 --> 05:08.160
the people used it for a wrong purpose.

05:08.990 --> 05:11.080
It’s something special about human beings

05:11.140 --> 05:22.110
that they start using things for a wrong attitude, for a wrong message,

05:22.930 --> 05:26.070
and try to use it for their own purpose.

05:26.070 --> 05:30.100
It’s such a common thing with human beings

05:30.100 --> 05:34.080
that they want to have power over other men.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.040
Now I’ve seen in My own country when

05:37.040 --> 05:41.110
people wanted to have separate nations.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.930
Those people who wanted to have separate nations actually did it,

05:46.930 --> 05:51.940
not to achieve anything great but just because they can become,

05:52.030 --> 05:55.000
those people who wanted, few of them,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.970
they'll become something great in their own country.

05:59.030 --> 06:02.100
So they never wanted to be in a country where

06:02.100 --> 06:05.030
they may not rise to that height.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.970
So then, they separated those countries and by separating I have seen

06:09.970 --> 06:14.960
all these countries are suffering, suffering very much.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.000
There’s no growth, there are financial problems,

06:18.000 --> 06:20.050
all kinds of problems are there and

06:20.050 --> 06:26.100
also the main country is suffering because they have now developed

06:26.100 --> 06:31.940
enmity and all this is working out against the main country.

06:31.940 --> 06:37.170
So to have a separatist idea itself is against Sahaj.

06:37.170 --> 06:44.160
Say, for example, a flower growing on the tree looks very nice,

06:45.000 --> 06:50.080
it develops there, matures there and it produces seeds also.

06:50.080 --> 06:57.100
But supposing you cut the flower and take it away, then what happens?

06:57.100 --> 07:00.010
The tree loses the flower, no doubt,

07:00.010 --> 07:04.050
but mostly it is the loss of the flower.

07:04.050 --> 07:08.020
Now this they did, all of them, and when they did it,

07:08.080 --> 07:10.100
you see, what is the result?

07:10.100 --> 07:20.150
That people who tried to have their own country, their own domain,

07:20.960 --> 07:28.070
they were killed, murdered, abused and some of them are in jail.

07:28.070 --> 07:32.940
So the attitude, even outside  Sahaja Yoga,

07:32.940 --> 07:36.010
has shown that it doesn’t help.

07:36.080 --> 07:42.040
So we must learn to be one.

07:42.040 --> 07:46.970
If after Sahaja Yoga, after your realization,

07:46.970 --> 07:53.100
if you do not understand this message that we all have to be one,

07:53.100 --> 07:57.050
one single unit, one single body;

07:57.050 --> 08:01.990
if we cannot be, if you are identified with other things,

08:01.990 --> 08:07.110
then it’s no way you have grown, you have not matured.

08:07.110 --> 08:11.100
A very important point on Sahasrara day, one has to understand,

08:11.100 --> 08:16.940
that all the seven chakras have their peethas in the Sahasrara.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.940
All the seven chakras.

08:18.940 --> 08:23.160
They are nicely settled down in the midriff of your brain

08:23.160 --> 08:31.040
and they act through that area, wherever they are,

08:31.040 --> 08:34.050
on the chakras and work it out.

08:34.050 --> 08:40.130
Now all these seven chakras become one,

08:40.130 --> 08:43.020
I should say, or go into unison.

08:43.020 --> 08:49.970
Complete integration takes place in these centers.

08:49.970 --> 08:57.960
Because these are governed by these seven main chakras,

08:57.960 --> 09:00.160
we can call them, you can call them by any name,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.930
and they govern all the other chakras

09:03.930 --> 09:08.140
and because they are in unison, completely integrated,

09:08.140 --> 09:13.000
that’s why all your chakras are integrated.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.170
Is the peethas which are enlightened, I should say, by Kundalini,

09:22.990 --> 09:31.990
also blessed by the Divine power, immediately become integrated.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.990
They say that like pearls in one string.

09:36.990 --> 09:41.100
It’s even more than that, it’s more than that,

09:41.170 --> 09:47.980
all these peethas within you get integrated in such a manner

09:47.980 --> 09:54.000
as if there’s no difference in their manifestation.

09:54.000 --> 10:01.030
Supposing you have a chakra which is not alright,

10:01.030 --> 10:03.120
something wrong physically, mentally, emotionally,

10:03.120 --> 10:06.090
whatever it is, the other chakras try

10:06.090 --> 10:17.000
to help this sick chakra and try to evolve a personality

10:17.000 --> 10:21.940
of a Sahaja Yogi in a way that he’s integrated.

10:21.940 --> 10:25.170
Now integration within yourself is very important,

10:25.170 --> 10:28.980
unless and until you are integrated within yourself

10:29.050 --> 10:31.970
you cannot be integrated outside.

10:31.970 --> 10:34.080
And the within yourself the integration

10:34.080 --> 10:37.980
is such a blessing of Sahaja Yoga that a person

10:37.980 --> 10:45.060
who gets this realization becomes a personality

10:45.060 --> 10:50.030
which is above the normal personality.

10:50.030 --> 10:55.170
It is not attached to all the negative forces,

10:55.170 --> 10:57.140
the destructive forces.

10:57.140 --> 11:01.960
It just gives up so many things

11:01.960 --> 11:05.990
which normally very difficult to give up.

11:05.990 --> 11:10.020
All these seven chakras, that we have within ourselves,

11:10.020 --> 11:16.140
are then guided by these peethas in unison.

11:17.030 --> 11:21.160
Just the help that comes from this unison

11:21.160 --> 11:26.060
helps all the chakras to get completely integrated.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.000
As it is we are not integrated because

11:29.000 --> 11:35.130
our mind goes on one side, our body goes on another side,

11:35.940 --> 11:40.000
our heart goes on another side, our emotions are different.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.060
We do not know which is the right thing to do,

11:44.140 --> 11:46.970
what is the best thing to do.

11:46.970 --> 11:50.080
But after realization, in the light of the Spirit,

11:50.140 --> 11:54.940
you get the truth and you know what is to be done.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.060
For example, after self realization

11:58.140 --> 12:02.060
you can judge people on their vibrations.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.100
You don’t have to use your brains for that,

12:04.100 --> 12:05.990
just on your vibrations,

12:05.990 --> 12:12.110
immediately you know what’s wrong with yourself and with others.

12:12.110 --> 12:18.140
So here it is a double correction, one is you see your own being,

12:18.140 --> 12:21.970
your own self, your self knowledge comes to you

12:21.970 --> 12:25.090
and secondly you can also make out another person,

12:25.090 --> 12:27.140
what sort of a thing he’s done.

12:27.140 --> 12:31.160
If somebody is not Sahaj and claims to be Sahaj,

12:31.970 --> 12:35.050
you can easily find out that he’s not Sahaj,

12:35.050 --> 12:37.050
his behaviour is not Sahaj.

12:37.050 --> 12:41.060
So the best thing is for all of us is

12:41.060 --> 12:46.090
to get this integration absolutely working out within ourselves.

12:46.090 --> 12:50.970
We should not shun it but we should accept that

12:50.970 --> 12:55.140
whatever defects we had, whatever wrong we have been doing,

12:55.140 --> 13:02.050
what wrong thinking we had, whatever destructive we had taken to,

13:02.110 --> 13:08.110
all this has to disappear because you are Sahaja Yogis.

13:08.110 --> 13:14.020
Sahaja Yogis have a special job to be done.

13:14.020 --> 13:18.940
They’re not like other people who are just working for money,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.060
working for power, working for domination.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.080
You are not.

13:23.080 --> 13:29.000
You are working in Sahaja Yoga for the emancipation of humanity.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.080
So whole thing is that this Sahasrara

13:33.140 --> 13:38.970
is a global field where we enter in.

13:39.030 --> 13:45.940
We enter into a global field and when we are there we just become,

13:45.940 --> 13:48.090
ourselves, a global personality.

13:48.090 --> 13:53.010
So all these minor things like your race, your country,

13:53.080 --> 13:56.970
your religion and all these,

13:56.970 --> 14:00.090
which are artificial barriers between human beings,

14:00.090 --> 14:04.950
just drops out and you become a realized soul,

14:04.950 --> 14:09.950
and you know what is humanity, you understand the humanity.

14:10.010 --> 14:13.080
This has to happen in all the Sahaja Yogis.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.000
When they are together.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.040
They should understand that we are not,

14:17.110 --> 14:19.950
no more ordinary human beings,

14:19.950 --> 14:23.120
we are special people chosen for a very special work

14:23.930 --> 14:26.930
which is the most important thing today.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.110
Now, as you know what is going on in Kali yuga,

14:30.170 --> 14:33.010
I need not describe all that to you,

14:33.010 --> 14:38.030
but what is the light of the Spirit which is going to show you

14:38.090 --> 14:43.930
what you can do to remove the ills of Kali Yuga.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.010
Starting right from yourself,

14:47.090 --> 14:50.150
you just see for yourself with great amusement,

14:50.150 --> 14:53.950
what you have been doing was all stupid.

14:54.030 --> 14:57.030
You should not have done that but you have been doing,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.170
so it’s alright, you can forgive others who are doing it.

14:59.170 --> 15:03.150
And you’ll understand that those who have been doing it

15:03.150 --> 15:06.140
have been doing all this out of ignorance.

15:06.140 --> 15:10.110
But now you have your Sahasrara open.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.120
In the open Sahasrara you are getting,

15:13.940 --> 15:18.940
or the Divine is pouring Its grace all the time.

15:19.010 --> 15:24.980
With that reception, with that, we should say,

15:25.050 --> 15:28.060
the nourishing of your Sahasrara,

15:28.120 --> 15:31.950
what happens is something really great.

15:31.950 --> 15:36.060
One thing happens that you get detached from yourself,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.170
you can see yourself, you can see your past,

15:39.170 --> 15:42.150
you can understand yourself that you have been doing

15:42.150 --> 15:48.980
so many wrong things and misunderstanding people.

15:49.060 --> 15:54.970
This sometimes takes you too far away from yourself.

15:54.970 --> 15:59.060
But once this light comes and the Sahasrara is nourished,

15:59.060 --> 16:02.010
in that light you see clearly

16:02.080 --> 16:04.980
what wrong you have been doing to yourself.

16:05.050 --> 16:08.940
Then, as a person, you can see your faults

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
but also you see the faults of your society, where you live.

16:13.120 --> 16:17.090
I’ve seen immediately after people get their realization

16:17.090 --> 16:18.940
they start telling Me,

16:18.940 --> 16:22.970
“Mother, I was a Christian but see, this is Christianity”.

16:22.970 --> 16:26.010
Somebody will say, “Mother, I was very patriotic,

16:26.090 --> 16:28.980
but I see now what is patriotism is”.

16:28.980 --> 16:34.960
Like, everybody starts seeing its own background,

16:35.030 --> 16:42.950
its own styles in which he has lived and just gets out of it.

16:43.040 --> 16:47.150
And once you are out of it it’s no more identified with you.

16:47.150 --> 16:50.100
And it’s such a spontaneous happening.

16:50.100 --> 16:53.040
Only thing, you have to learn to be spontaneous.

16:53.100 --> 16:58.010
And that’s what I find that, in Sahaj, people still,

16:58.010 --> 17:04.990
though they are out of this illusion, this ocean of illusion,

17:05.060 --> 17:10.170
still sometimes their one leg is still there in the ocean

17:10.170 --> 17:14.060
and still they’re pulling it out and pushing it back.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.120
That should not be.

17:16.960 --> 17:20.980
That is only because people don’t meditate.

17:21.060 --> 17:24.990
Now to say you must meditate, people think it’s a kind of a ritual,

17:25.070 --> 17:30.980
or maybe a kind of a style of Sahaja Yoga, no.

17:30.980 --> 17:37.060
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

17:37.130 --> 17:41.980
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

17:42.060 --> 17:47.040
To achieve that height of detachment,

17:47.130 --> 17:54.040
of understanding is only through meditation.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.170
So what happens in meditation is

17:56.170 --> 18:02.150
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

18:02.990 --> 18:09.040
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

18:09.100 --> 18:14.960
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

18:15.090 --> 18:19.990
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

18:20.060 --> 18:24.070
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

18:24.070 --> 18:27.120
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

18:27.120 --> 18:31.040
But meditation is very important for all of you

18:31.100 --> 18:34.930
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

18:35.020 --> 18:39.980
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

18:40.040 --> 18:44.060
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

18:44.130 --> 18:48.120
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.020
you’ll have no vibrations

18:50.080 --> 18:53.950
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

18:54.020 --> 18:57.030
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

18:57.030 --> 19:01.020
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

19:01.080 --> 19:05.960
and the one who has not been meditating.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.160
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

19:09.160 --> 19:12.950
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

19:12.950 --> 19:16.100
Meditation is the only way you can

19:16.100 --> 19:22.990
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.170
There’s no other way.

19:24.170 --> 19:28.940
I cannot find any other way but meditation

19:28.940 --> 19:34.950
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

19:35.020 --> 19:38.130
For example, I would say that Myself,

19:38.130 --> 19:41.080
whatever I have done is this,

19:41.080 --> 19:43.140
that I have been able to find out a method

19:43.140 --> 19:46.950
how to give Self-realization to masses.

19:46.950 --> 19:49.970
But that doesn’t mean that if I give to masses,

19:49.970 --> 19:52.160
they are all Sahaja Yogis, no.

19:52.970 --> 19:55.130
You must have seen whenever you have your programs,

19:55.970 --> 19:57.950
people get realization when I’m there

19:57.950 --> 20:07.050
and they come to programs for a while and then they drop out.

20:07.050 --> 20:10.050
The reason is, they have not meditated.

20:10.130 --> 20:13.940
If they had meditated they would have known

20:14.000 --> 20:19.940
what is their quality, what are they.

20:20.020 --> 20:28.050
Without meditation you don’t understand what is best for you.

20:28.050 --> 20:31.170
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

20:31.980 --> 20:34.980
that you’ll meditate every night,

20:34.980 --> 20:37.970
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

20:38.030 --> 20:42.050
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

20:42.050 --> 20:47.170
you are in contact with this Divine power.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.970
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

20:53.970 --> 20:58.970
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

20:59.030 --> 21:03.020
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

21:03.090 --> 21:06.030
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

21:06.110 --> 21:13.950
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

21:13.950 --> 21:18.950
which is another great blessing to us.

21:20.120 --> 21:24.030
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

21:24.110 --> 21:31.000
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.940
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

21:34.940 --> 21:36.170
you might get this and that.

21:36.980 --> 21:41.000
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

21:41.000 --> 21:47.050
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

21:47.120 --> 21:54.970
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.110
This is the truth.

21:57.170 --> 22:00.050
They say God is love and God is truth,

22:00.110 --> 22:05.940
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.110
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

22:09.110 --> 22:12.060
you have for your family, attached.

22:12.140 --> 22:15.140
Attached love is not truth.

22:15.950 --> 22:17.970
If you are attached to somebody

22:17.970 --> 22:21.950
then you never see the bad points of that person.

22:21.950 --> 22:23.980
If you are angry with somebody,

22:23.980 --> 22:27.060
then you can never see the good points of that person.

22:27.060 --> 22:31.120
But it’s a complete detached love

22:31.120 --> 22:34.950
and that love is extremely powerful

22:35.040 --> 22:39.170
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

22:39.170 --> 22:43.060
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

22:43.060 --> 22:45.000
his personality will improve,

22:45.080 --> 22:50.090
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

22:50.170 --> 22:54.090
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

22:54.940 --> 23:07.000
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.980
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

23:11.980 --> 23:15.980
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

23:15.980 --> 23:18.970
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

23:19.060 --> 23:24.090
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

23:24.150 --> 23:26.120
It just happens that you get detached.

23:26.950 --> 23:29.980
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.060
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

23:34.140 --> 23:39.950
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

23:40.010 --> 23:41.060
that is not the point.

23:41.060 --> 23:45.930
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

23:45.930 --> 23:49.970
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

23:50.030 --> 23:55.040
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

23:55.110 --> 24:00.060
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.110
In that state you are dealing with people,

24:05.110 --> 24:10.070
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

24:10.070 --> 24:15.930
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

24:16.030 --> 24:18.930
and that involvement which you had before

24:19.030 --> 24:24.060
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

24:24.120 --> 24:26.980
what the truth is, about any situation.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.070
So this detachment helps.

24:30.140 --> 24:35.120
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

24:36.070 --> 24:40.160
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

24:40.160 --> 24:46.070
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

24:46.160 --> 24:50.940
How can you have compassion for another person?

24:51.020 --> 24:55.010
Because if you feel for another person

24:55.100 --> 24:58.130
then only you can solve the problem”.

24:58.940 --> 25:03.960
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

25:04.020 --> 25:09.150
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.020
The person is crying, you are also crying,

25:13.120 --> 25:15.990
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

25:15.990 --> 25:21.040
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

25:21.120 --> 25:25.040
So to have detached in no way means

25:25.120 --> 25:30.050
you do not feel for another person.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.080
You do feel.

25:31.080 --> 25:36.130
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

25:36.940 --> 25:41.940
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

25:42.020 --> 25:44.130
But that your feeling is so detached

25:45.130 --> 25:50.150
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.930
First we must have full faith

25:52.990 --> 25:57.020
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.100
As soon as you are detached.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.970
You say, “You do it” - finished.

26:03.970 --> 26:05.960
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

26:06.020 --> 26:08.050
it’s You who is going to do it,”

26:08.120 --> 26:10.130
whole thing changes completely.

26:10.130 --> 26:15.100
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

26:15.100 --> 26:18.960
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

26:18.960 --> 26:23.130
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

26:23.940 --> 26:29.040
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

26:29.100 --> 26:32.010
you are the one who’s going to do it,

26:32.010 --> 26:37.050
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

26:37.930 --> 26:41.970
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

26:41.970 --> 26:43.070
it will work out.

26:43.070 --> 26:46.100
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

26:46.940 --> 26:49.930
especially when we find that people

26:49.930 --> 26:52.150
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

26:52.980 --> 26:56.080
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

26:56.150 --> 26:59.940
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

26:59.940 --> 27:04.960
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.130
Why should we worry?

27:06.130 --> 27:09.130
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

27:09.940 --> 27:10.960
why should we worry?

27:10.960 --> 27:13.020
Why should we think about it?

27:13.020 --> 27:16.050
Just leave it to the Divine power.

27:16.130 --> 27:20.930
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

27:21.020 --> 27:23.150
which is very difficult for human beings,

27:23.990 --> 27:25.970
because they live with their ego,

27:26.070 --> 27:28.020
they live with their conditionings;

27:28.100 --> 27:33.020
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

27:33.080 --> 27:38.160
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

27:39.130 --> 27:41.070
Krishna has said in His Gita:

27:41.150 --> 27:45.080
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

27:45.150 --> 27:47.100
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

27:47.100 --> 27:52.010
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

27:52.100 --> 27:56.080
of a husband, of a member of the society,

27:56.160 --> 27:58.150
all of them have their own dharma.

27:58.990 --> 28:04.050
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

28:04.130 --> 28:07.940
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

28:08.010 --> 28:12.080
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

28:12.160 --> 28:15.990
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

28:16.070 --> 28:20.050
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

28:20.110 --> 28:24.080
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

28:24.080 --> 28:25.100
That’s not necessary.

28:25.160 --> 28:31.100
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.940
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

28:34.940 --> 28:38.990
to rise to that state of consciousness.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.050
That is what we have to achieve.

28:41.130 --> 28:45.100
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

28:46.020 --> 28:49.080
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

28:49.930 --> 28:52.990
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

28:53.070 --> 28:59.020
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

28:59.080 --> 29:03.080
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

29:03.960 --> 29:13.020
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.130
Just put it on the Divine power.

29:15.130 --> 29:20.040
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

29:20.120 --> 29:24.930
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

29:25.020 --> 29:31.010
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

29:31.010 --> 29:34.930
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

29:35.130 --> 29:40.120
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

29:40.970 --> 29:46.140
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

29:48.070 --> 29:52.000
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

29:52.130 --> 29:56.990
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

29:57.070 --> 30:00.930
so he was working in a bank.

30:00.930 --> 30:04.070
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

30:04.130 --> 30:06.940
and he had to go by boat.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.140
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

30:10.140 --> 30:14.070
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

30:14.070 --> 30:20.970
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

30:21.100 --> 30:25.110
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

30:25.930 --> 30:29.080
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

30:29.080 --> 30:32.080
to stop all these things happening.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.960
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

30:36.030 --> 30:39.110
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

30:39.940 --> 30:43.080
And it was surprising, people told Me that

30:43.080 --> 30:46.140
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

30:46.990 --> 30:52.160
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

30:52.990 --> 30:55.970
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

30:56.070 --> 30:59.030
He went to another island where he had to go,

30:59.100 --> 31:01.080
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

31:01.140 --> 31:04.110
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

31:04.930 --> 31:06.970
everything started pouring down.

31:07.030 --> 31:11.140
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

31:11.990 --> 31:14.970
is worked out through the Divine power.

31:15.100 --> 31:19.110
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

31:19.930 --> 31:21.020
we can manage ourselves.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.170
Once you have that kind of a thing,

31:23.170 --> 31:25.100
you are not yet that much developed,

31:25.100 --> 31:29.080
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

31:29.080 --> 31:33.050
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

31:33.050 --> 31:35.060
because you have guidelines.

31:35.160 --> 31:40.100
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

31:40.170 --> 31:44.970
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

31:45.050 --> 31:46.970
how much they must have struggled.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.060
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

31:49.160 --> 31:52.990
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

31:53.050 --> 31:57.950
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

31:58.100 --> 32:01.170
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.080
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

32:07.160 --> 32:11.030
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

32:11.100 --> 32:16.170
they had such knowledge of their own

32:16.990 --> 32:21.080
that they achieved through their meditative process.

32:21.160 --> 32:23.100
And the way they have written books,

32:23.100 --> 32:26.110
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

32:26.170 --> 32:34.170
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

32:35.030 --> 32:39.130
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

32:39.950 --> 32:42.110
nobody was to tell them.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.950
But one thing with them was

32:45.080 --> 32:50.090
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

32:51.050 --> 32:54.940
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

32:55.000 --> 33:00.950
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

33:00.950 --> 33:04.950
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

33:04.950 --> 33:08.090
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

33:08.160 --> 33:12.000
Thoughts are coming all the time,

33:12.080 --> 33:16.160
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

33:16.990 --> 33:18.110
react to this and react to that

33:18.110 --> 33:21.950
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

33:21.950 --> 33:23.950
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

33:23.950 --> 33:27.140
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

33:27.970 --> 33:32.000
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

33:32.090 --> 33:37.130
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

33:37.940 --> 33:39.940
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

33:40.050 --> 33:43.940
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

33:43.940 --> 33:47.020
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

33:47.090 --> 33:52.060
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.030
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

33:55.030 --> 33:58.140
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

33:58.950 --> 34:02.160
And these are so much built up within you,

34:02.160 --> 34:06.970
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

34:07.940 --> 34:11.170
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.110
First one is, when it is conditioning,

34:14.110 --> 34:17.030
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

34:17.090 --> 34:19.970
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

34:20.030 --> 34:23.080
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

34:23.160 --> 34:25.090
That’s the conditioning part of it.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.080
Conditioning can be of many types.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.050
But the ego part of it is that,

34:29.050 --> 34:31.170
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

34:31.980 --> 34:35.950
I must be able to rule everyone.”

34:36.930 --> 34:40.010
These two things are there in the mind

34:40.110 --> 34:43.150
which are all the time crossing over.

34:44.060 --> 34:49.110
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

34:49.950 --> 34:54.090
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

34:54.150 --> 34:59.980
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

35:00.040 --> 35:04.980
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

35:05.060 --> 35:09.000
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

35:09.060 --> 35:11.070
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

35:11.150 --> 35:14.070
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

35:14.140 --> 35:17.930
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.030
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

35:21.030 --> 35:22.140
“I’m an extrovert”.

35:22.140 --> 35:24.090
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

35:24.150 --> 35:30.090
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

35:30.150 --> 35:34.060
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

35:34.060 --> 35:40.060
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

35:40.060 --> 35:46.070
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

35:46.140 --> 35:50.980
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

35:51.060 --> 35:53.170
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

35:53.980 --> 35:57.150
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

35:57.980 --> 36:01.960
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

36:02.030 --> 36:04.930
this Agnya can be opened out.

36:05.010 --> 36:07.930
With surrendering to the Divine,

36:07.930 --> 36:09.980
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

36:10.060 --> 36:13.980
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

36:14.040 --> 36:18.960
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

36:18.960 --> 36:25.170
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

36:25.980 --> 36:30.070
Your connection of Sahasrara with

36:30.070 --> 36:32.140
the All-pervading Power is established.

36:32.140 --> 36:39.090
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

36:39.090 --> 36:44.130
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

36:44.130 --> 36:48.060
is the real knowledge about everything.

36:48.060 --> 36:52.090
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

36:52.930 --> 36:56.010
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

36:56.010 --> 36:59.960
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

36:59.960 --> 37:05.040
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

37:05.100 --> 37:12.930
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

37:13.010 --> 37:21.010
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

37:21.090 --> 37:24.070
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

37:26.100 --> 37:29.950
Kabira has said something great about this,

37:29.950 --> 37:37.100
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

37:37.930 --> 37:42.040
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

37:42.100 --> 37:50.040
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

37:50.120 --> 37:54.040
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

37:54.100 --> 37:57.130
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

37:57.950 --> 38:01.020
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

38:01.090 --> 38:09.090
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.950
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

38:13.010 --> 38:17.040
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

38:17.160 --> 38:23.040
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

38:23.150 --> 38:28.150
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

38:29.040 --> 38:34.010
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

38:34.100 --> 38:38.130
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

38:38.990 --> 38:43.160
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

38:43.990 --> 38:47.930
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

38:48.090 --> 38:50.040
But the greatest thing happend to you

38:50.100 --> 38:52.090
that you become a global personality.

38:52.940 --> 38:55.950
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

38:56.130 --> 39:00.100
of every other nation where they have problems.

39:00.930 --> 39:04.010
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

39:04.990 --> 39:07.160
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

39:07.990 --> 39:10.160
maybe for media, maybe for something.

39:10.160 --> 39:14.960
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

39:15.050 --> 39:20.930
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

39:21.020 --> 39:25.930
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

39:25.990 --> 39:31.050
that it, whatever disturbs you,

39:31.120 --> 39:35.960
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

39:36.050 --> 39:40.010
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

39:40.100 --> 39:44.130
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

39:44.960 --> 39:47.940
if you are a global person.

39:47.940 --> 39:49.120
If you are a global person then

39:49.120 --> 39:54.960
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

39:55.050 --> 39:59.150
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

39:59.150 --> 40:03.970
to act because you are purely a global personality.

40:04.080 --> 40:06.050
Not attached to this, attached to that,

40:06.120 --> 40:10.160
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

40:10.160 --> 40:13.160
by this Divine power very easily.

40:14.010 --> 40:16.930
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

40:17.040 --> 40:21.020
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

40:21.100 --> 40:25.960
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.130
Angry for what?

40:27.130 --> 40:29.120
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -

40:29.940 --> 40:31.080
as if they’re proud of their anger.

40:31.080 --> 40:35.160
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

40:36.020 --> 40:39.150
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

40:39.970 --> 40:42.930
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.100
With anger you spoil yourself.

40:45.930 --> 40:49.990
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

40:50.070 --> 40:54.010
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

40:54.080 --> 41:00.990
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

41:01.070 --> 41:04.040
But if anything happens that angers you,

41:04.040 --> 41:06.130
you should settle down and see for yourself

41:06.940 --> 41:11.020
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

41:11.100 --> 41:17.110
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

41:18.020 --> 41:20.100
You must first of all realize that you are

41:20.100 --> 41:23.050
a special personality that your Sahasrara

41:23.130 --> 41:26.150
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

41:27.040 --> 41:31.020
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

41:32.080 --> 41:46.050
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

41:46.150 --> 41:48.970
You are not an ordinary person.

41:48.970 --> 41:54.020
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

41:54.110 --> 41:59.960
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.960
But that should not give you any ego.

42:04.100 --> 42:07.040
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

42:07.100 --> 42:09.050
but it’s for understanding that

42:09.150 --> 42:13.040
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

42:13.100 --> 42:17.160
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

42:17.970 --> 42:20.080
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

42:20.160 --> 42:23.070
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

42:23.140 --> 42:27.140
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

42:27.990 --> 42:30.140
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

42:30.990 --> 42:34.960
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

42:35.100 --> 42:39.940
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

42:39.940 --> 42:42.110
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

42:43.020 --> 42:44.990
It’s the Artist who is managing”.

42:44.990 --> 42:46.000
And who is the Artist?

42:46.000 --> 42:50.110
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

42:50.930 --> 42:55.030
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.100
You’ll be surprised,

42:56.100 --> 43:01.100
I have got so many letters from people how Sahaj has helped them.

43:01.160 --> 43:04.010
How at the right moment they got the help.

43:04.090 --> 43:10.980
At the point of complete destruction, how they were saved.

43:11.060 --> 43:13.020
So many people have written to Me.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.930
But I’m not surprised.

43:15.010 --> 43:19.020
Because if you are one with the Divine, it looks after you.

43:19.020 --> 43:22.940
It has all the powers, all the powers.

43:22.940 --> 43:29.160
Only one power it doesn’t have, to control you.

43:29.970 --> 43:36.000
If you want to ruin yourself, it gives you freedom, complete freedom.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.020
If you want to ruin yourself, ruin.

43:38.020 --> 43:42.140
If you don’t want to accept Divine power, alright, don’t accept.

43:42.140 --> 43:47.050
It’s a complete freedom to do what you like with yourself.

43:47.110 --> 43:50.020
That is one thing it has given and that’s why

43:50.080 --> 43:56.030
you must curb down that freedom and respect the Divine power.

43:56.030 --> 44:04.030
Today is, I like the day when it is a Mother’s, I should say,

44:04.030 --> 44:05.160
Mother's day also,

44:05.160 --> 44:09.160
because I think only a mother can work it out that way.

44:09.990 --> 44:12.140
One has to have lots of patience with people.

44:12.960 --> 44:16.000
What I’ve seen about all these great incarnations who came,

44:16.140 --> 44:24.970
they just disappeared; in a very short time they lived, very short time.

44:25.030 --> 44:30.050
Somebody was crucified about 33 years of age.

44:30.120 --> 44:34.000
Somebody took a samadhi at 23 years of age.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.950
Because I think they couldn’t bear the way people were stupid.

44:38.030 --> 44:39.140
They couldn’t see the point

44:39.950 --> 44:42.120
that they could do something for human beings.

44:42.120 --> 44:46.000
They lost their confidence I think, or maybe that they thought

44:46.080 --> 44:48.050
it’s useless to work for these people.

44:48.140 --> 44:53.000
Like that they took a position that, it’s better to disappear.

44:53.110 --> 44:55.950
But Mother’s position is different,

44:56.010 --> 45:01.050
She’ll go on struggling and fighting for her child.

45:01.050 --> 45:04.060
She’ll fight it out to the last to see

45:04.060 --> 45:07.050
that the child gets all the benefits.

45:07.110 --> 45:12.010
And this patience and this love and this forgiveness

45:12.120 --> 45:15.060
is innately built in a mother,

45:15.170 --> 45:18.090
see, because her attitude is very different.

45:18.120 --> 45:28.070
Not any achievement, not any big name

45:28.120 --> 45:32.140
or a, what you call a sort of an award or anything.

45:32.140 --> 45:35.970
It is just she does it because she is a mother.

45:36.090 --> 45:40.000
And that is what is the sign of any mother,

45:40.080 --> 45:43.010
if she’s a real mother, at least for her own children,

45:43.090 --> 45:47.040
she will go all out, she will work out everything

45:47.140 --> 45:52.140
for day in and day out and try to save the child from disaster.

45:52.980 --> 45:55.090
But Sahaja Yoga is a much bigger family

45:55.150 --> 46:00.010
and for that you really had to be worked out

46:00.010 --> 46:02.040
through the mother’s principle.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.940
You cannot take any other principle.

46:04.940 --> 46:08.000
Like there were very great warriors we had

46:08.150 --> 46:11.030
and they have done a great job also

46:11.110 --> 46:14.030
and they have worked out as warriors.

46:14.110 --> 46:16.950
Then we had some who were very sacrificing.

46:16.950 --> 46:19.950
All kinds of people there were.

46:19.950 --> 46:24.030
They worked very hard to establish dharma in people

46:24.110 --> 46:25.170
but they could not.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.040
I thought of one thing that, no use establishing dharma.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.090
First of all give them realization.

46:32.930 --> 46:38.040
When in the light of the Spirit they see what’s wrong,

46:38.120 --> 46:40.970
they become dharmic automatically.

46:40.970 --> 46:44.930
The best way is to do that, not to force dharma on them.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.170
Because if you put dharma on them,

46:46.980 --> 46:50.970
they don’t know how to bear it, they can’t digest.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.140
So this will be the best way,

46:53.950 --> 46:59.090
is to just make them aware of their Spirit.

46:59.980 --> 47:02.010
Once the light of the Spirit comes,

47:02.070 --> 47:04.140
in the light they see everything clearly,

47:04.970 --> 47:06.980
then no problem is there.

47:07.040 --> 47:10.170
And that’s why this Mother’s quality is very helpful.

47:10.170 --> 47:13.110
I mean in every country there has been

47:13.930 --> 47:18.070
a manifestation of the Mother Principle, in every country,

47:18.140 --> 47:21.170
and it has been depicted and said.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.150
But later on, it was taken over by people

47:25.970 --> 47:28.140
who didn’t want to talk about Mother.

47:28.960 --> 47:31.070
Because they could not justify themselves

47:31.140 --> 47:32.090
the way they were behaving.

47:32.090 --> 47:35.010
So they said, best is not to talk of the Mother.

47:35.090 --> 47:38.120
Also those who were very much advanced people,

47:38.980 --> 47:42.000
very matured, who were really incarnations

47:42.060 --> 47:44.090
did talk about the mother all the time.

47:44.150 --> 47:46.140
But still talk was talk.

47:46.960 --> 47:51.120
Now this has to be worked out as a Mother has to work it out.

47:51.930 --> 47:53.010
So in your own way,

47:53.090 --> 47:59.170
when you are doing Sahaja Yoga, there also you have to be a mother.

48:00.010 --> 48:03.030
More mother’s quality than the father’s quality,

48:03.140 --> 48:07.980
that: there’s no ambition, there’s no competition,

48:08.100 --> 48:11.140
there’s no jealousies, nothing.

48:11.960 --> 48:15.950
Just you want your children to come up

48:16.010 --> 48:19.120
and to grow in their spirituality.

48:19.960 --> 48:23.030
If that is the only attitude we have,

48:23.120 --> 48:27.120
then you’ll be amazed how satisfied you’ll feel.

48:27.960 --> 48:34.930
Because this is a very, very joy-giving thing

48:34.930 --> 48:38.120
to see people growing in spirituality.

48:38.930 --> 48:41.980
Not only talking about it, not only reading about it,

48:42.060 --> 48:45.980
but actually happening, actualizing within us.

48:46.960 --> 48:49.120
So this quality is very helpful

48:49.950 --> 48:53.170
and that really helps every Sahaja Yogi;

48:53.980 --> 48:57.930
to be patient, to be kind, to be humble.

48:58.100 --> 49:00.990
But you have to correct also.

49:01.150 --> 49:04.960
But there’s a way of correction of another person,

49:05.090 --> 49:10.030
of people who are coming, not from the Divine world

49:10.030 --> 49:11.960
but from the normal world.

49:12.040 --> 49:16.150
So it’s a difficult task to correct them.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.130
Some people are so hot tempered they can’t bear it.

49:19.980 --> 49:22.150
Doesn’t matter, you have to forgive them.

49:22.990 --> 49:28.020
But best is to concentrate on people who are simple,

49:28.100 --> 49:31.070
who are loving, who are affectionate

49:31.140 --> 49:35.950
and then gradually all these complicated people, also, will join.

49:36.010 --> 49:43.010
Your way of dealing with others has to be motherly.

49:43.090 --> 49:46.950
The motherly relationship has to be there.

49:47.930 --> 49:51.030
Now I was surprised that in the western literature,

49:51.030 --> 49:56.100
I don’t find any description of a child and a mother’s relationship,

49:56.170 --> 49:57.930
very surprising.

49:57.930 --> 49:59.980
There’s no description at all.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.990
How the mother sees the child, how he walks, how he falls down,

50:04.100 --> 50:07.930
then how he gets up and how he talks.

50:08.120 --> 50:11.040
All kinds of beautiful things has described,

50:11.130 --> 50:14.070
but not in the Western countries.

50:14.070 --> 50:16.020
I don’t know, they never saw this point,

50:16.090 --> 50:19.930
I think, that it is very important that to describe

50:20.010 --> 50:22.090
the attention of the mother.

50:22.090 --> 50:24.040
How she’s loving, how she’s kind,

50:24.100 --> 50:30.980
how she tolerates so much nonsense and how she keeps it as a,

50:30.980 --> 50:35.930
sort of a, forgiving thing.

50:35.990 --> 50:39.090
Not just to use it against the child or to trouble.

50:39.160 --> 50:42.060
Sometimes you have to correct, you have to tell.

50:42.130 --> 50:45.090
But at the right time, at the right place,

50:45.150 --> 50:52.010
if they are told, the child also sees the point, whatever is there.

50:52.010 --> 50:55.950
The first, most convincing thing is the affection

50:55.950 --> 50:57.960
and the love of the Mother.

50:58.020 --> 51:04.090
She goes on forgiving and giving that assurance that

51:04.090 --> 51:08.040
“I have a mother, nothing can happen to me.”

51:08.130 --> 51:11.950
And this assurance works very well.

51:12.010 --> 51:15.930
But the same assurance you have to give to other Sahaja Yogis

51:16.010 --> 51:18.130
who are getting realization from you.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.070
Let them feel that you are not angry with them.

51:21.150 --> 51:23.930
They are stupid, I know.

51:24.010 --> 51:26.120
They are sometimes violent.

51:27.050 --> 51:30.130
I have gone through all kinds of people.

51:30.960 --> 51:36.960
But the only thing that has worked is pure love.

51:37.100 --> 51:44.980
Pure love has no attributes of expecting something.

51:45.940 --> 51:53.160
You just give love and try to improve that person, with full attention.

51:53.980 --> 51:59.040
But in Divine work, you don’t have to get attached to that person.

51:59.100 --> 52:03.150
Supposing, there’s somebody who is not up to the point,

52:03.990 --> 52:06.940
is also troublesome, gets angry with you, annoyed,

52:06.940 --> 52:09.020
insults you and everything, so forget it!

52:09.930 --> 52:11.010
There are many others.

52:11.080 --> 52:13.070
There’s no need to run after one person,

52:13.160 --> 52:17.960
to get attached to that person or to make them fear.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.150
Now main thing is that,

52:19.960 --> 52:24.150
I feel all the Sahaja Yogis always feel that I’m their own,

52:24.150 --> 52:25.160
which is a fact.

52:25.160 --> 52:29.930
Whether I talk to you, whether I meet you or whatever it is,

52:30.010 --> 52:33.010
you have to know that I’m your Mother

52:33.010 --> 52:37.040
and any problem you have you can always tell Me.

52:37.130 --> 52:40.040
But sometimes the way people tell Me problems also,

52:40.130 --> 52:43.050
I feel, how low they are.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.130
Their mentality is so low.

52:45.960 --> 52:47.040
What are they asking Me?

52:47.120 --> 52:52.080
Supposing you go to some king and ask him for, say,

52:52.150 --> 52:55.030
half a dollar, then what will the king say?

52:55.030 --> 52:56.970
“What is the matter with this person?

52:57.040 --> 52:59.930
He doesn’t know what he should ask for.”

53:00.010 --> 53:02.090
In the same way, one feels that way that

53:02.970 --> 53:06.060
when you are asking anything to your Mother,

53:06.140 --> 53:09.070
it should be of some value.

53:09.070 --> 53:18.030
Some great value, it should have the value of complete satisfaction.

53:18.110 --> 53:22.060
When you ask for something it should give you complete satisfaction.

53:22.060 --> 53:25.970
But I’ve seen people asking for this thing, for that thing.

53:25.970 --> 53:29.040
I mean it’s to such an extent that I sometimes feel,

53:29.040 --> 53:32.060
“Oh God, how am I getting all these people around Me

53:32.150 --> 53:38.140
who are desiring something very low, very mean, very insipid?”

53:39.950 --> 53:46.060
But if you are one with the Sahasrara, then Sahasrara itself works.

53:46.960 --> 53:49.110
It will bring you contact with people,

53:50.150 --> 53:56.140
in contact with such people that you are amazed how it works.

53:57.070 --> 53:59.140
I went to Turkey and My experience of Turkey

54:00.040 --> 54:02.110
has proved that beyond doubt.

54:02.170 --> 54:05.950
I never expected, but the Turkish people,

54:05.950 --> 54:09.940
of all the people of the world,

54:10.130 --> 54:14.080
have taken to Sahaja Yoga just like a windfall.

54:14.140 --> 54:17.960
I can’t understand how they have accepted it.

54:18.020 --> 54:20.130
And they were at least two thousand people

54:20.940 --> 54:24.110
in the follow-up and people were finding it impossible

54:25.050 --> 54:27.940
to get them round and tell them.

54:28.030 --> 54:30.170
And when they had very close meetings also

54:31.000 --> 54:34.160
they had so many people and they continued to be there.

54:34.990 --> 54:38.030
Now maybe that it’s a very disturbed country

54:38.110 --> 54:41.130
with fundamentalism very much working out.

54:41.940 --> 54:48.990
But everywhere, every country has problems and has, we should say,

54:49.060 --> 54:56.140
a kind of a very destructive image, every country has.

54:56.970 --> 54:59.990
But in some countries, I don’t know how,

54:59.990 --> 55:04.000
it sparks and once they become Sahaja Yogis, no problem.

55:04.110 --> 55:06.970
There’s no problem about anything,

55:06.970 --> 55:09.940
means they are Sahaja Yogis you see, you don’t have to tell them.

55:10.030 --> 55:13.170
They themselves work it out, they understand it, what is it.

55:13.990 --> 55:18.030
Like we have every country which has problems,

55:18.100 --> 55:22.000
which has people who are not of a very great level,

55:22.060 --> 55:23.170
who are not great seekers.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.990
Maybe in some countries, I feel, those who were great seekers are lost.

55:28.100 --> 55:32.170
Like England, I feel that all the seekers are lost by drugs,

55:33.030 --> 55:35.020
hippyism, all nonsense.

55:35.140 --> 55:41.000
America is the worst of all, which is so much lost into wrong seeking;

55:41.100 --> 55:46.080
and it’s difficult to find people there who have right seeking.

55:46.940 --> 55:52.080
Gradually it is working out, but still, I must say,

55:52.160 --> 55:56.170
we should not think of any one particular country where Sahaja Yoga

55:56.990 --> 56:01.020
is not working out so much or in some places working out so much.

56:01.110 --> 56:06.140
It is, what we have to think, globally that Sahaja Yoga is growing.

56:06.950 --> 56:11.030
And you are part and parcel of that society which is Sahaja Yoga.

56:11.140 --> 56:14.980
It’s a very rare society which they never had.

56:15.050 --> 56:17.160
They had one or two sufis here and there,

56:17.980 --> 56:21.140
one or two realized souls here and there, who only suffered.

56:22.010 --> 56:26.000
All their lives they were tortured, nobody looked at them.

56:26.110 --> 56:30.030
I had great hopes about Maharashtra, but I’m so disappointed,

56:30.110 --> 56:35.150
because they tortured all these great saints all throughout,

56:35.150 --> 56:39.030
so badly, in such a mean manner,

56:39.110 --> 56:41.970
that I think they are still paying for it.

56:42.040 --> 56:45.170
And despite the fact that I’ve done so much work there,

56:46.010 --> 56:51.040
what I feel is that, their karmas are not good because they still,

56:51.040 --> 56:55.120
I would say, it’s a rotten country, become so rotten.

56:57.940 --> 57:04.130
You can see that, the way people are behaving, whole thing is so bad.

57:04.130 --> 57:07.050
Though Sahaja Yoga is there, no doubt,

57:07.050 --> 57:09.940
but I wouldn’t say it is of that level

57:09.940 --> 57:12.130
as it is in the north, north of India.

57:12.970 --> 57:13.940
It’s very surprising.

57:14.010 --> 57:16.940
North Indians never knew anything about Sahaja Yoga,

57:17.040 --> 57:19.930
they were not such religious people either.

57:20.010 --> 57:24.130
But how the north people have taken to Sahaja Yoga it`s very surprising.

57:24.940 --> 57:28.150
So you can’t say where the light will show, just can’t say.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.990
And wherever it shows we should accept.

57:31.050 --> 57:33.150
Wherever it doesn’t show, we should not feel bad about it.

57:33.970 --> 57:35.010
What can you do?

57:35.070 --> 57:38.990
You cannot sort of break their heads for Sahasrara,

57:38.990 --> 57:41.930
their Sahasrara has to be opened out.

57:42.010 --> 57:44.020
And with your motherly love,

57:44.100 --> 57:47.940
with your motherly understanding I’m sure you can do it.

57:48.970 --> 57:54.050
Not, may not be, to the same extent in every country,

57:54.110 --> 57:58.020
but I’m sure, as I feel that,

57:58.080 --> 58:05.100
maybe the punyas of these great saints will work and maybe,

58:05.160 --> 58:09.930
wherever I felt a little bit disappointed,

58:10.930 --> 58:16.070
I feel that all these places will work out and Sahaja Yoga will grow.

58:16.130 --> 58:19.960
But first and foremost is your Sahasrara.

58:20.110 --> 58:23.970
Only your Sahasrara can reflect the light of the Divine.

58:24.050 --> 58:26.940
So, your Sahasrara is extremely important.

58:27.040 --> 58:31.130
You must meditate to enrich your Sahasrara,

58:31.940 --> 58:36.070
to cure it, to make it completely nourished by the Kundalini.

58:36.160 --> 58:39.070
There`s no need to do many rituals but meditation

58:39.140 --> 58:44.990
and also little bit of taking Bandhan, even now today,

58:45.050 --> 58:50.000
is necessary I think, when you go out.

58:50.100 --> 58:57.050
Because still Kali Yuga is working it’s own pangs and the Satya Yuga

58:57.050 --> 58:59.080
is trying to come out.

58:59.160 --> 59:05.130
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

59:05.940 --> 59:09.160
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

59:09.160 --> 59:12.080
very important, it’s very important.

59:12.930 --> 59:21.020
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

59:21.020 --> 59:23.960
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

59:24.020 --> 59:26.050
maybe in the evening, anytime.

59:26.140 --> 59:29.080
But you will know that you are meditating when

59:29.080 --> 59:33.100
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

59:33.170 --> 59:35.080
Your reaction will be zero.

59:35.170 --> 59:37.140
Look at something you will just look at it,

59:37.960 --> 59:40.110
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

59:40.990 --> 59:42.960
You won`t react.

59:43.030 --> 59:46.140
When that reaction is not there then everything,

59:46.970 --> 59:49.160
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.940
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.110
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

59:58.170 --> 01:00:00.080
you are one with the Divine.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.970
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:10.140
every moment of your life and looks after you.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.960
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.960
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:21.940
May God bless you!

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.170
Now we have so many children.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.030
I don't know what to do with all these children here.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.970
They can just come up on the stage

01:00:59.970 --> 01:01:04.170
and they can sing the song of Shri Ganesha.
