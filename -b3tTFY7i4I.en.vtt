00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:24.136
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:07:27.677 --> 00:07:35.886
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.345
is a very, very important deity within us

00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:46.261
because He is the Vishnu,

00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:51.470
who resides in the Void,

00:07:53.637 --> 00:07:56.220
in the Nabhi.

00:07:56.761 --> 00:08:04.011
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.261
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

00:08:08.637 --> 00:08:10.886
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:16.303
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:18.803
You just did it

00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:25.512
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:28.678
He is in the Void

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:33.220
and if He is awakened

00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:41.345
He brings you to the light,

00:08:42.095 --> 00:08:45.261
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:49.761
and you start seeing that

00:08:51.053 --> 00:08:55.136
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

00:08:55.677 --> 00:09:00.345
and that’s how the dharma is established.

00:09:00.678 --> 00:09:04.428
Of course, the Dharma was established also

00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:11.053
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

00:09:11.387 --> 00:09:15.719
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

00:09:25.178 --> 00:09:29.886
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:33.678
and the ten Gurus

00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:39.512
is to establish Dharma within us.

00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:42.844
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.928
as you have seen everywhere.

00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:48.719
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:51.512
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

00:09:51.886 --> 00:09:57.886
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

00:09:58.637 --> 00:10:02.719
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

00:10:03.178 --> 00:10:07.261
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:15.969
But Shri Krishna is the one

00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:22.053
who says that “I come on this earth

00:10:22.512 --> 00:10:32.512
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

00:10:33.886 --> 00:10:36.136
When the Dharma becomes weak

00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:38.886
then He comes on this Earth,

00:10:39.387 --> 00:10:42.095
and then He destroys the people

00:10:42.512 --> 00:10:47.719
who are responsible

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:57.178
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.178
The second thing He says, that

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:06.803
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:16.011
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:18.011
who are destructive.”

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:20.053
These are His promises

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.928
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

00:11:25.345 --> 00:11:30.136
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

00:11:30.553 --> 00:11:34.470
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:38.678
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:41.178
when He came as Shri Krishna.

00:11:41.637 --> 00:11:44.761
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.136
could not be expressed in that way.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.428
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:56.178
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

00:11:56.637 --> 00:12:04.303
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:08.761
as He made it,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.428
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:17.637
the one who said that you become a witness;

00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:22.553
you witness the whole world like a drama,

00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:24.220
Sakshi Swarupa.

00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:31.261
And then once you see the whole world as just

00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:38.928
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

00:12:39.345 --> 00:12:40.678
That has happened to you people

00:12:41.053 --> 00:12:46.136
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

00:12:46.512 --> 00:12:48.220
the way you are enjoying yourself,

00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:53.928
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

00:12:54.345 --> 00:12:57.220
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:59.886
by killing Putana and other people,

00:13:00.345 --> 00:13:07.178
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:13.428
He is the one who will definitely protect

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:18.053
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:23.387
But later on He becomes the king,

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:26.928
and when He becomes the king

00:13:27.303 --> 00:13:31.677
He uses His powers in a different way.

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:36.095
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

00:13:36.428 --> 00:13:39.928
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:42.470
and was such a bad man.

00:13:42.886 --> 00:13:47.136
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

00:13:47.553 --> 00:13:49.761
He killed so many people.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.886
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

00:13:54.345 --> 00:14:01.637
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:09.678
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

00:14:10.136 --> 00:14:15.677
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:19.886
He did not believe in forgiveness.

00:14:20.387 --> 00:14:25.470
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.160
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

00:14:29.595 --> 00:14:31.303
If you are like Shiva,

00:14:31.678 --> 00:14:34.512
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

00:14:34.928 --> 00:14:39.553
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:46.553
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

00:14:47.387 --> 00:14:51.470
because it was important that there should be

00:14:51.761 --> 00:14:54.011
somebody with a very stern mind,

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:58.261
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

00:14:58.595 --> 00:15:02.095
and devil must be killed.

00:15:05.345 --> 00:15:08.053
He has done in His lifetime,

00:15:08.428 --> 00:15:11.428
if you see, killing of so many people.

00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:14.261
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:17.470
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:21.969
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

00:15:22.387 --> 00:15:26.011
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:34.719
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:38.345
He takes over.

00:15:38.677 --> 00:15:41.637
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

00:15:41.928 --> 00:15:44.928
because He does not forgive.

00:15:45.512 --> 00:15:50.178
He will immediately take over from you

00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:54.637
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

00:15:54.928 --> 00:16:00.678
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

00:16:01.053 --> 00:16:03.969
who are destroying the dharma.

00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:07.595
Now it is very surprising

00:16:07.886 --> 00:16:11.637
that whatever is preached by the person,

00:16:12.011 --> 00:16:16.387
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:19.345
Is very surprising.

00:16:19.803 --> 00:16:24.678
Like we said that Christ said,

00:16:24.969 --> 00:16:27.136
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:16:27.512 --> 00:16:31.387
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:38.428
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

00:16:39.678 --> 00:16:42.678
everybody has the spirit.

00:16:43.095 --> 00:16:47.928
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:51.928
and fight with each other.

00:16:52.844 --> 00:16:58.553
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

00:16:58.969 --> 00:17:01.677
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

00:17:02.053 --> 00:17:04.637
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:07.595
said about rahmat, means compassion.

00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:09.678
But you don’t find it anywhere.

00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:11.719
He has not said about shariat,

00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:13.470
He has not said of many things

00:17:13.803 --> 00:17:17.969
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

00:17:18.428 --> 00:17:20.761
He never said that women should cover their face

00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:23.345
or cover their heads,

00:17:23.719 --> 00:17:27.220
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

00:17:27.637 --> 00:17:33.136
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

00:17:33.512 --> 00:17:37.844
just the opposite of that people try to do.

00:17:40.387 --> 00:17:45.220
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

00:17:45.678 --> 00:17:51.303
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

00:17:51.761 --> 00:17:53.595
He rules over America.

00:17:54.011 --> 00:18:02.136
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:18:02.677 --> 00:18:06.261
He is the Lord of wealth.

00:18:06.678 --> 00:18:10.387
So, He has given wealth to America.

00:18:10.844 --> 00:18:18.553
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:24.844
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:29.844
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

00:18:30.303 --> 00:18:37.261
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:43.886
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

00:18:44.345 --> 00:18:46.637
that is working in America.

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:52.220
So they are going just the opposite way

00:18:52.637 --> 00:18:55.428
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

00:18:55.803 --> 00:18:57.761
so America is going.

00:18:58.136 --> 00:19:00.803
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

00:19:01.178 --> 00:19:05.844
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

00:19:06.095 --> 00:19:07.428
I mean, one can ask question,

00:19:07.719 --> 00:19:09.428
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

00:19:09.803 --> 00:19:11.719
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:13.928
Why are you sending troops all over?

00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:15.678
Why are you looking after everyone?”

00:19:16.053 --> 00:19:18.637
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

00:19:18.969 --> 00:19:22.969
under the guidance of the Americans.

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:25.637
They play a very important part

00:19:25.969 --> 00:19:29.595
in the formation of this United Nations

00:19:30.011 --> 00:19:35.303
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

00:19:35.803 --> 00:19:42.136
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

00:19:42.595 --> 00:19:45.011
they are missing.

00:19:45.387 --> 00:19:47.053
They are all right for communication.

00:19:47.345 --> 00:19:50.886
They are all right for establishing

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.053
relationships between countries.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.637
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

00:19:58.928 --> 00:20:02.637
no idea of dharma, no morality.

00:20:03.595 --> 00:20:07.220
Democracy without morality.

00:20:07.677 --> 00:20:13.178
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:18.178
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

00:20:18.678 --> 00:20:22.886
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

00:20:23.261 --> 00:20:26.303
is really torturing them.

00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:30.803
And also they are realizing, some of them,

00:20:31.136 --> 00:20:34.428
that because of immoral behavior

00:20:34.886 --> 00:20:39.470
they have come to a point where

00:20:39.803 --> 00:20:44.136
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:50.886
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:53.595
at a very young age.

00:20:53.928 --> 00:20:59.136
When it is coming

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:06.470
as a starking

00:21:10.303 --> 00:21:13.678
information is a shock.

00:21:14.095 --> 00:21:17.719
But despite that, despite all this,

00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:21.220
they are still going on with it and thinking that

00:21:21.553 --> 00:21:26.470
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:31.095
Now His punishments have started,

00:21:31.553 --> 00:21:35.470
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

00:21:35.844 --> 00:21:40.428
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

00:21:40.886 --> 00:21:45.387
and as a result he develops some disease.

00:21:45.928 --> 00:21:50.428
Now this disease is not curable.

00:21:51.261 --> 00:21:54.345
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

00:21:54.678 --> 00:21:57.220
of curing these diseases which are coming

00:21:57.595 --> 00:22:01.178
out of immoral living. They cannot.

00:22:01.637 --> 00:22:07.761
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

00:22:08.011 --> 00:22:12.136
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

00:22:12.428 --> 00:22:14.886
which are coming out of immorality.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.220
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

00:22:18.637 --> 00:22:22.512
that immorality is wrong.

00:22:23.095 --> 00:22:28.844
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:32.595
leads to these things.

00:22:33.136 --> 00:22:37.595
And this immorality is completely neglected

00:22:38.053 --> 00:22:41.803
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

00:22:42.303 --> 00:22:48.136
always He says, just to establish morality.

00:22:49.428 --> 00:22:52.470
Artificial morality, that is there,

00:22:52.886 --> 00:22:56.387
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

00:22:56.844 --> 00:23:02.053
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

00:23:02.512 --> 00:23:04.844
They follow one code of conduct

00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:12.345
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:16.428
But America is an open thing.

00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:20.178
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

00:23:20.637 --> 00:23:22.761
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:24.844
So they are not hiding it.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.178
And this has led this country, such a vast,

00:23:29.553 --> 00:23:32.136
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

00:23:32.512 --> 00:23:36.053
into such a ditch that I do not know

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.178
how it is going to recover unless and until

00:23:39.553 --> 00:23:42.053
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:48.719
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

00:23:49.387 --> 00:23:52.428
A dharmic person is the one who is always

00:23:52.761 --> 00:23:55.178
introspective by nature.

00:23:55.637 --> 00:24:02.470
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

00:24:02.928 --> 00:24:08.011
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

00:24:08.553 --> 00:24:11.553
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:13.512
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

00:24:14.011 --> 00:24:20.011
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

00:24:20.512 --> 00:24:25.761
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.136
They never try to introspect themselves.

00:24:29.637 --> 00:24:33.677
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

00:24:34.136 --> 00:24:37.803
Those people who go on like this

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:45.886
will definitely fall into a mess of things

00:24:46.261 --> 00:24:53.803
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

00:24:55.553 --> 00:25:02.803
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

00:25:03.178 --> 00:25:06.677
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

00:25:07.053 --> 00:25:09.178
They may be guided in one part.

00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:12.220
For example, you see, they might say that

00:25:12.677 --> 00:25:16.803
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:23.677
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

00:25:24.095 --> 00:25:28.677
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

00:25:29.053 --> 00:25:30.677
or whatever it is.”

00:25:31.053 --> 00:25:34.011
But all these things are extremely superficial

00:25:34.428 --> 00:25:37.928
for human beings and they are outside.

00:25:38.428 --> 00:25:43.553
The inside is all managed by the conscience

00:25:43.928 --> 00:25:49.677
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

00:25:50.095 --> 00:25:52.719
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:54.595
This conscience is there.

00:25:55.011 --> 00:26:00.345
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:04.553
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

00:26:05.095 --> 00:26:08.803
And this conscience has to answer.

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:12.928
That conscience that is within us is,

00:26:13.345 --> 00:26:18.969
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

00:26:19.553 --> 00:26:23.011
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

00:26:23.553 --> 00:26:27.637
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:31.719
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:26:33.053 --> 00:26:37.261
By listening to your conscience

00:26:37.886 --> 00:26:45.969
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

00:26:46.553 --> 00:26:48.886
But the people who have no conscience,

00:26:49.303 --> 00:26:53.512
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

00:26:53.886 --> 00:26:55.678
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

00:26:56.095 --> 00:26:58.470
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

00:26:58.886 --> 00:27:02.803
So the conscience has to be referred to,

00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:06.595
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

00:27:07.095 --> 00:27:10.220
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

00:27:10.637 --> 00:27:12.178
or to snatch somebody’s money

00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:16.512
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

00:27:16.969 --> 00:27:21.345
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

00:27:21.803 --> 00:27:25.178
At a time when people invaded so many countries

00:27:25.595 --> 00:27:29.053
and tried to overpower them,

00:27:29.553 --> 00:27:32.011
it was America which was the only country,

00:27:32.387 --> 00:27:35.719
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

00:27:36.178 --> 00:27:38.677
to become empires.

00:27:39.136 --> 00:27:41.387
Very surprising, what kept them there.

00:27:41.803 --> 00:27:44.719
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

00:27:45.095 --> 00:27:50.220
all over the world, and that era when people

00:27:50.595 --> 00:27:52.512
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

00:27:52.803 --> 00:27:56.969
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:00.553
America had stopped at that time.

00:28:00.969 --> 00:28:03.637
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

00:28:04.053 --> 00:28:07.261
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

00:28:07.595 --> 00:28:10.470
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

00:28:10.886 --> 00:28:13.011
But after having done that,

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:16.844
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

00:28:17.345 --> 00:28:20.220
they did not do it.

00:28:20.719 --> 00:28:24.428
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

00:28:24.678 --> 00:28:25.803
We should ask a question:

00:28:26.178 --> 00:28:28.969
when others were expanding their empires,

00:28:29.303 --> 00:28:33.303
why did not America do it?

00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:36.178
The reason is very simple.

00:28:36.512 --> 00:28:40.053
At that time some great people with great conscience

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.470
were born in that country

00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:46.345
and they guided that country.

00:28:46.761 --> 00:28:50.969
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:56.844
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.969
there will be a big list of those people.

00:28:59.303 --> 00:29:02.387
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:04.928
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

00:29:05.387 --> 00:29:08.303
full of conscience, full of conscience.

00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:13.969
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:17.387
to the ambition of gathering other countries

00:29:17.803 --> 00:29:20.053
and making them their slaves and ...

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.928
This they didn’t do.

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:29.220
So in the first place when the,

00:29:29.637 --> 00:29:32.136
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

00:29:32.553 --> 00:29:37.678
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:40.761
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

00:29:41.136 --> 00:29:43.844
all of them, when they conquered that country,

00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:46.969
once they settled down there,

00:29:47.512 --> 00:29:52.844
as if that era was over for them once for all,

00:29:53.345 --> 00:29:56.637
and then they started talking about freedom,

00:29:57.095 --> 00:30:01.345
of democracy, of higher values.

00:30:01.886 --> 00:30:08.969
But the karmas of their past,

00:30:09.595 --> 00:30:14.761
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

00:30:15.261 --> 00:30:17.803
so many Red Indians,

00:30:18.303 --> 00:30:22.345
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

00:30:22.844 --> 00:30:28.220
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:33.011
Despite that time when they did not try

00:30:33.512 --> 00:30:36.844
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:43.053
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

00:30:43.553 --> 00:30:46.719
And they always stood for something that is justice …

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.928
tried to, I mean, at least.

00:30:49.303 --> 00:30:52.969
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

00:30:53.345 --> 00:30:56.345
on the face of it, they tried to show

00:30:56.677 --> 00:30:59.677
that they are for uniting the whole world.

00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:04.761
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

00:31:05.136 --> 00:31:10.512
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:17.303
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

00:31:17.677 --> 00:31:20.220
started working in them.

00:31:20.512 --> 00:31:25.637
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

00:31:25.969 --> 00:31:29.844
are working against them.

00:31:30.844 --> 00:31:36.595
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

00:31:37.053 --> 00:31:39.719
So many diseases, so many things,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.512
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:50.053
very, very recently in America,

00:31:51.803 --> 00:31:56.261
because the exposure is coming up.

00:31:56.719 --> 00:31:59.677
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:05.261
who went there and captured

00:32:06.303 --> 00:32:09.095
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

00:32:09.303 --> 00:32:11.719
We have lost so many of them in America.

00:32:12.095 --> 00:32:17.220
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

00:32:17.719 --> 00:32:20.637
curses of the people whom they had killed,

00:32:21.053 --> 00:32:25.928
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

00:32:26.345 --> 00:32:28.969
Why should they have taken to wrong things

00:32:29.345 --> 00:32:32.803
as far as their personal life is concerned?

00:32:33.261 --> 00:32:35.428
Freedom was given to them

00:32:35.886 --> 00:32:39.928
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

00:32:40.387 --> 00:32:43.678
or to make a mess out of their lives.

00:32:44.261 --> 00:32:48.011
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

00:32:48.512 --> 00:32:50.803
Then the whole idea became collective.

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:53.886
When it became collective they found out that people

00:32:54.345 --> 00:32:57.053
like all those things that are destructive.

00:32:57.595 --> 00:32:59.595
So, we have Hollywood there,

00:33:00.053 --> 00:33:03.678
we have all such organizations and musicians

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:11.178
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

00:33:12.011 --> 00:33:19.303
which have formed groups and militant organizations

00:33:19.678 --> 00:33:26.928
which openly say that “We are that.”

00:33:27.303 --> 00:33:34.136
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:38.803
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

00:33:39.387 --> 00:33:43.595
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

00:33:44.095 --> 00:33:49.303
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

00:33:49.803 --> 00:33:52.261
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

00:33:52.595 --> 00:33:54.595
that this is a black magic organization,

00:33:54.969 --> 00:33:56.553
this is a witchcraft organization,

00:33:56.969 --> 00:34:00.136
openly they are registered there.

00:34:00.637 --> 00:34:03.844
So to such an extent they have gone;

00:34:04.303 --> 00:34:07.761
and accepted collectively.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:12.886
The reason is the punishment.

00:34:13.637 --> 00:34:19.011
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

00:34:19.512 --> 00:34:22.803
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:25.886
One must have real sympathy for them.

00:34:26.387 --> 00:34:30.886
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:36.261
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

00:34:36.678 --> 00:34:41.678
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.678
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:50.637
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

00:34:51.011 --> 00:34:56.761
into the hands of something else.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:02.178
So to establish Dharma in America,

00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:04.678
what can we do?

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:07.844
I’ve been to America at least ten times

00:35:08.261 --> 00:35:11.595
more than I’ve been to Russia

00:35:12.136 --> 00:35:19.261
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

00:35:19.553 --> 00:35:21.803
"You have lost your Dharma."

00:35:22.178 --> 00:35:23.677
But this will never appeal to them

00:35:24.011 --> 00:35:25.345
because they are very egoistical.

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:28.761
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.637
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

00:35:31.969 --> 00:35:35.470
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

00:35:35.886 --> 00:35:39.178
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.178
So it’s a difficult task in that country

00:35:42.595 --> 00:35:46.761
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.928
that this punishment you can only overcome

00:35:50.345 --> 00:35:52.595
if you become Sahaja yogis.

00:35:52.969 --> 00:35:56.637
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

00:35:57.095 --> 00:36:02.512
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

00:36:02.928 --> 00:36:05.512
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

00:36:05.886 --> 00:36:07.719
than any other country.

00:36:08.178 --> 00:36:11.678
My concern for America is for the same reason.

00:36:12.261 --> 00:36:14.678
I’m not saying so much about South America

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.553
but more about the North America.

00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:21.053
But even in South America, what I found is

00:36:21.595 --> 00:36:29.637
that it is a kind of a nation

00:36:30.261 --> 00:36:37.677
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.387
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:47.011
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

00:36:47.428 --> 00:36:50.969
They are following the footsteps of North America.

00:36:51.428 --> 00:36:54.303
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

00:36:54.677 --> 00:36:56.136
I mean, imagine openly on the street

00:36:56.553 --> 00:36:58.428
doing Halloween nonsense.

00:36:58.803 --> 00:37:00.345
So they are following carnival.

00:37:00.761 --> 00:37:03.719
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

00:37:04.095 --> 00:37:07.719
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

00:37:08.095 --> 00:37:09.220
from all over the places.

00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:13.886
From Australia people are coming down.

00:37:15.178 --> 00:37:20.470
All this is working against them very much.

00:37:20.844 --> 00:37:24.178
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

00:37:24.678 --> 00:37:31.303
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

00:37:31.803 --> 00:37:37.928
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:41.761
Openly.

00:37:42.637 --> 00:37:46.678
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.178
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:53.053
Their politicians are corrupt.

00:37:53.428 --> 00:37:56.886
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

00:37:57.303 --> 00:38:00.220
so much of black magic. Openly that.

00:38:00.677 --> 00:38:06.678
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

00:38:07.178 --> 00:38:12.136
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

00:38:12.637 --> 00:38:16.095
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

00:38:16.595 --> 00:38:19.677
So they go to church, they do everything

00:38:20.095 --> 00:38:26.095
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

00:38:26.677 --> 00:38:30.677
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:36.303
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

00:38:36.844 --> 00:38:40.345
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

00:38:40.969 --> 00:38:43.136
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

00:38:43.595 --> 00:38:46.470
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

00:38:46.928 --> 00:38:52.053
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.512
They indulge into black magic too much.

00:38:55.886 --> 00:38:58.677
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:01.512
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

00:39:01.928 --> 00:39:05.553
But so much it is developed in South America

00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:09.095
that it is impossible to understand that

00:39:09.678 --> 00:39:12.303
how they have accepted this nonsense

00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:16.095
so easily to curse themselves.

00:39:16.553 --> 00:39:19.303
Now, we have to understand that these problems

00:39:19.637 --> 00:39:24.969
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:39:25.761 --> 00:39:31.678
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

00:39:32.345 --> 00:39:37.470
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

00:39:38.136 --> 00:39:45.677
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

00:39:46.136 --> 00:39:49.261
which is talking about Dharma,

00:39:49.677 --> 00:39:55.011
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

00:39:55.886 --> 00:39:59.387
Now those people who are aggressive,

00:39:59.886 --> 00:40:01.678
who talk in an aggressive manner,

00:40:02.095 --> 00:40:07.969
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

00:40:08.678 --> 00:40:12.553
are the people who are right-sided.

00:40:12.969 --> 00:40:17.553
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

00:40:17.928 --> 00:40:22.095
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:26.677
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

00:40:27.011 --> 00:40:28.387
This man is so rude.

00:40:28.761 --> 00:40:33.678
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

00:40:34.136 --> 00:40:38.220
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

00:40:38.678 --> 00:40:40.928
So those people who are right-sided

00:40:41.345 --> 00:40:43.886
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

00:40:44.303 --> 00:40:45.553
any wrong they have done,

00:40:45.928 --> 00:40:49.303
any murder they have done, by their talk.

00:40:49.803 --> 00:40:54.637
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

00:40:55.011 --> 00:40:59.178
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

00:40:59.595 --> 00:41:02.761
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.220
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

00:41:06.595 --> 00:41:09.637
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:14.261
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

00:41:14.678 --> 00:41:19.220
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

00:41:19.678 --> 00:41:23.595
and then we try to justify it by talking,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.345
wriggling out of it.

00:41:26.678 --> 00:41:33.220
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

00:41:33.677 --> 00:41:37.220
have come out of it by just talking,

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:41.053
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

00:41:41.553 --> 00:41:44.512
That also is with all human beings,

00:41:44.928 --> 00:41:47.969
they have this capacity to say something

00:41:48.387 --> 00:41:52.637
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:55.261
But it is never realized by them

00:41:55.719 --> 00:42:00.387
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

00:42:01.637 --> 00:42:05.136
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

00:42:05.677 --> 00:42:08.553
because Shri Krishna is finished.

00:42:09.095 --> 00:42:14.470
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

00:42:15.095 --> 00:42:20.011
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:25.095
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:30.136
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

00:42:30.719 --> 00:42:38.011
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.928
a culture, a style, a behavior

00:42:43.387 --> 00:42:46.178
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

00:42:46.595 --> 00:42:51.761
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

00:42:52.178 --> 00:42:56.719
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.261
The person who listens to you,

00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:08.303
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

00:43:08.761 --> 00:43:13.053
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

00:43:13.512 --> 00:43:18.844
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

00:43:19.428 --> 00:43:21.387
It should not be aggressive, at all,

00:43:21.803 --> 00:43:24.761
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

00:43:25.261 --> 00:43:29.136
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

00:43:29.637 --> 00:43:34.220
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

00:43:34.595 --> 00:43:37.178
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

00:43:37.595 --> 00:43:41.345
So in no way one should hurt.

00:43:41.886 --> 00:43:46.553
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

00:43:46.844 --> 00:43:50.512
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

00:43:50.844 --> 00:43:57.095
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:02.095
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

00:44:02.512 --> 00:44:06.303
you can express your madhurya.

00:44:06.803 --> 00:44:11.928
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

00:44:12.345 --> 00:44:14.136
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

00:44:14.553 --> 00:44:16.220
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

00:44:16.677 --> 00:44:18.428
So they use their hands in such a way

00:44:18.803 --> 00:44:22.512
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

00:44:22.928 --> 00:44:25.178
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:27.178
the way they use their hands.

00:44:27.595 --> 00:44:30.512
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:33.928
that it should create madhurya.

00:44:34.387 --> 00:44:39.512
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:43.303
where people, they have to express their love

00:44:43.678 --> 00:44:48.428
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

00:44:48.844 --> 00:44:51.387
The whole expression is so sweet,

00:44:51.803 --> 00:44:58.053
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.512
So they don’t know how to express it.

00:45:00.886 --> 00:45:05.220
So they just put their hands like this.

00:45:05.677 --> 00:45:07.844
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:12.470
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:18.261
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

00:45:18.677 --> 00:45:26.303
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

00:45:26.637 --> 00:45:29.345
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:34.303
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

00:45:34.761 --> 00:45:40.011
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

00:45:40.428 --> 00:45:45.595
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

00:45:46.053 --> 00:45:49.220
So in their behavior, in their talking,

00:45:49.678 --> 00:45:53.345
how they express themselves.

00:45:53.844 --> 00:45:55.553
You can use the same eyes

00:45:55.969 --> 00:45:58.011
for showing your temper and getting angry.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.261
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

00:46:01.677 --> 00:46:05.136
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:11.844
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

00:46:12.345 --> 00:46:16.677
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

00:46:17.178 --> 00:46:23.303
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:30.595
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

00:46:31.011 --> 00:46:34.178
Like when I went to, went to England first,

00:46:34.677 --> 00:46:37.512
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

00:46:37.886 --> 00:46:39.969
But when I went there newly they said,

00:46:40.303 --> 00:46:42.387
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

00:46:42.678 --> 00:46:45.387
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:49.095
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:52.928
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

00:46:53.345 --> 00:46:56.470
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

00:46:56.803 --> 00:47:01.261
is not something, proper expression.”

00:47:01.678 --> 00:47:03.678
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

00:47:04.053 --> 00:47:07.136
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

00:47:07.553 --> 00:47:09.470
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

00:47:09.803 --> 00:47:11.136
automatically he shows his tongue.

00:47:11.512 --> 00:47:17.595
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

00:47:17.969 --> 00:47:21.136
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:24.678
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

00:47:25.011 --> 00:47:28.136
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:34.761
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.886
or to make an expression out of your nose.

00:47:40.261 --> 00:47:41.678
Also people do it like this, you see,

00:47:42.053 --> 00:47:44.969
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.011
All these things, expressions, are coming

00:47:48.512 --> 00:47:55.136
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

00:47:55.677 --> 00:47:58.928
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

00:47:59.428 --> 00:48:05.387
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

00:48:05.844 --> 00:48:09.011
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

00:48:09.428 --> 00:48:13.844
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:18.345
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

00:48:18.678 --> 00:48:21.803
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

00:48:22.261 --> 00:48:26.220
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:30.136
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

00:48:30.637 --> 00:48:35.053
Then it soothes down and also you develop

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:38.220
the soothing quality of the greenery.

00:48:38.677 --> 00:48:41.303
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

00:48:41.719 --> 00:48:42.969
how it soothes your eyes.”

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:46.969
In the same way you should try to soothe

00:48:47.761 --> 00:48:50.220
the other person when you talk to that person.

00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:52.178
The person must melt.

00:48:52.553 --> 00:48:56.470
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

00:48:56.886 --> 00:48:58.053
that person will never melt.

00:48:58.387 --> 00:49:02.512
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

00:49:03.011 --> 00:49:06.844
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

00:49:07.303 --> 00:49:12.095
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

00:49:12.512 --> 00:49:16.553
how He beautifully managed to say things

00:49:16.928 --> 00:49:23.178
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

00:49:23.969 --> 00:49:27.512
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

00:49:27.844 --> 00:49:34.011
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:36.345
But there are two types of diplomacies:

00:49:36.719 --> 00:49:39.220
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:44.345
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

00:49:44.719 --> 00:49:48.719
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.428
to know what is diplomacy.

00:49:52.844 --> 00:49:56.011
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

00:49:56.428 --> 00:49:59.678
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

00:50:00.136 --> 00:50:03.136
in such a genuine manner.

00:50:03.595 --> 00:50:06.345
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

00:50:06.719 --> 00:50:09.178
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

00:50:09.553 --> 00:50:12.595
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

00:50:13.011 --> 00:50:15.719
not possible if you are angry.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.178
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

00:50:20.637 --> 00:50:21.969
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

00:50:22.303 --> 00:50:25.387
I went to meet him and he was very angry

00:50:25.803 --> 00:50:27.512
because he could not stop the rain.

00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:29.303
He was supposed to stop the rain.

00:50:29.677 --> 00:50:31.261
And I was all drenched.

00:50:31.637 --> 00:50:33.345
And he was so angry and he said that

00:50:33.677 --> 00:50:35.928
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:38.844
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

00:50:39.053 --> 00:50:41.136
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

00:50:41.637 --> 00:50:44.844
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:50:45.178 --> 00:50:46.011
You are all drenched.”

00:50:46.345 --> 00:50:48.886
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.512
and you bought a sari for Me.

00:50:50.803 --> 00:50:52.677
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

00:50:53.053 --> 00:50:55.136
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

00:50:55.637 --> 00:51:00.095
The whole thing finished off.

00:51:00.678 --> 00:51:03.886
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

00:51:04.428 --> 00:51:07.220
This is how we have to melt people.

00:51:07.678 --> 00:51:12.886
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

00:51:13.261 --> 00:51:17.053
with his intellect or by temper or anything

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:23.387
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

00:51:23.886 --> 00:51:26.220
by your good words, by your sweet words,

00:51:26.637 --> 00:51:28.470
by your forgiving nature.

00:51:28.886 --> 00:51:33.553
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

00:51:33.928 --> 00:51:36.677
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

00:51:37.136 --> 00:51:38.678
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

00:51:39.178 --> 00:51:41.178
It’s the reaction of the another person

00:51:41.595 --> 00:51:43.678
which is important to be seen.

00:51:44.053 --> 00:51:47.595
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

00:51:47.969 --> 00:51:52.761
is to talk to others and melt them away.

00:51:53.095 --> 00:51:57.220
I hope in America people develop this quality

00:51:57.678 --> 00:52:01.553
and try to improve relations with each other.

00:52:01.886 --> 00:52:04.886
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

00:52:05.345 --> 00:52:06.928
They get very friendly with you.

00:52:07.303 --> 00:52:08.928
You give them any number of presents,

00:52:09.303 --> 00:52:11.969
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

00:52:12.387 --> 00:52:14.345
You call them for dinner, anything,

00:52:14.761 --> 00:52:17.512
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

00:52:17.928 --> 00:52:19.844
but they will never call you for dinner.

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:22.719
You see, they are very friendly as long

00:52:23.095 --> 00:52:24.637
as you are doing anything for them.

00:52:25.053 --> 00:52:28.595
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

00:52:29.011 --> 00:52:32.595
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

00:52:32.886 --> 00:52:36.220
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

00:52:36.719 --> 00:52:39.637
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

00:52:40.053 --> 00:52:43.428
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

00:52:43.803 --> 00:52:47.678
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

00:52:48.095 --> 00:52:53.512
that he can understand what is goodness.

00:52:54.178 --> 00:52:56.969
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:02.053
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:05.345
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

00:53:05.803 --> 00:53:08.803
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

00:53:09.303 --> 00:53:13.095
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

00:53:13.512 --> 00:53:16.303
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:19.220
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

00:53:19.637 --> 00:53:20.719
on the left side.

00:53:21.053 --> 00:53:23.345
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

00:53:23.677 --> 00:53:26.053
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

00:53:26.512 --> 00:53:28.011
Their whole behavior is that

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:30.553
as if they have done something wrong

00:53:30.969 --> 00:53:33.844
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

00:53:34.303 --> 00:53:38.886
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

00:53:39.345 --> 00:53:41.928
We are all Sahaja yogis.

00:53:42.345 --> 00:53:45.011
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

00:53:45.387 --> 00:53:47.136
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

00:53:47.553 --> 00:53:49.387
So this guilt has to go away.

00:53:49.761 --> 00:53:54.886
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

00:53:55.345 --> 00:53:58.428
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

00:53:58.844 --> 00:54:01.345
But we cannot see.

00:54:01.719 --> 00:54:05.053
We cannot witness what’s wrong

00:54:05.512 --> 00:54:07.470
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

00:54:07.761 --> 00:54:11.677
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:14.178
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:16.512
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

00:54:16.928 --> 00:54:18.595
But we do not want to face it.

00:54:18.969 --> 00:54:23.095
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:27.011
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

00:54:27.428 --> 00:54:29.387
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

00:54:29.719 --> 00:54:31.595
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

00:54:31.928 --> 00:54:35.761
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

00:54:36.136 --> 00:54:38.553
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

00:54:38.844 --> 00:54:41.011
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:44.844
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

00:54:45.261 --> 00:54:48.803
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

00:54:49.303 --> 00:54:51.261
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

00:54:51.553 --> 00:54:53.178
what are the problems are of the guilt,

00:54:53.553 --> 00:54:57.886
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:01.261
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

00:55:01.678 --> 00:55:07.053
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.886
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

00:55:10.345 --> 00:55:12.387
We know we are no good,” this, that.

00:55:12.844 --> 00:55:16.011
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

00:55:19.303 --> 00:55:21.595
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:24.136
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

00:55:24.553 --> 00:55:27.053
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

00:55:27.512 --> 00:55:29.261
And it was really very sweet of him.

00:55:29.719 --> 00:55:33.303
So then one journalist came and we told him.

00:55:33.637 --> 00:55:35.761
And now I think they are doing something about it.

00:55:36.095 --> 00:55:38.678
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

00:55:39.178 --> 00:55:43.678
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

00:55:44.011 --> 00:55:47.261
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

00:55:47.677 --> 00:55:50.220
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

00:55:50.677 --> 00:55:52.512
They said, “That time is over now.

00:55:52.844 --> 00:55:56.095
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

00:55:56.470 --> 00:56:00.470
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

00:56:00.803 --> 00:56:04.512
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

00:56:04.844 --> 00:56:07.095
Never talked of their past, of their governments

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:12.011
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:15.553
They were not concerned. They were above it.

00:56:15.969 --> 00:56:18.261
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

00:56:18.595 --> 00:56:20.095
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

00:56:20.512 --> 00:56:23.136
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

00:56:23.553 --> 00:56:26.470
about their problems or anything.

00:56:26.886 --> 00:56:28.678
They think, “Our problems are solved.

00:56:29.095 --> 00:56:30.844
We are now realized souls.

00:56:31.261 --> 00:56:34.053
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:37.678
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:38.178 --> 00:56:40.136
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

00:56:40.512 --> 00:56:42.928
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

00:56:43.345 --> 00:56:46.678
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

00:56:47.053 --> 00:56:49.136
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

00:56:49.553 --> 00:56:52.261
Just throw it or I burn it off.

00:56:52.719 --> 00:56:55.220
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:59.387
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

00:56:59.678 --> 00:57:02.928
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

00:57:03.303 --> 00:57:06.886
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

00:57:07.303 --> 00:57:10.677
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

00:57:11.053 --> 00:57:13.011
But still he remembers his past more,

00:57:13.428 --> 00:57:14.969
so anybody who passes by he says,

00:57:15.303 --> 00:57:19.303
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

00:57:19.678 --> 00:57:21.677
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

00:57:22.053 --> 00:57:24.136
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:57:24.595 --> 00:57:29.428
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

00:57:29.844 --> 00:57:31.512
and it can act through anyone.

00:57:31.844 --> 00:57:34.844
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.553
act through anyone.

00:57:36.844 --> 00:57:40.136
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:43.387
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

00:57:43.844 --> 00:57:47.470
you become vulnerable to black magic.

00:57:47.928 --> 00:57:50.553
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:53.886
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

00:57:54.428 --> 00:57:57.969
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

00:57:58.387 --> 00:58:00.886
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

00:58:01.303 --> 00:58:02.969
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

00:58:03.387 --> 00:58:06.261
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

00:58:06.595 --> 00:58:08.512
or something like that. They put ideas.

00:58:08.886 --> 00:58:11.178
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.428
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

00:58:14.719 --> 00:58:15.678
and then the guilt starts.

00:58:16.053 --> 00:58:17.844
Instead of doing something for that person

00:58:18.303 --> 00:58:21.136
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

00:58:21.595 --> 00:58:24.677
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

00:58:25.011 --> 00:58:30.928
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:34.095
or being affected by black magic.

00:58:34.553 --> 00:58:38.261
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

00:58:38.677 --> 00:58:43.678
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.761
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

00:58:48.178 --> 00:58:50.261
what He’s said always, I always feel,

00:58:50.678 --> 00:58:57.678
and that His main work is through our brain.

00:58:58.178 --> 00:59:02.220
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

00:59:02.719 --> 00:59:04.969
And as Shiva works through our heart,

00:59:05.345 --> 00:59:07.178
He works through our brain.

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:13.261
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

00:59:13.677 --> 00:59:17.261
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:21.387
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

00:59:21.761 --> 00:59:23.637
But the greatest thing that happens,

00:59:23.969 --> 00:59:25.844
that integration takes place in your brain.

00:59:26.261 --> 00:59:28.136
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

00:59:28.595 --> 00:59:30.470
and your brain wants another thing.

00:59:30.886 --> 00:59:32.303
The integration takes place.

00:59:32.637 --> 00:59:34.220
And when that integration takes place

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:37.886
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:59:38.345 --> 00:59:42.677
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

00:59:43.011 --> 00:59:44.969
you just become dharmic.

00:59:45.345 --> 00:59:47.303
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

00:59:47.678 --> 00:59:50.886
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

00:59:51.345 --> 00:59:55.512
which normally is used for rationality,

00:59:55.969 --> 00:59:57.844
for justifying all that is wrong,

00:59:58.303 --> 01:00:02.595
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

01:00:02.969 --> 01:00:06.470
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

01:00:06.886 --> 01:00:11.761
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:21.303
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

01:00:22.136 --> 01:00:31.512
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

01:00:31.969 --> 01:00:38.553
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:45.053
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

01:00:45.637 --> 01:00:50.345
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

01:00:50.844 --> 01:00:56.345
Virata is expressed.

01:00:56.761 --> 01:00:58.928
Then you are amazed at yourself.

01:00:59.303 --> 01:01:01.678
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

01:01:02.011 --> 01:01:04.678
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

01:01:05.136 --> 01:01:06.761
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

01:01:07.095 --> 01:01:10.053
suddenly you become a prophet.

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.637
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

01:01:13.969 --> 01:01:19.178
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:23.761
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.803
So this is what one has to realize,

01:01:27.178 --> 01:01:30.677
that after realization a person gets ideas

01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:34.637
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

01:01:34.886 --> 01:01:36.637
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

01:01:37.095 --> 01:01:41.387
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

01:01:41.761 --> 01:01:46.637
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

01:01:47.095 --> 01:01:53.928
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

01:01:54.595 --> 01:01:59.095
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.470
how your brain has changed its ways.

01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:07.553
The upside brain has become normal.

01:02:07.969 --> 01:02:14.677
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

01:02:15.136 --> 01:02:21.136
every day and see for yourself how the expression

01:02:21.595 --> 01:02:26.761
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.220
and is acting in your life.

01:02:30.637 --> 01:02:34.428
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

01:02:34.886 --> 01:02:38.886
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

01:02:39.261 --> 01:02:41.595
and others will never doubt you.

01:02:41.886 --> 01:02:44.178
May God bless you.
