1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,489
I again see today some new faces

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:08,849
who have come here,

3
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:15,175
and I have to explain again today,

4
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:20,205
for the first time to them,

5
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:25,752
what is Sahaja Yoga,

6
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:30,733
which has been promised in various scriptures

7
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:37,005
that you have to get your Second Birth.

8
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,526
You have to be born again.

9
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:43,328
It is said. Christ has said too,

10
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,818
the same thing.

11
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,860
But people have not been able to ponder

12
00:00:51,866 --> 00:00:58,930
on this subject: what does that mean – our Second Birth?

13
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:03,172
Are we not already born as human beings?

14
00:01:03,172 --> 00:01:06,452
We are born

15
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,914
but the human beings, which are born,

16
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:12,092
are told that you are to be 'born again.'

17
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,874
Now what are we going to do?

18
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:19,884
So they asked, "Are we to enter
into our mother's womb again?

19
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:23,564
And are to be born again?"

20
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,630
He said, :You'll be born of the
Holy Ghost, of the Holy Spirit."

21
00:01:30,644 --> 00:01:36,640
The Holy Ghost that He talked
about is the Kundalini within us.

22
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,151
She is the part of the Holy Ghost,

23
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,573
or you can say the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

24
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:48,773
which exists as all-pervading power.

25
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:54,227
Actually the all-pervading power of Divine Love

26
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,244
is the love of Holy Ghost or Her aura.

27
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:06,774
This is reflected within us, as the power of desire

28
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:17,995
as shown in the picture in
the triangular bone of sacrum

29
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:21,305
and coils itself in three and a half rounds.

30
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:32,826
If you could ask the child to play there,
it would be better. Whose child is this?

31
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:41,165
Children don't understand all, they
need not understand. They are all right.

32
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:45,085
They're realised. They're enjoying themselves.

33
00:02:53,376 --> 00:02:58,817
This force, which is called as residual force,

34
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,597
is the desire of God,

35
00:03:02,575 --> 00:03:13,035
which resides within us in a dormant way.

36
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:17,368
We actually do not know what is the desire of God.

37
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:18,896
We have our own conclusions,

38
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,256
our own conceptions,

39
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:23,438
our own ideas that I am doing the work of God.

40
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,219
But you are not yet connected with God,

41
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,219
how can you do the work of God?

42
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,704
There is no way of really establishing

43
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:33,204
any actual rapport with God,

44
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:36,159
and how can you say that you are related to God

45
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,659
or you are doing the work of God?

46
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,317
It’s all right that God is looking after you,

47
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:44,227
He is managing you,

48
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,889
He has given you this life, is correct.

49
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:51,841
But there is no way of finding God

50
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,911
in your conscious mind.

51
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:56,397
It's just your mental activity

52
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,897
maybe your ego,

53
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:02,363
which says, "I am God."

54
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:06,685
Some people say, "I like it!"

55
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:09,187
But why do you like it?

56
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,295
Because I think, I like it.

57
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:15,165
Then, why, whatever you think is your own.

58
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,835
It is not God’s,

59
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:26,565
how do you say, with such cock-sure attitude

60
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,805
that you are connected with God?

61
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,001
Then they will start discussing about it.

62
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,483
They sit down and talk about it

63
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:39,183
Yesterday only we had a very funny visitor in Paris

64
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:43,383
and he started it like a tape record

65
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:47,193
and he just started telling Me what he thinks.

66
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,653
But your thinking is your own imagination.

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,140
There is no actual experience in it.

68
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:56,606
There is no actuality.

69
00:04:56,616 --> 00:05:00,546
I said, "This is fanaticism."

70
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:03,033
When you start thinking about something

71
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:07,624
and accept it as real, then it is fanaticism,

72
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:08,634
of any kind.

73
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:13,446
You can be a football fanatic.

74
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:16,206
You think that a particular person must win.

75
00:05:16,206 --> 00:05:18,706
It becomes sort of your thinking.

76
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:21,206
Then that person must win, if he does not win

77
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:24,656
then you are going to kill everybody else.

78
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,776
If you go a little further with it,

79
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:35,678
you think that you are a great benevolent person.

80
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:37,488
Then whatever you think,

81
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,848
you feel that this is the thing

82
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,838
that is going to bring benevolence to people.

83
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:43,928
but what is the proof?

84
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:50,642
That what you think is the thing wanted by God.

85
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:51,868
All your thinking

86
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:58,528
is based either on your conditioning,

87
00:05:58,518 --> 00:05:59,648
whatever you have read,

88
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,499
if you are born a Christian all your thinking

89
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,249
will be Christian thinking means church's

90
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,738
thinking not God's thinking.

91
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:09,219
If you are a Hindu, you will think like a Hindu

92
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,719
of a temple or some sort of a Guru

93
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,219
or somebody who has taught you something.

94
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,940
If you are a Muslim you might become Khomeini

95
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,479
anything is possible!

96
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,029
Are we going in the same direction

97
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,910
with our thinking?

98
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:28,900
Or are we related to God?

99
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:31,890
First, relationship with God must be established.

100
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,390
That is extremely important

101
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,890
before we talk of God

102
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,653
because all our thinking is our conditioning

103
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:44,572
or else our imagination.

104
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:45,902
There are some people who met Me

105
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,022
they said they have met God.

106
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,522
I said, "Really?  How, how does he look like?"

107
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,582
"Oh, I met him on the street."

108
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,632
I said, "Very good."

109
00:06:53,632 --> 00:06:56,132
And somebody says, "I am Christ."

110
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:58,632
Somebody says, "I am Krishna."

111
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:02,877
But what is the proof?

112
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,372
I mean, supposing I say this is gold.

113
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:07,627
Then gold has a density.

114
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:09,877
You can find out whether it is gold or silver

115
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:12,127
or something but you cannot just go on saying,

116
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,380
“I think it is gold." So it becomes gold, can it?

117
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,560
In the same way our faith,

118
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:24,680
because we think we have a belief in it,

119
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,740
is mythical – as far as you are concerned,

120
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,965
as far as anybody else is concerned.

121
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,480
Unless and until you give the proof of God,

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,655
nobody is going to believe in God any further,

123
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,375
I can tell you this much.

124
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,335
And this is the reason

125
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,395
another mythical stuff is coming up

126
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:40,875
is that there is no God.

127
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,845
This is another myth.

128
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,351
Either to believe that you are connected with God

129
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,851
is equally mythical as to say there is no God.

130
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,535
Because if you have not met Him

131
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,351
how do you say, there is not? There may be,

132
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:57,081
may not be – is a better situation.

133
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,587
Just to denounce Him that there is no God,

134
00:07:59,587 --> 00:08:02,087
is another myth.

135
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,587
We some how or other managed to live with a myth.

136
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:08,774
It’s very comfortable to live with myth.

137
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,524
It’s a comfortable life; we do not want to

138
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,264
give up our comforts.

139
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:14,394
As just now, I was telling someone

140
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,244
that a little shell contains a little oyster in it.

141
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:21,226
Now, the oyster doesn’t want to get out of the shell.

142
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:23,726
It’s quite comfortable.

143
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:27,594
And a little bit of a sand comes in

144
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:36,550
and it sat troubling the comfort of the oyster.

145
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:41,380
So, oyster takes out his saliva

146
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,150
goes round it, makes it softer,

147
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,080
puts it there, curls up a little bit of its body

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,896
and says, “Now I am comfortable now I'm

149
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,336
very satisfied, it’s all right.

150
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,316
The shell is the thing for me."

151
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,820
And that’s how we go on living with the shell

152
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,696
avoiding understanding

153
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:03,816
that this shell is not the thing we are seeking.

154
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:08,026
So, one has to get out of that
comfortable feeling one has.

155
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,540
If you have a house, very nice!

156
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,505
I’ve got children, very nice!

157
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,990
I’ve got a wife, I’ve got a car. It's all right.

158
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,615
I am very comfortable, I am very satisfied.

159
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,824
But then, certain calamities come in.

160
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:31,044
You are faced with them.

161
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,274
Problems come in

162
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,746
and then you think,

163
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,250
"I never waited for this.

164
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,766
It was most unexpected."

165
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:49,347
There are another set of people,

166
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:54,397
who think – who ‘think’, again!

167
00:09:54,406 --> 00:10:02,366
that they have to search God.

168
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:08,857
And that’s how they jump into sea.

169
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,027
They jump into fire,

170
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:11,997
they jump into water,

171
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,897
they jump into all kinds of things

172
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:19,088
without understanding what danger it entails.

173
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,548
So one side we have a comfortably coiled up

174
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,768
an oyster and another is an oyster

175
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:25,588
which is burnt up

176
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:33,555
which is either drowned or something.

177
00:10:33,568 --> 00:10:39,905
So what should a human being do?

178
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:44,445
He should be comfortable,

179
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,675
but all the time he should think that

180
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:50,955
“I have not yet met God, I must meet.

181
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:53,414
I have to watch and see,

182
00:10:53,424 --> 00:10:57,204
I have to understand."

183
00:10:57,204 --> 00:10:59,704
Oyster in the shell

184
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:03,608
is better sometimes

185
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:09,478
than the oyster, which is completely fried out.

186
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,978
But the oyster in the shell

187
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,478
will die its own death.

188
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,433
But there is a possibility about the oyster

189
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,933
which has come out that he might meet

190
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,883
something.

191
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:26,296
Because he is a seeker

192
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:29,716
God also looks after him,

193
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:33,786
God also wants to help.

194
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,226
If he could listen to his own unconscious,

195
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:39,296
he could work it out.

196
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:46,221
Sahaja Yoga is not a new thing.

197
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,461
Sahaja means ‘spontaneous’.

198
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,966
Everything that happens in life is spontaneous.

199
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,576
From amoeba to this stage, you have come

200
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:58,206
spontaneously, 'Sahaja,' born with you.

201
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:01,506
It is within you!

202
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:10,812
Gradually, as a seed sprouts into a flower

203
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,312
and then the fragrance starts emitting out

204
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:14,488
from the flower,

205
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:21,332
in the same way it is all built in you.

206
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:26,636
You don’t have to go anywhere, it is between

207
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:29,776
your own thinking

208
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:36,366
and your desiring, it resides.

209
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,256
You desire something

210
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:45,656
and you don’t think about it

211
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:48,732
that is the best way you can do.

212
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:51,232
We have two capacities within us,

213
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:55,779
one is to desire. With this left side,

214
00:12:55,793 --> 00:13:02,339
the deep blue coloured channel within us,

215
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:04,499
the desire.

216
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,459
It manifests outside

217
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:17,033
as left sympathetic nervous system,

218
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:21,773
which is our emotional side,

219
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:26,933
which is responsible for collecting all our past,

220
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:29,166
all our experiences, all our conditioning.

221
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,143
This is the psyche about which

222
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:35,622
the psychologists are worried.

223
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:38,812
So, we desire.

224
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:43,272
And the right side one, the yellow coloured line

225
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:47,302
represents the power by which we maintain

226
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,795
our physical being

227
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:55,749
and ultimately we start thinking.

228
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:59,699
Between these two resides

229
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,209
the power of our evolution.

230
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:06,235
So we have left side and right side

231
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,065
sympathetic nervous system,

232
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,569
manifested in the gross, and in the centre

233
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,365
is the parasympathetic.

234
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:15,415
Parasympathetic is a system

235
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,909
which shows how much we have evolved so far.

236
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:20,652
How much we have achieved so far up to

237
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:23,532
human level.

238
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:26,055
Only human beings think that

239
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:32,571
they have to achieve God, not animals.

240
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,590
They have reached that state that they think

241
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:36,094
that they have to achieve God,

242
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:39,734
they desire that they have to achieve God.

243
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:45,796
There is a gap between their achievement

244
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:48,736
and there is the desire.

245
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:52,842
This is to be crossed.

246
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:58,762
But their desire cannot work it out,

247
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:03,082
only their desire can call for the help from God,

248
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,582
and the God’s desire is within you

249
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:10,202
in this triangular bone lying dormant.

250
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:15,562
This God’s desire is called as Kundalini.

251
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:18,072
That God’s desire has to rise within you,

252
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:23,185
and it is He who has to give you the Second Birth

253
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:25,195
or you can say that the She, the Mother,

254
00:15:25,205 --> 00:15:28,513
has to give you the Second Birth.

255
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:30,627
This is the Holy Ghost

256
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,143
about which Christ could not talk

257
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:36,737
to those mad people who really crucified Him.

258
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:41,417
They were mad that they thought that Christ

259
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:46,809
was blasphemous.

260
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:48,349
Just think of it!

261
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,439
And today we have churches and people,

262
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,939
and this and that.

263
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,069
When He lived nobody accepted Him,

264
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:02,259
nobody recognised Him

265
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,209
When He came, they talked of Moses,

266
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:08,599
Abraham.

267
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:11,099
It is very nice to handle Christ,

268
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,329
better talk about them, so that  we don't have

269
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:15,829
to face reality.

270
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:18,329
Because if they had recognised Christ

271
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,001
then Christ would have said, "All right

272
00:16:19,948 --> 00:16:22,078
if you are recognising Me, then get your

273
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,108
Realisation

274
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,505
and understand yourself.”

275
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:31,525
They where not prepared for this.

276
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,755
Only twelve people somehow – you see

277
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,241
managed to be there, somehow.

278
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:42,691
They would not accept Him either.

279
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,761
Till He was resurrected

280
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,861
then they accepted Him, in a way.

281
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,531
And then, what are you going to do

282
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,191
but to create a myth around it.

283
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,759
And to say that, “Of course,

284
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,989
we believed in Christ.”

285
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:02,205
Now what, which Christ did you believe in?

286
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:05,435
Because that Christ, whom you had to face

287
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:08,385
you did not face.

288
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,125
And now you live in imaginary world,

289
00:17:12,135 --> 00:17:14,875
you have your own paradise about it.

290
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:17,605
Where does He live within us?

291
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:23,591
Has He created any position within us?

292
00:17:23,591 --> 00:17:26,391
Is there any meaning to His life,

293
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:30,791
which has left a permanent mark within us

294
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,291
Was He one of the
mile-stones within us?

295
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,261
If so – where does He reside within us?

296
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,219
How can we be connected to him?

297
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,569
Nobody made any exploration about it.

298
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,945
Again the comfortable shell started.

299
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,845
It has happened not once,

300
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:50,015
thousands of years it has been happening,

301
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:52,265
whenever an Incarnation came on this Earth

302
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:56,845
that’s how they behaved.

303
00:17:56,852 --> 00:18:00,182
When Rama came they said,
“We believe in Parashurama”,

304
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,652
when Krishna came they said,

305
00:18:01,638 --> 00:18:03,932
"We believe in Rama."

306
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:08,552
Same thing with Christ, with everyone.

307
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:11,048
But you better now recognise

308
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,638
and know yourself, and face it once for all,

309
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:17,658
the time has come.

310
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:20,639
How long are you going to live with your myths?

311
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:24,108
The time has come.

312
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:31,608
It has nothing to do with
East, West or North and South.

313
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:34,123
Most amazing is that in the West,

314
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:38,484
people are afraid that this is Eastern knowledge.

315
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:41,204
The other day only one lady who is a Realised Soul,

316
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:43,044
her son is a Realised Soul.

317
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:45,544
They said their teacher was very anxious

318
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:47,964
about my son, because he said, "Why are you

319
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:50,464
giving this Eastern knowledge to him?"

320
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,814
How can it be Eastern? It is universal knowledge

321
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:56,314
I said, "Why don't you go and ask the teacher

322
00:18:56,314 --> 00:19:01,179
was Christ born in England or in America?

323
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:05,959
His cross is even, you can find it

324
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:13,923
on the airport of London.

325
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,647
Because I think that Christ was an Englishman.

326
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,517
So it’s all right, he has to – poor thing

327
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,425
has to become an Englishman. What to do?

328
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,645
This knowledge cannot be limited to Indians

329
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,115
or to English or to anyone.

330
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:34,184
It is God’s knowledge, it is for everyone of you

331
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:39,155
it is your right to know.

332
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:43,465
All of you have got Kundalini.

333
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,965
You can see with your naked eyes its pulsation;

334
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,476
you can see its rising.

335
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,953
You can see its piercing through,

336
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:52,685
you can feel it, it throbbing here.

337
00:19:52,685 --> 00:19:56,050
You can see the piercing.

338
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,660
You can see, when it pierces through,

339
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,980
how you become actually collectively conscious.

340
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:05,780
You do become.

341
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,842
It’s a fact! And how can you avoid fact?

342
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,333
And why should you avoid?

343
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,923
Because reality is so beautiful,

344
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:19,223
why should we be afraid of facing the reality,

345
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:21,723
which is so beautiful.

346
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:25,233
There was a gentleman in Paris

347
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,733
who got his Realisation and two days he was

348
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,032
just laughing out of joy and he said,

349
00:20:30,032 --> 00:20:32,052
“I’ve never laughed all my life

350
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:34,192
as I have laughed now” and just out of joy

351
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,692
he was laughing;

352
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:39,552
so joyous. He said, "Mother let me laugh now

353
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,382
and enjoy myself, I'm really living."

354
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:44,107
Actually he told me that he never believed

355
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,137
in God, to begin with.

356
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,132
He thought he was a very rational being.

357
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:55,462
I said, rational beings are still half,

358
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,504
because they are dealing with something

359
00:20:57,504 --> 00:21:01,299
so limited, is rationality.

360
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,829
We have to cross these barriers of rationality,

361
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:11,354
and something is already within you,

362
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,854
God has placed within you because it is his

363
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:17,198
desire that you should know Him,

364
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:19,464
that His power should flow through you

365
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:23,094
and that you should be the citizen of His kingdom,

366
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:25,364
that He is your generous Father and He's

367
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:30,929
and He has made all these arrangements for you.

368
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:35,138
Now, 75% people sitting here are Realised Souls.

369
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:42,608
I’m so very happy, because I struggled
with six of them for four years.

370
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:47,878
It is such a remarkable thing

371
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,538
but it is very, very hard for people to believe

372
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,328
that you have to get an experience of God,

373
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,247
you have to feel Him within yourself.

374
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:06,197
As an actualisation, you have to
feel Him in your conscious mind.

375
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:09,297
Because if religion gets organised

376
00:22:09,297 --> 00:22:13,170
you also get beliefs organised.

377
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:16,837
Then, whatever they say becomes perfect;

378
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,755
blind leading the blind.

379
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,285
You cannot organise God, you cannot.

380
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:31,835
He will organise.

381
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:35,485
You cannot conceive Him.

382
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,785
He has to conceive you.

383
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:41,935
His Grace must come on you.

384
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:46,255
You have to ask for his Grace.

385
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:50,275
He has already placed His desire within you.

386
00:22:50,297 --> 00:22:55,265
And this desire resides as Kundalini.

387
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:59,656
You have heard so much about
Kundalini before also, I believe.

388
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:01,633
Maybe you must have read some horrible books,

389
00:23:01,643 --> 00:23:03,453
which are shown, to Me,

390
00:23:03,473 --> 00:23:05,623
that this Kundalini gives you jerks,

391
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,113
and you start jumping and you start making

392
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:11,428
noises and things like that.

393
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:13,913
At the very outset, I must tell you

394
00:23:13,913 --> 00:23:17,883
that it is the desire of God, which is your Mother.

395
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:23,687
And this Mother is your own Mother

396
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,973
You do not have

397
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,003
any other Mother but this Mother

398
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:32,507
and She does not have any child but you.

399
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:34,143
Do you think such a Mother

400
00:23:34,143 --> 00:23:37,263
who has been waiting to give you this rebirth

401
00:23:37,263 --> 00:23:41,273
would be in any way troublesome to you?

402
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:46,943
Even your physical mother bore all the pains
upon herself to give you birth.

403
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:52,786
Then why should this Mother try to trouble you?

404
00:23:52,786 --> 00:23:58,193
Then people asked Me, "Then how did
these people talk of these things?

405
00:23:58,193 --> 00:23:59,551
I mean you can talk of anything

406
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:02,941
if you want to befool people.

407
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,186
If you want to befool people, can’t you?

408
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:09,396
I mean, if you indulge into such a thing you
can. You can get possessed by somebody

409
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:14,165
also, that you start writing all these nonsensical things.

410
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:17,656
So many mythical things have been written

411
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:21,176
apart from that, those who write that Kundalini
gives you jerks and all that

412
00:24:21,206 --> 00:24:25,596
maybe the people, who were something like
villagers coming and touching the electricity

413
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:32,156
at a wrong point and getting a shock and maligning
the electricity, maybe the unauthorised people,

414
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:34,665
who did not know anything about Kundalini.

415
00:24:34,665 --> 00:24:40,225
For Kundalini can only be awakened by an authorised
person who is authorised by God.

416
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:47,746
not by theological college or by any Pandit
or by any Ayurveda school or anything.

417
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:51,186
Christ never went to any theological college.

418
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:59,246
It cannot be done by any such person

419
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:02,656
who says he will read books and raise the Kundalini.

420
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,176
It’s not the mechanism that works out that way.

421
00:25:05,176 --> 00:25:08,596
You cannot even sprout a seed by reading.

422
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:11,082
Can you?

423
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:15,006
You have done nothing living by reading.

424
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:22,327
How can you raise Kundalini by reading?

425
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:32,734
This is in your every day-to-day life we really
lack sometimes common sense.

426
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:40,753
We go and read something,

427
00:25:40,764 --> 00:25:47,193
we think by reading something we are going
to go to God,

428
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:52,685
or we then sit down and discuss about it.

429
00:25:52,682 --> 00:25:56,522
You cannot do anything by this reading, which
is just a dead thing!

430
00:25:56,542 --> 00:26:00,762
All your arguments, everything is dead.

431
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:04,906
It is not yet enlightened; otherwise every word
could be living.

432
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:06,826
That’s the Mantra.

433
00:26:06,842 --> 00:26:11,176
The word that is living is the Mantra.

434
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,460
These holy words,

435
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,980
if spoken by a person who is not enlightened

436
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,250
has no meaning at all.

437
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,620
If it is spoken by a person, who is enlightened,

438
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,850
because enlightenment
means he is related to God

439
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,330
and he can address to God

440
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,830
like you get connected.

441
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,975
All right, if it is done, done, nothing to worry.

442
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:43,484
Nothing to feel bad, if some people have been

443
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:45,984
very fanatically involved into it,

444
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:47,826
it doesn’t matter.

445
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:51,236
Makes no difference at all today, I feel.

446
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:53,456
All kinds of things, whatever are done are done

447
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,536
in the past, finished.

448
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:58,036
We have to get our Realisation.

449
00:26:58,036 --> 00:27:00,536
We have to actualise ourselves.

450
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,921
This is the main point.

451
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,791
We are seeking ourselves.

452
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,691
Unless and until you realise yourself

453
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,781
you don’t have to even believe in Me,

454
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:11,281
but you should not deny Me.

455
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:19,016
I would not like anybody to believe in Me, blindly,

456
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:24,695
because blind people cannot get it.

457
00:27:24,696 --> 00:27:27,849
But you should not be also closed

458
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:32,539
because closed people also cannot get it.

459
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:36,318
When you get it then you must believe,

460
00:27:36,316 --> 00:27:38,475
that is what is called as 'Shraddha.'

461
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:41,385
In Sanskrit language, there two things are;

462
00:27:41,396 --> 00:27:49,004
one is blind faith and another is Shraddha,

463
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:53,244
that is faith, pure faith.

464
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:57,324
But in English we have to use an adjective

465
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,704
that blind faith and faith.

466
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:02,056
But people are so confused that they forget

467
00:28:02,054 --> 00:28:03,626
the adjective of blind,

468
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:06,256
and they think my faith is... If your faith is that

469
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:11,730
one has to accept it.

470
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:15,826
But your faith should be such that it is based

471
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:22,114
on the truth.

472
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:28,074
Then you become an enlightened person.

473
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,937
After all God has made us into human beings,

474
00:28:30,941 --> 00:28:32,947
He has given us this nose, eyes, everything.

475
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:35,447
We have done nothing about it.

476
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:40,750
And if He has made us for a purpose, He is going
to connect us, He is going to do it.

477
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:41,904
It’s His job

478
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:46,034
If He does not do it, He will have no meaning,
His creation will have no meaning.

479
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,374
It is His job!

480
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:57,877
And besides that somebody else wants to do
it for you, why should you worry?

481
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,400
Once you get it, you can do it, too.

482
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:09,550
Like one light enlightened can
enlighten another light, you can do it.

483
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:13,880
Today I wanted to talk a little bit,

484
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,400
because 75 % are Sahaja Yogis, who are Realised
Souls and who know Sahaja Yoga, they have

485
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:22,890
given Realisation to so many, they have cured
people and I mean they are just there.

486
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:30,458
And I was very happy that in Paris so many
of them achieved their Nirvikalpa,

487
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,910
which is... we call as the Doubtless Awareness.

488
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:39,520
The first state is the Thoughtless Awareness.

489
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:44,340
Awareness means, 'Enlightened
Awareness,' you can say,

490
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:50,749
'Samadhi' is the one where your awareness
becomes enlightened.

491
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:54,936
The first state is of Thoughtless Awareness.

492
00:29:54,951 --> 00:29:58,846
And then you jump into your Realisation,

493
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:03,236
but still the state is not established.

494
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:11,001
You mature then as Doubtless Awareness,

495
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:17,003
and this Doubtless Awareness is a state, is not
a thing. “Now I have no doubts about Sahaja

496
00:30:17,013 --> 00:30:21,433
Yoga”, that’s not the way. It's a state,

497
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:27,763
where the rhythm of these vibrations,
or the rhythm of these radiations

498
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:32,329
achieve a certain depth and a rhythm,

499
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:39,196
which then you yourself start seeing that these
doubts are something separate and you build

500
00:30:39,206 --> 00:30:46,526
up your own reserve against them. It's not
mental state, it is the state of the being.

501
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:55,017
You can say a seed becoming a fruit

502
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,520
and maturing,

503
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,612
or you can say a flower becoming a fruit

504
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:04,642
and then the fruit maturing.

505
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,836
In this way, first you get your Self Realisation

506
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:10,336
and you get your Thoughtless Awareness.

507
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,516
And then you get your Doubtless Awareness.

508
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,896
But people who are not complicated so much,

509
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:19,106
uncomplicated people, simple people,

510
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,046
PART OF SHRI MATAJI'S TALK IS MISSING

511
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:24,537
chakras are alright,  or not you start verifying it

512
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,317
through your brain.

513
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:29,157
You go round and round and round.

514
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:32,657
That's why the first thing you get is...

515
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:38,150
your attention gets enlightened.

516
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:42,690
You put your attention to someone and you
know about that person on your fingers.

517
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:48,090
You can feel their centres and then you know
through decoding what centres.

518
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:54,320
Supposing somebody is having a heart-attack
or something you can feel it on this finger,

519
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:59,317
a heat, or a kind of a spasm,
sometimes and sometimes numbness.

520
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:04,636
If a person is going to die, you feel a numbness
in all your fingers. There are many things

521
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:09,144
which decode it. Apart from physical
you have got also emotional problems

522
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:14,404
which can be found out. The left side suggest
the emotional problem and the right side

523
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:16,898
the physical and the mental problem.

524
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:19,491
If a person is egoistical,

525
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:24,689
if his ego is hurt, anyway if there's a problem
with his ego somehow or other

526
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:30,494
in any way, then you get this
finger catching very much.

527
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:34,284
But after getting Realisation, you
don't feel bad if somebody says,

528
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:36,782
“Mother, my Agnya here is catching.”

529
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:39,054
All right, you say it, you don’t feel bad about it.

530
00:32:39,032 --> 00:32:41,039
You say, "All right, clear it out!"

531
00:32:41,035 --> 00:32:45,489
This centre is that of Christ.

532
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,985
Even many people who call themselves Christians

533
00:32:47,985 --> 00:32:51,989
have the same Agnya as the Jews
have and as the Muslims have.

534
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,929
One because they are unauthorised

535
00:32:55,925 --> 00:33:00,007
that’s why Christ is angry, another
because they are criticising Christ.

536
00:33:00,017 --> 00:33:04,637
Both ways it is just the same.

537
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:10,067
Christ wants, or anyone of them, they want
that you should realise them, you should feel

538
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:15,217
them, you should know them.

539
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:24,277
Today specially for the Sahaja Yogis I
wanted to discuss the right side very much,

540
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:31,691
because so far, we have not dealt with it very
much. Normally we got people who were

541
00:33:31,691 --> 00:33:34,671
on the left side, on the emotional problem.

542
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:40,273
The right side is called also as Prana Shakti,

543
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:44,658
means the vital power of life.

544
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:48,598
And the left side is called as Mana Shakti.

545
00:33:48,604 --> 00:33:51,104
Now this Prana Shakti,

546
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:56,335
which is on the right-hand side...

547
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,820
What's happened?

548
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,469
There's some noise somewhere.

549
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,225
The Prana Shakti within us

550
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:13,015
comes to us through five elements.

551
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:20,245
The five elements are, as you know,

552
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,935
is, one of them is the earth,

553
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,955
then we have got the water,

554
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:30,760
then we have got the air,

555
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,279
then we have got the light

556
00:34:33,307 --> 00:34:35,807
and then we have got the ether.

557
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,307
These five elements are there.

558
00:34:38,332 --> 00:34:43,849
Out of these five elements our body is made.

559
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:54,189
These five elements create five cocoons around
us. And that’s how we have got five auras within us.

560
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:00,489
These five auras can be
detected by some machines

561
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:05,209
because these machines are

562
00:35:05,209 --> 00:35:14,579
able to detect only the right side

563
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,579
as they deal with matter.

564
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:27,464
The whole of the matter is created by these five
energies and they have also a casual energy behind

565
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:32,351
it. And these casual energies actually make that.

566
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:38,765
For example: the causal
energy of earth is fragrance.

567
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:44,211
From the fragrance earth is created.

568
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:46,718
Now, within us all these five centres

569
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:53,652
that you see

570
00:35:53,664 --> 00:36:01,742
these are, these five up to
here, are made of five elements.

571
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,985
The body of those centres are made of

572
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:09,157
only the body part, I am saying
– of those five elements.

573
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:18,547
And the Deities residing in those centres
are also born from those five elements.

574
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:22,747
Because they were born of a particular element,

575
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:35,512
they concentrated more on that and maintained
the knowledge more limited to that area,

576
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,592
which dealt with that particular element.

577
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:46,620
For example, we can say the green thing is the
one that represents the water, water element.

578
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:53,130
This centre in the stomach is
the water element within us.

579
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:56,175
It is called as Nabhi Chakra

580
00:36:56,185 --> 00:36:59,765
and around it is called as the
Bhavasaghara, you can say the Void

581
00:36:59,765 --> 00:37:02,055
or you can say the Gap, or whatever you may say,

582
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:06,355
the whole world as such, within us.

583
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:15,445
So the people who were born on
this centre, around this centre,

584
00:37:15,425 --> 00:37:21,791
were born out of water element.

585
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:28,575
In this Bhavasaghra, Bhavasaghra
means the ocean of this world

586
00:37:28,585 --> 00:37:36,342
were born, through this ocean of the world,
were born all the Primordial Masters

587
00:37:36,353 --> 00:37:38,582
one after another,

588
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:42,849
we can say Abraham, Moses,

589
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:49,559
we had Janaka, we had Adi Nath and Socrates

590
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:52,529
and so many others like that

591
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,023
Nanaka

592
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:59,532
and also very recently we
had about hundred years back

593
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:03,769
a very great saint born in India known as Sainath.

594
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:08,362
They all represent the same
element, that is the water element,

595
00:38:08,377 --> 00:38:10,877
being responsible or being born out of that

596
00:38:10,877 --> 00:38:25,038
they are anxious to maintain water element as the
one which is within us for sustaining ourselves.

597
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:29,748
We are sustained by water so they
help us to sustain ourselves.

598
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:34,901
They are the sustainers, they tell us
how to sustain, as a human being.

599
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:42,683
And all of them have tried to establish religion
within us. A religion doesn’t mean outside,

600
00:38:42,664 --> 00:38:49,614
but the religion as a man, means the capacity
of a man or you can say, the quality of a man.

601
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:52,133
What a human being should be like,

602
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:55,907
what is the way to know if
he is a human being or not

603
00:38:55,897 --> 00:38:59,497
which is described in the Ten Commandments.

604
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:05,787
Now the way they have said it is all
misinterpreted and all wrong things have come.

605
00:39:05,806 --> 00:39:11,666
But one thing is definite, that they have never talked of fanaticism.

606
00:39:11,661 --> 00:39:14,161
They are against fanaticism.

607
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:22,094
They are against alcoholism, because
alcohol spoils the water element very much.

608
00:39:22,118 --> 00:39:28,558
If you see the effect of alcohol on
water in the blood of human beings

609
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:30,708
you will be amazed how

610
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:34,094
the neutral position of hydrogen
and oxygen are over time

611
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:38,174
is absolutely imbalanced by alcohol.

612
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,873
And water cannot absorb any heat from the liver,

613
00:39:40,873 --> 00:39:43,373
which sorts out all your poisons.

614
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:47,049
And that's how people get bad livers and bad troubles

615
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:51,628
and then people would say, "What's wrong?"

616
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:55,119
There is nothing wrong as such,
because even nothing wrong in that.

617
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,858
“What’s wrong according to the theory
of wrong and right of human beings,

618
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:04,088
I think nothing is wrong. You can kill
yourself. You can jump from anything.

619
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,781
You can do whatever you like.

620
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,811
There is nothing wrong. If you break this, if you
break that, if you break anybody, do anything,

621
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:16,751
there is nothing wrong what’s wrong with it?

622
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:21,078
But there is fundamentally wrong is
that you are created for a purpose.

623
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:23,408
You have not created yourself.

624
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:26,758
God has created you with such difficulties.

625
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:30,968
He has taken you out of

626
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:34,558
so many evolutionary processes
and brought you to this stage

627
00:40:34,546 --> 00:40:40,378
and now you have no business to
kill yourself and destroy yourself.

628
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:43,988
This is wrong is that you are destroying
yourself, you are destroying your community

629
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:48,248
you are destroying others or
you are destroying yourself.

630
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:53,988
If you are destroying yourself also because
you are on your own, you think, "What’s wrong?"

631
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:57,298
You are a part and parcel of the whole.

632
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:03,068
You are a cell in the whole and
being created to know the whole

633
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:06,348
and if you destroy yourself you
are destroying the whole as well.

634
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:12,381
You become malignant. You become cancerous

635
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:14,858
and that’s why it’s all wrong.

636
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:21,167
In anyway if you destroy others or destroy
yourself you have no right to do that.

637
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:24,007
God has given you freedom, no doubt.

638
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:28,777
By creating ego and superego within
yourself with these activities,

639
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,047
you become separated from the whole.

640
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:34,192
And then you think you are Mr Such and Such.

641
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:39,532
And then you stand and say, “I
believe in this, and I believe in...,"

642
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:43,958
actually who are you? You are made by God.

643
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,468
You are His own child.

644
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,771
Still you are a child.

645
00:41:48,778 --> 00:41:53,541
It's like a baby saying, "I believe in it, I believe in it."

646
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:57,889
You have not known the whole so far.

647
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,139
How can you say that?

648
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,649
You have to grow!

649
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:08,016
And when you grow, your
freedom is complete,

650
00:42:08,018 --> 00:42:10,518
absolute.

651
00:42:10,518 --> 00:42:17,946
But the ideas about this freedom are such
that you are fighting your own innocence

652
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:21,786
you are fighting your own sustenance.

653
00:42:21,796 --> 00:42:30,072
And this sustenance was completely supported

654
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:38,382
protected by these great
incarnations of Primordial Masters.

655
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:42,216
That’s why they talked against alcohol.

656
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:47,851
Christ did not talk about alcohol, all
right – because He was at another point,

657
00:42:47,851 --> 00:42:51,571
but He did not say that you take alcohol, never.

658
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,471
People said that He drank wine

659
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,881
but wine means grape juice in that country,

660
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:59,381
it doesn’t mean alcohol.

661
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:05,821
How can Christ say, you drink wine,

662
00:43:05,835 --> 00:43:07,981
which is fermented,

663
00:43:07,984 --> 00:43:09,931
which will go against your awareness?

664
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:12,164
Just think of it!

665
00:43:12,191 --> 00:43:15,264
It goes against your awareness, isn’t it?

666
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,464
Your awareness is to be enlightened,

667
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:19,987
He came on this earth to enlighten that awareness,

668
00:43:19,987 --> 00:43:25,020
do you think He will say that you get foggy with it?

669
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:29,510
Does it not fog your attention and your awareness,

670
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,010
is a fact.

671
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:37,750
But He wants to do something else

672
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:43,686
because He came as Divine Power itself.

673
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:46,267
He was the embodiment of Pranava

674
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:51,777
not Prana – all powers put together.

675
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:57,267
He was the embodiment of OM itself, the Brahma.

676
00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:00,527
That’s why He came to prove

677
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,999
what Krishna has said,

678
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:06,239
that it cannot be killed by anyone.

679
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:08,659
It cannot be blown off,

680
00:44:08,662 --> 00:44:11,979
it cannot be destroyed.

681
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:15,232
His body was made out of that,

682
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:20,732
and that’s why He could be resurrected.

683
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,691
All these things are knowledgeable

684
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,262
only if you are a realised soul,

685
00:44:28,262 --> 00:44:31,882
otherwise you cannot understand this.

686
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:35,192
Because you have not yet gone into the depth

687
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:36,882
of your own understanding,

688
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:40,192
you are still children as I say,

689
00:44:40,182 --> 00:44:43,148
you have to be born again,

690
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:50,578
and then you can find out for these vibrations.

691
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:54,448
You have to ask just a question,

692
00:44:54,448 --> 00:45:03,298
“Was Christ embodied with Pranava,

693
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:06,323
or the OM, or the Brahma?

694
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,902
Or was He made of Brahma itself?”

695
00:45:10,902 --> 00:45:15,512
You will get the cool breeze.

696
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:20,842
and that is the sign that He was.

697
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:28,154
It is much deeper but the whole
knowledge exists as experience to you.

698
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:32,932
The whole of it, it is an experience within us.

699
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:36,784
And one has to get that experience of oneself,

700
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:39,542
which is knowledge itself

701
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:43,778
and then everything trickles down

702
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:48,925
just like actual thing within us,
as we see white as white and red as red.

703
00:45:48,925 --> 00:45:55,255
Animals do not see perhaps,
but human beings do see.

704
00:45:55,275 --> 00:46:02,755
Thus, our awareness is enlightened.

705
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:08,635
I will be talking to other Sahaja Yogis in
the Ashram about the right side later on

706
00:46:08,658 --> 00:46:12,695
because we have new people, and
they are to be looked after.

707
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:21,029
And I think, next time when I
meet, I don’t know when, maybe...

708
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:27,804
No, in the Ashram firstly. Thursday evening I think, then
I'll talk to you because Friday I've got to fly out.

709
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:30,995
Thursday evening I will
be there most probably.

710
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:38,634
So just now, let’s have the
experience for the new ones,

711
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,814
and for the others also to deepen themselves.
May God bless you.

712
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:50,469
All of you should put your
hands just like this, before Me,

713
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,409
and close your eyes, just close your eyes!

714
00:46:56,409 --> 00:47:01,698
Put the hands like this, you
see and just close your eyes.

715
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:06,089
You have to close your eyes because
the Kundalini, when She rises

716
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:08,629
on the Agnya Chakra

717
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:10,789
the dilatation of the pupil takes place

718
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:14,496
and if your eyes are open the dilatation doesn’t take place.

719
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:20,689
When people mesmerize they keep your eyes
open, because they put you on the sides.

720
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:26,259
I will tell one day how they mesmerise, also.

721
00:47:28,923 --> 00:47:34,030
First you will feel that there is no thought
in your mind, if you watch your thoughts.

722
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:41,250
Then the Kundalini rises about
Agnya, you get Thoughtless Awareness.

723
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:49,400
When it pierces the fontenel bone area, I mean
when you get your baptism by your Kundalini,

724
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:57,717
then you feel the kind of a cool
breeze coming towards you from me;

725
00:47:57,726 --> 00:48:07,796
or a kind of a radiation of cool breeze
coming. From all over you might feel it.

726
00:48:13,107 --> 00:48:19,168
On your hands! Through
your fingers! It works!

727
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:25,308
All of you should put your
hands towards me. Please!

728
00:48:26,848 --> 00:48:29,348
That's important.

729
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:41,989
I mean even to put your hands is hard to
request, that means how egotistical you are.

730
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:48,732
You've come here for getting your Realisation
and don't even want to put your hands towards me.

731
00:48:48,753 --> 00:48:54,188
All such people should leave.

732
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:58,413
Getting cool breeze?
Great!

733
00:48:58,413 --> 00:49:00,511
Close you eyes and enjoy yourself.

734
00:49:00,513 --> 00:49:05,301
Best is to enjoy, this is the greatest
moment you've been waiting for.

735
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:10,059
Close you eyes!
Enjoy yourself!
