00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:12.587
So these divisive methods have come through

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:16.787
the innate humility not being you.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.632
If you can enjoy each and everything,

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.033
then you are humble.

00:00:25.576 --> 00:00:30.606
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.440
then you are humble.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.562
This humility is a very deep-down character,

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:47.642
because from Mooladhara it comes.

00:00:50.946 --> 00:00:53.976
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:58.096
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:05.036
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:08.875
He just moves, with all His big stomach

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:12.146
He moves on a little rat.

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:21.369
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:25.026
He’s so sweet.

00:01:25.956 --> 00:01:30.176
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and things and vibrations.

00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:36.166
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:43.476
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.820
instead of denouncing this, that.

00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:50.036
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

00:01:50.117 --> 00:01:51.229
this you may not like.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.328
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.439
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.809
“Baked beans” – all right!

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.016
We have to open out ourselves.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:17.036
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.765
Without humility you cannot,

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:25.046
because you are objecting to everything, creating a wall.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:30.976
Only the humility will make you spread out.

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:35.586
Today, the first day of our tour,

00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:44.005
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:50.006
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.976
and is beautiful.

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:56.844
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

00:02:56.925 --> 00:03:01.915
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:05.885
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.597
And she came to Me and she said,

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.859
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:14.166
the opportunity to play before You.”

00:03:15.476 --> 00:03:19.586
Just imagine – such a genius.

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:23.847
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.309
about the same age, maybe younger.

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:30.855
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:33.977
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

00:03:34.058 --> 00:03:35.792
he just went into ecstasy.

00:03:35.873 --> 00:03:39.411
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:40.945
when she saw Me,

00:03:41.026 --> 00:03:43.865
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:45.786
And she – she had temperature.

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:48.063
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:50.813
I am perfectly all right.”

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:55.548
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.738
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.078
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.065
because they are humble.

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:09.616
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:12.657
doesn’t make a big sound.
