00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:14.060
This program has been arranged by Vaitharna
and Bombay Sahaja Yogis to welcome you all

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.730
to India.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:28.079
Give them a hand.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.419
(Applause)

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:55.260
All the way you all have travelled to come
to this Holy Land, I should say, for your

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.360
spiritual growth.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:10.520
Every country has been blessed by God Almighty,
it's not only that India is a specially blessed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.520
one.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:22.909
But the people in India are definitely are
very much blessed that they are even blind

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.020
to seeking.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.320
They are not seeking as you people are seeking.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.640
This is their big problem.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.920
Because they think that they know everything
about God and they don't have to bother, while

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.820
you are really seekers of Truth - no doubt
about it.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.749
And the way you are seeking, the way you have
jumped into the ocean of joy and the way you

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:01.950
are dancing today has really filled My heart
with tremendous gratitude towards you.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:12.400
Even to receive the blessings, you have to
have people with open hearts, with wisdom,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.470
with love, with feeling of collectivity and
humanity.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:36.340
Unless and until you are of that quality,
it's impossible to make you work-out Sahaja

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.350
Yoga in this way.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.450
My own experience of you all is this that
you people are growing very fast.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.810
And that's how Sahaja Yoga is manifesting
even faster sometimes through you, people.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.530
And when you tell Me what miracles you have
met and what all the good things have happened

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:10.410
to you, I feel that you deserve much more
and should happen to you many, many good things.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:25.970
I hope, this tour will bring forth deeper,
sweeter qualities that are inside, hidden

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.989
for so many years - ages - and that you will
feel very much satisfied with yourself.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.260
That you are born as a human being and now
you are reborn as a Sahaja Yogi.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.540
I'm sure it will happen in this tour, most
of you, that you will feel your depth and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.370
that you will develop real respect for the
glory that you are.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:04.050
Sahaja Yogi has no business to feel guilty,
nor does he have anything to do with condemning

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.870
himself . You must know that if you were not
a Sahaja Yogi, I could not have talked to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.120
you, you could not have come to India, you
could not have known what is the Spirit. and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.060
also know the amount of knowledge you know.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.970
Nobody, so far, in the whole history of spirituality
knew - except for the Incarnations.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.820
So you are put quite close to Incarnations.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:38.760
So you have to be very proud, not vain, but
proud, because what you know is the Truth.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:50.470
Despite of this beautiful awareness that you
have about yourself should really mould you

00:04:50.470 --> 00:05:00.260
into beautiful people, into an image of that
collectivity about what we have thought of.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:09.290
And in the future we have to think of Ram-Raj,
is the Kingdom of God being brought on this

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.290
earth.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.660
Instead of we going into the Kingdom of God,
let us bring the Kingdom of God on this earth.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:28.280
It's possible, but you have to look after
your growth and the sacrifices of giving it

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280
to others.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.780
Here you don't have to sacrifice anything
as such, you don't have to surrender anything.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.190
What you have to surrender is your ego and
your super-ego.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.910
Then you become free people.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.860
And this freedom will take you very much higher
and higher in your spiritual Ascent.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.980
There's only one thing I have to be apologetic
about, that the arrangements we make for you,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.810
are all in the surroundings of nature, because
you yourself do not want to live in cement

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.810
houses.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:15.730
As a result, we have to organize other facilities
in a little Spartan way and sometimes could

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.470
be inconvenient to you.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:25.210
But I hope, you will go through all that,
with joy and happiness, and will understand

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.180
that that's the maximum one can do in a far-fetched
places of this kind.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:37.840
The nature is surrounding you and nature is
so beautiful and it sings the praise of God

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:50.460
in every way - the leaves, the flowers, the
trees, the ripples of the rivers - and the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.500
great mountains, like great Sahaja Yogis,
are meditating and emitting vibrations all

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500
over.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.750
So one has to be more receptive than to be
more complaining, should be more enjoying

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:16.150
than feeling sad, should be one with Myself
than with yourself in the sense that the Self

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.190
that is within you is weak.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.630
So when you start thinking about your small,
petty stuff, then you are not with Me at all.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:30.139
So try to enjoy yourself in the most collective
way.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:36.110
We have achieved quite a lot, I think, in
this short time.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:43.040
I feel we have achieved a lot, because so
many saints have been created, so many people

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.300
have been transformed.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:54.600
They look like lotuses before Me and I just
loose all control over words and cannot fill

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:01.100
in this joy into the cup of those poor little
words.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:06.780
They cannot carry My joy and My feelings to
you.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:14.530
But I am really overjoyed, and I think, gradually,
I may become a person who may never get angry

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:22.860
with anyone and maybe a person who'll loose
complete sense of controlling anyone whatsoever.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:34.099
We have some mishaps, as you know, in every
country something happens and it's a little

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:42.110
backward movement, but every backward movement
gives you a greater push and it has to happen,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:48.350
because we have people who sometimes retard
your progress.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.770
They try to create problems which are unsurmountable.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.120
So they have to give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.450
And doesn't matter - as long as we all are
progressing - one or two persons here and

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.860
there, doesn't matter at all.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.550
On the contrary, we should be thankful, that
all such people, who were responsible for

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.710
retarding our growth, have left us and have
left us in peace.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.930
So, all these attachments should be given
up.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:21.520
I have an experience, which I must tell you
so far, that if, say, one Mr.X - supposing

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.490
he was a leader or he was something - and
he leaves, because - or he has to leave, because

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:34.070
of certain problems that he has and he cannot
continue or I have to ask him to leave, then

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:41.690
some people still get worried about that person
and get attached to that person or think about

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.279
that person.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:50.250
This is a common experience I've had and such
people also gradually get lost.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.770
So, now you have to know that you are not
more compassionate than I am.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:03.540
If I have asked somebody to go out of Sahaja
Yoga, it is out of compassion to you all that

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.370
I have asked him to get out.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:11.310
And you should be compassionate to yourself
not to bother about such people who have left

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.660
Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.120
Just give them up, we have to give them up,
because they are on the periphery and they

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.100
are trying to move towards the periphery.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.880
So, let them get out.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.940
We cannot waste our energy for them.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.710
Those people who are problematic should know
that they should improve their problems and

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:36.430
must get into the centre and keep their pace
onward.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:42.550
Instead of, if they try to go down and down
and down and all the time threaten that we

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.950
have to leave Sahaja Yoga, you better tell
them that once for all, "Get out!"

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.870
That's the only way we can save others.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:57.490
As I've told you many-a-times that one bad
apple can spoil all the rest of them though

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.700
they may be good.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.900
So you have to be very kind to yourself and
very compassionate and should thank yourself

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.190
that you are in Sahaja Yoga and that you can
progress very well.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.460
This is a new dimension into which we are
moving.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:19.529
Here we don't have to see what is our progress
materially, physically or also intellectually.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:21.880
You have to see what is our progress spiritually.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:32.430
Because spiritual progress is complete knowledge,
absolute knowledge, is complete joy, absolute

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:44.050
joy and it is a complete power, absolute power.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.440
That's what we have to aim at.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.490
May God bless you all.
