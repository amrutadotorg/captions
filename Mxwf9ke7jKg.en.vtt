00:22:31.996 --> 00:22:41.596
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:22:44.524 --> 00:22:51.604
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:22:53.644 --> 00:23:02.004
sitting here with such shining faces

00:23:02.004 --> 00:23:05.524
from all over the world,

00:23:07.964 --> 00:23:15.164
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:23:22.244 --> 00:23:30.884
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:23:30.884 --> 00:23:35.044
who are going to save this world

00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:40.284
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:23:40.524 --> 00:23:43.884
that are surrounding us.

00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:48.604
Is coming from all sides,

00:23:49.564 --> 00:23:57.004
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:23:57.284 --> 00:24:01.484
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:24:01.484 --> 00:24:07.164
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:24:07.164 --> 00:24:11.964
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:24:12.604 --> 00:24:17.164
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:22.204
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:24:27.764 --> 00:24:30.004
As I told you the other day that

00:24:30.004 --> 00:24:39.844
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:24:39.844 --> 00:24:42.644
that it could work out,

00:24:45.364 --> 00:24:48.284
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:24:48.284 --> 00:24:52.764
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:24:52.764 --> 00:24:57.284
but you were so sensitive

00:24:57.284 --> 00:25:02.644
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:08.404
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.964
It's unbelievable.

00:25:10.964 --> 00:25:14.844
I can't believe Myself

00:25:15.364 --> 00:25:22.884
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:25:23.524 --> 00:25:27.004
No one can believe that there are so many

00:25:27.004 --> 00:25:29.524
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:25:29.524 --> 00:25:33.244
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:25:36.404 --> 00:25:41.844
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:25:42.524 --> 00:25:46.804
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:25:46.804 --> 00:25:50.124
and devas, not so many.

00:25:51.244 --> 00:25:54.084
One better than the other

00:25:54.324 --> 00:26:00.564
such beautiful heart,

00:26:02.484 --> 00:26:06.564
such brilliant brains

00:26:06.884 --> 00:26:19.404
and such active attention, is really

00:26:19.404 --> 00:26:26.124
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:26:26.124 --> 00:26:30.724
so many people, which I never expected.

00:26:30.724 --> 00:26:35.564
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:26:35.564 --> 00:26:39.724
and then those who came also,

00:26:39.724 --> 00:26:45.564
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:26:45.564 --> 00:26:49.964
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:26:49.964 --> 00:26:53.524
One after another, so many problems came

00:26:53.524 --> 00:26:56.844
and also there were many who were

00:26:56.844 --> 00:27:01.404
of a very low-level seekers.

00:27:01.404 --> 00:27:07.764
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:27:08.444 --> 00:27:13.684
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:16.404
the way it has happened.

00:27:16.404 --> 00:27:19.884
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:27:19.884 --> 00:27:26.124
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:27:26.124 --> 00:27:31.764
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:27:31.764 --> 00:27:37.004
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:27:37.004 --> 00:27:39.964
You are the channels

00:27:40.204 --> 00:27:46.524
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:27:48.564 --> 00:27:53.964
It is really remarkable the way

00:27:53.964 --> 00:27:58.284
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:28:11.844 --> 00:28:14.924
First of all, everybody was very much

00:28:14.924 --> 00:28:17.764
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:28:17.764 --> 00:28:23.084
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:28:23.084 --> 00:28:24.444
and then Delhi people said,

00:28:24.444 --> 00:28:26.444
"This time we are going to celebrate,

00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:29.404
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

00:28:29.684 --> 00:28:34.524
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

00:28:34.524 --> 00:28:38.564
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

00:28:40.124 --> 00:28:42.884
So many will be coming down."

00:28:42.884 --> 00:28:46.484
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:50.684
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:28:50.684 --> 00:28:54.884
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

00:28:54.884 --> 00:28:58.204
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

00:28:58.204 --> 00:29:02.724
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:29:03.724 --> 00:29:05.404
the way they have done it.

00:29:05.404 --> 00:29:07.324
The best part of it,

00:29:07.564 --> 00:29:12.684
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:29:12.964 --> 00:29:15.884
have groups and politics and all that,

00:29:15.884 --> 00:29:21.164
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:29:31.444 --> 00:29:34.004
There is no quarrelling.

00:29:34.444 --> 00:29:36.924
There is no pulling each other's legs.

00:29:36.924 --> 00:29:39.764
Is very remarkable thing

00:29:39.764 --> 00:29:42.884
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:29:42.884 --> 00:29:45.004
where every day what you hear

00:29:45.004 --> 00:29:50.324
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:29:51.604 --> 00:29:54.164
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:29:54.164 --> 00:29:58.044
this goodness was to be born and

00:29:58.044 --> 00:30:01.124
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:30:01.124 --> 00:30:03.844
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:03.844 --> 00:30:08.964
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:30:10.124 --> 00:30:13.604
and it's not easy

00:30:14.364 --> 00:30:21.124
to penetrate into the so-called

00:30:21.124 --> 00:30:24.604
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:30:24.604 --> 00:30:32.724
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:30:33.564 --> 00:30:37.804
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:30:37.804 --> 00:30:42.604
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:30:42.604 --> 00:30:46.244
that they have made out of their brains.

00:30:48.124 --> 00:30:52.244
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:30:52.764 --> 00:30:58.644
But the way they have absorbed

00:30:58.644 --> 00:31:07.844
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:31:10.684 --> 00:31:14.604
Nobody can comprehend even

00:31:16.844 --> 00:31:27.244
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:31:27.244 --> 00:31:30.724
on this Earth,

00:31:30.924 --> 00:31:35.684
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:31:35.684 --> 00:31:39.484
Just after My birth they were born here

00:31:42.244 --> 00:31:46.844
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:46.724 --> 00:31:52.244
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:54.804
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:31:54.804 --> 00:31:59.604
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

00:32:00.164 --> 00:32:01.764
My family members,

00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:06.244
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:14.484
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:32:16.284 --> 00:32:22.084
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:32:22.564 --> 00:32:27.204
there is totality waiting for them?

00:32:27.204 --> 00:32:31.324
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:34.644
which had no connection with reality.

00:32:36.964 --> 00:32:41.564
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:32:41.564 --> 00:32:45.684
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:32:45.924 --> 00:32:48.804
I remember the first incident

00:32:48.804 --> 00:32:56.204
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:32:56.844 --> 00:33:02.524
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:33:02.844 --> 00:33:06.324
Immediately, all the other,

00:33:06.324 --> 00:33:09.844
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:33:09.844 --> 00:33:11.404
they started saying that

00:33:11.404 --> 00:33:14.204
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:33:14.204 --> 00:33:17.004
so Mother has given him realization."

00:33:17.004 --> 00:33:21.044
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:24.964
I started shouting at them,

00:33:24.964 --> 00:33:26.964
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:29.844
you can never take to Divinity,"

00:33:29.844 --> 00:33:32.604
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

00:33:32.604 --> 00:33:35.124
One has to take another life,

00:33:35.124 --> 00:33:40.844
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:41.084 --> 00:33:45.884
But after that, suddenly,

00:33:45.884 --> 00:33:49.164
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:33:49.164 --> 00:33:54.044
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:33:54.044 --> 00:34:00.564
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

00:34:00.564 --> 00:34:03.444
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:08.164
Thus, we got twelve people

00:34:08.164 --> 00:34:15.324
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:34:16.404 --> 00:34:19.484
she was the fourteenth.

00:34:23.044 --> 00:34:27.364
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:34:28.684 --> 00:34:34.244
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:36.844
They were all flabbergasted.

00:34:37.124 --> 00:34:39.604
They didn't know what it was.

00:34:42.804 --> 00:34:47.044
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:34:47.044 --> 00:34:55.564
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:34:55.764 --> 00:35:01.284
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

00:35:01.284 --> 00:35:05.724
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:35:05.724 --> 00:35:08.004
I've never told otherwise also.

00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:13.324
So then, she recited a poem

00:35:13.324 --> 00:35:16.204
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:35:16.204 --> 00:35:18.604
and she was just a maidservant.

00:35:18.844 --> 00:35:21.844
And in a man's voice.

00:35:24.044 --> 00:35:25.844
So everybody was shocked

00:35:26.164 --> 00:35:29.604
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:35:29.604 --> 00:35:32.164
And then she went away.

00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:37.444
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:35:38.244 --> 00:35:42.604
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:35:42.604 --> 00:35:45.764
in My house itself.

00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:54.284
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:35:54.284 --> 00:35:56.164
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:35:56.164 --> 00:35:59.524
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:35:59.524 --> 00:36:03.164
and something will happen to us."

00:36:03.164 --> 00:36:04.764
But after the Puja they said,

00:36:05.124 --> 00:36:08.844
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

00:36:08.844 --> 00:36:13.324
They all felt the cool breeze

00:36:13.324 --> 00:36:17.124
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:20.324
They started understanding that

00:36:20.324 --> 00:36:26.004
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:36:27.204 --> 00:36:34.204
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:36:34.884 --> 00:36:42.084
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:36:44.644 --> 00:36:48.164
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:36:48.884 --> 00:36:55.404
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:36:55.404 --> 00:37:01.324
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:37:01.324 --> 00:37:08.164
that you found out that everywhere

00:37:08.164 --> 00:37:11.444
people were following whatever they're following,

00:37:11.444 --> 00:37:15.284
they were not reaching any point.

00:37:15.284 --> 00:37:18.164
Like a cocoon,

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:22.004
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:25.284
They got their realizations

00:37:25.604 --> 00:37:29.564
so quickly and when they told Me

00:37:31.764 --> 00:37:34.884
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:37:34.884 --> 00:37:38.964
I was amazed.

00:37:41.204 --> 00:37:44.324
How this seeking was working within them

00:37:44.324 --> 00:37:47.284
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:47.284 --> 00:37:49.484
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:37:49.484 --> 00:37:58.124
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:37:58.124 --> 00:38:04.324
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:07.124
You are just representing your country,

00:38:07.124 --> 00:38:11.044
but there are many more in your countries.

00:38:11.044 --> 00:38:13.764
Even in India we have many more.

00:38:13.764 --> 00:38:18.444
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:38:18.444 --> 00:38:21.524
So, multiple of this number,

00:38:21.524 --> 00:38:24.004
I do not know how many would be there.

00:38:24.004 --> 00:38:26.524
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:38:26.724 --> 00:38:28.404
"I don't know."

00:38:28.404 --> 00:38:29.524
Say, "You don't know?"

00:38:29.884 --> 00:38:34.284
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

00:38:34.284 --> 00:38:36.764
So they can't understand. I said,

00:38:36.764 --> 00:38:43.924
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:38:44.804 --> 00:38:46.924
I don't know how to type.

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:50.644
I don't know how to write even My check."

00:38:51.564 --> 00:38:53.604
They can't understand

00:38:53.484 --> 00:38:57.724
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:38:59.124 --> 00:39:02.844
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:39:03.964 --> 00:39:07.804
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:39:07.804 --> 00:39:12.284
everything gets absolutely

00:39:12.284 --> 00:39:15.004
done in the most perfect manner

00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:19.124
like a remote control.

00:39:19.124 --> 00:39:22.204
Now this whole thing,

00:39:23.404 --> 00:39:28.844
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:39:28.844 --> 00:39:34.644
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:39:34.644 --> 00:39:39.324
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:39:40.404 --> 00:39:45.484
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:49.404
because you all have commitment

00:39:49.724 --> 00:39:53.044
and that commitment gives you

00:39:53.044 --> 00:39:57.444
all these organizing capacities.

00:40:00.964 --> 00:40:06.524
So many things you have seen get organized

00:40:06.524 --> 00:40:10.404
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:40:10.404 --> 00:40:14.724
has come into Krita Yuga

00:40:14.724 --> 00:40:18.964
where it is working it out. It's acting.

00:40:18.964 --> 00:40:24.604
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:40:26.204 --> 00:40:29.484
For example, the police people told us

00:40:29.484 --> 00:40:31.764
that there are Muslims living here

00:40:31.764 --> 00:40:34.444
and you might have some danger from them.

00:40:34.444 --> 00:40:36.924
They might do some harm to you.

00:40:36.924 --> 00:40:39.084
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

00:40:39.084 --> 00:40:43.724
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

00:40:45.004 --> 00:40:47.604
I said, "They'll never harm us."

00:40:47.604 --> 00:40:51.724
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:40:51.724 --> 00:40:55.484
and he was a great realized soul

00:40:55.484 --> 00:41:00.764
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:41:00.764 --> 00:41:05.164
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:41:05.164 --> 00:41:08.324
How can they harm us?"

00:41:08.324 --> 00:41:10.484
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:41:10.484 --> 00:41:16.884
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

00:41:16.884 --> 00:41:18.284
and they were so impressed

00:41:18.284 --> 00:41:23.404
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:41:23.404 --> 00:41:27.084
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:29.244
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:41:29.244 --> 00:41:33.684
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:41:33.684 --> 00:41:35.484
all kinds of things.

00:41:35.484 --> 00:41:37.524
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:41:37.524 --> 00:41:41.084
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:41:41.084 --> 00:41:44.804
and I always have admired his poetry

00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:51.244
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:41:51.244 --> 00:41:55.444
and divinity.

00:41:54.364 --> 00:41:58.164
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:41:58.164 --> 00:42:01.244
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

00:42:01.244 --> 00:42:03.484
I said, "This is Ruh."

00:42:03.484 --> 00:42:06.244
"Ah, this is Ruh."

00:42:07.564 --> 00:42:10.244
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:42:10.244 --> 00:42:12.764
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:42:12.764 --> 00:42:16.244
and you may have to have ...

00:42:27.364 --> 00:42:31.404
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:42:31.404 --> 00:42:33.484
and we are going to take their addresses

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.924
and we are going to meet them;

00:42:34.924 --> 00:42:37.644
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:42:37.644 --> 00:42:41.444
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:42:47.724 --> 00:42:55.604
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:42:55.604 --> 00:43:00.044
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:43:16.124 --> 00:43:19.204
Also contemporarily,

00:43:19.844 --> 00:43:23.484
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:43:23.484 --> 00:43:28.284
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:43:28.284 --> 00:43:31.604
to give wisdom to those people

00:43:31.604 --> 00:43:35.404
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:43:35.844 --> 00:43:39.884
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:42.284
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:43:42.284 --> 00:43:44.644
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:46.124
See, on top of your head

00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:49.764
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:43:50.004 --> 00:43:52.724
though there is no breeze outside,

00:43:52.724 --> 00:43:54.884
the leaves are just steady,

00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:59.364
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:44:02.364 --> 00:44:05.324
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:44:05.324 --> 00:44:10.084
will cool down and will bring peace

00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:14.844
to our politicians and to the people

00:44:14.844 --> 00:44:19.244
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:44:19.244 --> 00:44:23.524
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:44:23.524 --> 00:44:28.004
there are so many things going on

00:44:28.004 --> 00:44:30.964
of uncertainties,

00:44:31.364 --> 00:44:34.444
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:44:34.444 --> 00:44:37.604
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:44:37.604 --> 00:44:40.604
in England there's recession,

00:44:40.604 --> 00:44:42.764
America there is recession,

00:44:43.044 --> 00:44:44.844
Spain there is recession,

00:44:44.844 --> 00:44:47.644
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:44:47.924 --> 00:44:53.684
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:44:54.204 --> 00:44:56.764
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:44:56.764 --> 00:44:59.964
that they see now will correct

00:45:00.324 --> 00:45:04.164
their behavior towards materialism

00:45:04.164 --> 00:45:09.844
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:45:10.084 --> 00:45:13.764
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:45:13.764 --> 00:45:20.844
this world will be so beautiful,

00:45:20.844 --> 00:45:29.804
so enchanting that in the history,

00:45:29.804 --> 00:45:32.124
people will describe

00:45:32.124 --> 00:45:35.764
that the world itself became a lotus

00:45:35.764 --> 00:45:41.124
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:45:49.404 --> 00:45:51.884
You are the petals,

00:45:53.364 --> 00:45:55.604
you are the corona,

00:45:58.124 --> 00:46:00.604
you are the color,

00:46:01.684 --> 00:46:04.164
you are the beauty,

00:46:05.724 --> 00:46:07.644
you are the pollen

00:46:08.404 --> 00:46:12.324
of that beautiful lotus

00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:15.329
I hope today

00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:21.849
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:23.289
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:46:23.289 --> 00:46:27.089
and work for yourself also.

00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:29.249
The only danger is

00:46:29.249 --> 00:46:34.289
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:46:34.529 --> 00:46:39.329
That's the only horse.

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:44.129
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:46:44.129 --> 00:46:46.409
you'll progress very fast,

00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:49.609
beautifully.

00:46:52.689 --> 00:47:00.649
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:47:00.649 --> 00:47:09.209
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:47:09.489 --> 00:47:14.649
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:20.449
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:47:20.449 --> 00:47:22.329
I'm working very hard,

00:47:22.329 --> 00:47:26.689
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:47:34.809 --> 00:47:36.689
In the same way, you also,

00:47:36.689 --> 00:47:39.569
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:47:39.569 --> 00:47:44.409
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:47:44.409 --> 00:47:47.649
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:47.649 --> 00:47:50.529
We'll think about it.

00:47:50.529 --> 00:47:53.369
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:47:53.369 --> 00:47:56.049
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:47:56.049 --> 00:47:57.529
writings,

00:47:57.529 --> 00:47:58.849
go round,

00:47:58.849 --> 00:48:00.769
talk to their colleagues,

00:48:00.769 --> 00:48:04.729
organize meetings,

00:48:04.729 --> 00:48:08.249
seminars with your colleagues.

00:48:10.649 --> 00:48:13.529
There are architects

00:48:14.489 --> 00:48:19.049
and other professionals

00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:24.969
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:48:24.969 --> 00:48:27.689
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:30.209
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:30.209 --> 00:48:33.809
Is very important because

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:38.049
financial problems can only be

00:48:38.209 --> 00:48:40.929
solved by the Divine Power.

00:48:40.929 --> 00:48:44.489
Nobody else can solve it.

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:48.649
So everyone in this world,

00:48:48.649 --> 00:48:54.089
whether it is law or any other field,

00:48:54.089 --> 00:48:59.329
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:49:00.209 --> 00:49:04.849
and also to creative work.

00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:10.169
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

00:49:10.169 --> 00:49:12.649
to your surroundings,

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:19.169
to villages, to cities,

00:49:19.169 --> 00:49:22.209
wherever it is possible,

00:49:22.209 --> 00:49:24.609
wherever you can organize,

00:49:24.609 --> 00:49:28.489
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:49:28.489 --> 00:49:31.209
As far as curing is concerned,

00:49:31.209 --> 00:49:34.569
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

00:49:34.569 --> 00:49:37.369
Please use only My photograph.

00:49:37.369 --> 00:49:40.209
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

00:49:40.209 --> 00:49:44.649
and less sick people.

00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:47.169
Also, people will be cured

00:49:47.169 --> 00:49:50.929
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

00:49:51.209 --> 00:49:54.529
We have also agricultural field

00:49:54.529 --> 00:49:56.969
on which we have done something,

00:49:56.969 --> 00:50:02.369
but much can be done about agriculture.

00:50:02.369 --> 00:50:05.049
One should see the government and tell them

00:50:05.049 --> 00:50:07.449
what agriculture can do.

00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:10.529
You can form a committee and go and see them

00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:14.649
and talk to them that

00:50:14.649 --> 00:50:20.569
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:23.209
We have to help our children.

00:50:23.209 --> 00:50:25.569
We have to look after them

00:50:25.569 --> 00:50:34.769
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

00:50:34.769 --> 00:50:37.969
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

00:50:37.969 --> 00:50:41.409
even in India.

00:50:41.409 --> 00:50:45.209
So we have to see that our children

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:48.449
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

00:50:49.729 --> 00:50:51.729
Is very important

00:50:51.729 --> 00:50:55.569
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

00:50:55.569 --> 00:50:58.409
So many of them are born realized,

00:50:58.409 --> 00:51:01.089
so we have to discipline them properly

00:51:01.089 --> 00:51:06.729
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

00:51:06.729 --> 00:51:11.289
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

00:51:15.769 --> 00:51:22.729
It is also our family life which is very important.

00:51:22.969 --> 00:51:24.769
Is shocking that

00:51:24.769 --> 00:51:28.329
family life is nowadays becoming

00:51:28.329 --> 00:51:32.249
a kind of a stupid thing.

00:51:32.249 --> 00:51:35.449
No one understands the importance of it.

00:51:35.449 --> 00:51:39.009
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

00:51:39.009 --> 00:51:43.729
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

00:51:43.729 --> 00:51:49.089
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

00:51:49.049 --> 00:51:54.969
and there should be a proper rapport

00:51:54.969 --> 00:52:02.529
between husband and wife to begin with,

00:52:02.529 --> 00:52:06.169
so that there is a companionship

00:52:06.169 --> 00:52:09.489
and the children also see that companionship

00:52:09.489 --> 00:52:13.409
and enjoy it.

00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:18.009
In our dress, in our life,

00:52:18.009 --> 00:52:22.889
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

00:52:23.609 --> 00:52:25.369
Is very important.

00:52:25.569 --> 00:52:27.849
We should wear whatever suits us

00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:30.609
in whatever country we are.

00:52:31.369 --> 00:52:33.649
I mean, imagine in summer climate

00:52:33.649 --> 00:52:36.409
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

00:52:36.649 --> 00:52:38.849
what will happen to him?

00:52:39.529 --> 00:52:41.129
Whatever suits us,

00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:45.449
whatever fits our culture,

00:52:45.449 --> 00:52:50.009
one should try to wear decent dresses,

00:52:50.009 --> 00:52:52.729
traditional dresses.

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:55.529
Specially for women, it is very important

00:52:55.529 --> 00:53:00.369
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

00:53:07.449 --> 00:53:10.649
Also, another point I would like to say,

00:53:10.649 --> 00:53:15.529
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

00:53:16.209 --> 00:53:19.049
at least newspapers.

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:23.209
If your attention is on the problems

00:53:23.209 --> 00:53:26.809
that are in this world, it's very effective

00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:31.649
because you know your attention is active, it works.

00:53:33.449 --> 00:53:35.969
So use your attention.

00:53:35.969 --> 00:53:37.449
You see the newspapers,

00:53:37.449 --> 00:53:40.089
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

00:53:40.089 --> 00:53:41.889
you can give a bandhan,

00:53:41.889 --> 00:53:45.249
but you must see what's happening where,

00:53:45.249 --> 00:53:48.049
is very important.

00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:52.969
Also men should not just read something sensational,

00:53:52.969 --> 00:53:56.129
but read something that's happening

00:53:56.129 --> 00:53:59.529
and also think, what are the solutions.

00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:02.929
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

00:54:02.929 --> 00:54:06.209
in a collective way or in an individual way.

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:14.009
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

00:54:14.009 --> 00:54:17.089
Also one has to read good books,

00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:20.129
good films one has to see,

00:54:20.129 --> 00:54:22.849
and have your reflection on them.

00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:24.809
Keep your mind alert.

00:54:24.809 --> 00:54:29.049
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

00:54:29.049 --> 00:54:30.529
coming out of

00:54:30.529 --> 00:54:33.449
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:36.009
beautiful, very high class.

00:54:36.209 --> 00:54:39.489
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:42.609
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

00:54:42.609 --> 00:54:44.129
from everywhere.

00:54:44.129 --> 00:54:47.529
They are trying to systematize now.

00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:49.489
And now, in this system,

00:54:49.489 --> 00:54:52.129
if you can all help spontaneously,

00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:56.569
it will be a great achievement

00:54:56.569 --> 00:55:00.089
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:04.289
all these datas and keep them with us.

00:55:06.209 --> 00:55:09.329
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

00:55:09.329 --> 00:55:12.049
All have to meditate.

00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:14.809
Only in meditation you are in present

00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:17.609
and you grow in your spirituality.

00:55:17.609 --> 00:55:21.609
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:25.169
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

00:55:25.169 --> 00:55:28.769
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

00:55:29.969 --> 00:55:31.649
no doubt.

00:55:32.009 --> 00:55:33.729
We really grow very fast.

00:55:33.729 --> 00:55:36.529
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

00:55:36.529 --> 00:55:38.689
the way he has changed.

00:55:38.689 --> 00:55:40.489
And then, once you get used to it,

00:55:40.729 --> 00:55:43.209
you'll never give it up.

00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:45.169
Is very simple meditation.

00:55:45.169 --> 00:55:47.929
You have foot soaking or something like that

00:55:47.929 --> 00:55:51.049
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:52.729
that's all.

00:55:53.489 --> 00:55:55.769
Is not that you have to do

00:55:55.769 --> 00:55:59.209
one lakh jappas or something.

00:55:59.209 --> 00:56:00.689
Nothing of the kind.

00:56:00.689 --> 00:56:02.409
Is very simple.

00:56:02.409 --> 00:56:04.609
But this, you have to do for yourself,

00:56:04.609 --> 00:56:10.929
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

00:56:13.409 --> 00:56:20.169
We have lots of advantages over others.

00:56:20.169 --> 00:56:22.449
But one thing I have to tell you,

00:56:22.449 --> 00:56:27.649
those people who are not prone to seeking,

00:56:27.649 --> 00:56:31.209
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:31.209 --> 00:56:34.209
Don't waste your energy on such people,

00:56:34.209 --> 00:56:36.209
discussing and arguing,

00:56:36.209 --> 00:56:38.969
because it cannot be discussed much.

00:56:38.969 --> 00:56:41.649
You just forget them and leave them alone.

00:56:41.649 --> 00:56:43.249
I'll look after them.

00:56:43.249 --> 00:56:47.049
You just take to simple people, good people,

00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:51.129
who are seeking the truth.

00:56:51.129 --> 00:56:53.689
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

00:56:53.689 --> 00:56:57.449
who are just believing in discussion,

00:56:57.369 --> 00:57:00.809
arguments and shabda jaal.

00:57:00.809 --> 00:57:05.129
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

00:57:05.129 --> 00:57:08.249
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

00:57:08.249 --> 00:57:10.769
there's something special

00:57:11.009 --> 00:57:15.809
and that they have something very unique

00:57:15.809 --> 00:57:21.609
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

00:57:21.609 --> 00:57:24.169
All these things, you should understand,

00:57:24.169 --> 00:57:27.289
have come to you spontaneously from within,

00:57:27.289 --> 00:57:30.849
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

00:57:30.849 --> 00:57:34.329
Should never be shy of your virtues.

00:57:35.649 --> 00:57:37.489
And whatever people may try

00:57:37.489 --> 00:57:39.889
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:41.849
if it is wrong you should never do it.

00:57:40.529 --> 00:57:46.689
Because, now, you are very powerful

00:57:41.849 --> 00:57:44.449
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

00:57:51.649 --> 00:57:53.889
and that you have to lead the people

00:57:53.889 --> 00:57:55.569
and people don't have to lead you.

00:57:55.569 --> 00:57:57.529
Fashions don't have to lead you,

00:57:57.529 --> 00:58:00.009
but you have to create fashions.

00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:03.729
You have to create a path for them.

00:58:03.729 --> 00:58:06.609
It's not that you have to

00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:10.569
trod on the path that they have made.

00:58:10.569 --> 00:58:12.009
Try to understand

00:58:12.009 --> 00:58:15.369
that your own personality

00:58:15.369 --> 00:58:20.569
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:24.209
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:29.449
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

00:58:29.449 --> 00:58:31.529
Don't get ideas from them

00:58:31.529 --> 00:58:33.169
and don't get frightened

00:58:33.169 --> 00:58:35.649
when they try to tell you something

00:58:35.649 --> 00:58:38.569
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:43.689
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

00:58:43.689 --> 00:58:46.609
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:50.009
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

00:58:50.009 --> 00:58:53.009
that it worked out.

00:58:54.889 --> 00:58:56.369
I didn't have to,

00:58:56.369 --> 00:59:00.569
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

00:59:00.569 --> 00:59:05.209
I just started it.

00:59:05.649 --> 00:59:08.369
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

00:59:08.569 --> 00:59:12.289
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:15.329
I started the whole thing on My own,

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:17.169
worked it out on My own,

00:59:17.169 --> 00:59:20.489
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

00:59:20.489 --> 00:59:23.809
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:26.889
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

00:59:26.889 --> 00:59:28.969
It has happened.

00:59:28.969 --> 00:59:31.929
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

00:59:31.929 --> 00:59:33.729
All of you should, first of all,

00:59:33.729 --> 00:59:36.049
see that you are not a conditioned person

00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:38.329
and you do not have an ego

00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:41.209
and then you should go ahead with it

00:59:41.209 --> 00:59:44.569
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:48.329
Today's puja is very short puja.

00:59:48.609 --> 00:59:52.809
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

00:59:53.169 --> 00:59:56.449
There are so many things which I cannot,

00:59:56.449 --> 01:00:02.209
at this time, which is short, tell you

01:00:02.209 --> 01:00:05.169
but if you sit down, you can easily make

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:09.289
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:12.649
So, now put your mind to it

01:00:12.649 --> 01:00:17.169
in a way that you are the organizer.

01:00:17.169 --> 01:00:19.929
Then what should you do? What can you do?

01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:21.209
What are you going to achieve?

01:00:21.209 --> 01:00:25.849
Please try and it will work out.

01:00:26.529 --> 01:00:28.329
All of you can do it.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:31.369
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

01:00:31.369 --> 01:00:34.409
and write it down in that: what you have done,

01:00:34.409 --> 01:00:36.489
how many people you have given realization,

01:00:36.489 --> 01:00:41.129
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:43.689
But now, if there's no diary,

01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:45.009
Sahaja yogis can say among,

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:48.089
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

01:00:48.089 --> 01:00:51.129
you start it today.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.489
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:59.409
is that they take things little lightly.

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:06.809
Of course, that is their character.

01:01:06.809 --> 01:01:10.369
But not Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:12.649
Other things you can take lightly.

01:01:12.649 --> 01:01:14.409
If somebody shouts at you,

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:15.889
somebody gets angry with you,

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:18.449
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.409
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.369
because you are the spirit.

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:24.969
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:27.849
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

01:01:29.649 --> 01:01:32.209
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:34.489
your attitude should be different.

01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:36.689
If you are relaxing on one side,

01:01:36.889 --> 01:01:40.049
another side you have to be dynamic

01:01:40.049 --> 01:01:42.929
and that side is where you have to put forward

01:01:42.929 --> 01:01:44.489
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:44.489 --> 01:01:46.249
when you have to talk to people,

01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:48.529
you have to organize a press conference

01:01:48.529 --> 01:01:50.649
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

01:01:50.649 --> 01:01:52.649
At whatever level you want to work it out,

01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:55.089
please make a proper plan about it

01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:57.209
and just do it.

01:01:57.209 --> 01:02:01.569
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:07.249
With all these ideas that I have,

01:02:08.369 --> 01:02:11.369
you have many more

01:02:11.369 --> 01:02:15.329
and I hope by next year,

01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:18.049
we'll see manifestation of those.

01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:20.209
I hope many people will write books

01:02:20.209 --> 01:02:22.529
like U.C. Rai has written.

01:02:22.529 --> 01:02:28.449
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:31.289
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.009
Everything he has done single-handed.

01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:36.729
So beautifully he has worked it out.

01:02:36.729 --> 01:02:42.209
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:45.489
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:48.449
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:53.569
But it should be honest, very honest book.

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:56.969
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

01:02:56.969 --> 01:03:01.569
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.769
All those who have such ideas

01:03:03.769 --> 01:03:09.369
should make an effort to create some new books,

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:14.609
some new ideas, some new creation.

01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:16.649
Is very important

01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:18.689
because in these modern times

01:03:18.689 --> 01:03:21.969
people want to do something new,

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:24.889
something novel.

01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:27.689
Under these circumstances,

01:03:27.689 --> 01:03:30.489
I'm sure you all will work out.

01:03:31.129 --> 01:03:34.569
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:39.689
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:43.529
and then these can be properly put together,

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:47.489
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:50.489
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

01:03:50.489 --> 01:03:53.769
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:57.849 --> 01:04:01.409
This is a very opportune time.

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:10.489
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:31.529
And what will be the symptom

01:04:31.529 --> 01:04:37.449
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:48.489
Whatever people may try,

01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:51.409
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:52.889
Satyame vijayate.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.809
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

01:05:00.899 --> 01:05:03.939
For this I congratulate you again and again.

01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:07.619
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:11.179
May God bless you all.
