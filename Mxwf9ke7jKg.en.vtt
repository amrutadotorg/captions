WEBVTT

22:31.996 --> 22:41.596
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

22:44.524 --> 22:51.604
to see so many Sahaja yogis

22:53.644 --> 23:02.004
sitting here with such shining faces

23:02.004 --> 23:05.524
from all over the world,

23:07.964 --> 23:15.164
as if My vision has taken its form today.

23:22.244 --> 23:30.884
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

23:30.884 --> 23:35.044
who are going to save this world

23:35.364 --> 23:40.284
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

23:40.524 --> 23:43.884
that are surrounding us.

23:44.844 --> 23:48.604
Is coming from all sides,

23:49.564 --> 23:57.004
while you people have really taken your second birth

23:57.284 --> 24:01.484
from this pond of Kali Yuga

24:01.484 --> 24:07.164
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

24:07.164 --> 24:11.964
hues, fragrance and beauty.

24:12.604 --> 24:17.164
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

24:17.164 --> 24:22.204
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

24:27.764 --> 24:30.004
As I told you the other day that

24:30.004 --> 24:39.844
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

24:39.844 --> 24:42.644
that it could work out,

24:45.364 --> 24:48.284
otherwise it would have been impossible.

24:48.284 --> 24:52.764
To even transform one person is very difficult,

24:52.764 --> 24:57.284
but you were so sensitive

24:57.284 --> 25:02.644
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

25:02.644 --> 25:08.404
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.964
It's unbelievable.

25:10.964 --> 25:14.844
I can't believe Myself

25:15.364 --> 25:22.884
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

25:23.524 --> 25:27.004
No one can believe that there are so many

25:27.004 --> 25:29.524
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

25:29.524 --> 25:33.244
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

25:36.404 --> 25:41.844
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

25:42.524 --> 25:46.804
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

25:46.804 --> 25:50.124
and devas, not so many.

25:51.244 --> 25:54.084
One better than the other

25:54.324 --> 26:00.564
such beautiful heart,

26:02.484 --> 26:06.564
such brilliant brains

26:06.884 --> 26:19.404
and such active attention, is really

26:19.404 --> 26:26.124
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

26:26.124 --> 26:30.724
so many people, which I never expected.

26:30.724 --> 26:35.564
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

26:35.564 --> 26:39.724
and then those who came also,

26:39.724 --> 26:45.564
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

26:45.564 --> 26:49.964
all kinds of people created problems for us.

26:49.964 --> 26:53.524
One after another, so many problems came

26:53.524 --> 26:56.844
and also there were many who were

26:56.844 --> 27:01.404
of a very low-level seekers.

27:01.404 --> 27:07.764
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

27:08.444 --> 27:13.684
I cannot distinguish one from another,

27:13.684 --> 27:16.404
the way it has happened.

27:16.404 --> 27:19.884
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

27:19.884 --> 27:26.124
is the greatest blessings for this world.

27:26.124 --> 27:31.764
I could not do it alone. You know that.

27:31.764 --> 27:37.004
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

27:37.004 --> 27:39.964
You are the channels

27:40.204 --> 27:46.524
and you have to work it out further and further.

27:48.564 --> 27:53.964
It is really remarkable the way

27:53.964 --> 27:58.284
Delhi people have organized everything.

28:11.844 --> 28:14.924
First of all, everybody was very much

28:14.924 --> 28:17.764
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

28:17.764 --> 28:23.084
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

28:23.084 --> 28:24.444
and then Delhi people said,

28:24.444 --> 28:26.444
"This time we are going to celebrate,

28:26.444 --> 28:29.404
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

28:29.684 --> 28:34.524
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

28:34.524 --> 28:38.564
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

28:40.124 --> 28:42.884
So many will be coming down."

28:42.884 --> 28:46.484
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

28:48.364 --> 28:50.684
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

28:50.684 --> 28:54.884
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

28:54.884 --> 28:58.204
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

28:58.204 --> 29:02.724
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

29:03.724 --> 29:05.404
the way they have done it.

29:05.404 --> 29:07.324
The best part of it,

29:07.564 --> 29:12.684
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

29:12.964 --> 29:15.884
have groups and politics and all that,

29:15.884 --> 29:21.164
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

29:31.444 --> 29:34.004
There is no quarrelling.

29:34.444 --> 29:36.924
There is no pulling each other's legs.

29:36.924 --> 29:39.764
Is very remarkable thing

29:39.764 --> 29:42.884
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

29:42.884 --> 29:45.004
where every day what you hear

29:45.004 --> 29:50.324
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

29:51.604 --> 29:54.164
Perhaps, in this hell only,

29:54.164 --> 29:58.044
this goodness was to be born and

29:58.044 --> 30:01.124
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

30:01.124 --> 30:03.844
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

30:03.844 --> 30:08.964
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

30:10.124 --> 30:13.604
and it's not easy

30:14.364 --> 30:21.124
to penetrate into the so-called

30:21.124 --> 30:24.604
people who call themselves intellectuals

30:24.604 --> 30:32.724
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

30:33.564 --> 30:37.804
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

30:37.804 --> 30:42.604
another side the classes who live in the frame

30:42.604 --> 30:46.244
that they have made out of their brains.

30:48.124 --> 30:52.244
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

30:52.764 --> 30:58.644
But the way they have absorbed

30:58.644 --> 31:07.844
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

31:10.684 --> 31:14.604
Nobody can comprehend even

31:16.844 --> 31:27.244
that there were so many born after My birth,

31:27.244 --> 31:30.724
on this Earth,

31:30.924 --> 31:35.684
or some maybe before also, very few.

31:35.684 --> 31:39.484
Just after My birth they were born here

31:42.244 --> 31:46.844
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

31:46.724 --> 31:52.244
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

31:52.244 --> 31:54.804
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

31:54.804 --> 31:59.604
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

32:00.164 --> 32:01.764
My family members,

32:01.764 --> 32:06.244
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

32:07.324 --> 32:14.484
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

32:16.284 --> 32:22.084
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

32:22.564 --> 32:27.204
there is totality waiting for them?

32:27.204 --> 32:31.324
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

32:31.324 --> 32:34.644
which had no connection with reality.

32:36.964 --> 32:41.564
And it was impossible even to envisage

32:41.564 --> 32:45.684
the method by which I could talk to them.

32:45.924 --> 32:48.804
I remember the first incident

32:48.804 --> 32:56.204
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

32:56.844 --> 33:02.524
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

33:02.844 --> 33:06.324
Immediately, all the other,

33:06.324 --> 33:09.844
there were hardly about thirty-five people

33:09.844 --> 33:11.404
they started saying that

33:11.404 --> 33:14.204
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

33:14.204 --> 33:17.004
so Mother has given him realization."

33:17.004 --> 33:21.044
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

33:21.604 --> 33:24.964
I started shouting at them,

33:24.964 --> 33:26.964
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

33:26.964 --> 33:29.844
you can never take to Divinity,"

33:29.844 --> 33:32.604
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

33:32.604 --> 33:35.124
One has to take another life,

33:35.124 --> 33:40.844
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

33:41.084 --> 33:45.884
But after that, suddenly,

33:45.884 --> 33:49.164
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

33:49.164 --> 33:54.044
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

33:54.044 --> 34:00.564
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

34:00.564 --> 34:03.444
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

34:03.444 --> 34:08.164
Thus, we got twelve people

34:08.164 --> 34:15.324
and one lady whom I had given before also,

34:16.404 --> 34:19.484
she was the fourteenth.

34:23.044 --> 34:27.364
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

34:28.684 --> 34:34.244
for whom it was something out of the blue.

34:34.244 --> 34:36.844
They were all flabbergasted.

34:37.124 --> 34:39.604
They didn't know what it was.

34:42.804 --> 34:47.044
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

34:47.044 --> 34:55.564
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

34:55.764 --> 35:01.284
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

35:01.284 --> 35:05.724
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

35:05.724 --> 35:08.004
I've never told otherwise also.

35:09.724 --> 35:13.324
So then, she recited a poem

35:13.324 --> 35:16.204
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

35:16.204 --> 35:18.604
and she was just a maidservant.

35:18.844 --> 35:21.844
And in a man's voice.

35:24.044 --> 35:25.844
So everybody was shocked

35:26.164 --> 35:29.604
that the bhoots should say all these things.

35:29.604 --> 35:32.164
And then she went away.

35:32.164 --> 35:37.444
After that, these people started probing into it.

35:38.244 --> 35:42.604
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

35:42.604 --> 35:45.764
in My house itself.

35:46.044 --> 35:54.284
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

35:54.284 --> 35:56.164
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

35:56.164 --> 35:59.524
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

35:59.524 --> 36:03.164
and something will happen to us."

36:03.164 --> 36:04.764
But after the Puja they said,

36:05.124 --> 36:08.844
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

36:08.844 --> 36:13.324
They all felt the cool breeze

36:13.324 --> 36:17.124
and the entire atmosphere changed.

36:17.124 --> 36:20.324
They started understanding that

36:20.324 --> 36:26.004
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

36:27.204 --> 36:34.204
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

36:34.884 --> 36:42.084
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

36:44.644 --> 36:48.164
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

36:48.884 --> 36:55.404
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

36:55.404 --> 37:01.324
and that's what happened with all of you,

37:01.324 --> 37:08.164
that you found out that everywhere

37:08.164 --> 37:11.444
people were following whatever they're following,

37:11.444 --> 37:15.284
they were not reaching any point.

37:15.284 --> 37:18.164
Like a cocoon,

37:18.164 --> 37:22.004
they're hitting their head here and there.

37:22.004 --> 37:25.284
They got their realizations

37:25.604 --> 37:29.564
so quickly and when they told Me

37:31.764 --> 37:34.884
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

37:34.884 --> 37:38.964
I was amazed.

37:41.204 --> 37:44.324
How this seeking was working within them

37:44.324 --> 37:47.284
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

37:47.284 --> 37:49.484
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

37:49.484 --> 37:58.124
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

37:58.124 --> 38:04.324
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.124
You are just representing your country,

38:07.124 --> 38:11.044
but there are many more in your countries.

38:11.044 --> 38:13.764
Even in India we have many more.

38:13.764 --> 38:18.444
You are just here, come to represent them.

38:18.444 --> 38:21.524
So, multiple of this number,

38:21.524 --> 38:24.004
I do not know how many would be there.

38:24.004 --> 38:26.524
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

38:26.724 --> 38:28.404
"I don't know."

38:28.404 --> 38:29.524
Say, "You don't know?"

38:29.884 --> 38:34.284
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

38:34.284 --> 38:36.764
So they can't understand. I said,

38:36.764 --> 38:43.924
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

38:44.804 --> 38:46.924
I don't know how to type.

38:46.924 --> 38:50.644
I don't know how to write even My check."

38:51.564 --> 38:53.604
They can't understand

38:53.484 --> 38:57.724
person like Me existing in these modern times.

38:59.124 --> 39:02.844
But everything gets done, somehow.

39:03.964 --> 39:07.804
Despite all My modern ignorance,

39:07.804 --> 39:12.284
everything gets absolutely

39:12.284 --> 39:15.004
done in the most perfect manner

39:15.004 --> 39:19.124
like a remote control.

39:19.124 --> 39:22.204
Now this whole thing,

39:23.404 --> 39:28.844
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

39:28.844 --> 39:34.644
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

39:34.644 --> 39:39.324
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

39:40.404 --> 39:45.484
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

39:45.484 --> 39:49.404
because you all have commitment

39:49.724 --> 39:53.044
and that commitment gives you

39:53.044 --> 39:57.444
all these organizing capacities.

40:00.964 --> 40:06.524
So many things you have seen get organized

40:06.524 --> 40:10.404
because also this Paramchaitanya

40:10.404 --> 40:14.724
has come into Krita Yuga

40:14.724 --> 40:18.964
where it is working it out. It's acting.

40:18.964 --> 40:24.604
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

40:26.204 --> 40:29.484
For example, the police people told us

40:29.484 --> 40:31.764
that there are Muslims living here

40:31.764 --> 40:34.444
and you might have some danger from them.

40:34.444 --> 40:36.924
They might do some harm to you.

40:36.924 --> 40:39.084
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

40:39.084 --> 40:43.724
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

40:45.004 --> 40:47.604
I said, "They'll never harm us."

40:47.604 --> 40:51.724
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

40:51.724 --> 40:55.484
and he was a great realized soul

40:55.484 --> 41:00.764
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

41:00.764 --> 41:05.164
at least, believers of Sufism.

41:05.164 --> 41:08.324
How can they harm us?"

41:08.324 --> 41:10.484
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

41:10.484 --> 41:16.884
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

41:16.884 --> 41:18.284
and they were so impressed

41:18.284 --> 41:23.404
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

41:23.404 --> 41:27.084
morning time, and they were so respectful.

41:27.084 --> 41:29.244
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

41:29.244 --> 41:33.684
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

41:33.684 --> 41:35.484
all kinds of things.

41:35.484 --> 41:37.524
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

41:37.524 --> 41:41.084
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

41:41.084 --> 41:44.804
and I always have admired his poetry

41:44.804 --> 41:51.244
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

41:51.244 --> 41:55.444
and divinity.

41:54.364 --> 41:58.164
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

41:58.164 --> 42:01.244
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

42:01.244 --> 42:03.484
I said, "This is Ruh."

42:03.484 --> 42:06.244
"Ah, this is Ruh."

42:07.564 --> 42:10.244
Once these people start getting Ruh,

42:10.244 --> 42:12.764
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

42:12.764 --> 42:16.244
and you may have to have ...

42:27.364 --> 42:31.404
There are so many Sufis all over the world

42:31.404 --> 42:33.484
and we are going to take their addresses

42:33.484 --> 42:34.924
and we are going to meet them;

42:34.924 --> 42:37.644
then you might have to have another big pendal,

42:37.644 --> 42:41.444
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

42:47.724 --> 42:55.604
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

42:55.604 --> 43:00.044
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

43:16.124 --> 43:19.204
Also contemporarily,

43:19.844 --> 43:23.484
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

43:23.484 --> 43:28.284
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

43:28.284 --> 43:31.604
to give wisdom to those people

43:31.604 --> 43:35.404
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

43:35.844 --> 43:39.884
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

43:39.884 --> 43:42.284
With all these Sahaja yogis

43:42.284 --> 43:44.644
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

43:44.644 --> 43:46.124
See, on top of your head

43:46.124 --> 43:49.764
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

43:50.004 --> 43:52.724
though there is no breeze outside,

43:52.724 --> 43:54.884
the leaves are just steady,

43:54.884 --> 43:59.364
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

44:02.364 --> 44:05.324
So I'm sure these vibrations

44:05.324 --> 44:10.084
will cool down and will bring peace

44:10.084 --> 44:14.844
to our politicians and to the people

44:14.844 --> 44:19.244
who are at the helm of affairs.

44:19.244 --> 44:23.524
At this juncture, when in the whole world

44:23.524 --> 44:28.004
there are so many things going on

44:28.004 --> 44:30.964
of uncertainties,

44:31.364 --> 44:34.444
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

44:34.444 --> 44:37.604
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

44:37.604 --> 44:40.604
in England there's recession,

44:40.604 --> 44:42.764
America there is recession,

44:43.044 --> 44:44.844
Spain there is recession,

44:44.844 --> 44:47.644
everybody is suffering from the pangs

44:47.924 --> 44:53.684
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

44:54.204 --> 44:56.764
So, I'm sure this polarity

44:56.764 --> 44:59.964
that they see now will correct

45:00.324 --> 45:04.164
their behavior towards materialism

45:04.164 --> 45:09.844
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

45:10.084 --> 45:13.764
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

45:13.764 --> 45:20.844
this world will be so beautiful,

45:20.844 --> 45:29.804
so enchanting that in the history,

45:29.804 --> 45:32.124
people will describe

45:32.124 --> 45:35.764
that the world itself became a lotus

45:35.764 --> 45:41.124
full of fragrance of Divinity.

45:49.404 --> 45:51.884
You are the petals,

45:53.364 --> 45:55.604
you are the corona,

45:58.124 --> 46:00.604
you are the color,

46:01.684 --> 46:04.164
you are the beauty,

46:05.724 --> 46:07.644
you are the pollen

46:08.404 --> 46:12.324
of that beautiful lotus

46:12.489 --> 46:15.329
I hope today

46:15.329 --> 46:21.849
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

46:21.849 --> 46:23.289
to spread Sahaja Yoga

46:23.289 --> 46:27.089
and work for yourself also.

46:27.329 --> 46:29.249
The only danger is

46:29.249 --> 46:34.289
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

46:34.529 --> 46:39.329
That's the only horse.

46:39.329 --> 46:44.129
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

46:44.129 --> 46:46.409
you'll progress very fast,

46:46.409 --> 46:49.609
beautifully.

46:52.689 --> 47:00.649
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

47:00.649 --> 47:09.209
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

47:09.489 --> 47:14.649
I don't know what vow I should take.

47:17.769 --> 47:20.449
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

47:20.449 --> 47:22.329
I'm working very hard,

47:22.329 --> 47:26.689
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

47:34.809 --> 47:36.689
In the same way, you also,

47:36.689 --> 47:39.569
all of you, have to take a vow today

47:39.569 --> 47:44.409
that we'll go all out in the commitment

47:44.409 --> 47:47.649
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

47:47.649 --> 47:50.529
We'll think about it.

47:50.529 --> 47:53.369
There are scientists who should produce books,

47:53.369 --> 47:56.049
there are doctors who should produce books,

47:56.049 --> 47:57.529
writings,

47:57.529 --> 47:58.849
go round,

47:58.849 --> 48:00.769
talk to their colleagues,

48:00.769 --> 48:04.729
organize meetings,

48:04.729 --> 48:08.249
seminars with your colleagues.

48:10.649 --> 48:13.529
There are architects

48:14.489 --> 48:19.049
and other professionals

48:19.609 --> 48:24.969
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

48:24.969 --> 48:27.689
Even the people who are dealing with finances

48:27.689 --> 48:30.209
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

48:30.209 --> 48:33.809
Is very important because

48:33.809 --> 48:38.049
financial problems can only be

48:38.209 --> 48:40.929
solved by the Divine Power.

48:40.929 --> 48:44.489
Nobody else can solve it.

48:44.889 --> 48:48.649
So everyone in this world,

48:48.649 --> 48:54.089
whether it is law or any other field,

48:54.089 --> 48:59.329
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

49:00.209 --> 49:04.849
and also to creative work.

49:05.769 --> 49:10.169
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

49:10.169 --> 49:12.649
to your surroundings,

49:12.649 --> 49:19.169
to villages, to cities,

49:19.169 --> 49:22.209
wherever it is possible,

49:22.209 --> 49:24.609
wherever you can organize,

49:24.609 --> 49:28.489
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

49:28.489 --> 49:31.209
As far as curing is concerned,

49:31.209 --> 49:34.569
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

49:34.569 --> 49:37.369
Please use only My photograph.

49:37.369 --> 49:40.209
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

49:40.209 --> 49:44.649
and less sick people.

49:44.649 --> 49:47.169
Also, people will be cured

49:47.169 --> 49:50.929
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

49:51.209 --> 49:54.529
We have also agricultural field

49:54.529 --> 49:56.969
on which we have done something,

49:56.969 --> 50:02.369
but much can be done about agriculture.

50:02.369 --> 50:05.049
One should see the government and tell them

50:05.049 --> 50:07.449
what agriculture can do.

50:07.449 --> 50:10.529
You can form a committee and go and see them

50:12.849 --> 50:14.649
and talk to them that

50:14.649 --> 50:20.569
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

50:20.569 --> 50:23.209
We have to help our children.

50:23.209 --> 50:25.569
We have to look after them

50:25.569 --> 50:34.769
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

50:34.769 --> 50:37.969
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

50:37.969 --> 50:41.409
even in India.

50:41.409 --> 50:45.209
So we have to see that our children

50:45.209 --> 50:48.449
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

50:49.729 --> 50:51.729
Is very important

50:51.729 --> 50:55.569
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

50:55.569 --> 50:58.409
So many of them are born realized,

50:58.409 --> 51:01.089
so we have to discipline them properly

51:01.089 --> 51:06.729
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

51:06.729 --> 51:11.289
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

51:15.769 --> 51:22.729
It is also our family life which is very important.

51:22.969 --> 51:24.769
Is shocking that

51:24.769 --> 51:28.329
family life is nowadays becoming

51:28.329 --> 51:32.249
a kind of a stupid thing.

51:32.249 --> 51:35.449
No one understands the importance of it.

51:35.449 --> 51:39.009
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

51:39.009 --> 51:43.729
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

51:43.729 --> 51:49.089
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

51:49.049 --> 51:54.969
and there should be a proper rapport

51:54.969 --> 52:02.529
between husband and wife to begin with,

52:02.529 --> 52:06.169
so that there is a companionship

52:06.169 --> 52:09.489
and the children also see that companionship

52:09.489 --> 52:13.409
and enjoy it.

52:14.569 --> 52:18.009
In our dress, in our life,

52:18.009 --> 52:22.889
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

52:23.609 --> 52:25.369
Is very important.

52:25.569 --> 52:27.849
We should wear whatever suits us

52:27.849 --> 52:30.609
in whatever country we are.

52:31.369 --> 52:33.649
I mean, imagine in summer climate

52:33.649 --> 52:36.409
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

52:36.649 --> 52:38.849
what will happen to him?

52:39.529 --> 52:41.129
Whatever suits us,

52:41.129 --> 52:45.449
whatever fits our culture,

52:45.449 --> 52:50.009
one should try to wear decent dresses,

52:50.009 --> 52:52.729
traditional dresses.

52:52.969 --> 52:55.529
Specially for women, it is very important

52:55.529 --> 53:00.369
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

53:07.449 --> 53:10.649
Also, another point I would like to say,

53:10.649 --> 53:15.529
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

53:16.209 --> 53:19.049
at least newspapers.

53:19.369 --> 53:23.209
If your attention is on the problems

53:23.209 --> 53:26.809
that are in this world, it's very effective

53:26.809 --> 53:31.649
because you know your attention is active, it works.

53:33.449 --> 53:35.969
So use your attention.

53:35.969 --> 53:37.449
You see the newspapers,

53:37.449 --> 53:40.089
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

53:40.089 --> 53:41.889
you can give a bandhan,

53:41.889 --> 53:45.249
but you must see what's happening where,

53:45.249 --> 53:48.049
is very important.

53:48.049 --> 53:52.969
Also men should not just read something sensational,

53:52.969 --> 53:56.129
but read something that's happening

53:56.129 --> 53:59.529
and also think, what are the solutions.

53:59.529 --> 54:02.929
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

54:02.929 --> 54:06.209
in a collective way or in an individual way.

54:06.209 --> 54:14.009
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

54:14.009 --> 54:17.089
Also one has to read good books,

54:17.089 --> 54:20.129
good films one has to see,

54:20.129 --> 54:22.849
and have your reflection on them.

54:22.849 --> 54:24.809
Keep your mind alert.

54:24.809 --> 54:29.049
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

54:29.049 --> 54:30.529
coming out of

54:30.529 --> 54:33.449
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

54:33.449 --> 54:36.009
beautiful, very high class.

54:36.209 --> 54:39.489
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

54:39.489 --> 54:42.609
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

54:42.609 --> 54:44.129
from everywhere.

54:44.129 --> 54:47.529
They are trying to systematize now.

54:47.529 --> 54:49.489
And now, in this system,

54:49.489 --> 54:52.129
if you can all help spontaneously,

54:52.129 --> 54:56.569
it will be a great achievement

54:56.569 --> 55:00.089
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

55:00.089 --> 55:04.289
all these datas and keep them with us.

55:06.209 --> 55:09.329
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

55:09.329 --> 55:12.049
All have to meditate.

55:12.049 --> 55:14.809
Only in meditation you are in present

55:14.809 --> 55:17.609
and you grow in your spirituality.

55:17.609 --> 55:21.609
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

55:21.609 --> 55:25.169
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

55:25.169 --> 55:28.769
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

55:29.969 --> 55:31.649
no doubt.

55:32.009 --> 55:33.729
We really grow very fast.

55:33.729 --> 55:36.529
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

55:36.529 --> 55:38.689
the way he has changed.

55:38.689 --> 55:40.489
And then, once you get used to it,

55:40.729 --> 55:43.209
you'll never give it up.

55:43.209 --> 55:45.169
Is very simple meditation.

55:45.169 --> 55:47.929
You have foot soaking or something like that

55:47.929 --> 55:51.049
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

55:51.049 --> 55:52.729
that's all.

55:53.489 --> 55:55.769
Is not that you have to do

55:55.769 --> 55:59.209
one lakh jappas or something.

55:59.209 --> 56:00.689
Nothing of the kind.

56:00.689 --> 56:02.409
Is very simple.

56:02.409 --> 56:04.609
But this, you have to do for yourself,

56:04.609 --> 56:10.929
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

56:13.409 --> 56:20.169
We have lots of advantages over others.

56:20.169 --> 56:22.449
But one thing I have to tell you,

56:22.449 --> 56:27.649
those people who are not prone to seeking,

56:27.649 --> 56:31.209
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

56:31.209 --> 56:34.209
Don't waste your energy on such people,

56:34.209 --> 56:36.209
discussing and arguing,

56:36.209 --> 56:38.969
because it cannot be discussed much.

56:38.969 --> 56:41.649
You just forget them and leave them alone.

56:41.649 --> 56:43.249
I'll look after them.

56:43.249 --> 56:47.049
You just take to simple people, good people,

56:47.049 --> 56:51.129
who are seeking the truth.

56:51.129 --> 56:53.689
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

56:53.689 --> 56:57.449
who are just believing in discussion,

56:57.369 --> 57:00.809
arguments and shabda jaal.

57:00.809 --> 57:05.129
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

57:05.129 --> 57:08.249
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

57:08.249 --> 57:10.769
there's something special

57:11.009 --> 57:15.809
and that they have something very unique

57:15.809 --> 57:21.609
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

57:21.609 --> 57:24.169
All these things, you should understand,

57:24.169 --> 57:27.289
have come to you spontaneously from within,

57:27.289 --> 57:30.849
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

57:30.849 --> 57:34.329
Should never be shy of your virtues.

57:35.649 --> 57:37.489
And whatever people may try

57:37.489 --> 57:39.889
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

57:39.889 --> 57:41.849
if it is wrong you should never do it.

57:40.529 --> 57:46.689
Because, now, you are very powerful

57:41.849 --> 57:44.449
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

57:51.649 --> 57:53.889
and that you have to lead the people

57:53.889 --> 57:55.569
and people don't have to lead you.

57:55.569 --> 57:57.529
Fashions don't have to lead you,

57:57.529 --> 58:00.009
but you have to create fashions.

58:00.009 --> 58:03.729
You have to create a path for them.

58:03.729 --> 58:06.609
It's not that you have to

58:06.609 --> 58:10.569
trod on the path that they have made.

58:10.569 --> 58:12.009
Try to understand

58:12.009 --> 58:15.369
that your own personality

58:15.369 --> 58:20.569
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

58:20.569 --> 58:24.209
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

58:24.209 --> 58:29.449
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

58:29.449 --> 58:31.529
Don't get ideas from them

58:31.529 --> 58:33.169
and don't get frightened

58:33.169 --> 58:35.649
when they try to tell you something

58:35.649 --> 58:38.569
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

58:38.569 --> 58:43.689
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

58:43.689 --> 58:46.609
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

58:46.609 --> 58:50.009
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

58:50.009 --> 58:53.009
that it worked out.

58:54.889 --> 58:56.369
I didn't have to,

58:56.369 --> 59:00.569
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

59:00.569 --> 59:05.209
I just started it.

59:05.649 --> 59:08.369
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

59:08.569 --> 59:12.289
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

59:12.289 --> 59:15.329
I started the whole thing on My own,

59:15.329 --> 59:17.169
worked it out on My own,

59:17.169 --> 59:20.489
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

59:20.489 --> 59:23.809
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

59:23.809 --> 59:26.889
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

59:26.889 --> 59:28.969
It has happened.

59:28.969 --> 59:31.929
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

59:31.929 --> 59:33.729
All of you should, first of all,

59:33.729 --> 59:36.049
see that you are not a conditioned person

59:36.049 --> 59:38.329
and you do not have an ego

59:38.329 --> 59:41.209
and then you should go ahead with it

59:41.209 --> 59:44.569
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

59:44.569 --> 59:48.329
Today's puja is very short puja.

59:48.609 --> 59:52.809
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

59:53.169 --> 59:56.449
There are so many things which I cannot,

59:56.449 --> 01:00:02.209
at this time, which is short, tell you

01:00:02.209 --> 01:00:05.169
but if you sit down, you can easily make

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:09.289
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:12.649
So, now put your mind to it

01:00:12.649 --> 01:00:17.169
in a way that you are the organizer.

01:00:17.169 --> 01:00:19.929
Then what should you do? What can you do?

01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:21.209
What are you going to achieve?

01:00:21.209 --> 01:00:25.849
Please try and it will work out.

01:00:26.529 --> 01:00:28.329
All of you can do it.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:31.369
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

01:00:31.369 --> 01:00:34.409
and write it down in that: what you have done,

01:00:34.409 --> 01:00:36.489
how many people you have given realization,

01:00:36.489 --> 01:00:41.129
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

01:00:41.129 --> 01:00:43.689
But now, if there's no diary,

01:00:43.689 --> 01:00:45.009
Sahaja yogis can say among,

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:48.089
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

01:00:48.089 --> 01:00:51.129
you start it today.

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.489
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:59.409
is that they take things little lightly.

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:06.809
Of course, that is their character.

01:01:06.809 --> 01:01:10.369
But not Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:10.369 --> 01:01:12.649
Other things you can take lightly.

01:01:12.649 --> 01:01:14.409
If somebody shouts at you,

01:01:14.409 --> 01:01:15.889
somebody gets angry with you,

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:18.449
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

01:01:18.449 --> 01:01:21.409
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.369
because you are the spirit.

01:01:23.369 --> 01:01:24.969
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:27.849
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

01:01:29.649 --> 01:01:32.209
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:34.489
your attitude should be different.

01:01:34.489 --> 01:01:36.689
If you are relaxing on one side,

01:01:36.889 --> 01:01:40.049
another side you have to be dynamic

01:01:40.049 --> 01:01:42.929
and that side is where you have to put forward

01:01:42.929 --> 01:01:44.489
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:44.489 --> 01:01:46.249
when you have to talk to people,

01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:48.529
you have to organize a press conference

01:01:48.529 --> 01:01:50.649
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

01:01:50.649 --> 01:01:52.649
At whatever level you want to work it out,

01:01:52.649 --> 01:01:55.089
please make a proper plan about it

01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:57.209
and just do it.

01:01:57.209 --> 01:02:01.569
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

01:02:01.889 --> 01:02:07.249
With all these ideas that I have,

01:02:08.369 --> 01:02:11.369
you have many more

01:02:11.369 --> 01:02:15.329
and I hope by next year,

01:02:15.329 --> 01:02:18.049
we'll see manifestation of those.

01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:20.209
I hope many people will write books

01:02:20.209 --> 01:02:22.529
like U.C. Rai has written.

01:02:22.529 --> 01:02:28.449
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

01:02:28.449 --> 01:02:31.289
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.009
Everything he has done single-handed.

01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:36.729
So beautifully he has worked it out.

01:02:36.729 --> 01:02:42.209
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:45.489
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:48.449
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:53.569
But it should be honest, very honest book.

01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:56.969
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

01:02:56.969 --> 01:03:01.569
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:03.769
All those who have such ideas

01:03:03.769 --> 01:03:09.369
should make an effort to create some new books,

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:14.609
some new ideas, some new creation.

01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:16.649
Is very important

01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:18.689
because in these modern times

01:03:18.689 --> 01:03:21.969
people want to do something new,

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:24.889
something novel.

01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:27.689
Under these circumstances,

01:03:27.689 --> 01:03:30.489
I'm sure you all will work out.

01:03:31.129 --> 01:03:34.569
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

01:03:34.569 --> 01:03:39.689
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

01:03:39.689 --> 01:03:43.529
and then these can be properly put together,

01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:47.489
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:50.489
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

01:03:50.489 --> 01:03:53.769
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:57.849 --> 01:04:01.409
This is a very opportune time.

01:04:01.769 --> 01:04:10.489
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:31.529
And what will be the symptom

01:04:31.529 --> 01:04:37.449
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:48.489
Whatever people may try,

01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:51.409
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:52.889
Satyame vijayate.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:57.809
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

01:05:00.899 --> 01:05:03.939
For this I congratulate you again and again.

01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:07.619
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:11.179
May God bless you all.
