NOTE Language: en

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.518
As I had a few minutes,
I did one or two drawings.

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.471
I would like to talk to you
about planet Sahaj this morning

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:20.732
and I would like to explain to you
this planet on which you live.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.411
And I want to explain a paradox

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:28.411
because - the paradox is that -
we ARE AND WE ARE NOT

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.753
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:36.628
Because there is a discrepancy between
what we  say we are

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:39.029
and we say we are yogis

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.888
and what sometimes we seem to be.

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.995
So people can be a little bit confused
or depressed about it.

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.279
I remember sometimes
people ask me,

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:07.273
because in August I will say
I am in Sahaj since 40 years.

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:15.628
And then I have to look at myself
in the mirror and I say,

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:21.427
Well, I have to explain.

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:25.068
The explanation is very simple

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:28.177
but Boris says to know
that with the translation...

00:01:31.737 --> 00:01:35.591
See, Shri Mataji has explained to me
how Adi Kundalini

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.846
was awakened in Nargol,

00:01:39.784 --> 00:01:42.161
on the border of the Indian ocean.

00:01:42.362 --> 00:01:47.619
Shri Mataji has explained to me how
Adi Kundalini was awakened in Nargol

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:50.740
And it looks a bit like a Krimi
(a spy novel in German)

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:56.943
because She went there
to spy on a rakshasa

00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.401
who had there a seminar.

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.396
Because there was a big Rajnish camp,

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:08.245
and Shri Mataji went there to see
what was happening.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:13.878
Then, what She told me
is that She could see

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.003
with Her yogic powers how Rajnish
was possessing everybody.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:24.990
And then what She said
is that She realised

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:30.987
that advent (of Evil) was much more
advanced than what She thought.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:40.500
but basically, this was
what She was saying.

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:44.943
And She felt that if it
would not happen now,

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:49.807
on mass realisation,
mankind would be destroyed.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:54.432
We are talking about
May 1970, so ... you can see.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:57.020
We take our time towards destruction.

00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:01.648
So, then comes
the important bit of the story:

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.992
Then She described how She was
sitting under this tree,

00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:11.630
and then the Adi Kundalini, you know,
just rose, and She described it.

00:03:12.662 --> 00:03:19.609
But what She says is that
the Kundalini was released,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.740
although mankind was not ready,
this is the important thing.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.763
And this explains
what is going on today.

00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:35.382
You see, when in the past
people would get their realisation,

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:40.180
they would get their realisation
having cleaned the entire system:

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:43.180
all the chakras were clean,

00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:47.242
the attention was Nirmal,
the attention was purer,

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.647
nobody could get (caught up),
no question being possessed,

00:03:50.848 --> 00:03:54.940
people had reached the level
where Kundalini would rise.

00:03:55.326 --> 00:04:00.111
What Shri Mataji did,
because She is the overlord,

00:04:00.312 --> 00:04:03.417
overlord of the entire system:

00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.533
She rewrote the Divine books.

00:04:06.734 --> 00:04:09.966
She did something that no Deity,

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:11.943
no avatar,

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:16.526
no saint has or could
ever do before Her.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.409
She gave realisation to people,
who were not prepared.

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:27.932
And that also explained
the 10 last years of Her life,

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:32.323
where She said
She would go into sanyasa.

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:35.771
We think She would go to Pratishtan
and withdraw, but no,

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:38.325
She went into a condition,

00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:44.029
in which She withdrew Her attention
apparently from Her physical form,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.565
and that for 10 years,
and it was a tremendous tapasya!

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.075
And we understand
that She did this to (purify us)

00:04:54.276 --> 00:04:59.684
Because She says She took...
She took us all unprepared

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:03.224
as we are sahaja yogis
in Her cosmic body.

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:06.737
so She did that tapasya

00:05:06.938 --> 00:05:12.930
to purify all the options of what
would happen, once She leaves.

00:05:13.305 --> 00:05:16.773
That basically now
it is up to us.

00:05:17.078 --> 00:05:19.878
You know, I told you,
how on the animal channel

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:24.362
we watch how the mumy bear is
throwing their kids into the wilderness,

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.933
the little bears,
they want to stay with mummy,

00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:29.331
but they cannot do it,
because she keeps them away.

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:34.221
are going to become big bears

00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:36.474
and they can survive,
that's why she does it.

00:05:36.675 --> 00:05:44.463
And this 10 years when She withdrew,
let's say 2003 - 2013, more or less.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:49.596
But this also explains
why we are yogis

00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:52.560
and some of us
are still struggling,

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:57.888
because the work, that we didn't do
before, the rising of the Kundalini,

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.490
we need to do it after
the rising of the Kundalini.

00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:03.442
And if we understand that,

00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:07.174
we don't feel bad
about any difficulties.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.568
So, now to understand
a bit about how this thing works,

00:06:18.472 --> 00:06:21.276
(German?)

00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:57.888
There are 2 forces
that we are dealing with:

00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:06.875
one is the centripetal force,
which takes you in,

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:13.750
and one is the centrifugal force,
which takes you out.

00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:19.232
Now, in one tape Shri Mataji says,
- it's not so reassuring -

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:23.612
but She says, this force is anxious
to throw you out.

00:07:24.073 --> 00:07:29.018
So that corresponds
to 2 types of religion:

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:36.507
one is the inner religion,

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:41.724
which corresponds
to the centripetal movement,

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:45.698
and the centrifugal religion
takes you out.

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:48.713
Ok?
The external religion.

00:07:49.433 --> 00:07:53.503
So Shri Mataji, She asked
in public and in private,

00:08:02.614 --> 00:08:03.992
Ok, so

00:08:06.086 --> 00:08:10.453
what is the inner religion?

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.055
The external religion is

00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:24.555
that you do not...

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:29.289
Ok. The internal religion is
Sahaja sthiti

00:08:36.813 --> 00:08:41.518
And this is what you all know, when
you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:46.164
when you are in love when you are
in peace, when you are in Sahasrara.

00:08:46.594 --> 00:08:52.096
But because of this process
of purification in unprepared yogis

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:56.499
was not completed,
we are not always in Sahaj sthiti,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.820
when we call ourselves Sahaja Yogis,

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:02.687
so we face the temptation
of external religions

00:09:02.888 --> 00:09:07.180
and this is what Shri Mataji
has tested for the last 10 years.

00:09:09.573 --> 00:09:13.316
You see, if we are in Sahaja sthiti,

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:17.211
the authority is within ourselves.

00:09:29.995 --> 00:09:33.255
because you will feel my vibrations

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:36.904
and you will know
that what I say is true.

00:09:37.105 --> 00:09:39.068
That is the sthiti.

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:43.310
But we, if we are not
in Sahaj sthiti, then

00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:47.104
we look for the authority outside,

00:09:47.441 --> 00:09:48.979
ok?
Outside.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.676
External religion
look for authority outside.

00:09:51.877 --> 00:09:54.512
So, for instance, you are...
(video paused)

00:09:54.713 --> 00:10:00.122
So when... of the Catholic
or the Sunni model, where somebody

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.802
will follow the pope or the caliph

00:10:06.003 --> 00:10:09.786
in the name of Christ
or in the name of Allah.

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:13.812
They don't follow Christ or Allah,
they follow the pope or the caliph.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:17.749
This model of externalisation
we had to test it,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.187
because in our collectivity
we did have some people,

00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:24.568
who would follow one individual
or another,

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:27.296
thinking that this is the authority
we have to follow.

00:10:27.497 --> 00:10:29.805
But if we keep our discrimination,

00:10:30.006 --> 00:10:34.789
we take all the inputs that
we have to, but we follow Shri Mataji

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.990
only like Shri Ganesha.

00:10:38.076 --> 00:10:41.266
Now, another temptation
of external religion,

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:45.005
which also has been tested
is hierarchies.

00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.638
Hierarchies.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:52.742
You see if you have
bureaucrats as leaders,

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:57.227
then, you know, like a shoemaker,
he is making shoes,

00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:01.849
a bureaucrat is making bureaucracies.
I am a bureaucrat, I know.

00:11:02.584 --> 00:11:06.906
I ended my career acting
Assistant Secretary General,

00:11:07.107 --> 00:11:11.578
and I was... You know, when we were
in the castle with Shri Mataji, I was

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:15.289
a bit naughty,
I was sort of teasing Sir CP

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.266
But you see,
the business of our democrats...

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:32.463
because we have
the temptation for hierarchy,

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:34.982
we have the temptation
for bureaucracy,

00:11:35.183 --> 00:11:38.154
we have the temptation
for rules and regulations

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:41.491
and some people
even wrote the rules

00:11:41.692 --> 00:11:44.613
how to take vibrations
with little envelopes.

00:11:44.814 --> 00:11:49.182
All of a sudden, we were in the world
of complete idiocy.

00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:54.703
Where did you get lost?

00:12:00.114 --> 00:12:03.388
You see, with bureaucracy
you get lost anyway.

00:12:06.302 --> 00:12:09.094
Then another temptation
of external religion,

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.654
because you structure
all this nicely

00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:17.924
and it's like the shell,
but the sthiti is not there.

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:21.715
Because the more shell you have,
the less sthiti you have.

00:12:22.176 --> 00:12:25.952
So, you see, another temptation
you have to understand,

00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:29.027
of the external religion, is

00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:34.844
is to convert to the new faith.

00:12:36.063 --> 00:12:39.940
In the new faith. You convert
people to the new faith.

00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:47.737
you do more programs,
you have more ashrams,

00:12:47.938 --> 00:12:51.034
you are a little bit
like a salesman of coca-cola:

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:54.789
you sell more bottles,
you give more realisations.

00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:59.781
You see, the model for this is
Paul, Saint Paul.

00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:02.164
He was never with Christ,

00:13:06.594 --> 00:13:11.206
and all of a sudden he was
the big leader in Christianity,

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:15.143
busy writing letters,
organising public programs,

00:13:15.344 --> 00:13:17.862
organising bhajan groups.

00:13:18.237 --> 00:13:20.490
We have also those characters.

00:13:20.691 --> 00:13:23.896
Now, we have to understand,
Shri Mataji did say,

00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:26.630
our job is to give realisation

00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:31.260
and our job is
to make people Sahaja yogis.

00:13:31.784 --> 00:13:35.263
But if I am not a Sahaja yogi,

00:13:35.464 --> 00:13:37.638
if I am NOT in Sahaj sthiti,

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:40.753
how am I going to do that?

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:45.763
If you want to give drawing lessons
in the school to the child,

00:13:45.964 --> 00:13:47.841
you need to know drawing.

00:13:48.042 --> 00:13:50.927
If you want to bring
to the world "The world of Sahaj",

00:13:51.128 --> 00:13:54.557
you need to manifest
the world of Sahaj.

00:13:56.448 --> 00:14:01.651
These are variations on a theme that
you know (centrifugal and centripetal).

00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:06.364
But when you see it
in the context of the 10 last years

00:14:06.565 --> 00:14:09.729
that we went through,
which were very difficult,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.953
you understand that Shri Mataji
has tested these 2 forces.

00:14:16.708 --> 00:14:22.250
And the master of the testing
is called Mahamaya,

00:14:22.602 --> 00:14:27.174
so She is the One, who tests, She is
the One, who gives the notes, not us.

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.729
What we can try
is to do our best.

00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:38.495
is to understand that
Sahaja sthiti,

00:14:38.696 --> 00:14:41.320
the reality of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:41.594 --> 00:14:46.703
is not about having ashrams,
having council,

00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:57.674
but the essence of it is to be
in that Sahaja state.

00:14:57.875 --> 00:14:59.875
And if we are honest,

00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:03.440
if we are honest
and we look at 24 hours,

00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:13.641
Because honesty brings light

00:15:13.842 --> 00:15:17.950
and in the light we see
and in seeing we correct (ourselves).

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:22.626
So this is 25 years
of Sahaja Yoga in Hungary,

00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:42.638
Ok, what is the inner religion?

00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:49.693
The inner religion means
going to the axis of planet Sahaja.

00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:53.654
Now, what is the axis
of the planet Sahaja?

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:07.958
You know the story
where there was

00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:12.482
a discussion among the...

00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:18.424
The story is that there was
a discussion among the Trimurtis -

00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:22.805
who is the biggest: is it, Shri Shiva,
is it Shri Vishnu or is it Shri Brahma?

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:26.638
And then they saw the lingam,
(symbol of Shri Shiva).

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.380
So the story goes that...

00:16:34.959 --> 00:16:40.146
So the story is that the swan
of Shri, Brahma went up

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.523
to find out,
where was the end of the lingam

00:16:43.724 --> 00:16:47.094
and Vishnu took the form
of a boar

00:16:47.295 --> 00:16:52.750
to dig into the earth to find,
where was the bottom of the lingam?

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.669
My boar is not very good, but...

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:59.161
And so they could not find it.

00:16:59.575 --> 00:17:04.195
But Brahmadeva cheated,
because He said, that He found it,

00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:11.680
So, as a result, they say, Brahmadeva
is not worshipped in India.

00:17:11.881 --> 00:17:15.180
But the sense of this anecdote

00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:19.724
is that the axis of planet Sahaj
is the lingam.

00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:26.560
And this is what Shri Mataji tells us,
when She started a public program.

00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:38.320
and, by the way, we still need to have
the courage to stand by the Truth,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.810
And the Spirit is Shri Shiva

00:17:56.631 --> 00:18:03.836
in the sense, that our consciousness
goes into the Truth of the Sahaj sthiti

00:18:04.037 --> 00:18:05.529
which is joy.

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:10.727
So the destination
of the inner religion is the axis

00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:12.789
of the Sahaja planet.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:19.112
And this is why we are also going
to celebrate Shiva puja tomorrow.

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:27.667
Our journey,
my sisters and my brothers,

00:18:27.868 --> 00:18:32.734
our journey
is the story of the return,

00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:35.657
we return home.

00:18:36.954 --> 00:18:40.893
We went through this long adventure,

00:18:41.094 --> 00:18:46.461
we went through this long picnic,
which is called human existence,

00:18:48.555 --> 00:18:51.573
and now we are
on the way to the return

00:18:51.774 --> 00:18:54.305
from where we came from.

00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:57.182
While being in human consciousness,

00:18:57.383 --> 00:19:00.612
because we came from God
and we return to God.

00:19:00.813 --> 00:19:06.958
So this is if you want,
this is a little snapshot of the axis.

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:10.351
Here you have the material world...

00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:17.109
Someone was hurt?

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.000
Yeah,
I think is safer to put it down.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:32.726
Now, this is nicely timed,

00:19:33.016 --> 00:19:36.273
because the material world
will pass away,

00:19:37.547 --> 00:19:40.424
but we will dwell in eternity,

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:42.828
because eternity is our home.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.065
On the trip the return,

00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:48.984
we are here in the material world,

00:19:52.493 --> 00:19:58.737
and there is also where you have
this play of the Maya,

00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:01.357
of the centrifugal
and the centripetal,

00:20:01.558 --> 00:20:05.779
but in the history of mankind,
in the history of religions

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:12.096
this journey took place
and first, we crossed the Devalok.

00:20:12.972 --> 00:20:19.081
Devalok is when our ancestors
worshipped the Deva.

00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:24.841
So, for instance, Zoroastrians
worshipped the Fire,

00:20:25.042 --> 00:20:27.776
the Incas worshipped Surya,

00:20:28.386 --> 00:20:31.755
the Greeks, you know,
with the pantheon,

00:20:31.956 --> 00:20:34.432
they worshipped the Devas.

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:43.088
Then, more recently, you could say,
since the invention of science,

00:20:43.289 --> 00:20:45.791
we crossed the Brahmalok.

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:49.598
Because Shri Brahma
is the great Sire of the Creation

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:54.990
and with science
we actually study what He has done.

00:20:55.191 --> 00:20:57.187
So, science is a study of God,

00:21:00.857 --> 00:21:03.031
They think they study the matter.

00:21:03.232 --> 00:21:06.672
But they study matter as done
by the Creator of matter.

00:21:06.873 --> 00:21:10.880
So the entire scientific enquiry,

00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:14.310
which brought our society
to the state, where it is now,

00:21:14.763 --> 00:21:17.177
is going through the Brahmalok.

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.891
And the next...

00:21:25.937 --> 00:21:31.552
but what happened is that,
we becoming seekers

00:21:31.753 --> 00:21:38.325
we started being an actor
in the drama of our own evolution.

00:21:38.545 --> 00:21:42.367
And seekers are not just
you and me sitting now.

00:21:42.568 --> 00:21:47.359
The pre-Socratic philosophers,
like Pythagoras

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.849
or Parmenides or...
(video pauzed)

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.766
were already dealing with the movement
of consciousness, the power of evolution.

00:21:54.967 --> 00:21:58.081
So, Boris,
I am going to finish very soon,

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.224
because we arrived to
the axis of the axis (Sushumna Nadi)

00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:05.302
and here it is, the sthiti.

00:22:05.503 --> 00:22:10.560
You know, Shri Mataji teased us
and told us to count how many people

00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:15.466
we gave realisation. But believe me,
I never counted in my entire life,

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.091
how many people
I gave realisation to,

00:22:22.073 --> 00:22:26.104
But if we get ourselves
in the sthiti state,

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:32.161
then just our being there
will raise Kundalinis.

00:22:44.503 --> 00:22:47.357
So the journey for us
is towards the Stithi,

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:52.318
because these are where then
we are going to get

00:22:52.519 --> 00:22:59.253
the blessings of Shri Shiva

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:01.588
which is Kalyan.

00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:05.255
Kalyan, there is a speech
of Shri Mataji on this,

00:23:05.456 --> 00:23:06.513
maybe you can hear it.

00:23:06.714 --> 00:23:10.620
But Kalyan is the state where we are
blessed on all sides.

00:23:24.162 --> 00:23:26.297
If we can all understand

00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:33.375
that our most important job
is to be what we claim to be

00:23:33.724 --> 00:23:35.344
- the job is done.

00:23:35.545 --> 00:23:38.271
And I am very confident

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:43.875
that we are all together
on the right path.

00:23:44.599 --> 00:23:49.491
You see, there is a relationship
between (seeking and finding)

00:23:49.692 --> 00:23:53.320
because seekers are
in the evolution bowl

00:23:53.521 --> 00:23:56.984
and yogis are not
in the evolution bowl.

00:23:57.185 --> 00:24:00.049
But there is a relationship
between the two.

00:24:01.386 --> 00:24:06.065
The link is in the name
of Shri Lakshmi,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.377
Anantasta.

00:24:11.578 --> 00:24:14.530
Because Shri Lakshmi
is the power of evolution

00:24:14.731 --> 00:24:16.994
She is the Shakti of Shri Vishnu,
She becomes Mahalakshmi,

00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:20.534
She is the power of evolution.
Mahalakshmi is the power of evolution.

00:24:20.735 --> 00:24:24.778
There is a name Shri Lakshmi, where
She is said to be Anantasta,

00:24:24.979 --> 00:24:27.992
which means She resides in eternity.

00:24:28.532 --> 00:24:31.844
So, eternity
is the eternal present,

00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:37.625
eternity is when we are
in Nirvichara Samadhi,

00:24:37.857 --> 00:24:40.107
eternity is peaceful.

00:24:40.638 --> 00:24:45.966
So, before we were evolving
through action-reaction,

00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:48.594
synthesis, disorder,

00:24:48.795 --> 00:24:50.255
petitions,

00:24:50.638 --> 00:24:54.922
letters on the e-mail,
accusing, descending

00:24:55.123 --> 00:24:57.123
- that was before.

00:24:57.442 --> 00:25:01.531
Most yogis have the intelligence
to understand

00:25:01.732 --> 00:25:03.732
that this is not our model,

00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:10.042
most yogis understand that
evolution now for us is peaceful.

00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:15.500
We don't need to do anything
- we become.

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.917
This is what Sahaj is.

00:25:20.766 --> 00:25:25.026
You will see temptations
to make out of Sahaj a cult,

00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:29.937
to make out of Sahaj a sect,
to make out of Sahaj a religion.

00:25:30.844 --> 00:25:35.018
Shri Mataji
through the 10 years of withdrawal

00:25:35.219 --> 00:25:40.667
has allowed those options
to develop in small doses,

00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:46.216
but this is processed by the collective
the consciousness of the yogis

00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:48.417
who are in Sahaja sthiti.

00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:53.135
So, you see, if we are as a collective,
we go to the Sahaj sthiti,

00:25:53.336 --> 00:25:55.674
which is the only direction
where we want to go,

00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:58.549
which is the reason
why you came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.237
We didn't come to Sahaja yoga...

00:26:01.438 --> 00:26:04.758
You came to Sahaja Yoga
to be Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

00:26:05.024 --> 00:26:07.659
And we all understand that we are all
brothers and sisters

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.797
we all want that
- there is no animosity,

00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:12.969
there is no fight,

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.917
there is forgiveness,
there is compassion

00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:19.833
but there is also the courage
to stand by the Truth,

00:26:21.657 --> 00:26:24.359
because the Truth is this
(the axis).

00:26:25.414 --> 00:26:28.807
If yogis don't have the courage
to stand by the Truth,

00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:30.906
they miss the axis,

00:26:31.157 --> 00:26:34.070
and my sense is that in

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:38.234
the collective overall there is,

00:26:38.435 --> 00:26:41.245
(even if they cannot explain it
in a speech like this),

00:26:41.446 --> 00:26:45.016
but there is an understanding
that this is what they want.

00:26:45.217 --> 00:26:48.430
And this is the reason
why there is progress in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:50.893
although you don't think so,
because you see division,

00:26:51.094 --> 00:26:58.271
you see fighting, you see various
things, but actually we are growing.

00:26:58.472 --> 00:27:02.776
There is more awareness,
there is more understanding.

00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:08.161
For instance, when we came here,
yesterday we arrived at this hotel

00:27:08.362 --> 00:27:11.802
you know,
this did not happen like that,

00:27:12.003 --> 00:27:17.375
when I was going to seminars
in Austria 25 years ago

00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:20.721
- you know, I arrived at the hotel,
I became thoughtless.

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:22.482
Why did I become thoughtless?

00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:26.169
Not because of the hotel, but otherwise
I would give him one more star.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.943
I became thoughtless
because all of you

00:27:29.144 --> 00:27:32.247
at that moment were coming,
driving towards this hotel

00:27:32.448 --> 00:27:35.924
with the desire to be
all together for this weekend.

00:27:38.268 --> 00:27:40.956
So let's have faith in ourselves.
