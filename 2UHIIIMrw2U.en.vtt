WEBVTT

00:07.552 --> 00:10.518
As I had a few minutes,
I did one or two drawings.

00:10.719 --> 00:14.471
I would like to talk to you
about planet Sahaj this morning

00:14.672 --> 00:20.732
and I would like to explain to you
this planet on which you live.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.411
And I want to explain a paradox

00:23.612 --> 00:28.411
because - the paradox is that -
we ARE AND WE ARE NOT

00:28.612 --> 00:30.753
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:31.503 --> 00:36.628
Because there is a discrepancy between
what we  say we are

00:36.956 --> 00:39.029
and we say we are yogis

00:39.230 --> 00:41.888
and what sometimes we seem to be.

00:42.089 --> 00:47.995
So people can be a little bit confused
or depressed about it.

00:48.196 --> 00:50.279
I remember sometimes
people ask me,

01:02.437 --> 01:07.273
because in August I will say
I am in Sahaj since 40 years.

01:11.854 --> 01:15.628
And then I have to look at myself
in the mirror and I say,

01:19.542 --> 01:21.427
Well, I have to explain.

01:21.628 --> 01:25.068
The explanation is very simple

01:25.269 --> 01:28.177
but Boris says to know
that with the translation...

01:31.737 --> 01:35.591
See, Shri Mataji has explained to me
how Adi Kundalini

01:35.792 --> 01:38.846
was awakened in Nargol,

01:39.784 --> 01:42.161
on the border of the Indian ocean.

01:42.362 --> 01:47.619
Shri Mataji has explained to me how
Adi Kundalini was awakened in Nargol

01:47.847 --> 01:50.740
And it looks a bit like a Krimi
(a spy novel in German)

01:50.941 --> 01:56.943
because She went there
to spy on a rakshasa

01:57.771 --> 02:01.401
who had there a seminar.

02:02.135 --> 02:04.396
Because there was a big Rajnish camp,

02:04.597 --> 02:08.245
and Shri Mataji went there to see
what was happening.

02:09.097 --> 02:13.878
Then, what She told me
is that She could see

02:14.159 --> 02:19.003
with Her yogic powers how Rajnish
was possessing everybody.

02:19.347 --> 02:24.990
And then what She said
is that She realised

02:25.191 --> 02:30.987
that advent (of Evil) was much more
advanced than what She thought.

02:38.105 --> 02:40.500
but basically, this was
what She was saying.

02:40.701 --> 02:44.943
And She felt that if it
would not happen now,

02:45.144 --> 02:49.807
on mass realisation,
mankind would be destroyed.

02:50.167 --> 02:54.432
We are talking about
May 1970, so ... you can see.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.020
We take our time towards destruction.

02:57.221 --> 03:01.648
So, then comes
the important bit of the story:

03:01.890 --> 03:05.992
Then She described how She was
sitting under this tree,

03:06.193 --> 03:11.630
and then the Adi Kundalini, you know,
just rose, and She described it.

03:12.662 --> 03:19.609
But what She says is that
the Kundalini was released,

03:19.810 --> 03:26.740
although mankind was not ready,
this is the important thing.

03:26.998 --> 03:30.763
And this explains
what is going on today.

03:31.162 --> 03:35.382
You see, when in the past
people would get their realisation,

03:35.583 --> 03:40.180
they would get their realisation
having cleaned the entire system:

03:40.381 --> 03:43.180
all the chakras were clean,

03:43.381 --> 03:47.242
the attention was Nirmal,
the attention was purer,

03:47.443 --> 03:50.647
nobody could get (caught up),
no question being possessed,

03:50.848 --> 03:54.940
people had reached the level
where Kundalini would rise.

03:55.326 --> 04:00.111
What Shri Mataji did,
because She is the overlord,

04:00.312 --> 04:03.417
overlord of the entire system:

04:03.618 --> 04:06.533
She rewrote the Divine books.

04:06.734 --> 04:09.966
She did something that no Deity,

04:10.167 --> 04:11.943
no avatar,

04:12.144 --> 04:16.526
no saint has or could
ever do before Her.

04:17.050 --> 04:21.409
She gave realisation to people,
who were not prepared.

04:21.792 --> 04:27.932
And that also explained
the 10 last years of Her life,

04:28.151 --> 04:32.323
where She said
She would go into sanyasa.

04:32.524 --> 04:35.771
We think She would go to Pratishtan
and withdraw, but no,

04:35.972 --> 04:38.325
She went into a condition,

04:38.526 --> 04:44.029
in which She withdrew Her attention
apparently from Her physical form,

04:44.230 --> 04:48.565
and that for 10 years,
and it was a tremendous tapasya!

04:49.480 --> 04:54.075
And we understand
that She did this to (purify us)

04:54.276 --> 04:59.684
Because She says She took...
She took us all unprepared

04:59.885 --> 05:03.224
as we are sahaja yogis
in Her cosmic body.

05:03.425 --> 05:06.737
so She did that tapasya

05:06.938 --> 05:12.930
to purify all the options of what
would happen, once She leaves.

05:13.305 --> 05:16.773
That basically now
it is up to us.

05:17.078 --> 05:19.878
You know, I told you,
how on the animal channel

05:20.079 --> 05:24.362
we watch how the mumy bear is
throwing their kids into the wilderness,

05:24.563 --> 05:26.933
the little bears,
they want to stay with mummy,

05:27.134 --> 05:29.331
but they cannot do it,
because she keeps them away.

05:32.378 --> 05:34.221
are going to become big bears

05:34.422 --> 05:36.474
and they can survive,
that's why she does it.

05:36.675 --> 05:44.463
And this 10 years when She withdrew,
let's say 2003 - 2013, more or less.

05:45.042 --> 05:49.596
But this also explains
why we are yogis

05:49.847 --> 05:52.560
and some of us
are still struggling,

05:52.761 --> 05:57.888
because the work, that we didn't do
before, the rising of the Kundalini,

05:58.089 --> 06:01.490
we need to do it after
the rising of the Kundalini.

06:01.691 --> 06:03.442
And if we understand that,

06:03.643 --> 06:07.174
we don't feel bad
about any difficulties.

06:08.080 --> 06:13.568
So, now to understand
a bit about how this thing works,

06:18.472 --> 06:21.276
(German?)

06:53.434 --> 06:57.888
There are 2 forces
that we are dealing with:

06:59.021 --> 07:06.875
one is the centripetal force,
which takes you in,

07:07.422 --> 07:13.750
and one is the centrifugal force,
which takes you out.

07:14.381 --> 07:19.232
Now, in one tape Shri Mataji says,
- it's not so reassuring -

07:19.433 --> 07:23.612
but She says, this force is anxious
to throw you out.

07:24.073 --> 07:29.018
So that corresponds
to 2 types of religion:

07:34.269 --> 07:36.507
one is the inner religion,

07:36.708 --> 07:41.724
which corresponds
to the centripetal movement,

07:41.925 --> 07:45.698
and the centrifugal religion
takes you out.

07:46.089 --> 07:48.713
Ok?
The external religion.

07:49.433 --> 07:53.503
So Shri Mataji, She asked
in public and in private,

08:02.614 --> 08:03.992
Ok, so

08:06.086 --> 08:10.453
what is the inner religion?

08:15.704 --> 08:19.055
The external religion is

08:21.086 --> 08:24.555
that you do not...

08:24.985 --> 08:29.289
Ok. The internal religion is
Sahaja sthiti

08:36.813 --> 08:41.518
And this is what you all know, when
you are in thoughtless awareness,

08:41.719 --> 08:46.164
when you are in love when you are
in peace, when you are in Sahasrara.

08:46.594 --> 08:52.096
But because of this process
of purification in unprepared yogis

08:52.297 --> 08:56.499
was not completed,
we are not always in Sahaj sthiti,

08:56.700 --> 08:58.820
when we call ourselves Sahaja Yogis,

08:59.021 --> 09:02.687
so we face the temptation
of external religions

09:02.888 --> 09:07.180
and this is what Shri Mataji
has tested for the last 10 years.

09:09.573 --> 09:13.316
You see, if we are in Sahaja sthiti,

09:13.517 --> 09:17.211
the authority is within ourselves.

09:29.995 --> 09:33.255
because you will feel my vibrations

09:33.456 --> 09:36.904
and you will know
that what I say is true.

09:37.105 --> 09:39.068
That is the sthiti.

09:39.269 --> 09:43.310
But we, if we are not
in Sahaj sthiti, then

09:43.511 --> 09:47.104
we look for the authority outside,

09:47.441 --> 09:48.979
ok?
Outside.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.676
External religion
look for authority outside.

09:51.877 --> 09:54.512
So, for instance, you are...
(video paused)

09:54.713 --> 10:00.122
So when... of the Catholic
or the Sunni model, where somebody

10:01.917 --> 10:05.802
will follow the pope or the caliph

10:06.003 --> 10:09.786
in the name of Christ
or in the name of Allah.

10:09.987 --> 10:13.812
They don't follow Christ or Allah,
they follow the pope or the caliph.

10:14.013 --> 10:17.749
This model of externalisation
we had to test it,

10:17.950 --> 10:21.187
because in our collectivity
we did have some people,

10:21.388 --> 10:24.568
who would follow one individual
or another,

10:24.769 --> 10:27.296
thinking that this is the authority
we have to follow.

10:27.497 --> 10:29.805
But if we keep our discrimination,

10:30.006 --> 10:34.789
we take all the inputs that
we have to, but we follow Shri Mataji

10:34.990 --> 10:36.990
only like Shri Ganesha.

10:38.076 --> 10:41.266
Now, another temptation
of external religion,

10:41.467 --> 10:45.005
which also has been tested
is hierarchies.

10:45.841 --> 10:48.638
Hierarchies.

10:49.248 --> 10:52.742
You see if you have
bureaucrats as leaders,

10:52.943 --> 10:57.227
then, you know, like a shoemaker,
he is making shoes,

10:57.428 --> 11:01.849
a bureaucrat is making bureaucracies.
I am a bureaucrat, I know.

11:02.584 --> 11:06.906
I ended my career acting
Assistant Secretary General,

11:07.107 --> 11:11.578
and I was... You know, when we were
in the castle with Shri Mataji, I was

11:11.779 --> 11:15.289
a bit naughty,
I was sort of teasing Sir CP

11:22.490 --> 11:25.266
But you see,
the business of our democrats...

11:25.467 --> 11:32.463
because we have
the temptation for hierarchy,

11:32.664 --> 11:34.982
we have the temptation
for bureaucracy,

11:35.183 --> 11:38.154
we have the temptation
for rules and regulations

11:38.355 --> 11:41.491
and some people
even wrote the rules

11:41.692 --> 11:44.613
how to take vibrations
with little envelopes.

11:44.814 --> 11:49.182
All of a sudden, we were in the world
of complete idiocy.

11:52.836 --> 11:54.703
Where did you get lost?

12:00.114 --> 12:03.388
You see, with bureaucracy
you get lost anyway.

12:06.302 --> 12:09.094
Then another temptation
of external religion,

12:09.295 --> 12:12.654
because you structure
all this nicely

12:13.138 --> 12:17.924
and it's like the shell,
but the sthiti is not there.

12:18.125 --> 12:21.715
Because the more shell you have,
the less sthiti you have.

12:22.176 --> 12:25.952
So, you see, another temptation
you have to understand,

12:26.153 --> 12:29.027
of the external religion, is

12:32.101 --> 12:34.844
is to convert to the new faith.

12:36.063 --> 12:39.940
In the new faith. You convert
people to the new faith.

12:44.071 --> 12:47.737
you do more programs,
you have more ashrams,

12:47.938 --> 12:51.034
you are a little bit
like a salesman of coca-cola:

12:51.235 --> 12:54.789
you sell more bottles,
you give more realisations.

12:55.305 --> 12:59.781
You see, the model for this is
Paul, Saint Paul.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.164
He was never with Christ,

13:06.594 --> 13:11.206
and all of a sudden he was
the big leader in Christianity,

13:11.407 --> 13:15.143
busy writing letters,
organising public programs,

13:15.344 --> 13:17.862
organising bhajan groups.

13:18.237 --> 13:20.490
We have also those characters.

13:20.691 --> 13:23.896
Now, we have to understand,
Shri Mataji did say,

13:24.097 --> 13:26.630
our job is to give realisation

13:26.831 --> 13:31.260
and our job is
to make people Sahaja yogis.

13:31.784 --> 13:35.263
But if I am not a Sahaja yogi,

13:35.464 --> 13:37.638
if I am NOT in Sahaj sthiti,

13:37.839 --> 13:40.753
how am I going to do that?

13:41.292 --> 13:45.763
If you want to give drawing lessons
in the school to the child,

13:45.964 --> 13:47.841
you need to know drawing.

13:48.042 --> 13:50.927
If you want to bring
to the world "The world of Sahaj",

13:51.128 --> 13:54.557
you need to manifest
the world of Sahaj.

13:56.448 --> 14:01.651
These are variations on a theme that
you know (centrifugal and centripetal).

14:02.042 --> 14:06.364
But when you see it
in the context of the 10 last years

14:06.565 --> 14:09.729
that we went through,
which were very difficult,

14:09.930 --> 14:14.953
you understand that Shri Mataji
has tested these 2 forces.

14:16.708 --> 14:22.250
And the master of the testing
is called Mahamaya,

14:22.602 --> 14:27.174
so She is the One, who tests, She is
the One, who gives the notes, not us.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.729
What we can try
is to do our best.

14:33.141 --> 14:38.495
is to understand that
Sahaja sthiti,

14:38.696 --> 14:41.320
the reality of Sahaja Yoga,

14:41.594 --> 14:46.703
is not about having ashrams,
having council,

14:53.571 --> 14:57.674
but the essence of it is to be
in that Sahaja state.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.875
And if we are honest,

15:00.141 --> 15:03.440
if we are honest
and we look at 24 hours,

15:11.641 --> 15:13.641
Because honesty brings light

15:13.842 --> 15:17.950
and in the light we see
and in seeing we correct (ourselves).

15:18.167 --> 15:22.626
So this is 25 years
of Sahaja Yoga in Hungary,

15:39.678 --> 15:42.638
Ok, what is the inner religion?

15:44.083 --> 15:49.693
The inner religion means
going to the axis of planet Sahaja.

15:49.958 --> 15:53.654
Now, what is the axis
of the planet Sahaja?

16:04.379 --> 16:07.958
You know the story
where there was

16:09.451 --> 16:12.482
a discussion among the...

16:14.904 --> 16:18.424
The story is that there was
a discussion among the Trimurtis -

16:18.625 --> 16:22.805
who is the biggest: is it, Shri Shiva,
is it Shri Vishnu or is it Shri Brahma?

16:23.006 --> 16:26.638
And then they saw the lingam,
(symbol of Shri Shiva).

16:26.990 --> 16:30.380
So the story goes that...

16:34.959 --> 16:40.146
So the story is that the swan
of Shri, Brahma went up

16:40.630 --> 16:43.523
to find out,
where was the end of the lingam

16:43.724 --> 16:47.094
and Vishnu took the form
of a boar

16:47.295 --> 16:52.750
to dig into the earth to find,
where was the bottom of the lingam?

16:52.990 --> 16:55.669
My boar is not very good, but...

16:56.482 --> 16:59.161
And so they could not find it.

16:59.575 --> 17:04.195
But Brahmadeva cheated,
because He said, that He found it,

17:07.941 --> 17:11.680
So, as a result, they say, Brahmadeva
is not worshipped in India.

17:11.881 --> 17:15.180
But the sense of this anecdote

17:15.381 --> 17:19.724
is that the axis of planet Sahaj
is the lingam.

17:20.917 --> 17:26.560
And this is what Shri Mataji tells us,
when She started a public program.

17:33.021 --> 17:38.320
and, by the way, we still need to have
the courage to stand by the Truth,

17:49.500 --> 17:55.810
And the Spirit is Shri Shiva

17:56.631 --> 18:03.836
in the sense, that our consciousness
goes into the Truth of the Sahaj sthiti

18:04.037 --> 18:05.529
which is joy.

18:05.771 --> 18:10.727
So the destination
of the inner religion is the axis

18:10.928 --> 18:12.789
of the Sahaja planet.

18:12.990 --> 18:19.112
And this is why we are also going
to celebrate Shiva puja tomorrow.

18:23.289 --> 18:27.667
Our journey,
my sisters and my brothers,

18:27.868 --> 18:32.734
our journey
is the story of the return,

18:33.657 --> 18:35.657
we return home.

18:36.954 --> 18:40.893
We went through this long adventure,

18:41.094 --> 18:46.461
we went through this long picnic,
which is called human existence,

18:48.555 --> 18:51.573
and now we are
on the way to the return

18:51.774 --> 18:54.305
from where we came from.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.182
While being in human consciousness,

18:57.383 --> 19:00.612
because we came from God
and we return to God.

19:00.813 --> 19:06.958
So this is if you want,
this is a little snapshot of the axis.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.351
Here you have the material world...

19:15.289 --> 19:17.109
Someone was hurt?

19:24.180 --> 19:27.000
Yeah,
I think is safer to put it down.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.726
Now, this is nicely timed,

19:33.016 --> 19:36.273
because the material world
will pass away,

19:37.547 --> 19:40.424
but we will dwell in eternity,

19:40.625 --> 19:42.828
because eternity is our home.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.065
On the trip the return,

19:46.266 --> 19:48.984
we are here in the material world,

19:52.493 --> 19:58.737
and there is also where you have
this play of the Maya,

19:58.938 --> 20:01.357
of the centrifugal
and the centripetal,

20:01.558 --> 20:05.779
but in the history of mankind,
in the history of religions

20:05.980 --> 20:12.096
this journey took place
and first, we crossed the Devalok.

20:12.972 --> 20:19.081
Devalok is when our ancestors
worshipped the Deva.

20:19.831 --> 20:24.841
So, for instance, Zoroastrians
worshipped the Fire,

20:25.042 --> 20:27.776
the Incas worshipped Surya,

20:28.386 --> 20:31.755
the Greeks, you know,
with the pantheon,

20:31.956 --> 20:34.432
they worshipped the Devas.

20:35.362 --> 20:43.088
Then, more recently, you could say,
since the invention of science,

20:43.289 --> 20:45.791
we crossed the Brahmalok.

20:46.033 --> 20:49.598
Because Shri Brahma
is the great Sire of the Creation

20:49.799 --> 20:54.990
and with science
we actually study what He has done.

20:55.191 --> 20:57.187
So, science is a study of God,

21:00.857 --> 21:03.031
They think they study the matter.

21:03.232 --> 21:06.672
But they study matter as done
by the Creator of matter.

21:06.873 --> 21:10.880
So the entire scientific enquiry,

21:11.081 --> 21:14.310
which brought our society
to the state, where it is now,

21:14.763 --> 21:17.177
is going through the Brahmalok.

21:17.381 --> 21:18.891
And the next...

21:25.937 --> 21:31.552
but what happened is that,
we becoming seekers

21:31.753 --> 21:38.325
we started being an actor
in the drama of our own evolution.

21:38.545 --> 21:42.367
And seekers are not just
you and me sitting now.

21:42.568 --> 21:47.359
The pre-Socratic philosophers,
like Pythagoras

21:47.560 --> 21:49.849
or Parmenides or...
(video pauzed)

21:50.050 --> 21:54.766
were already dealing with the movement
of consciousness, the power of evolution.

21:54.967 --> 21:58.081
So, Boris,
I am going to finish very soon,

21:58.580 --> 22:03.224
because we arrived to
the axis of the axis (Sushumna Nadi)

22:03.425 --> 22:05.302
and here it is, the sthiti.

22:05.503 --> 22:10.560
You know, Shri Mataji teased us
and told us to count how many people

22:10.761 --> 22:15.466
we gave realisation. But believe me,
I never counted in my entire life,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.091
how many people
I gave realisation to,

22:22.073 --> 22:26.104
But if we get ourselves
in the sthiti state,

22:26.620 --> 22:32.161
then just our being there
will raise Kundalinis.

22:44.503 --> 22:47.357
So the journey for us
is towards the Stithi,

22:47.558 --> 22:52.318
because these are where then
we are going to get

22:52.519 --> 22:59.253
the blessings of Shri Shiva

22:59.472 --> 23:01.588
which is Kalyan.

23:02.409 --> 23:05.255
Kalyan, there is a speech
of Shri Mataji on this,

23:05.456 --> 23:06.513
maybe you can hear it.

23:06.714 --> 23:10.620
But Kalyan is the state where we are
blessed on all sides.

23:24.162 --> 23:26.297
If we can all understand

23:26.498 --> 23:33.375
that our most important job
is to be what we claim to be

23:33.724 --> 23:35.344
- the job is done.

23:35.545 --> 23:38.271
And I am very confident

23:38.623 --> 23:43.875
that we are all together
on the right path.

23:44.599 --> 23:49.491
You see, there is a relationship
between (seeking and finding)

23:49.692 --> 23:53.320
because seekers are
in the evolution bowl

23:53.521 --> 23:56.984
and yogis are not
in the evolution bowl.

23:57.185 --> 24:00.049
But there is a relationship
between the two.

24:01.386 --> 24:06.065
The link is in the name
of Shri Lakshmi,

24:09.680 --> 24:11.377
Anantasta.

24:11.578 --> 24:14.530
Because Shri Lakshmi
is the power of evolution

24:14.731 --> 24:16.994
She is the Shakti of Shri Vishnu,
She becomes Mahalakshmi,

24:17.195 --> 24:20.534
She is the power of evolution.
Mahalakshmi is the power of evolution.

24:20.735 --> 24:24.778
There is a name Shri Lakshmi, where
She is said to be Anantasta,

24:24.979 --> 24:27.992
which means She resides in eternity.

24:28.532 --> 24:31.844
So, eternity
is the eternal present,

24:32.672 --> 24:37.625
eternity is when we are
in Nirvichara Samadhi,

24:37.857 --> 24:40.107
eternity is peaceful.

24:40.638 --> 24:45.966
So, before we were evolving
through action-reaction,

24:46.167 --> 24:48.594
synthesis, disorder,

24:48.795 --> 24:50.255
petitions,

24:50.638 --> 24:54.922
letters on the e-mail,
accusing, descending

24:55.123 --> 24:57.123
- that was before.

24:57.442 --> 25:01.531
Most yogis have the intelligence
to understand

25:01.732 --> 25:03.732
that this is not our model,

25:03.933 --> 25:10.042
most yogis understand that
evolution now for us is peaceful.

25:11.579 --> 25:15.500
We don't need to do anything
- we become.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.917
This is what Sahaj is.

25:20.766 --> 25:25.026
You will see temptations
to make out of Sahaj a cult,

25:25.227 --> 25:29.937
to make out of Sahaj a sect,
to make out of Sahaj a religion.

25:30.844 --> 25:35.018
Shri Mataji
through the 10 years of withdrawal

25:35.219 --> 25:40.667
has allowed those options
to develop in small doses,

25:41.211 --> 25:46.216
but this is processed by the collective
the consciousness of the yogis

25:46.417 --> 25:48.417
who are in Sahaja sthiti.

25:48.711 --> 25:53.135
So, you see, if we are as a collective,
we go to the Sahaj sthiti,

25:53.336 --> 25:55.674
which is the only direction
where we want to go,

25:55.875 --> 25:58.549
which is the reason
why you came to Sahaja Yoga.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.237
We didn't come to Sahaja yoga...

26:01.438 --> 26:04.758
You came to Sahaja Yoga
to be Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

26:05.024 --> 26:07.659
And we all understand that we are all
brothers and sisters

26:07.860 --> 26:10.797
we all want that
- there is no animosity,

26:11.172 --> 26:12.969
there is no fight,

26:13.180 --> 26:15.917
there is forgiveness,
there is compassion

26:16.118 --> 26:19.833
but there is also the courage
to stand by the Truth,

26:21.657 --> 26:24.359
because the Truth is this
(the axis).

26:25.414 --> 26:28.807
If yogis don't have the courage
to stand by the Truth,

26:29.008 --> 26:30.906
they miss the axis,

26:31.157 --> 26:34.070
and my sense is that in

26:34.875 --> 26:38.234
the collective overall there is,

26:38.435 --> 26:41.245
(even if they cannot explain it
in a speech like this),

26:41.446 --> 26:45.016
but there is an understanding
that this is what they want.

26:45.217 --> 26:48.430
And this is the reason
why there is progress in Sahaja Yoga,

26:48.631 --> 26:50.893
although you don't think so,
because you see division,

26:51.094 --> 26:58.271
you see fighting, you see various
things, but actually we are growing.

26:58.472 --> 27:02.776
There is more awareness,
there is more understanding.

27:03.151 --> 27:08.161
For instance, when we came here,
yesterday we arrived at this hotel

27:08.362 --> 27:11.802
you know,
this did not happen like that,

27:12.003 --> 27:17.375
when I was going to seminars
in Austria 25 years ago

27:17.667 --> 27:20.721
- you know, I arrived at the hotel,
I became thoughtless.

27:20.922 --> 27:22.482
Why did I become thoughtless?

27:22.683 --> 27:26.169
Not because of the hotel, but otherwise
I would give him one more star.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.943
I became thoughtless
because all of you

27:29.144 --> 27:32.247
at that moment were coming,
driving towards this hotel

27:32.448 --> 27:35.924
with the desire to be
all together for this weekend.

27:38.268 --> 27:40.956
So let's have faith in ourselves.
