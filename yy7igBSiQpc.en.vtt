WEBVTT

00:14.120 --> 00:21.990
but today I am going to tell you

00:16.200 --> 00:26.070
something more which we have to it's

00:21.990 --> 00:32.250
very important to know because as was

00:26.070 --> 00:33.690
described by people that again the

00:32.250 --> 00:43.470
practice sahaja yoga as they go to

00:33.690 --> 00:49.379
church but is not from their heart and

00:43.470 --> 00:55.229
heart the abode of the spirit is the

00:49.379 --> 01:02.030
Shiva within us so we have to know more

00:55.229 --> 01:02.030
about heart and that is very important

01:02.420 --> 01:09.720
you know about these three noddies we

01:05.040 --> 01:13.070
have me rapping de suzuna but in the

01:09.720 --> 01:13.070
heart there are for nerds

01:15.930 --> 01:26.520
and the one nerdy goes to mooladhara and

01:23.820 --> 01:29.480
if you cross the limits of mooladhara it

01:26.520 --> 01:34.230
goes to hell that's why they say that

01:29.480 --> 01:39.480
Shiva is a destroyer actually you asked

01:34.230 --> 01:48.960
for your destruction and when you asked

01:39.480 --> 01:52.070
for your destruction you have it even if

01:48.960 --> 01:57.450
it destroys everything as I was telling

01:52.070 --> 02:01.530
it's like when a fruit has to come the

01:57.450 --> 02:03.510
petals look as if they're destroyed as I

02:01.530 --> 02:06.119
have destroyed I would say many of your

02:03.510 --> 02:08.550
things you can call it like your

02:06.119 --> 02:10.649
conditionings your ego your rationalism

02:08.550 --> 02:12.620
your fanaticism all this has been

02:10.649 --> 02:17.070
destroyed it is a job

02:12.620 --> 02:27.600
this has to be destroyed for the beauty

02:17.070 --> 02:33.860
to come out so when your maryadas cross

02:27.600 --> 02:40.410
beyond certain point you go to your

02:33.860 --> 02:44.010
destruction in four directions

02:40.410 --> 02:51.690
there are destructions made as there are

02:44.010 --> 02:55.470
four NARAS so now what is to be done how

02:51.690 --> 02:59.780
are we to stop this destruction of the

02:55.470 --> 02:59.780
through the first daddy going to hell

03:00.140 --> 03:07.709
one of the qualities of Shiva is that

03:04.019 --> 03:10.500
his innocence this extremely innocent is

03:07.709 --> 03:13.280
innocent like a child his innocence

03:10.500 --> 03:13.280
personified

03:14.970 --> 03:36.760
so we have to put our carnal desires

03:27.960 --> 03:44.230
dissolve them dissolve them into the

03:36.760 --> 03:46.630
innocence the ocean of innocence you

03:44.230 --> 03:55.870
have to dissolve it in the ocean of

03:46.630 --> 03:59.530
innocence innocence is something to be

03:55.870 --> 04:03.100
appreciated to be understood to be

03:59.530 --> 04:09.640
enjoyed like you see animals they're

04:03.100 --> 04:15.000
innocent you see children they're

04:09.640 --> 04:22.120
innocent flowers they are innocent

04:15.000 --> 04:24.420
divert your attention to all these

04:22.120 --> 04:24.420
things

04:28.139 --> 04:37.229
you see unlocking on the street what is

04:33.030 --> 04:43.229
there to see West is all like three feet

04:37.229 --> 04:47.460
height you see at three feet height all

04:43.229 --> 04:49.740
the flowers all the beautiful grass all

04:47.460 --> 04:51.830
the children who are about three feet

04:49.740 --> 04:54.180
are the best

04:51.830 --> 05:06.509
we need not see people who are above

04:54.180 --> 05:09.689
that just see on three feet level you

05:06.509 --> 05:15.240
can see the legs of somebody that's

05:09.689 --> 05:19.340
alright but you don't see the eyes of a

05:15.240 --> 05:19.340
person who are not innocent

05:19.580 --> 05:33.680
so dissolve this desire a little antenna

05:26.129 --> 05:38.870
cells and this mullet Aramis is innocent

05:33.680 --> 05:38.870
is not dead finished but is innocent

05:38.930 --> 05:45.710
it is righteous

05:41.270 --> 05:45.710
it is recognizes qualities

05:46.540 --> 05:53.140
it's pure so even if you are in this

05:50.980 --> 05:57.300
world even if you are living like a

05:53.140 --> 06:05.710
human being even if you have children

05:57.300 --> 06:09.490
still you are ignorant the second noreen

06:05.710 --> 06:12.060
the second child that can take you to

06:09.490 --> 06:14.170
destruction is desire

06:12.060 --> 06:17.170
that's why Buddha said that

06:14.170 --> 06:23.590
desirelessness is the only way that

06:17.170 --> 06:25.540
people do not get old not sick not

06:23.590 --> 06:28.619
worried

06:25.540 --> 06:28.619
[Music]

06:28.950 --> 06:39.360
now this desire that we have I want this

06:35.580 --> 06:41.770
the West is much more than anywhere else

06:39.360 --> 06:46.360
because the enterpreneurs are every day

06:41.770 --> 06:52.710
producing new things desires can be of

06:46.360 --> 06:52.710
any kind not only material the desires

06:52.860 --> 06:58.440
could be also quite mental

06:59.589 --> 07:08.589
I must possess this woman I must possess

07:04.059 --> 07:13.359
this child all kinds of positions that

07:08.589 --> 07:18.489
work into you as desires I wouldn't say

07:13.359 --> 07:24.029
it is because of attachment it's not

07:18.489 --> 07:24.029
attachment but it is just to have more

07:28.529 --> 07:36.779
go on adding up things getting things

07:38.849 --> 07:50.019
still one doesn't feel happy and

07:42.099 --> 07:52.689
satisfied what is the reason for this

07:50.019 --> 07:57.239
kind of desire is that it's not pure

07:52.689 --> 08:00.489
desire it's an impure desire

07:57.239 --> 08:03.989
it's an impure desire and when such a

08:00.489 --> 08:07.479
desire starts working you can go any far

08:03.989 --> 08:10.299
like Saddam Hussein like Hitler like

08:07.479 --> 08:20.019
anything is nothing but absolutely

08:10.299 --> 08:24.610
desired beyond any limitations you want

08:20.019 --> 08:26.999
to dominate others is also another

08:24.610 --> 08:26.999
desire

08:28.960 --> 08:40.289
all these desires lead you ultimately to

08:34.539 --> 08:47.200
a destruction because there's no joy

08:40.289 --> 08:55.660
there's no happiness for example now I

08:47.200 --> 09:00.430
want to have a sorry so I want to buy

08:55.660 --> 09:02.290
aside all my attention will be how we

09:00.430 --> 09:06.570
like in that sorry I must get that sorry

09:02.290 --> 09:11.140
this thing that thing the attention

09:06.570 --> 09:13.959
becomes polluted disturbed for a

09:11.140 --> 09:19.630
nonsensical thing like a sorry the

09:13.959 --> 09:25.150
attention which has to enjoy which has

09:19.630 --> 09:32.290
to enjoy the spirit which has to nourish

09:25.150 --> 09:36.279
the spirit becomes disturbed because of

09:32.290 --> 09:40.480
desires in the first place

09:36.279 --> 09:45.940
the attention is disturbed because we

09:40.480 --> 09:50.620
are not innocent in the second place the

09:45.940 --> 09:53.160
attention gets into turmoil because we

09:50.620 --> 09:53.160
have desire

09:57.029 --> 10:07.800
so what should we do as far as the

10:00.930 --> 10:16.470
desire is culture a desire for beautiful

10:07.800 --> 10:20.459
things we can shift our desire material

10:16.470 --> 10:24.709
desire into aesthetics I have one thing

10:20.459 --> 10:24.709
but which is really aesthetically rich

10:25.370 --> 10:36.240
so whatever you desire if you start it

10:29.250 --> 10:40.120
working it out desiring for something

10:36.240 --> 10:43.240
aesthetically handmade nicely

10:40.120 --> 10:43.240
[Music]

10:44.060 --> 10:51.180
gradually you'll find will end up with

10:47.700 --> 10:56.580
vibrations because all beautiful things

10:51.180 --> 11:01.220
have vibrations and to have the

10:56.580 --> 11:01.220
vibrations you have to go to pure desire

11:01.460 --> 11:12.410
so this desire which is madness which

11:05.790 --> 11:18.090
makes you mad which is so much darlin

11:12.410 --> 11:21.360
boring becomes pure desire because you

11:18.090 --> 11:24.000
have to dissolve all your desires into

11:21.360 --> 11:27.990
vibration you to start desiring nothing

11:24.000 --> 11:30.180
but vibrations after self so if you have

11:27.990 --> 11:39.110
vibrations that doesn't mean that they

11:30.180 --> 11:46.140
are something dry no it means the joy of

11:39.110 --> 11:51.630
nothing Mukti is you cannot adoration

11:46.140 --> 11:55.440
this that it's the ocean of love that is

11:51.630 --> 12:03.720
God you just get dressed into it there's

11:55.440 --> 12:09.200
no word stood and that is what when you

12:03.720 --> 12:18.450
feel you must know that you have taken

12:09.200 --> 12:25.580
the spirit as a real connection between

12:18.450 --> 12:25.580
you and your mother or your father

12:26.570 --> 12:41.430
there's no differentiation you are one

12:35.730 --> 12:45.300
in that ocean grazed in the ocean

12:41.430 --> 12:50.040
you are the drop you are the ocean you

12:45.300 --> 12:56.880
are one in that nothing and that but

12:50.040 --> 13:08.670
they cannot be mechanical because not

12:56.880 --> 13:10.890
man-made so to enjoy sahaja yoga you

13:08.670 --> 13:15.890
must know that it's not dry vibrations

13:10.890 --> 13:21.600
only but misty bhakti

13:15.890 --> 13:29.360
that is the joy of choise quality

13:21.600 --> 13:32.300
quality of joy that he adds to our life

13:29.360 --> 13:36.900
everything seems to be surrounded

13:32.300 --> 13:40.830
resounding same thing the joy that I'm

13:36.900 --> 13:47.330
loved so much by God that God God loves

13:40.830 --> 13:54.830
me that I have a meaning in life then

13:47.330 --> 13:58.840
the ego drops out first of all and also

13:54.830 --> 14:01.690
the conditionings drop

13:58.840 --> 14:05.920
[Music]

14:01.690 --> 14:05.920
now the third Nadi

14:07.750 --> 14:16.580
[Music]

14:10.480 --> 14:23.420
3rd Nadi is the Nadi by which we feel

14:16.580 --> 14:28.130
attached attached to someone like this

14:23.420 --> 14:33.890
is my child this is my husband this is

14:28.130 --> 14:39.470
my family this is my wife this is my

14:33.890 --> 14:42.220
father this is my mother in the

14:39.470 --> 14:48.590
beginning of sahaja yoga of everyone

14:42.220 --> 14:52.970
when they are just the beginners so they

14:48.590 --> 14:55.100
talk about their whole family my father

14:52.970 --> 14:58.040
is like this my mother is seeing my

14:55.100 --> 15:02.410
mother sisters brothers these that's

14:58.040 --> 15:05.840
real this thing is not right

15:02.410 --> 15:12.340
as if you see we all have taken a

15:05.840 --> 15:12.340
contract what should I do

15:12.400 --> 15:19.250
so now this so-called limited love what

15:17.720 --> 15:25.730
is the solution which takes you to

15:19.250 --> 15:30.820
destruction is the unlimited because

15:25.730 --> 15:30.820
Shiva is nothing but love is love

15:33.270 --> 15:46.570
now is that corrects that nourishes that

15:41.380 --> 15:53.140
wants your benevolence that's what you

15:46.570 --> 16:02.320
eyes it wants your benevolence it looks

15:53.140 --> 16:04.780
after your benevolence so when you are

16:02.320 --> 16:15.460
looking after the benevolence of others

16:04.780 --> 16:19.870
wait now then the whole life changes the

16:15.460 --> 16:22.780
whole pattern changes and you really

16:19.870 --> 16:26.020
enjoy it because you become one with so

16:22.780 --> 16:32.410
many concern that so many families so

16:26.020 --> 16:34.860
many things many problems of others sir

16:32.410 --> 16:40.330
it just feels you are born with so many

16:34.860 --> 16:44.620
all this is the most enjoyable

16:40.330 --> 16:49.140
I mean why all this is for there after

16:44.620 --> 16:49.140
all think about yourself why am I here

16:50.820 --> 17:00.250
I'm here to enjoy everyone everyone they

16:55.870 --> 17:05.290
are all realized Souls such beautiful

17:00.250 --> 17:15.489
lotuses I am NOT going to stoop down to

17:05.290 --> 17:21.709
the mud now I am aloneness that

17:15.489 --> 17:25.399
is the way you open the heart the Lotus

17:21.709 --> 17:30.349
of your heart and the fragrance of such

17:25.399 --> 17:38.229
a person it's so beautiful it's so

17:30.349 --> 17:40.729
beautiful so you are no more divisive

17:38.229 --> 17:45.139
you do not want to separate from each

17:40.729 --> 17:47.720
other anywhere is done you are agreeable

17:45.139 --> 17:50.450
to that you don't think that it will be

17:47.720 --> 17:57.429
done here or there or there but anywhere

17:50.450 --> 18:00.080
but should be all of us together so

17:57.429 --> 18:04.519
they're small attachments that are with

18:00.080 --> 18:08.979
you have to be dissolved into this ocean

18:04.519 --> 18:08.979
of love which is Shiva

18:15.050 --> 18:22.820
fourth one is the most important for all

18:19.730 --> 18:24.410
of us is to know that there's a nerdy

18:22.820 --> 18:29.840
which passes through the official

18:24.410 --> 18:35.990
different into the heart starts from the

18:29.840 --> 18:45.170
heart goes up passes through our gap it

18:35.990 --> 18:49.970
has four petals opens up this is the one

18:45.170 --> 18:55.550
which gives you the state which is

18:49.970 --> 19:00.020
called as thorium we live in three

18:55.550 --> 19:03.350
states in the living in the awakened

19:00.020 --> 19:05.270
state geography our attention goes to

19:03.350 --> 19:12.800
these that and all that we spoiled our

19:05.270 --> 19:17.000
attention but the second one is the one

19:12.800 --> 19:22.400
what we call is that we sleep when we

19:17.000 --> 19:24.410
sleep also all these things that have

19:22.400 --> 19:29.120
happened come to us from our past and

19:24.410 --> 19:34.250
things like that but then we go to the

19:29.120 --> 19:41.270
deepest deep water specialty is a state

19:34.250 --> 19:45.710
where we have deep sleep and you dream

19:41.270 --> 19:47.630
of something that is reality also you

19:45.710 --> 19:52.790
may dream about me

19:47.630 --> 19:58.630
I kiss the ether a part of the

19:52.790 --> 20:01.010
subconscious where some beautiful

19:58.630 --> 20:04.550
informations are passed or supposing I

20:01.010 --> 20:06.410
come say Italy Italians might know in

20:04.550 --> 20:10.370
their social tea that I've come here or

20:06.410 --> 20:12.320
maybe anybody might know depends all but

20:10.370 --> 20:14.929
the fourth state is called Astoria there

20:12.320 --> 20:17.470
are two more states you are in notorious

20:14.929 --> 20:22.610
state is the fourth today means fourth

20:17.470 --> 20:25.210
for state is where that you are in a

20:22.610 --> 20:25.210
thoughtless awareness

20:26.330 --> 20:35.850
when there is no thought just think of

20:30.930 --> 20:40.650
it when there is no thought you have to

20:35.850 --> 20:44.100
be innocent when there is no thought you

20:40.650 --> 20:47.330
have to have vibrations when there is no

20:44.100 --> 20:50.370
thought you cannot be attached to anyone

20:47.330 --> 20:53.430
so into that hot a state you have come

20:50.370 --> 20:58.980
now is through the artistic thing but in

20:53.430 --> 21:04.020
this state when you are these four

20:58.980 --> 21:09.540
petals which are within you have to open

21:04.020 --> 21:21.770
out in your brain they come from your

21:09.540 --> 21:21.770
heart to your brain and that is where

21:21.980 --> 21:29.840
they absolutely understand what is God

21:33.499 --> 21:50.159

21:40.950 --> 21:52.579
