00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:21.990
but today I am going to tell you

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:26.070
something more which we have to it's

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:32.250
very important to know because as was

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.690
described by people that again the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:43.470
practice sahaja yoga as they go to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:49.379
church but is not from their heart and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:55.229
heart the abode of the spirit is the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:02.030
Shiva within us so we have to know more

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:02.030
about heart and that is very important

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.720
you know about these three noddies we

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.070
have me rapping de suzuna but in the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.070
heart there are for nerds

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:26.520
and the one nerdy goes to mooladhara and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.480
if you cross the limits of mooladhara it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.230
goes to hell that's why they say that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:39.480
Shiva is a destroyer actually you asked

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:48.960
for your destruction and when you asked

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:52.070
for your destruction you have it even if

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.450
it destroys everything as I was telling

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:01.530
it's like when a fruit has to come the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.510
petals look as if they're destroyed as I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.119
have destroyed I would say many of your

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.550
things you can call it like your

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.649
conditionings your ego your rationalism

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.620
your fanaticism all this has been

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.070
destroyed it is a job

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:27.600
this has to be destroyed for the beauty

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:33.860
to come out so when your maryadas cross

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:40.410
beyond certain point you go to your

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:44.010
destruction in four directions

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:51.690
there are destructions made as there are

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:55.470
four NARAS so now what is to be done how

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.780
are we to stop this destruction of the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.780
through the first daddy going to hell

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.709
one of the qualities of Shiva is that

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.500
his innocence this extremely innocent is

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.280
innocent like a child his innocence

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280
personified

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:36.760
so we have to put our carnal desires

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:44.230
dissolve them dissolve them into the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:46.630
innocence the ocean of innocence you

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:55.870
have to dissolve it in the ocean of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:59.530
innocence innocence is something to be

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.100
appreciated to be understood to be

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:09.640
enjoyed like you see animals they're

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:15.000
innocent you see children they're

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:22.120
innocent flowers they are innocent

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.420
divert your attention to all these

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.420
things

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:37.229
you see unlocking on the street what is

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:43.229
there to see West is all like three feet

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:47.460
height you see at three feet height all

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.740
the flowers all the beautiful grass all

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.830
the children who are about three feet

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.180
are the best

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:06.509
we need not see people who are above

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:09.689
that just see on three feet level you

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:15.240
can see the legs of somebody that's

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:19.340
alright but you don't see the eyes of a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.340
person who are not innocent

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:33.680
so dissolve this desire a little antenna

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:38.870
cells and this mullet Aramis is innocent

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.870
is not dead finished but is innocent

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.710
it is righteous

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.710
it is recognizes qualities

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.140
it's pure so even if you are in this

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.300
world even if you are living like a

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:05.710
human being even if you have children

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:09.490
still you are ignorant the second noreen

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.060
the second child that can take you to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.170
destruction is desire

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.170
that's why Buddha said that

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:23.590
desirelessness is the only way that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:25.540
people do not get old not sick not

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.619
worried

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.619
[Music]

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:39.360
now this desire that we have I want this

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.770
the West is much more than anywhere else

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.360
because the enterpreneurs are every day

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:52.710
producing new things desires can be of

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.710
any kind not only material the desires

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.440
could be also quite mental

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:08.589
I must possess this woman I must possess

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:13.359
this child all kinds of positions that

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:18.489
work into you as desires I wouldn't say

00:07:13.359 --> 00:07:24.029
it is because of attachment it's not

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:24.029
attachment but it is just to have more

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:36.779
go on adding up things getting things

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:50.019
still one doesn't feel happy and

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:52.689
satisfied what is the reason for this

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:57.239
kind of desire is that it's not pure

00:07:52.689 --> 00:08:00.489
desire it's an impure desire

00:07:57.239 --> 00:08:03.989
it's an impure desire and when such a

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:07.479
desire starts working you can go any far

00:08:03.989 --> 00:08:10.299
like Saddam Hussein like Hitler like

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:20.019
anything is nothing but absolutely

00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:24.610
desired beyond any limitations you want

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:26.999
to dominate others is also another

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.999
desire

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:40.289
all these desires lead you ultimately to

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:47.200
a destruction because there's no joy

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:55.660
there's no happiness for example now I

00:08:47.200 --> 00:09:00.430
want to have a sorry so I want to buy

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:02.290
aside all my attention will be how we

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:06.570
like in that sorry I must get that sorry

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:11.140
this thing that thing the attention

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:13.959
becomes polluted disturbed for a

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:19.630
nonsensical thing like a sorry the

00:09:13.959 --> 00:09:25.150
attention which has to enjoy which has

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:32.290
to enjoy the spirit which has to nourish

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:36.279
the spirit becomes disturbed because of

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:40.480
desires in the first place

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:45.940
the attention is disturbed because we

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:50.620
are not innocent in the second place the

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:53.160
attention gets into turmoil because we

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.160
have desire

00:09:57.029 --> 00:10:07.800
so what should we do as far as the

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:16.470
desire is culture a desire for beautiful

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:20.459
things we can shift our desire material

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:24.709
desire into aesthetics I have one thing

00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:24.709
but which is really aesthetically rich

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:36.240
so whatever you desire if you start it

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:40.120
working it out desiring for something

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:43.240
aesthetically handmade nicely

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.240
[Music]

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:51.180
gradually you'll find will end up with

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:56.580
vibrations because all beautiful things

00:10:51.180 --> 00:11:01.220
have vibrations and to have the

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.220
vibrations you have to go to pure desire

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:12.410
so this desire which is madness which

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:18.090
makes you mad which is so much darlin

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:21.360
boring becomes pure desire because you

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:24.000
have to dissolve all your desires into

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.990
vibration you to start desiring nothing

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.180
but vibrations after self so if you have

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:39.110
vibrations that doesn't mean that they

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:46.140
are something dry no it means the joy of

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:51.630
nothing Mukti is you cannot adoration

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:55.440
this that it's the ocean of love that is

00:11:51.630 --> 00:12:03.720
God you just get dressed into it there's

00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:09.200
no word stood and that is what when you

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:18.450
feel you must know that you have taken

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:25.580
the spirit as a real connection between

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:25.580
you and your mother or your father

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:41.430
there's no differentiation you are one

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:45.300
in that ocean grazed in the ocean

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:50.040
you are the drop you are the ocean you

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:56.880
are one in that nothing and that but

00:12:50.040 --> 00:13:08.670
they cannot be mechanical because not

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:10.890
man-made so to enjoy sahaja yoga you

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:15.890
must know that it's not dry vibrations

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:21.600
only but misty bhakti

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:29.360
that is the joy of choise quality

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:32.300
quality of joy that he adds to our life

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:36.900
everything seems to be surrounded

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:40.830
resounding same thing the joy that I'm

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:47.330
loved so much by God that God God loves

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:54.830
me that I have a meaning in life then

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:58.840
the ego drops out first of all and also

00:13:54.830 --> 00:14:01.690
the conditionings drop

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:05.920
[Music]

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.920
now the third Nadi

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:16.580
[Music]

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:23.420
3rd Nadi is the Nadi by which we feel

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:28.130
attached attached to someone like this

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:33.890
is my child this is my husband this is

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:39.470
my family this is my wife this is my

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:42.220
father this is my mother in the

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:48.590
beginning of sahaja yoga of everyone

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:52.970
when they are just the beginners so they

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:55.100
talk about their whole family my father

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:58.040
is like this my mother is seeing my

00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:02.410
mother sisters brothers these that's

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:05.840
real this thing is not right

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:12.340
as if you see we all have taken a

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:12.340
contract what should I do

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.250
so now this so-called limited love what

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:25.730
is the solution which takes you to

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:30.820
destruction is the unlimited because

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.820
Shiva is nothing but love is love

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:46.570
now is that corrects that nourishes that

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:53.140
wants your benevolence that's what you

00:15:46.570 --> 00:16:02.320
eyes it wants your benevolence it looks

00:15:53.140 --> 00:16:04.780
after your benevolence so when you are

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:15.460
looking after the benevolence of others

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:19.870
wait now then the whole life changes the

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:22.780
whole pattern changes and you really

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:26.020

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:32.410
many concern that so many families so

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:34.860

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:40.330
it just feels you are born with so many

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:44.620
all this is the most enjoyable

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:49.140
I mean why all this is for there after

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.140
all think about yourself why am I here

00:16:50.820 --> 00:17:00.250
I'm here to enjoy everyone everyone they

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:05.290
are all realized Souls such beautiful

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:15.489
lotuses I am NOT going to stoop down to

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:21.709
the mud now I am aloneness that

00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:25.399
is the way you open the heart the Lotus

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:30.349
of your heart and the fragrance of such

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:38.229
a person it's so beautiful it's so

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:40.729
beautiful so you are no more divisive

00:17:38.229 --> 00:17:45.139
you do not want to separate from each

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:47.720
other anywhere is done you are agreeable

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:50.450
to that you don't think that it will be

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:57.429
done here or there or there but anywhere

00:17:50.450 --> 00:18:00.080
but should be all of us together so

00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:04.519
they're small attachments that are with

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:08.979
you have to be dissolved into this ocean

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:08.979
of love which is Shiva

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:22.820
fourth one is the most important for all

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.410
of us is to know that there's a nerdy

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.840
which passes through the official

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:35.990
different into the heart starts from the

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:45.170
heart goes up passes through our gap it

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:49.970
has four petals opens up this is the one

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:55.550
which gives you the state which is

00:18:49.970 --> 00:19:00.020
called as thorium we live in three

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:03.350
states in the living in the awakened

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:05.270
state geography our attention goes to

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:12.800
these that and all that we spoiled our

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:17.000
attention but the second one is the one

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:22.400
what we call is that we sleep when we

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.410
sleep also all these things that have

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.120
happened come to us from our past and

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:34.250
things like that but then we go to the

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:41.270
deepest deep water specialty is a state

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:45.710
where we have deep sleep and you dream

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:47.630
of something that is reality also you

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:52.790
may dream about me

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:58.630
I kiss the ether a part of the

00:19:52.790 --> 00:20:01.010
subconscious where some beautiful

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:04.550
informations are passed or supposing I

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:06.410
come say Italy Italians might know in

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:10.370
their social tea that I've come here or

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:12.320
maybe anybody might know depends all but

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.929
the fourth state is called Astoria there

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.470
are two more states you are in notorious

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:22.610
state is the fourth today means fourth

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:25.210
for state is where that you are in a

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.210
thoughtless awareness

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:35.850
when there is no thought just think of

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:40.650
it when there is no thought you have to

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:44.100
be innocent when there is no thought you

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:47.330
have to have vibrations when there is no

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:50.370
thought you cannot be attached to anyone

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.430
so into that hot a state you have come

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:58.980
now is through the artistic thing but in

00:20:53.430 --> 00:21:04.020
this state when you are these four

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:09.540
petals which are within you have to open

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:21.770
out in your brain they come from your

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:21.770
heart to your brain and that is where

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:29.840
they absolutely understand what is God

00:21:33.499 --> 00:21:50.159
absolutely no what is parties that is

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:52.579
the time when one receives the real

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:52.579
knowledge

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:04.920
but unless and until these four petals

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:09.270
open one may fall back that's where some

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:13.020
other sahaja Yogi's who are still

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:19.260
meddling with things if they should not

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:24.300
do wha and they don't understand what is

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:26.400
God is but it's not the understanding

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.560
you know you understand this one little

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:35.360
point that it comes from your heart

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:35.360
impure brain not from brain your heart

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:46.550
it comes as if the amarosa

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:52.740
of your body covers your brain

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:56.990
absolutely I will sure to achieve that

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.990
state my god
