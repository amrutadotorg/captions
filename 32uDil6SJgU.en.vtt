[Music]

00:16.840 --> 00:22.810
now first before meditate in your heart

00:23.800 --> 00:41.920
you should see in your heart and they

00:29.330 --> 00:41.920
try to put your guru in the core of it

00:42.580 --> 00:54.190
after establishing in the heart you must

00:51.500 --> 00:54.190
bow to that

00:57.610 --> 01:05.500
with full devotion and dedication now

01:02.930 --> 01:11.150
whatever you do with your mind after

01:05.500 --> 01:15.940
realization is not imagination because

01:11.150 --> 01:23.600
now your mind your imagination is itself

01:15.940 --> 01:28.700
enlightened so project yourself in such

01:23.600 --> 01:33.580
a way that you humble down at the feet

01:28.700 --> 01:33.580
of your guru

01:37.590 --> 01:41.930
and now Oscar

01:45.740 --> 01:57.400
the necessary temperament needed for

01:52.280 --> 02:02.720
meditation or atmosphere needed for

01:57.400 --> 02:11.300
meditation meditation is when you are

02:02.720 --> 02:16.610
one with the divine now if there are

02:11.300 --> 02:19.730
thoughts coming in first you have to say

02:16.610 --> 02:26.870
the first month of course and then watch

02:19.730 --> 02:31.190
inside also you must say mantra of

02:26.870 --> 02:34.420
Ganesha will help some people and then

02:31.190 --> 02:34.420
you should watch inside

02:38.349 --> 02:49.680
and see for yourself which is the

02:42.730 --> 02:49.680
biggest hurdle what's the thought

02:51.930 --> 02:59.489
now for the thought you have to say the

02:55.230 --> 03:05.540
mantra of nearly Chara that Thomas

02:59.489 --> 03:09.420
Akshar near which our sakshat shri

03:05.540 --> 03:11.959
mataji nirmala devi namo namah should

03:09.420 --> 03:11.959
say twice

03:17.510 --> 03:20.680
[Music]

03:23.020 --> 03:26.169
[Music]

03:29.880 --> 03:38.810
[Music]

03:47.600 --> 03:53.160
now we come to the hurdle of your ego

03:50.640 --> 03:54.840
because see your thought has talked now

03:53.160 --> 03:59.850
no doubt but there's still the pressure

03:54.840 --> 04:05.190
on the head so if it is ego you have to

03:59.850 --> 04:07.880
say so many Versace ah ma ahankara not

04:05.190 --> 04:12.330
meet the great Ankara means the evil

04:07.880 --> 04:17.600

04:20.950 --> 04:27.420
[Music]

04:35.780 --> 04:39.760
[Music]

04:46.140 --> 04:53.639
[Music]

04:57.600 --> 05:05.820
now even now if you find that ego is

05:01.540 --> 05:09.520
still there then you have to raise your

05:05.820 --> 05:12.340
left side to push it back to the right

05:09.520 --> 05:19.570
hand side with your hand one hand

05:12.340 --> 05:22.780
towards the photograph push the left

05:19.570 --> 05:26.910
side higher and right side door so the

05:22.780 --> 05:26.910
ego and super-ego get the balance

05:34.250 --> 05:42.760
do it seven times try to feel how you

05:39.620 --> 05:42.760
are feeling inside is

05:54.560 --> 06:06.290
now you raise your Kundalini up on the

06:00.140 --> 06:13.180
head and tighten again raise your

06:06.290 --> 06:13.180
Kundalini up on the head and tighten

06:13.420 --> 06:32.360
again they're totally and tighten now at

06:28.130 --> 06:35.169
the sahasrara you should say the mantra

06:32.360 --> 06:35.169

07:35.520 --> 07:41.010
I like this let's take it down okay and

07:38.280 --> 07:43.140
see that you are stationed there once

07:41.010 --> 07:47.190
