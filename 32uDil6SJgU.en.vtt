try to put your guru in the core of it

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:54.190
after establishing in the heart you must

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.190
bow to that

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.500
with full devotion and dedication now

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.150
whatever you do with your mind after

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.940
realization is not imagination because

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:23.600
now your mind your imagination is itself

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:28.700
enlightened so project yourself in such

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.580
a way that you humble down at the feet

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.580
of your guru

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.930
and now Oscar

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:57.400
the necessary temperament needed for

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:02.720
meditation or atmosphere needed for

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:11.300
meditation meditation is when you are

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:16.610
one with the divine now if there are

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.730
thoughts coming in first you have to say

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.870
the first month of course and then watch

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:31.190
inside also you must say mantra of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.420
Ganesha will help some people and then

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.420
you should watch inside

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:49.680
and see for yourself which is the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.680
biggest hurdle what's the thought

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.489
now for the thought you have to say the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:05.540
mantra of nearly Chara that Thomas

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:09.420
Akshar near which our sakshat shri

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.959
mataji nirmala devi namo namah should

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.959
say twice

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.680
[Music]

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.169
[Music]

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:38.810
[Music]

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.160
now we come to the hurdle of your ego

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.840
because see your thought has talked now

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.850
no doubt but there's still the pressure

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:05.190
on the head so if it is ego you have to

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.880
say so many Versace ah ma ahankara not

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:12.330
meet the great Ankara means the evil

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:17.600
Sasha shri mataji vÃ¡radi

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.600
in Ivana mommy she's right

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.420

[Music]

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:53.639
[Music]

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.820
now even now if you find that ego is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:09.520
still there then you have to raise your

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.340
left side to push it back to the right

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:19.570
hand side with your hand one hand

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:22.780
towards the photograph push the left

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.910
side higher and right side door so the

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.910
ego and super-ego get the balance

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:42.760
do it seven times try to feel how you

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.760
are feeling inside is

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:06.290
now you raise your Kundalini up on the

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:13.180
head and tighten again raise your

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.180
Kundalini up on the head and tighten

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:32.360
again they're totally and tighten now at

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:35.169
the sahasrara you should say the mantra

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.169
of sastra

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.759
[Music]

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:04.680
[Music]

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.819
[Music]

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:30.070
[Music]

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.140
see that you are stationed there once

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:47.190

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:08.169
[Music]

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:11.289
