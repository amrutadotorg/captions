00:00.459 --> 00:03.764
Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis of all the Yogas.

00:04.467 --> 00:07.571
Only thing [is] human beings have

00:07.673 --> 00:10.683
a wrong notion that they can do something about it.

00:10.924 --> 00:12.795
It’s all built in them.

00:13.090 --> 00:15.037
Like any good instrument

00:15.151 --> 00:18.110
it’s all built in and as soon as the Kundalini starts

00:18.208 --> 00:20.417
She starts working it out.

00:20.689 --> 00:24.918
And all these gadgets within us go into motion

00:26.607 --> 00:28.287
and they create that

00:31.528 --> 00:35.051
state within us by which the Kundalini rises within you.

00:38.124 --> 00:42.951
Perhaps, we take it for granted,

00:43.122 --> 00:45.319
Kundalini rising so much because

00:45.431 --> 00:48.538
we do not see all that’s happening within.

00:49.013 --> 00:51.527
(Talking to a mother with a child) Can you
take him out?

00:52.305 --> 00:57.875
He’s so happy that I don’t feel [he’s]
disturbing but everybody [else] is disturbed.

00:58.702 --> 01:05.094
Rising of the Kundalini is the easiest for Me.

01:05.734 --> 01:06.874
No problem.

01:09.480 --> 01:13.411
Even working out those gadgets as I called them

01:14.013 --> 01:16.680
– chakras and their different movements,

01:16.855 --> 01:20.162
constrictions and dilatation at a particular point

01:20.322 --> 01:23.902
when Kundalini is coming up – is not difficult.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.638
But there are two other channels within us,

01:28.840 --> 01:33.162
which you know very well, which act our sympathetic nervous system.

01:33.318 --> 01:37.374
Which can be quite in trouble

01:38.565 --> 01:41.431
because of various conditionings within us.

01:42.575 --> 01:44.953
For example, some people have, say,

01:45.056 --> 01:47.743
a small conditioning like going to a spiritualist.

01:47.882 --> 01:51.818
Take a position, a very simple thing like going to a spiritualist.

01:51.977 --> 01:55.095
Now you ask the person, “Have you been to a spiritualist?”

01:55.247 --> 01:59.468
Because if you find burning on the left Swadishthana

01:59.605 --> 02:02.125
and the heart catching a little, it’s definitely

02:02.319 --> 02:05.789
he has been to somebody like that, which is unauthorised.

02:05.906 --> 02:09.300
If you do something unauthorised you can feel it on your

02:09.448 --> 02:12.665
Swadishthana, that the person has been there.

02:13.877 --> 02:18.251
Now see, just say that he has been there, to a spiritualist,

02:18.511 --> 02:22.162
you can work it out by giving the bandhan to the spiritualist

02:22.242 --> 02:25.278
whose name he might tell. Even if he doesn’t tell it can work out.

02:25.384 --> 02:28.272
It is that subtle and it works that subtle.

02:28.446 --> 02:29.956
But that much one has to say.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.220
Now, the reason for all this is this:

02:33.672 --> 02:36.414
that at this stage when you are getting Realisation,

02:36.518 --> 02:38.364
you are human beings,

02:38.681 --> 02:42.241
the highest that the Creation has created, highest.

02:43.379 --> 02:46.516
And that you have the freedom to choose

02:47.102 --> 02:48.739
the Good or the Bad.

02:50.046 --> 02:52.563
This choice must be made by you.

02:52.785 --> 02:55.307
If you make that willing choice,

02:55.432 --> 02:59.602
then Kundalini is the easiest thing for Me or for anyone of you.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.926
But if there is hesitation about it, for example, a person may say,

03:03.052 --> 03:06.060
“Oh, so what’s wrong? I went only for one day."

03:06.928 --> 03:09.673
Anything like that, Kundalini goes back.

03:09.852 --> 03:13.137
She is a sensitive thing, extremely sensitive:

03:13.455 --> 03:17.839
any kind of refusal to Her or denial to Her She goes down.

03:22.010 --> 03:26.248
And this is something if you understand that we are human beings

03:27.189 --> 03:31.862
and we are the highest, highest in the Creation.

03:32.933 --> 03:35.104
We have no self-esteem, I tell you.

03:35.219 --> 03:37.728
Human beings have no self-esteem.

03:37.862 --> 03:40.578
If they had, they would not have behaved like this.

03:40.681 --> 03:43.037
The way we are torturing ourselves, torturing others,

03:43.128 --> 03:45.849
I mean doing all kinds of nonsense.

03:47.939 --> 03:51.043
If they had that understanding of themselves

03:51.145 --> 03:53.717
there would have been no problem, but they do not have.

03:53.877 --> 03:56.028
Only when it comes to Kundalini,

03:56.142 --> 03:58.364
then they have all their esteem.

03:58.690 --> 04:00.028
Most surprising!

04:00.133 --> 04:03.429
Then they will say, “Why not?
What’s wrong?”

04:03.662 --> 04:06.584
Anything you say that time, that’s the time they should be most

04:06.713 --> 04:11.119
surrendering, that’s the time they’ll argue! It’s human nature!

04:11.640 --> 04:14.209
Otherwise they will not argue,

04:14.402 --> 04:17.531
if you ask them, “Will you come to the pub?”
“Yes, why not?”

04:17.610 --> 04:19.039
They’ll never argue.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.509
Have you heard anybody saying that?

04:22.571 --> 04:25.623
Me even, I mean I tell you, I dare not.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.500
Say, people come to My house for a party and thing,

04:28.616 --> 04:30.689
My husband has to offer them drinks

04:30.759 --> 04:33.352
because they won’t talk to us if you do not offer them drinks.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.748
That’s the thing in England. In India I never

04:36.850 --> 04:40.626
would allow anybody to even bring any bottles in the house.

04:40.850 --> 04:43.001
But here they said, “English won’t talk to you

04:43.115 --> 04:44.929
if you don’t have bottles in the house!

04:45.018 --> 04:47.955
How can you do it, it’s not a house if there is no bottle!”

04:48.103 --> 04:51.285
That’s the part of the culture, the base of it.

04:51.384 --> 04:53.519
But I dare not say even once.

04:53.609 --> 04:55.149
They will say “Why don’t you drink?

04:55.230 --> 04:56.985
Is it not allowed in your religion?

04:57.086 --> 05:01.775
Why don’t you drink?”
But if I say, “Why do you drink?”, finished!

05:04.024 --> 05:07.232
I have no manners.
I am most unmannerly person going round!

05:07.334 --> 05:08.785
You see My point?

05:09.070 --> 05:11.032
You are not supposed to say these things,

05:11.100 --> 05:13.095
you are not supposed to discuss these things.

05:13.199 --> 05:16.212
But if you say some sort of a dirty joke,

05:16.349 --> 05:18.749
really everybody will be very happy.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.628
There is nothing like indecency indecorum in those things.

05:22.793 --> 05:26.256
But it is indecent to say something decent!

05:26.458 --> 05:29.142
In the same way in Kundalini it happens

05:29.245 --> 05:33.449
that when it comes to actual Kundalini rising,

05:33.600 --> 05:36.987
one should be in the most humble manner, “Oh, God!”

05:37.145 --> 05:40.536
Just see the time, the moment has come for you to get what it is.

05:40.711 --> 05:43.509
That time they’ll be arrogantly like this, you see, sitting,

05:43.622 --> 05:45.036
“No, it doesn’t happen to me!”

05:45.128 --> 05:49.093
As if it’s a very great thing it’s not happening to you!
Just imagine!

05:49.309 --> 05:51.973
It would be like a king sitting on a throne

05:53.673 --> 05:56.665
and somebody is trying to put the crown on the head

05:56.801 --> 06:00.553
and the person says, “Oh, it doesn’t fit me at all!”

06:01.344 --> 06:03.223
It’s that silly, you know.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.567
But it is so.

06:05.671 --> 06:08.234
And this is why the Kundalini,

06:08.586 --> 06:12.089
the Kundalini doesn’t rise and She stops.

06:12.647 --> 06:24.437
And once She is that way, little bit insulted She feels hesitant.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.655
You see, like a guest who has come into your house,

06:27.826 --> 06:30.240
if you put a punch on the nose,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.272
it will take time for you to patch up the whole thing, isn’t it?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.721
And that patching up is just so slow,

06:38.812 --> 06:42.460
I mean people just don’t believe in patching up anything.

06:43.119 --> 06:46.659
And that’s why the Kundalini is so disturbing.

06:47.339 --> 06:48.992
It is so disturbing.

06:51.924 --> 06:56.211
One should understand that She is extremely sensitive,

06:57.198 --> 06:58.878
She is your self-respect.

07:01.279 --> 07:05.710
Any fun you make out of Her is a waste:

07:06.410 --> 07:11.059
you are wasting yourself,
you are wasting the energy of the Kundalini,

07:11.207 --> 07:13.540
you are stopping your Realisation.

07:17.733 --> 07:21.779
It is very important to understand that She is Knowledge.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.838
Whatever you have read so far is not knowledge, is Avidya.

07:25.976 --> 07:29.085
Humility must come to you for that, very important.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.121
You might have read thousands of books,

07:31.201 --> 07:34.648
makes no difference to the Kundalini.
She is Knowledge.

07:37.317 --> 07:39.763
That time all your knowledge will come,

07:39.858 --> 07:42.601
“Mother, I’ve read in this book this is written, that is written,”

07:42.695 --> 07:47.193
Finished! [Then] your Realisation is a very difficult thing.

07:47.630 --> 07:50.099
I’m here sitting down, “Oh please,

07:50.192 --> 07:52.218
have your Realisation, don’t disturb Her”.

07:52.310 --> 07:54.734
I’m sitting in between like a mediator, you see,

07:54.779 --> 07:57.611
between Her and you, “Now, don’t disturb Her”.

07:57.763 --> 08:00.728
Here you are, suddenly you come out with a special

08:00.821 --> 08:02.915
announcement that, “I’ve read such and such book”

08:02.996 --> 08:05.841
and that book must be from some bhoot or somebody horrible,

08:06.091 --> 08:07.091
has to be.

08:07.373 --> 08:09.479
And then you come out, “I’ve read that book

08:09.559 --> 08:12.485
and such and such, it says so…”, finished.

08:14.671 --> 08:17.449
Here we are talking of actualisation,

08:17.812 --> 08:22.789
of gettingRealisation, not of books.

08:23.172 --> 08:26.151
You have to forget what you have been going through.

08:26.300 --> 08:30.768
You have to forget what you have been doing so far for Kundalini.

08:30.895 --> 08:34.052
You have to forget all those things you have had

08:34.143 --> 08:36.527
so far through your gurus and this and that,

08:36.663 --> 08:38.950
and all other sorts of nonsense.

08:39.305 --> 08:42.123
You have to forget all that and you have to think it’s a

08:42.237 --> 08:45.014
very simple abode of your Mother

08:45.535 --> 08:48.687
where you have come just to have your food.

08:49.390 --> 08:52.520
Please come and be seated and have your food.

08:53.744 --> 08:57.272
With that simplicity of heart only, the Kundalini will react.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.628
If you are a lord of some place,

08:59.935 --> 09:02.413
Kundalini will say “Alright, go and be a lord."

09:02.562 --> 09:04.865
Kundalini is not bothered about you.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.667
She knows who is arrogant, She knows who is humble,

09:07.747 --> 09:09.880
She knows who wants Realisation.

09:10.374 --> 09:13.478
She has been recording everything what you have been doing

09:13.558 --> 09:16.063
since long, since ages, since many lives.

09:16.199 --> 09:17.435
So She knows everything.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.519
And if She even now finds the same thing,

09:20.644 --> 09:22.571
She just refuses to rise.

09:25.518 --> 09:27.851
I’ve seen it’s a common experience:

09:27.934 --> 09:29.564
if somebody doesn’t get Realisation,

09:29.678 --> 09:31.671
he feels very proud, “Oh, I’m not mesmerised!”

09:31.809 --> 09:34.187
I said, “Is it mesmerism, is it?”

09:36.938 --> 09:41.368
If through mesmerism you could cure cancer,

09:41.502 --> 09:44.178
then I think mesmerism is a good idea,

09:44.280 --> 09:45.880
if it is mesmerism!

09:52.143 --> 09:56.233
So first of all, before getting Realisation, one has to know

09:57.152 --> 09:59.485
that this is what you are seeking,

10:00.077 --> 10:02.077
this is what you have to have

10:02.174 --> 10:06.378
and the Kundalini is the only thing that is going to transform you.

10:06.491 --> 10:08.362
There’s no doubt about it.

10:09.586 --> 10:12.901
But even when you come to that point of Kundalini,

10:12.995 --> 10:15.035
people have read books on Kundalini also.

10:15.150 --> 10:16.848
And everything they’ve read, already,

10:16.939 --> 10:19.606
they have sorted out everything already!

10:21.451 --> 10:23.104
So, then they ask,

10:24.577 --> 10:27.094
“Then what about that book?
It says so…”

10:27.228 --> 10:30.678
Now you see for yourself, why don’t you see what it is like!

10:30.848 --> 10:33.745
But in seeing also you have to be humble.

10:34.016 --> 10:37.723
Those people who have come to us with humility, with innocence,

10:38.879 --> 10:43.075
have got Realisation very well, and they’ve established it.

10:44.922 --> 10:49.477
They have got it at a time, some of them, who were just dying,

10:49.716 --> 10:53.428
just dying, they came to Me at the time they were in coma.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.835
But they have established themselves

10:55.914 --> 10:57.981
because they were true seekers.

10:58.218 --> 11:01.674
If you have to seek the Truth, you have to be truthful also.

11:01.776 --> 11:05.050
And if you are truthful you will see that this is truthful.

11:05.333 --> 11:09.528
There is no hanky-panky in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot have.

11:10.185 --> 11:12.932
There is no befooling or anything.

11:13.102 --> 11:14.698
That’s not possible.

11:14.907 --> 11:18.202
The Kundalini has to rise, She has to give you Realisation,

11:18.384 --> 11:20.481
She has to get you alright.

11:21.752 --> 11:23.772
No other certificate is needed.

11:24.912 --> 11:27.611
This is the main certificate you have to have

11:27.735 --> 11:29.899
– that you get your Realisation,

11:30.025 --> 11:32.110
you feel your vibrations, not others.

11:32.255 --> 11:34.106
Some other people can feel it.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.167
The other day we had a very unique experience

11:36.280 --> 11:41.133
and there was a gentleman and the Kundalini was trying to push

11:41.360 --> 11:44.917
the Sahasrara and the whole Grace was flowing on him

11:45.042 --> 11:47.242
as if like a fountain coming out of here,

11:47.367 --> 11:49.169
and nothing was going into his being.

11:49.262 --> 11:50.541
Can you imagine!

11:50.735 --> 11:54.713
The Grace, just pouring onto that dumb fellow.

11:55.290 --> 11:59.179
It was all falling on all the sides but nothing going into him!

11:59.697 --> 12:01.825
And the fellow was very proud,

12:01.894 --> 12:03.901
“Oh, nothing is happening to me!”you see.

12:04.086 --> 12:05.605
I said, “Look at this man!”

12:06.548 --> 12:09.071
The Grace has to be accepted.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.546
With folded hands one has to get it. With humility.

12:16.477 --> 12:22.185
How can we be arrogant when the Grace is coming on you?

12:22.543 --> 12:26.385
Is it sensible, is that good manners, by any chance?

12:29.652 --> 12:32.212
One has to be extremely humble.

12:34.614 --> 12:37.458
That will show to the Kundalini that you want it,

12:37.594 --> 12:39.274
that you want to have it.

12:40.992 --> 12:48.849
At the smallest of points it has been stopped.

12:50.913 --> 12:52.225
Like I would say,

12:52.357 --> 12:56.481
if a little thing goes into the eyes, you cannot see the whole sky.

12:56.613 --> 12:57.693
In the same way,

12:57.822 --> 13:01.118
a very small thing, a very, very small thing

13:01.833 --> 13:04.500
can stop the movement of the Kundalini.

13:05.849 --> 13:09.748
And that small thing, if somebody says, “Ask this question.

13:09.941 --> 13:12.332
Please ask and get it.

13:13.300 --> 13:20.814
This is your due,” you have to just, to be humble.

13:22.061 --> 13:23.694
If you cannot be humble

13:23.796 --> 13:25.663
it is not going to work out.

13:28.002 --> 13:30.181
That’s something so simple

13:31.065 --> 13:33.932
but it’s difficult for people to be simple.

13:35.501 --> 13:39.388
Seeker: The word ‘humble’ is
misunderstood in England, I think, a lot.

13:39.466 --> 13:42.300
Does humble mean “no intellectual arrogance”?

13:42.750 --> 13:46.410
No intellectual arrogance? Is a good idea, I tell you!

13:46.564 --> 13:47.922
Intellectual arrogance now…

13:48.040 --> 13:50.178
Can you open the windows, please?

13:50.343 --> 13:51.846
Windows a little bit more.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.106
That you can open.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.133
There are so many people are here.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.573
…that’s a good idea!

13:56.666 --> 13:58.602
Now, let’s see intellectuals.

13:58.714 --> 13:59.714
Oh, God!

13:59.850 --> 14:01.411
I’ve had enough of them!

14:05.006 --> 14:07.584
Even the name gives you heat, I tell you.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.534
Now, let’s see the intellectuals, the rationality.

14:13.268 --> 14:15.335
Rationality has lead us where?

14:15.660 --> 14:16.987
Just think over it.

14:18.024 --> 14:22.454
Rationality is nothing but your brain’s own imagination.

14:22.670 --> 14:24.836
You can rationalise everything.

14:25.050 --> 14:26.530
“What’s wrong?”

14:27.006 --> 14:29.235
What’s wrong in anything?

14:29.419 --> 14:32.670
People are killing their own children, “What’s wrong?

14:32.853 --> 14:35.822
What’s wrong, tell Me? Basically, what’s wrong?”

14:36.089 --> 14:38.909
I mean, they are their own children, they have produced it,

14:39.004 --> 14:42.652
they are killing it, they can produce more, what’s wrong?

14:43.127 --> 14:46.435
Tomorrow, you will be amazed,
there will be people coming out to say that,

14:46.537 --> 14:50.569
“If we kill our children you have no business to say anything!”

14:51.899 --> 14:54.172
People will come and fight the law

14:54.274 --> 14:57.410
that, “If they are our children we can kill them.

14:57.562 --> 14:58.782
We have produced them.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.806
We can produce more children.
What’s wrong?”

15:01.959 --> 15:06.126
You see, rationality can give all kinds of absurd ideas.

15:09.010 --> 15:11.516
But it is not wisdom.

15:11.781 --> 15:15.361
It is not wisdom, it’s not logical.

15:19.312 --> 15:21.437
Everything has to be logical.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.908
Sahaja Yoga is Absolute logic.

15:29.009 --> 15:33.227
Rationality is limited, but logic is not.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.319
When you sit down with the logic you can see

15:38.557 --> 15:42.205
that you have given birth to a child, he has a right to live

15:44.791 --> 15:48.192
and you have no right to kill – that’s the logic.

15:49.193 --> 15:54.483
If you have right to kill then it is also rightful to kill you,

15:58.066 --> 16:01.012
because you are a child of somebody else,

16:01.227 --> 16:04.027
if your father kills you, is it all right?

16:04.605 --> 16:06.159
Reverse it back.

16:07.239 --> 16:08.876
That is logic.

16:13.901 --> 16:17.900
So, the so-called intellectuals, where have they reached?

16:20.659 --> 16:22.298
That’s all nonsense.

16:22.546 --> 16:25.355
They’ve reached at a nonsensical point.

16:26.102 --> 16:29.114
Take any, any realm, say take politics.

16:29.353 --> 16:32.052
Of course I’ve nothing to do with it because it is absurd,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.720
it’s a myth for Me.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.344
They are just playing with shadows.

16:38.796 --> 16:40.464
There’s no Reality in it!

16:40.552 --> 16:43.248
None of the politics has any Reality in it

16:43.339 --> 16:45.853
which is today existing whether it is capitalism

16:45.933 --> 16:47.613
or communism or anything.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.885
Because they have not yet found out the Real Laws.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.161
They have not yet found out the

16:54.276 --> 16:56.633
Power which governs the world.

16:59.071 --> 17:03.819
Only it is the Kingdom of God that can have some politics

17:06.177 --> 17:08.043
and is the natural politics.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.910
They are fighting about communism to capitalism.

17:12.216 --> 17:14.810
What sort of capitalism we have here

17:14.934 --> 17:18.146
and what sort of communism they have here?

17:19.491 --> 17:21.842
From fire to frying pan like that.

17:22.565 --> 17:25.516
It’s all useless, absolutely mythical.

17:25.674 --> 17:29.991
Man has not yet achieved that state
where he can decide about his politics.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.654
After Realisation,

17:32.195 --> 17:35.236
you know that you have powers, you become a capitalist.

17:35.362 --> 17:37.809
And you have to distribute it [so] you become a communist.

17:37.934 --> 17:40.323
You become both, you have to be a communist

17:40.471 --> 17:42.044
and you have to be a capitalist

17:42.170 --> 17:44.527
and you are very happy that you are a capitalist

17:44.653 --> 17:46.586
because you can be communist.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.048
If you don’t have your own powers,

17:49.174 --> 17:51.507
how are you going to distribute it?

17:51.973 --> 17:56.294
The whole priority is changed and a big difference comes in.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.723
When you do not know your powers,

18:00.188 --> 18:04.640
when you do not know that there is All-pervading Power beyond,

18:04.982 --> 18:07.249
then what are you discussing here?

18:07.363 --> 18:11.102
It is something like, you have no money in the bank,

18:11.249 --> 18:13.183
there is no market available

18:13.313 --> 18:16.213
and you are just discussing here what to buy!

18:22.811 --> 18:26.972
So, this intellectual business is a mythical thing,

18:27.539 --> 18:29.166
is nothing but a myth.

18:29.623 --> 18:31.562
It’s just a myth, believe Me.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.227
It is nothing but a myth.

18:39.320 --> 18:56.889
Intelligence which is not logical is abandonment, is abandonment.

18:58.248 --> 19:01.799
You cannot have intelligence with arrogance, you cannot have.

19:01.896 --> 19:04.296
If you have it, it’s not intelligence.

19:04.410 --> 19:08.171
Every intelligent man knows that he should not be arrogant,

19:09.895 --> 19:12.162
if he is really truly intelligent.

19:14.707 --> 19:17.485
Very simple logic: if you are arrogant,

19:17.621 --> 19:20.693
others can be arrogant with you, do you like it?

19:22.470 --> 19:23.915
No one likes it.

19:28.032 --> 19:32.765
Simple, simple equations are there.

19:34.314 --> 19:37.966
If you are intelligent you may be anything

19:38.080 --> 19:39.254
– so what does it matter?

19:39.370 --> 19:41.040
“You hang yourself by the nearest tree,”

19:41.131 --> 19:45.152
that’s what people will say, if you try to be rude to them.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.048
If you are very rich and segmented,

19:50.389 --> 19:54.865
fragmented then you do not enjoy your riches with others:

19:56.406 --> 19:59.521
what’s the use of all the riches with you?

20:00.823 --> 20:03.322
Life is so logical, it’s so logical!

20:03.492 --> 20:07.843
But I think this logic you see after Realisation better and simple,

20:08.502 --> 20:11.391
because you start sharing, you can feel the sharing,

20:11.506 --> 20:13.920
you can feel it others, you can feel others Vishuddhi,

20:14.046 --> 20:16.494
you can feel others Nabhi and all these chakras

20:16.642 --> 20:18.364
and you know we are sharing now.

20:18.533 --> 20:19.903
So, here we are

20:19.994 --> 20:23.514
that we know that we are not separated, we are all one.

20:27.070 --> 20:30.502
But today I have to warn a little bit, all of you,

20:32.555 --> 20:39.741
that in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who get into Realisation,

20:41.294 --> 20:42.974
becoming angels, really.

20:44.444 --> 20:48.375
It’s the boon by which you become angels, real angel...

20:48.864 --> 20:51.153
But angels should not fall.

20:51.758 --> 20:55.849
You must have heard about an angel called Lucifer who fell down

20:56.201 --> 20:57.881
and he became a Satan.

21:01.174 --> 21:05.253
And it’s very dangerous for a Sahaja Yogi

21:07.079 --> 21:09.899
not to be a Sahaja Yogi after some time.

21:11.588 --> 21:14.397
He has to take a decision that, “I’m going

21:14.488 --> 21:19.454
to be a righteous person, a good person and a good Sahaja Yogi."

21:21.075 --> 21:27.183
He cannot be a policeman and a thief, he cannot do it.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.380
You think of a policeman becoming a thief, what happens?

21:30.610 --> 21:32.546
He is punished doubly.

21:35.742 --> 21:39.711
It is just like that: a policeman cannot become a thief.

21:40.742 --> 21:45.445
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi has to rise.

21:45.832 --> 21:49.882
If he does not, it’s a very dangerous thing

21:50.388 --> 21:53.536
and I would warn you that you’ll go out of circulation.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.078
You just get out of circulation

21:58.294 --> 22:03.790
from Sahaja Yoga, absolutely out of circulation.

22:04.196 --> 22:06.328
I think it’s hot for the baby.

22:06.535 --> 22:08.790
Take the baby out for a while, alright?

22:08.890 --> 22:09.890
It’s very hot.

22:09.982 --> 22:10.982
Yes, take it.

22:11.152 --> 22:12.152
It’s very hot.

22:12.254 --> 22:15.936
Please, open the doors and windows,

22:21.719 --> 22:23.399
it will be a good idea.

22:26.981 --> 22:31.619
So, one has to understand that in Sahaja Yoga you have to grow.

22:32.229 --> 22:33.678
All of you must grow,

22:33.804 --> 22:37.216
allow your growth to take place, do not hinder it.

22:37.403 --> 22:41.063
The more you’ll grow the more enjoyable it will be!

22:41.290 --> 22:46.016
But as we are human beings, have coming out of some sort of a

22:47.365 --> 22:49.292
falsehood into the Truth,

22:49.440 --> 22:51.841
Reality, we have to hold on to the Reality

22:51.921 --> 22:54.392
much more than to the falsehood.

22:54.551 --> 22:58.380
But still if there is clinging, please try to shed them off.

22:58.716 --> 23:03.392
Throw them out, do not cling onto that.

23:03.708 --> 23:05.757
The growth has to take place.

23:05.931 --> 23:10.463
Now the greatest calamity of

23:10.588 --> 23:13.445
our London, England, Sahaja Yogis, we should see that

23:13.574 --> 23:15.600
– because I know Indian Sahaja Yogis as they are,

23:15.714 --> 23:17.809
they have their own problems, but we have one,

23:17.934 --> 23:19.534
and that is inertia.

23:19.939 --> 23:21.709
Inertia is our problem.

23:22.763 --> 23:26.260
The whole country is set up with it, the inertia.

23:26.816 --> 23:29.911
It’s a very serious problem for Sahaja Yoga.

23:30.852 --> 23:33.548
And I would tell you, I have been to Europe,

23:33.650 --> 23:36.448
I’ve been to Portugal, I’ve been to

23:36.562 --> 23:38.512
India, of course you know very well and

23:38.614 --> 23:43.364
also Australia – inertia is maximum in England.

23:47.976 --> 23:49.960
Now what is the reason?

23:51.548 --> 23:54.186
We must go to the root of this cause.

23:54.606 --> 23:58.493
I have told you that England is the Heart of the Universe.

23:59.961 --> 24:04.153
Seeker: Must be a joke – England is the Heart of the Universe?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.497
You didn’t know that?
Seeker: The Universe, is it?

24:06.709 --> 24:10.322
Yes.
Seeker: Don’t believe you!

24:10.503 --> 24:13.883
Shri Mataji: That’s too much ah?

24:40.656 --> 24:48.296
Then speaking aside about changing for a bigger
room in 5 minutes.

24:50.499 --> 24:52.776
Now about this heart I will tell you

24:52.878 --> 24:54.976
downstairs, I think, if we can move down.

24:55.190 --> 24:57.277
There it will be better because it’s very hot here

24:57.368 --> 25:00.225
and there’s a food also is to be organised in that room.

25:00.377 --> 25:02.228
So it’s better to go now.

25:02.438 --> 25:06.618
All right?
Go and find your seats, I’ll be just there.

25:10.726 --> 25:14.764
And you are the people who are responsible for the heart.

25:15.886 --> 25:19.742
Now heart is the most important organ in the body.

25:20.872 --> 25:23.324
If the heart fails, the whole body fails.

25:25.435 --> 25:29.120
Supposing the brain fails, still the body will go on.

25:30.294 --> 25:36.243
But if the heart fails, the body stops functioning.

25:38.760 --> 25:42.842
So the attack is on the heart.

25:46.057 --> 25:50.279
All the satanic forces and demonic forces and destructive forces

25:50.416 --> 25:54.446
will try to attack the heart, naturally,

25:56.475 --> 25:59.511
because if they attack any other place

26:04.897 --> 26:07.563
then the body will be still functioning.

26:08.309 --> 26:12.524
So, first they will try all their methods to attack the heart.

26:12.987 --> 26:16.366
I’m saying this because today there are at least

26:16.457 --> 26:18.112
80% Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

26:18.214 --> 26:21.350
that they should understand their responsibility.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.554
If this heart becomes frozen through inertia,

26:32.699 --> 26:37.721
there is no hope for the whole world and neither for the Universe

26:43.152 --> 26:46.338
or for this Creation, there is no hope.

26:47.925 --> 26:51.449
That’s why I’m stationed in England.

26:53.668 --> 26:57.368
I have been travelling and travelling in England,

26:58.548 --> 27:00.228
spreading vibrations.

27:02.467 --> 27:05.934
But I think English Sahaja Yogis do not think

27:06.694 --> 27:13.156
how important it is to awaken themselves and to work it out.

27:17.755 --> 27:22.336
The movement is extremely slow as if it is deadening.

27:22.616 --> 27:25.817
And I am sometimes really worried about it.

27:31.211 --> 27:35.147
We have to see now how these negative forces work in us.

27:39.789 --> 27:42.192
They work in us in various ways.

27:47.313 --> 27:48.433
First of all,

27:51.406 --> 27:55.816
they will work in us through people who are vulnerable.

28:05.855 --> 28:09.821
We have people among us who are weak Sahaja Yogis.

28:14.084 --> 28:17.691
Who cannot sustain the Truth within themselves

28:20.889 --> 28:25.229
and they are very vulnerable for all these negative forces.

28:32.206 --> 28:35.173
These negative forces work through them.

28:39.572 --> 28:47.750
They give you ideas as a very highly developed centre.

28:51.166 --> 28:55.196
There were some Sahaja Yogis who are really first class,

28:56.999 --> 29:00.519
they were given idea by one of the such vulnerable one

29:00.695 --> 29:04.599
that, “Why should we combine with others who are not so good?

29:04.725 --> 29:07.196
Let’s have a separate entity."

29:07.855 --> 29:09.554
Because, before this,

29:09.691 --> 29:12.559
one person used to get very important and he used to organise,

29:12.616 --> 29:15.516
“Do this!” and “Do that!” and used to boast.

29:17.421 --> 29:19.675
Because I stopped all that, they

29:19.834 --> 29:23.281
– these people who were really good and sensible people,

29:23.392 --> 29:25.182
they were given this idea that,

29:25.308 --> 29:26.997
“Let’s start our organisation separately”.

29:27.123 --> 29:30.455
I mean, in the sense that, “Let’s have a deeper

29:32.088 --> 29:34.488
meditation” or some sort of a thing.

29:38.189 --> 29:41.259
To a simple person it would look really good

29:41.346 --> 29:43.822
because those who are good should really go further,

29:43.902 --> 29:47.405
why should they be, sort of, tied with others.

29:50.769 --> 29:55.231
But one has to know that you cannot be segmented.

29:57.659 --> 30:02.330
If this finger is sick it is more
necessary to look after that sick finger.

30:02.432 --> 30:03.640
I do that way.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.812
If I look after someone much more,

30:06.938 --> 30:11.132
then know that person needs My help, that’s why. To a point.

30:13.284 --> 30:16.263
But sometimes such people can come out to say that,

30:16.367 --> 30:17.885
“Oh, Mother cares for me so much.

30:17.970 --> 30:19.410
She has said this, She said that!”

30:19.606 --> 30:21.356
All sorts of nonsense can work out.

30:21.471 --> 30:24.645
It depends on your wisdom to understand.

30:29.237 --> 30:35.924
Now, when these people said that they would like to have a another

30:37.216 --> 30:41.241
organisation or, say, another deeper meditation thing.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.382
I said, “You have not even followed the basics of Sahaja Yoga

30:45.541 --> 30:47.093
though you have gone so high up.

30:47.206 --> 30:48.318
How is it?”

30:53.129 --> 30:56.425
Everyone is a part of One Whole

30:59.135 --> 31:03.375
and we have to articulate through them this Divine life.

31:05.646 --> 31:09.942
Nobody is to be condemned or discredited and put down.

31:10.401 --> 31:12.210
Everyone is important.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.117
If somebody is so sick that he should be taken out,

31:16.229 --> 31:18.349
he goes out of circulation automatically.

31:18.508 --> 31:20.108
It is managed that way.

31:20.525 --> 31:24.015
You have seen so many people have gone out of circulation.

31:24.691 --> 31:26.858
Then it is their lookout.

31:28.329 --> 31:30.809
But you don’t worry about these things,

31:30.901 --> 31:34.538
you have to only worry how much one you are one with others.

31:34.662 --> 31:38.084
If one person says, “I am higher than others!” then

31:38.197 --> 31:41.201
know that his fall is imminent.

31:46.361 --> 31:54.482
This kind of domination is absolutely not allowed

31:55.276 --> 32:01.851
and such a person falls, you have seen, this happens.

32:07.417 --> 32:11.533
So, no fragmentation is to be thought of.

32:15.070 --> 32:17.729
Everybody has to grow in a tree.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.417
Every bit is important.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.013
In a body every part is important.

32:28.676 --> 32:31.576
Even if there is a slightest pain in one of the fingers,

32:31.678 --> 32:33.678
the whole body looks after it.

32:35.283 --> 32:38.775
Does it cut out the finger because it is painful?

32:40.020 --> 32:45.040
Or does anything in the body think that that is so important?

32:45.763 --> 32:47.058
Even heart?

32:49.744 --> 32:54.095
That feeling itself is taking you away from the whole.

32:55.501 --> 33:00.592
Try to find your wholesomeness among your brothers and sisters,

33:02.056 --> 33:03.336
try to patch up.

33:05.385 --> 33:06.741
Love each other.

33:08.151 --> 33:09.485
Love each other.

33:09.758 --> 33:12.623
Now, no question of My saying as yourself,

33:12.703 --> 33:16.287
because you can feel it, that they all exist within you.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.667
So that question doesn’t arise.

33:21.556 --> 33:24.569
But those who try to exclude themselves

33:24.694 --> 33:26.426
and keep to themselves

33:26.540 --> 33:32.866
and just don’t bother about others, are not going to grow.

33:33.037 --> 33:35.211
Neither those who try to dominate others

33:35.302 --> 33:38.502
and try to sit on their heads and try to show off

33:39.134 --> 33:40.814
– they are going to fall.

33:44.112 --> 33:45.763
Why I’m saying this?

33:45.962 --> 33:50.683
Because England is very important to Me

33:52.487 --> 33:57.166
and this is a very common failing among us.

33:57.620 --> 34:02.527
When I’m talking to you, I’m talking as British, Myself.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.889
All those who are also here,

34:07.070 --> 34:09.233
Indians or whatsoever, they are all British

34:09.359 --> 34:11.825
and they all develop these qualities.

34:16.975 --> 34:20.566
So, no kind of aggressiveness will be permitted in Sahaja Yoga.

34:20.672 --> 34:24.070
Such a person will have to go out of circulation.

34:29.930 --> 34:32.172
One has to be very careful.

34:35.418 --> 34:40.741
The another very big problem of inertia is

34:42.805 --> 34:46.555
that people say, “Now Sahaja Yoga will do everything."

34:46.777 --> 34:49.922
Where is Sahaja Yoga? It exists within you.

34:50.071 --> 34:54.355
It’s in your own Kundalini, in your own hands, in your own feet.

34:54.450 --> 34:56.960
Before Realisation effortlessness is alright.

34:57.651 --> 35:00.907
After Realisation you have to be dynamic.

35:01.429 --> 35:04.748
For example, when you have to enlighten the light,

35:04.850 --> 35:08.690
the light doesn’t move here and there,
otherwise you cannot enlighten it.

35:08.788 --> 35:11.416
But after enlightenment, it has to give light,

35:11.509 --> 35:14.409
otherwise what’s the use of enlightening it?

35:18.842 --> 35:22.025
So, everybody has to start moving about

35:22.978 --> 35:27.521
and trying to work out Sahaja Yoga everywhere, every place,

35:28.440 --> 35:30.458
every person that you can.

35:31.851 --> 35:34.989
Talk to them in a way that they feel convinced

35:35.058 --> 35:36.991
that you are sensible people.

35:37.624 --> 35:40.806
The other day I was telling them that:

35:41.203 --> 35:44.692
I do not say that you should dress up in a way that is aggressive,

35:44.795 --> 35:47.931
but also not dress up in a way that is repulsive.

35:50.267 --> 35:53.767
Right from dressing up you go further,

35:54.426 --> 35:56.159
the way you talk to people.

35:56.916 --> 35:58.366
Then go deeper into it.

35:58.571 --> 36:02.294
It’s very easy for anybody to make
out whether you are genuine or not.

36:02.529 --> 36:05.043
And the most important is how far you have

36:05.123 --> 36:08.899
achieved in Sahaja Yoga is the point they are going to see.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.478
Not Me, they are going to see you.

36:15.359 --> 36:19.657
We all have to spread Sahaja Yoga, it is very important.

36:20.890 --> 36:26.487
And England is very important, much more than Europe or India.

36:31.465 --> 36:35.907
And that’s why I hope you all will understand your responsibility.

36:38.380 --> 36:42.925
First and foremost is to be humble, try to be humble.

36:43.484 --> 36:46.677
Humble because so far you have not known

36:47.119 --> 36:50.078
what is the Truth or the Reality is.

36:50.986 --> 36:53.651
To know it you have to be humble,

36:55.330 --> 36:58.402
because it doesn’t come to you out of arrogance.

36:58.614 --> 37:00.236
It comes through,

37:00.927 --> 37:04.258
it penetrates in you, it sieves through you if you are humble,

37:04.352 --> 37:05.753
otherwise it does not.

37:05.877 --> 37:07.241
I am warning you!

37:07.581 --> 37:08.631
It does not.

37:08.885 --> 37:10.631
It doesn’t go to arrogant people

37:10.722 --> 37:14.041
and to aggressive people, it doesn’t work out in them,

37:14.178 --> 37:16.711
it only works out among humble people.

37:21.508 --> 37:24.045
Try to be humble in your heart.

37:24.504 --> 37:26.653
We enjoy your humility.

37:27.743 --> 37:29.293
You really enjoy your humility.

37:29.871 --> 37:32.891
Actually humility gives you innocence.

37:33.459 --> 37:37.368
Humility is the only way to achieve our lost innocence.

37:38.116 --> 37:40.811
Even if you have all the powers of the world

37:40.936 --> 37:43.803
and you are humble, how beautiful you look!

37:47.297 --> 37:51.331
Any person who is in a big position and if he is humble,

37:51.819 --> 37:55.979
people write legends after such a personality.

38:00.312 --> 38:06.027
Try to develop a humble attitude towards life, extremely humble.

38:06.656 --> 38:11.424
But with humility we confuse inertia, that’s a wrong thing.

38:12.573 --> 38:16.329
Humility never means inertia, humility means dynamism.

38:22.304 --> 38:26.632
And that dynamism is extremely quiet, silent and beautiful.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.727
Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous thing, it’s Mahayoga.

38:33.877 --> 38:36.969
At this stage it is Mahayoga,

38:38.058 --> 38:41.663
because it has reached it’s highest peak now.

38:43.572 --> 38:48.694
Never in any incarnation so many realisations were given.

38:49.103 --> 38:51.152
Krishna used to do Sahaja Yog,

38:51.278 --> 38:54.565
He used to raise Kundalini, Rama did that,

38:55.121 --> 38:59.951
Christ did it, Buddha did it, Mahavira did it.

39:00.470 --> 39:03.740
Nobody could achieve mass realisation.

39:03.898 --> 39:09.594
Today it’s so fortunate that I am facing so many saints.

39:11.760 --> 39:16.134
It’s My great faith and great fortune

39:16.565 --> 39:19.003
that you all have got Realisation.

39:20.034 --> 39:24.430
You don’t know, My joy has no words to express itself.

39:25.303 --> 39:29.744
But let not this garden be ruined

39:31.979 --> 39:34.778
by abandonment and by foolishness.

39:35.004 --> 39:39.807
It is tender, newly blossoming, beautiful garden.

39:39.922 --> 39:43.277
Look after it with that care and gentleness.

39:48.980 --> 39:53.379
Otherwise it can all fritter away.

39:55.104 --> 39:58.548
Most of the fake gurus are being exposed now.

39:58.675 --> 40:00.816
They are all going to be exposed.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.966
They’ll fritter away because they are false.

40:04.348 --> 40:07.382
But if Sahaja Yoga fritters away, you English

40:07.643 --> 40:09.831
Sahaja Yogis will be held responsible

40:09.988 --> 40:12.387
because of your inertia or your arrogance.

40:12.569 --> 40:14.475
When you are active you are arrogant,

40:14.578 --> 40:18.511
when you are not you are lethargic.

40:20.641 --> 40:23.636
Please, come out of these two extremes.

40:25.169 --> 40:29.936
I request you to meditate on this about yourself

40:30.322 --> 40:35.094
and I’m sure we are going to achieve wonders,

40:36.588 --> 40:38.766
definitely, no doubt about it.

40:40.534 --> 40:42.331
May God bless you all

40:47.331 --> 40:49.871
Those who have come for the first time,

40:49.974 --> 40:52.026
I would request them to come in front

40:52.173 --> 40:54.640
so that we can see them, all of them.
