00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.764
Sahaja Yoga is the synthesis of all the Yogas.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:07.571
Only thing [is] human beings have

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.683
a wrong notion that they can do something about it.

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.795
It’s all built in them.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.037
Like any good instrument

00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:18.110
it’s all built in and as soon as the Kundalini starts

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.417
She starts working it out.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.918
And all these gadgets within us go into motion

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.287
and they create that

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:35.051
state within us by which the Kundalini rises within you.

00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:42.951
Perhaps, we take it for granted,

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:45.319
Kundalini rising so much because

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:48.538
we do not see all that’s happening within.

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:51.527
(Talking to a mother with a child) Can you
take him out?

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:57.875
He’s so happy that I don’t feel [he’s]
disturbing but everybody [else] is disturbed.

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:05.094
Rising of the Kundalini is the easiest for Me.

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:06.874
No problem.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.411
Even working out those gadgets as I called them

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:16.680
– chakras and their different movements,

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:20.162
constrictions and dilatation at a particular point

00:01:20.322 --> 00:01:23.902
when Kundalini is coming up – is not difficult.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:28.638
But there are two other channels within us,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.162
which you know very well, which act our sympathetic nervous system.

00:01:33.318 --> 00:01:37.374
Which can be quite in trouble

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.431
because of various conditionings within us.

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:44.953
For example, some people have, say,

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:47.743
a small conditioning like going to a spiritualist.

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:51.818
Take a position, a very simple thing like going to a spiritualist.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:55.095
Now you ask the person, “Have you been to a spiritualist?”

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:59.468
Because if you find burning on the left Swadishthana

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:02.125
and the heart catching a little, it’s definitely

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.789
he has been to somebody like that, which is unauthorised.

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:09.300
If you do something unauthorised you can feel it on your

00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:12.665
Swadishthana, that the person has been there.

00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:18.251
Now see, just say that he has been there, to a spiritualist,

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.162
you can work it out by giving the bandhan to the spiritualist

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:25.278
whose name he might tell. Even if he doesn’t tell it can work out.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.272
It is that subtle and it works that subtle.

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:29.956
But that much one has to say.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.220
Now, the reason for all this is this:

00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:36.414
that at this stage when you are getting Realisation,

00:02:36.518 --> 00:02:38.364
you are human beings,

00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:42.241
the highest that the Creation has created, highest.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.516
And that you have the freedom to choose

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:48.739
the Good or the Bad.

00:02:50.046 --> 00:02:52.563
This choice must be made by you.

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:55.307
If you make that willing choice,

00:02:55.432 --> 00:02:59.602
then Kundalini is the easiest thing for Me or for anyone of you.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.926
But if there is hesitation about it, for example, a person may say,

00:03:03.052 --> 00:03:06.060
“Oh, so what’s wrong? I went only for one day."

00:03:06.928 --> 00:03:09.673
Anything like that, Kundalini goes back.

00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:13.137
She is a sensitive thing, extremely sensitive:

00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:17.839
any kind of refusal to Her or denial to Her She goes down.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.248
And this is something if you understand that we are human beings

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.862
and we are the highest, highest in the Creation.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.104
We have no self-esteem, I tell you.

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.728
Human beings have no self-esteem.

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:40.578
If they had, they would not have behaved like this.

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:43.037
The way we are torturing ourselves, torturing others,

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:45.849
I mean doing all kinds of nonsense.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.043
If they had that understanding of themselves

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:53.717
there would have been no problem, but they do not have.

00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:56.028
Only when it comes to Kundalini,

00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:58.364
then they have all their esteem.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.028
Most surprising!

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:03.429
Then they will say, “Why not?
What’s wrong?”

00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:06.584
Anything you say that time, that’s the time they should be most

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:11.119
surrendering, that’s the time they’ll argue! It’s human nature!

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.209
Otherwise they will not argue,

00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:17.531
if you ask them, “Will you come to the pub?”
“Yes, why not?”

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.039
They’ll never argue.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.509
Have you heard anybody saying that?

00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.623
Me even, I mean I tell you, I dare not.

00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:28.500
Say, people come to My house for a party and thing,

00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:30.689
My husband has to offer them drinks

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.352
because they won’t talk to us if you do not offer them drinks.

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.748
That’s the thing in England. In India I never

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.626
would allow anybody to even bring any bottles in the house.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.001
But here they said, “English won’t talk to you

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:44.929
if you don’t have bottles in the house!

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.955
How can you do it, it’s not a house if there is no bottle!”

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:51.285
That’s the part of the culture, the base of it.

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:53.519
But I dare not say even once.

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:55.149
They will say “Why don’t you drink?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:56.985
Is it not allowed in your religion?

00:04:57.086 --> 00:05:01.775
Why don’t you drink?”
But if I say, “Why do you drink?”, finished!

00:05:04.024 --> 00:05:07.232
I have no manners.
I am most unmannerly person going round!

00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:08.785
You see My point?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.032
You are not supposed to say these things,

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.095
you are not supposed to discuss these things.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.212
But if you say some sort of a dirty joke,

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.749
really everybody will be very happy.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.628
There is nothing like indecency indecorum in those things.

00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:26.256
But it is indecent to say something decent!

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.142
In the same way in Kundalini it happens

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.449
that when it comes to actual Kundalini rising,

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.987
one should be in the most humble manner, “Oh, God!”

00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:40.536
Just see the time, the moment has come for you to get what it is.

00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.509
That time they’ll be arrogantly like this, you see, sitting,

00:05:43.622 --> 00:05:45.036
“No, it doesn’t happen to me!”

00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:49.093
As if it’s a very great thing it’s not happening to you!
Just imagine!

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.973
It would be like a king sitting on a throne

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:56.665
and somebody is trying to put the crown on the head

00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:00.553
and the person says, “Oh, it doesn’t fit me at all!”

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:03.223
It’s that silly, you know.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.567
But it is so.

00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:08.234
And this is why the Kundalini,

00:06:08.586 --> 00:06:12.089
the Kundalini doesn’t rise and She stops.

00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:24.437
And once She is that way, little bit insulted She feels hesitant.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.655
You see, like a guest who has come into your house,

00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:30.240
if you put a punch on the nose,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.272
it will take time for you to patch up the whole thing, isn’t it?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.721
And that patching up is just so slow,

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:42.460
I mean people just don’t believe in patching up anything.

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.659
And that’s why the Kundalini is so disturbing.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:48.992
It is so disturbing.

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:56.211
One should understand that She is extremely sensitive,

00:06:57.198 --> 00:06:58.878
She is your self-respect.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:05.710
Any fun you make out of Her is a waste:

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.059
you are wasting yourself,
you are wasting the energy of the Kundalini,

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:13.540
you are stopping your Realisation.

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:21.779
It is very important to understand that She is Knowledge.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.838
Whatever you have read so far is not knowledge, is Avidya.

00:07:25.976 --> 00:07:29.085
Humility must come to you for that, very important.

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:31.121
You might have read thousands of books,

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:34.648
makes no difference to the Kundalini.
She is Knowledge.

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:39.763
That time all your knowledge will come,

00:07:39.858 --> 00:07:42.601
“Mother, I’ve read in this book this is written, that is written,”

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:47.193
Finished! [Then] your Realisation is a very difficult thing.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.099
I’m here sitting down, “Oh please,

00:07:50.192 --> 00:07:52.218
have your Realisation, don’t disturb Her”.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.734
I’m sitting in between like a mediator, you see,

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:57.611
between Her and you, “Now, don’t disturb Her”.

00:07:57.763 --> 00:08:00.728
Here you are, suddenly you come out with a special

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:02.915
announcement that, “I’ve read such and such book”

00:08:02.996 --> 00:08:05.841
and that book must be from some bhoot or somebody horrible,

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:07.091
has to be.

00:08:07.373 --> 00:08:09.479
And then you come out, “I’ve read that book

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:12.485
and such and such, it says so…”, finished.

00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:17.449
Here we are talking of actualisation,

00:08:17.812 --> 00:08:22.789
of gettingRealisation, not of books.

00:08:23.172 --> 00:08:26.151
You have to forget what you have been going through.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.768
You have to forget what you have been doing so far for Kundalini.

00:08:30.895 --> 00:08:34.052
You have to forget all those things you have had

00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:36.527
so far through your gurus and this and that,

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:38.950
and all other sorts of nonsense.

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:42.123
You have to forget all that and you have to think it’s a

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:45.014
very simple abode of your Mother

00:08:45.535 --> 00:08:48.687
where you have come just to have your food.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.520
Please come and be seated and have your food.

00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:57.272
With that simplicity of heart only, the Kundalini will react.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.628
If you are a lord of some place,

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:02.413
Kundalini will say “Alright, go and be a lord."

00:09:02.562 --> 00:09:04.865
Kundalini is not bothered about you.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.667
She knows who is arrogant, She knows who is humble,

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:09.880
She knows who wants Realisation.

00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:13.478
She has been recording everything what you have been doing

00:09:13.558 --> 00:09:16.063
since long, since ages, since many lives.

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:17.435
So She knows everything.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.519
And if She even now finds the same thing,

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:22.571
She just refuses to rise.

00:09:25.518 --> 00:09:27.851
I’ve seen it’s a common experience:

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.564
if somebody doesn’t get Realisation,

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:31.671
he feels very proud, “Oh, I’m not mesmerised!”

00:09:31.809 --> 00:09:34.187
I said, “Is it mesmerism, is it?”

00:09:36.938 --> 00:09:41.368
If through mesmerism you could cure cancer,

00:09:41.502 --> 00:09:44.178
then I think mesmerism is a good idea,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.880
if it is mesmerism!

00:09:52.143 --> 00:09:56.233
So first of all, before getting Realisation, one has to know

00:09:57.152 --> 00:09:59.485
that this is what you are seeking,

00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:02.077
this is what you have to have

00:10:02.174 --> 00:10:06.378
and the Kundalini is the only thing that is going to transform you.

00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:08.362
There’s no doubt about it.

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:12.901
But even when you come to that point of Kundalini,

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:15.035
people have read books on Kundalini also.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.848
And everything they’ve read, already,

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:19.606
they have sorted out everything already!

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.104
So, then they ask,

00:10:24.577 --> 00:10:27.094
“Then what about that book?
It says so…”

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:30.678
Now you see for yourself, why don’t you see what it is like!

00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:33.745
But in seeing also you have to be humble.

00:10:34.016 --> 00:10:37.723
Those people who have come to us with humility, with innocence,

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:43.075
have got Realisation very well, and they’ve established it.

00:10:44.922 --> 00:10:49.477
They have got it at a time, some of them, who were just dying,

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:53.428
just dying, they came to Me at the time they were in coma.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.835
But they have established themselves

00:10:55.914 --> 00:10:57.981
because they were true seekers.

00:10:58.218 --> 00:11:01.674
If you have to seek the Truth, you have to be truthful also.

00:11:01.776 --> 00:11:05.050
And if you are truthful you will see that this is truthful.

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:09.528
There is no hanky-panky in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot have.

00:11:10.185 --> 00:11:12.932
There is no befooling or anything.

00:11:13.102 --> 00:11:14.698
That’s not possible.

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:18.202
The Kundalini has to rise, She has to give you Realisation,

00:11:18.384 --> 00:11:20.481
She has to get you alright.

00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:23.772
No other certificate is needed.

00:11:24.912 --> 00:11:27.611
This is the main certificate you have to have

00:11:27.735 --> 00:11:29.899
– that you get your Realisation,

00:11:30.025 --> 00:11:32.110
you feel your vibrations, not others.

00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:34.106
Some other people can feel it.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.167
The other day we had a very unique experience

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.133
and there was a gentleman and the Kundalini was trying to push

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.917
the Sahasrara and the whole Grace was flowing on him

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:47.242
as if like a fountain coming out of here,

00:11:47.367 --> 00:11:49.169
and nothing was going into his being.

00:11:49.262 --> 00:11:50.541
Can you imagine!

00:11:50.735 --> 00:11:54.713
The Grace, just pouring onto that dumb fellow.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.179
It was all falling on all the sides but nothing going into him!

00:11:59.697 --> 00:12:01.825
And the fellow was very proud,

00:12:01.894 --> 00:12:03.901
“Oh, nothing is happening to me!”you see.

00:12:04.086 --> 00:12:05.605
I said, “Look at this man!”

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:09.071
The Grace has to be accepted.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:13.546
With folded hands one has to get it. With humility.

00:12:16.477 --> 00:12:22.185
How can we be arrogant when the Grace is coming on you?

00:12:22.543 --> 00:12:26.385
Is it sensible, is that good manners, by any chance?

00:12:29.652 --> 00:12:32.212
One has to be extremely humble.

00:12:34.614 --> 00:12:37.458
That will show to the Kundalini that you want it,

00:12:37.594 --> 00:12:39.274
that you want to have it.

00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:48.849
At the smallest of points it has been stopped.

00:12:50.913 --> 00:12:52.225
Like I would say,

00:12:52.357 --> 00:12:56.481
if a little thing goes into the eyes, you cannot see the whole sky.

00:12:56.613 --> 00:12:57.693
In the same way,

00:12:57.822 --> 00:13:01.118
a very small thing, a very, very small thing

00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:04.500
can stop the movement of the Kundalini.

00:13:05.849 --> 00:13:09.748
And that small thing, if somebody says, “Ask this question.

00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:12.332
Please ask and get it.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:20.814
This is your due,” you have to just, to be humble.

00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:23.694
If you cannot be humble

00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:25.663
it is not going to work out.

00:13:28.002 --> 00:13:30.181
That’s something so simple

00:13:31.065 --> 00:13:33.932
but it’s difficult for people to be simple.

00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:39.388
Seeker: The word ‘humble’ is
misunderstood in England, I think, a lot.

00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:42.300
Does humble mean “no intellectual arrogance”?

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.410
No intellectual arrogance? Is a good idea, I tell you!

00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:47.922
Intellectual arrogance now…

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.178
Can you open the windows, please?

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:51.846
Windows a little bit more.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.106
That you can open.

00:13:53.214 --> 00:13:55.133
There are so many people are here.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.573
…that’s a good idea!

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:58.602
Now, let’s see intellectuals.

00:13:58.714 --> 00:13:59.714
Oh, God!

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.411
I’ve had enough of them!

00:14:05.006 --> 00:14:07.584
Even the name gives you heat, I tell you.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.534
Now, let’s see the intellectuals, the rationality.

00:14:13.268 --> 00:14:15.335
Rationality has lead us where?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.987
Just think over it.

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:22.454
Rationality is nothing but your brain’s own imagination.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.836
You can rationalise everything.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.530
“What’s wrong?”

00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:29.235
What’s wrong in anything?

00:14:29.419 --> 00:14:32.670
People are killing their own children, “What’s wrong?

00:14:32.853 --> 00:14:35.822
What’s wrong, tell Me? Basically, what’s wrong?”

00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:38.909
I mean, they are their own children, they have produced it,

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.652
they are killing it, they can produce more, what’s wrong?

00:14:43.127 --> 00:14:46.435
Tomorrow, you will be amazed,
there will be people coming out to say that,

00:14:46.537 --> 00:14:50.569
“If we kill our children you have no business to say anything!”

00:14:51.899 --> 00:14:54.172
People will come and fight the law

00:14:54.274 --> 00:14:57.410
that, “If they are our children we can kill them.

00:14:57.562 --> 00:14:58.782
We have produced them.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.806
We can produce more children.
What’s wrong?”

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:06.126
You see, rationality can give all kinds of absurd ideas.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.516
But it is not wisdom.

00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:15.361
It is not wisdom, it’s not logical.

00:15:19.312 --> 00:15:21.437
Everything has to be logical.

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:23.908
Sahaja Yoga is Absolute logic.

00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:33.227
Rationality is limited, but logic is not.

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:38.319
When you sit down with the logic you can see

00:15:38.557 --> 00:15:42.205
that you have given birth to a child, he has a right to live

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:48.192
and you have no right to kill – that’s the logic.

00:15:49.193 --> 00:15:54.483
If you have right to kill then it is also rightful to kill you,

00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:01.012
because you are a child of somebody else,

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:04.027
if your father kills you, is it all right?

00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:06.159
Reverse it back.

00:16:07.239 --> 00:16:08.876
That is logic.

00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:17.900
So, the so-called intellectuals, where have they reached?

00:16:20.659 --> 00:16:22.298
That’s all nonsense.

00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:25.355
They’ve reached at a nonsensical point.

00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:29.114
Take any, any realm, say take politics.

00:16:29.353 --> 00:16:32.052
Of course I’ve nothing to do with it because it is absurd,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.720
it’s a myth for Me.

00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:37.344
They are just playing with shadows.

00:16:38.796 --> 00:16:40.464
There’s no Reality in it!

00:16:40.552 --> 00:16:43.248
None of the politics has any Reality in it

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:45.853
which is today existing whether it is capitalism

00:16:45.933 --> 00:16:47.613
or communism or anything.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:51.885
Because they have not yet found out the Real Laws.

00:16:52.112 --> 00:16:54.161
They have not yet found out the

00:16:54.276 --> 00:16:56.633
Power which governs the world.

00:16:59.071 --> 00:17:03.819
Only it is the Kingdom of God that can have some politics

00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:08.043
and is the natural politics.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.910
They are fighting about communism to capitalism.

00:17:12.216 --> 00:17:14.810
What sort of capitalism we have here

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:18.146
and what sort of communism they have here?

00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:21.842
From fire to frying pan like that.

00:17:22.565 --> 00:17:25.516
It’s all useless, absolutely mythical.

00:17:25.674 --> 00:17:29.991
Man has not yet achieved that state
where he can decide about his politics.

00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:31.654
After Realisation,

00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:35.236
you know that you have powers, you become a capitalist.

00:17:35.362 --> 00:17:37.809
And you have to distribute it [so] you become a communist.

00:17:37.934 --> 00:17:40.323
You become both, you have to be a communist

00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:42.044
and you have to be a capitalist

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.527
and you are very happy that you are a capitalist

00:17:44.653 --> 00:17:46.586
because you can be communist.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.048
If you don’t have your own powers,

00:17:49.174 --> 00:17:51.507
how are you going to distribute it?

00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:56.294
The whole priority is changed and a big difference comes in.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:59.723
When you do not know your powers,

00:18:00.188 --> 00:18:04.640
when you do not know that there is All-pervading Power beyond,

00:18:04.982 --> 00:18:07.249
then what are you discussing here?

00:18:07.363 --> 00:18:11.102
It is something like, you have no money in the bank,

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:13.183
there is no market available

00:18:13.313 --> 00:18:16.213
and you are just discussing here what to buy!

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:26.972
So, this intellectual business is a mythical thing,

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.166
is nothing but a myth.

00:18:29.623 --> 00:18:31.562
It’s just a myth, believe Me.

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:34.227
It is nothing but a myth.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:56.889
Intelligence which is not logical is abandonment, is abandonment.

00:18:58.248 --> 00:19:01.799
You cannot have intelligence with arrogance, you cannot have.

00:19:01.896 --> 00:19:04.296
If you have it, it’s not intelligence.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.171
Every intelligent man knows that he should not be arrogant,

00:19:09.895 --> 00:19:12.162
if he is really truly intelligent.

00:19:14.707 --> 00:19:17.485
Very simple logic: if you are arrogant,

00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:20.693
others can be arrogant with you, do you like it?

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:23.915
No one likes it.

00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:32.765
Simple, simple equations are there.

00:19:34.314 --> 00:19:37.966
If you are intelligent you may be anything

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.254
– so what does it matter?

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.040
“You hang yourself by the nearest tree,”

00:19:41.131 --> 00:19:45.152
that’s what people will say, if you try to be rude to them.

00:19:47.287 --> 00:19:50.048
If you are very rich and segmented,

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:54.865
fragmented then you do not enjoy your riches with others:

00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:59.521
what’s the use of all the riches with you?

00:20:00.823 --> 00:20:03.322
Life is so logical, it’s so logical!

00:20:03.492 --> 00:20:07.843
But I think this logic you see after Realisation better and simple,

00:20:08.502 --> 00:20:11.391
because you start sharing, you can feel the sharing,

00:20:11.506 --> 00:20:13.920
you can feel it others, you can feel others Vishuddhi,

00:20:14.046 --> 00:20:16.494
you can feel others Nabhi and all these chakras

00:20:16.642 --> 00:20:18.364
and you know we are sharing now.

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:19.903
So, here we are

00:20:19.994 --> 00:20:23.514
that we know that we are not separated, we are all one.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.502
But today I have to warn a little bit, all of you,

00:20:32.555 --> 00:20:39.741
that in Sahaja Yoga, we have people who get into Realisation,

00:20:41.294 --> 00:20:42.974
becoming angels, really.

00:20:44.444 --> 00:20:48.375
It’s the boon by which you become angels, real angel...

00:20:48.864 --> 00:20:51.153
But angels should not fall.

00:20:51.758 --> 00:20:55.849
You must have heard about an angel called Lucifer who fell down

00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:57.881
and he became a Satan.

00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:05.253
And it’s very dangerous for a Sahaja Yogi

00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:09.899
not to be a Sahaja Yogi after some time.

00:21:11.588 --> 00:21:14.397
He has to take a decision that, “I’m going

00:21:14.488 --> 00:21:19.454
to be a righteous person, a good person and a good Sahaja Yogi."

00:21:21.075 --> 00:21:27.183
He cannot be a policeman and a thief, he cannot do it.

00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:30.380
You think of a policeman becoming a thief, what happens?

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.546
He is punished doubly.

00:21:35.742 --> 00:21:39.711
It is just like that: a policeman cannot become a thief.

00:21:40.742 --> 00:21:45.445
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi has to rise.

00:21:45.832 --> 00:21:49.882
If he does not, it’s a very dangerous thing

00:21:50.388 --> 00:21:53.536
and I would warn you that you’ll go out of circulation.

00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:58.078
You just get out of circulation

00:21:58.294 --> 00:22:03.790
from Sahaja Yoga, absolutely out of circulation.

00:22:04.196 --> 00:22:06.328
I think it’s hot for the baby.

00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:08.790
Take the baby out for a while, alright?

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:09.890
It’s very hot.

00:22:09.982 --> 00:22:10.982
Yes, take it.

00:22:11.152 --> 00:22:12.152
It’s very hot.

00:22:12.254 --> 00:22:15.936
Please, open the doors and windows,

00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:23.399
it will be a good idea.

00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:31.619
So, one has to understand that in Sahaja Yoga you have to grow.

00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:33.678
All of you must grow,

00:22:33.804 --> 00:22:37.216
allow your growth to take place, do not hinder it.

00:22:37.403 --> 00:22:41.063
The more you’ll grow the more enjoyable it will be!

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.016
But as we are human beings, have coming out of some sort of a

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.292
falsehood into the Truth,

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.841
Reality, we have to hold on to the Reality

00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:54.392
much more than to the falsehood.

00:22:54.551 --> 00:22:58.380
But still if there is clinging, please try to shed them off.

00:22:58.716 --> 00:23:03.392
Throw them out, do not cling onto that.

00:23:03.708 --> 00:23:05.757
The growth has to take place.

00:23:05.931 --> 00:23:10.463
Now the greatest calamity of

00:23:10.588 --> 00:23:13.445
our London, England, Sahaja Yogis, we should see that

00:23:13.574 --> 00:23:15.600
– because I know Indian Sahaja Yogis as they are,

00:23:15.714 --> 00:23:17.809
they have their own problems, but we have one,

00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.534
and that is inertia.

00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:21.709
Inertia is our problem.

00:23:22.763 --> 00:23:26.260
The whole country is set up with it, the inertia.

00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:29.911
It’s a very serious problem for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:30.852 --> 00:23:33.548
And I would tell you, I have been to Europe,

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.448
I’ve been to Portugal, I’ve been to

00:23:36.562 --> 00:23:38.512
India, of course you know very well and

00:23:38.614 --> 00:23:43.364
also Australia – inertia is maximum in England.

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:49.960
Now what is the reason?

00:23:51.548 --> 00:23:54.186
We must go to the root of this cause.

00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:58.493
I have told you that England is the Heart of the Universe.

00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:04.153
Seeker: Must be a joke – England is the Heart of the Universe?

00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:06.497
You didn’t know that?
Seeker: The Universe, is it?

00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:10.322
Yes.
Seeker: Don’t believe you!

00:24:10.503 --> 00:24:13.883
Shri Mataji: That’s too much ah?

00:24:40.656 --> 00:24:48.296
Then speaking aside about changing for a bigger
room in 5 minutes.

00:24:50.499 --> 00:24:52.776
Now about this heart I will tell you

00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:54.976
downstairs, I think, if we can move down.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.277
There it will be better because it’s very hot here

00:24:57.368 --> 00:25:00.225
and there’s a food also is to be organised in that room.

00:25:00.377 --> 00:25:02.228
So it’s better to go now.

00:25:02.438 --> 00:25:06.618
All right?
Go and find your seats, I’ll be just there.

00:25:10.726 --> 00:25:14.764
And you are the people who are responsible for the heart.

00:25:15.886 --> 00:25:19.742
Now heart is the most important organ in the body.

00:25:20.872 --> 00:25:23.324
If the heart fails, the whole body fails.

00:25:25.435 --> 00:25:29.120
Supposing the brain fails, still the body will go on.

00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:36.243
But if the heart fails, the body stops functioning.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.842
So the attack is on the heart.

00:25:46.057 --> 00:25:50.279
All the satanic forces and demonic forces and destructive forces

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:54.446
will try to attack the heart, naturally,

00:25:56.475 --> 00:25:59.511
because if they attack any other place

00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:07.563
then the body will be still functioning.

00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:12.524
So, first they will try all their methods to attack the heart.

00:26:12.987 --> 00:26:16.366
I’m saying this because today there are at least

00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:18.112
80% Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

00:26:18.214 --> 00:26:21.350
that they should understand their responsibility.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.554
If this heart becomes frozen through inertia,

00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:37.721
there is no hope for the whole world and neither for the Universe

00:26:43.152 --> 00:26:46.338
or for this Creation, there is no hope.

00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:51.449
That’s why I’m stationed in England.

00:26:53.668 --> 00:26:57.368
I have been travelling and travelling in England,

00:26:58.548 --> 00:27:00.228
spreading vibrations.

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:05.934
But I think English Sahaja Yogis do not think

00:27:06.694 --> 00:27:13.156
how important it is to awaken themselves and to work it out.

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:22.336
The movement is extremely slow as if it is deadening.

00:27:22.616 --> 00:27:25.817
And I am sometimes really worried about it.

00:27:31.211 --> 00:27:35.147
We have to see now how these negative forces work in us.

00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:42.192
They work in us in various ways.

00:27:47.313 --> 00:27:48.433
First of all,

00:27:51.406 --> 00:27:55.816
they will work in us through people who are vulnerable.

00:28:05.855 --> 00:28:09.821
We have people among us who are weak Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:14.084 --> 00:28:17.691
Who cannot sustain the Truth within themselves

00:28:20.889 --> 00:28:25.229
and they are very vulnerable for all these negative forces.

00:28:32.206 --> 00:28:35.173
These negative forces work through them.

00:28:39.572 --> 00:28:47.750
They give you ideas as a very highly developed centre.

00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:55.196
There were some Sahaja Yogis who are really first class,

00:28:56.999 --> 00:29:00.519
they were given idea by one of the such vulnerable one

00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:04.599
that, “Why should we combine with others who are not so good?

00:29:04.725 --> 00:29:07.196
Let’s have a separate entity."

00:29:07.855 --> 00:29:09.554
Because, before this,

00:29:09.691 --> 00:29:12.559
one person used to get very important and he used to organise,

00:29:12.616 --> 00:29:15.516
“Do this!” and “Do that!” and used to boast.

00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:19.675
Because I stopped all that, they

00:29:19.834 --> 00:29:23.281
– these people who were really good and sensible people,

00:29:23.392 --> 00:29:25.182
they were given this idea that,

00:29:25.308 --> 00:29:26.997
“Let’s start our organisation separately”.

00:29:27.123 --> 00:29:30.455
I mean, in the sense that, “Let’s have a deeper

00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:34.488
meditation” or some sort of a thing.

00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:41.259
To a simple person it would look really good

00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.822
because those who are good should really go further,

00:29:43.902 --> 00:29:47.405
why should they be, sort of, tied with others.

00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:55.231
But one has to know that you cannot be segmented.

00:29:57.659 --> 00:30:02.330
If this finger is sick it is more
necessary to look after that sick finger.

00:30:02.432 --> 00:30:03.640
I do that way.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.812
If I look after someone much more,

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:11.132
then know that person needs My help, that’s why. To a point.

00:30:13.284 --> 00:30:16.263
But sometimes such people can come out to say that,

00:30:16.367 --> 00:30:17.885
“Oh, Mother cares for me so much.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.410
She has said this, She said that!”

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:21.356
All sorts of nonsense can work out.

00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:24.645
It depends on your wisdom to understand.

00:30:29.237 --> 00:30:35.924
Now, when these people said that they would like to have a another

00:30:37.216 --> 00:30:41.241
organisation or, say, another deeper meditation thing.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.382
I said, “You have not even followed the basics of Sahaja Yoga

00:30:45.541 --> 00:30:47.093
though you have gone so high up.

00:30:47.206 --> 00:30:48.318
How is it?”

00:30:53.129 --> 00:30:56.425
Everyone is a part of One Whole

00:30:59.135 --> 00:31:03.375
and we have to articulate through them this Divine life.

00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:09.942
Nobody is to be condemned or discredited and put down.

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.210
Everyone is important.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.117
If somebody is so sick that he should be taken out,

00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:18.349
he goes out of circulation automatically.

00:31:18.508 --> 00:31:20.108
It is managed that way.

00:31:20.525 --> 00:31:24.015
You have seen so many people have gone out of circulation.

00:31:24.691 --> 00:31:26.858
Then it is their lookout.

00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:30.809
But you don’t worry about these things,

00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:34.538
you have to only worry how much one you are one with others.

00:31:34.662 --> 00:31:38.084
If one person says, “I am higher than others!” then

00:31:38.197 --> 00:31:41.201
know that his fall is imminent.

00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:54.482
This kind of domination is absolutely not allowed

00:31:55.276 --> 00:32:01.851
and such a person falls, you have seen, this happens.

00:32:07.417 --> 00:32:11.533
So, no fragmentation is to be thought of.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:17.729
Everybody has to grow in a tree.

00:32:19.938 --> 00:32:22.417
Every bit is important.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:28.013
In a body every part is important.

00:32:28.676 --> 00:32:31.576
Even if there is a slightest pain in one of the fingers,

00:32:31.678 --> 00:32:33.678
the whole body looks after it.

00:32:35.283 --> 00:32:38.775
Does it cut out the finger because it is painful?

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.040
Or does anything in the body think that that is so important?

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:47.058
Even heart?

00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:54.095
That feeling itself is taking you away from the whole.

00:32:55.501 --> 00:33:00.592
Try to find your wholesomeness among your brothers and sisters,

00:33:02.056 --> 00:33:03.336
try to patch up.

00:33:05.385 --> 00:33:06.741
Love each other.

00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:09.485
Love each other.

00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:12.623
Now, no question of My saying as yourself,

00:33:12.703 --> 00:33:16.287
because you can feel it, that they all exist within you.

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.667
So that question doesn’t arise.

00:33:21.556 --> 00:33:24.569
But those who try to exclude themselves

00:33:24.694 --> 00:33:26.426
and keep to themselves

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:32.866
and just don’t bother about others, are not going to grow.

00:33:33.037 --> 00:33:35.211
Neither those who try to dominate others

00:33:35.302 --> 00:33:38.502
and try to sit on their heads and try to show off

00:33:39.134 --> 00:33:40.814
– they are going to fall.

00:33:44.112 --> 00:33:45.763
Why I’m saying this?

00:33:45.962 --> 00:33:50.683
Because England is very important to Me

00:33:52.487 --> 00:33:57.166
and this is a very common failing among us.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:02.527
When I’m talking to you, I’m talking as British, Myself.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.889
All those who are also here,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:09.233
Indians or whatsoever, they are all British

00:34:09.359 --> 00:34:11.825
and they all develop these qualities.

00:34:16.975 --> 00:34:20.566
So, no kind of aggressiveness will be permitted in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:20.672 --> 00:34:24.070
Such a person will have to go out of circulation.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.172
One has to be very careful.

00:34:35.418 --> 00:34:40.741
The another very big problem of inertia is

00:34:42.805 --> 00:34:46.555
that people say, “Now Sahaja Yoga will do everything."

00:34:46.777 --> 00:34:49.922
Where is Sahaja Yoga? It exists within you.

00:34:50.071 --> 00:34:54.355
It’s in your own Kundalini, in your own hands, in your own feet.

00:34:54.450 --> 00:34:56.960
Before Realisation effortlessness is alright.

00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:00.907
After Realisation you have to be dynamic.

00:35:01.429 --> 00:35:04.748
For example, when you have to enlighten the light,

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.690
the light doesn’t move here and there,
otherwise you cannot enlighten it.

00:35:08.788 --> 00:35:11.416
But after enlightenment, it has to give light,

00:35:11.509 --> 00:35:14.409
otherwise what’s the use of enlightening it?

00:35:18.842 --> 00:35:22.025
So, everybody has to start moving about

00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:27.521
and trying to work out Sahaja Yoga everywhere, every place,

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.458
every person that you can.

00:35:31.851 --> 00:35:34.989
Talk to them in a way that they feel convinced

00:35:35.058 --> 00:35:36.991
that you are sensible people.

00:35:37.624 --> 00:35:40.806
The other day I was telling them that:

00:35:41.203 --> 00:35:44.692
I do not say that you should dress up in a way that is aggressive,

00:35:44.795 --> 00:35:47.931
but also not dress up in a way that is repulsive.

00:35:50.267 --> 00:35:53.767
Right from dressing up you go further,

00:35:54.426 --> 00:35:56.159
the way you talk to people.

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.366
Then go deeper into it.

00:35:58.571 --> 00:36:02.294
It’s very easy for anybody to make
out whether you are genuine or not.

00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:05.043
And the most important is how far you have

00:36:05.123 --> 00:36:08.899
achieved in Sahaja Yoga is the point they are going to see.

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:13.478
Not Me, they are going to see you.

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:19.657
We all have to spread Sahaja Yoga, it is very important.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:26.487
And England is very important, much more than Europe or India.

00:36:31.465 --> 00:36:35.907
And that’s why I hope you all will understand your responsibility.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:42.925
First and foremost is to be humble, try to be humble.

00:36:43.484 --> 00:36:46.677
Humble because so far you have not known

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:50.078
what is the Truth or the Reality is.

00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:53.651
To know it you have to be humble,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:58.402
because it doesn’t come to you out of arrogance.

00:36:58.614 --> 00:37:00.236
It comes through,

00:37:00.927 --> 00:37:04.258
it penetrates in you, it sieves through you if you are humble,

00:37:04.352 --> 00:37:05.753
otherwise it does not.

00:37:05.877 --> 00:37:07.241
I am warning you!

00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:08.631
It does not.

00:37:08.885 --> 00:37:10.631
It doesn’t go to arrogant people

00:37:10.722 --> 00:37:14.041
and to aggressive people, it doesn’t work out in them,

00:37:14.178 --> 00:37:16.711
it only works out among humble people.

00:37:21.508 --> 00:37:24.045
Try to be humble in your heart.

00:37:24.504 --> 00:37:26.653
We enjoy your humility.

00:37:27.743 --> 00:37:29.293
You really enjoy your humility.

00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:32.891
Actually humility gives you innocence.

00:37:33.459 --> 00:37:37.368
Humility is the only way to achieve our lost innocence.

00:37:38.116 --> 00:37:40.811
Even if you have all the powers of the world

00:37:40.936 --> 00:37:43.803
and you are humble, how beautiful you look!

00:37:47.297 --> 00:37:51.331
Any person who is in a big position and if he is humble,

00:37:51.819 --> 00:37:55.979
people write legends after such a personality.

00:38:00.312 --> 00:38:06.027
Try to develop a humble attitude towards life, extremely humble.

00:38:06.656 --> 00:38:11.424
But with humility we confuse inertia, that’s a wrong thing.

00:38:12.573 --> 00:38:16.329
Humility never means inertia, humility means dynamism.

00:38:22.304 --> 00:38:26.632
And that dynamism is extremely quiet, silent and beautiful.

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:33.727
Sahaja Yoga is a tremendous thing, it’s Mahayoga.

00:38:33.877 --> 00:38:36.969
At this stage it is Mahayoga,

00:38:38.058 --> 00:38:41.663
because it has reached it’s highest peak now.

00:38:43.572 --> 00:38:48.694
Never in any incarnation so many realisations were given.

00:38:49.103 --> 00:38:51.152
Krishna used to do Sahaja Yog,

00:38:51.278 --> 00:38:54.565
He used to raise Kundalini, Rama did that,

00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:59.951
Christ did it, Buddha did it, Mahavira did it.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.740
Nobody could achieve mass realisation.

00:39:03.898 --> 00:39:09.594
Today it’s so fortunate that I am facing so many saints.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.134
It’s My great faith and great fortune

00:39:16.565 --> 00:39:19.003
that you all have got Realisation.

00:39:20.034 --> 00:39:24.430
You don’t know, My joy has no words to express itself.

00:39:25.303 --> 00:39:29.744
But let not this garden be ruined

00:39:31.979 --> 00:39:34.778
by abandonment and by foolishness.

00:39:35.004 --> 00:39:39.807
It is tender, newly blossoming, beautiful garden.

00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:43.277
Look after it with that care and gentleness.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.379
Otherwise it can all fritter away.

00:39:55.104 --> 00:39:58.548
Most of the fake gurus are being exposed now.

00:39:58.675 --> 00:40:00.816
They are all going to be exposed.

00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:03.966
They’ll fritter away because they are false.

00:40:04.348 --> 00:40:07.382
But if Sahaja Yoga fritters away, you English

00:40:07.643 --> 00:40:09.831
Sahaja Yogis will be held responsible

00:40:09.988 --> 00:40:12.387
because of your inertia or your arrogance.

00:40:12.569 --> 00:40:14.475
When you are active you are arrogant,

00:40:14.578 --> 00:40:18.511
when you are not you are lethargic.

00:40:20.641 --> 00:40:23.636
Please, come out of these two extremes.

00:40:25.169 --> 00:40:29.936
I request you to meditate on this about yourself

00:40:30.322 --> 00:40:35.094
and I’m sure we are going to achieve wonders,

00:40:36.588 --> 00:40:38.766
definitely, no doubt about it.

00:40:40.534 --> 00:40:42.331
May God bless you all

00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:49.871
Those who have come for the first time,

00:40:49.974 --> 00:40:52.026
I would request them to come in front

00:40:52.173 --> 00:40:54.640
so that we can see them, all of them.
