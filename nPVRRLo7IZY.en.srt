1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,847
It is so Sahaj today that the day
of celebration

2
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:24,343
has fallen onto the birthday
of Shri Ganesh.

3
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:30,777
Every month they celebrate the fourth day
of the moon

4
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:39,636
as the birth date of Shri Ganesh,
and today is that date.

5
00:00:39,837 --> 00:00:48,156
Luckily, we are here for the Puja
of Shri Ganesha on His birthday.

6
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:58,568
I’ve said a lot about Shri Ganesha
and His importance in our life.

7
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:07,540
He is the giver of wisdom, but this wisdom
comes from our innocence.

8
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:14,676
Innocence that is innate within us.

9
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:27,061
As children we are innocent, but as we
grow we start exerting ourselves

10
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:32,165
in a manner that we start losing
our innocence.

11
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:39,287
We lose it in two ways; once we have
lost our innocence,

12
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:43,100
we cannot believe that others
could be innocent.

13
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:49,984
Another is, that we think innocence
is not important.

14
00:01:53,274 --> 00:02:01,324
Innocence is the sustenance, is the basis
of spirituality.

15
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:07,903
If a person doesn’t have innocence,
he cannot rise in spirituality.

16
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,562
That’s why the first job of Sahaja Yoga is

17
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:15,991
to establish Shri Ganesha within you,
to awaken Him.

18
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,887
As soon as the Kundalini awakens, you must
know that Shri Ganesha comes into being.

19
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:28,288
Without His awakening within you,
Kundalini cannot be raised.

20
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:34,578
But it could be temporary, or it could
be a permanent thing.

21
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:40,900
It could be very temporary with people
who are not yet adjusted

22
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:49,793
to the new method, or to the ways
of God’s love.

23
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:54,909
Those who have not understood, or those
who have not gone through those traditions,

24
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,641
it is rather difficult for them to establish
Shri Ganesha within them.

25
00:02:59,842 --> 00:03:09,336
At this point I find, there are people
who fight with their problems,

26
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:15,398
and try to overcome the outward problems,
and establish Shri Ganesha.

27
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,636
But there are other people who are still
not there;

28
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:26,892
they start doubting others’ innocence.
In Sahaja Yoga is a very common failing.

29
00:03:27,093 --> 00:03:30,233
I have seen people complaining
about others,

30
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:33,580
saying that their innocence is not
established.

31
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,828
Is the first sign that your own innocence
is in danger.

32
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:41,542
Because you doubt yourself, you are
doubting others.

33
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:46,508
If you are doubting others, then be sure
that you are not going to gain anything.

34
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,102
Your job is to look after yourself,
and not others.

35
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:54,377
And if you start doing like this, gradually
in your Mooladhara,

36
00:03:54,538 --> 00:04:00,598
there will be lots of these bhoots
that will just jump in.

37
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,056
And they’ll give you more ideas and more
ideas of doubting others.

38
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:10,633
By doubting others, you can never correct
them, and never yourself.

39
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:18,073
So those people who indulge into this kind
of practices, go away from their innocence.

40
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:22,606
They try to find out what others are doing,
what are their ways

41
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:29,373
of using other people in Sahaja Yoga,
for their own purposes.

42
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:36,489
Or some sort of a funny spy-like attitude,
they develop.

43
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,375
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to only spy
yourself, and not others.

44
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:43,636
Those who start spying themselves,
criticizing others,

45
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:46,776
will never rise higher than what you are.

46
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,238
In the beginning, I have seen many
Sahaja Yogis who come,

47
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,843
also try to do this, to criticize others;
this is the sign of their immaturity,

48
00:04:56,044 --> 00:05:04,165
sign of their, also, poor awakening
of their Shri Ganesha.

49
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,709
So those who come for the first time
should be very careful

50
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,306
that still we have to achieve a lot,

51
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:14,562
and we should not start doubting others,
making remarks about others.

52
00:05:14,763 --> 00:05:22,030
Because in innocence, people can be very,
very simple, very friendly,

53
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:26,996
but inside their hearts there is no malice,
there’s no filth.

54
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:31,040
But those who come for the first time
sometimes have the filth within them.

55
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:35,460
And they see the reflection of their
own filth in other people.

56
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,723
I had gone to a program in Kolhapur,

57
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:41,153
and you know how your Mother is innocent
and pure -

58
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:45,153
and a gentleman came and he told Me
that he has a Nabhi problem.

59
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:49,339
So I said: ‘All right, you put your hand
on My Nabhi’. He put his hand there,

60
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,157
and the women there, who were really
funny women, they said:

61
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:57,240
‘Why should Mother allow another man
to touch Her knee?’

62
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,660
They could not understand that: ‘How could
anybody touch a lady’s knee?’

63
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:07,898
But once you are at that level, you don’t
really know that there is bad in it.

64
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,500
And you just say: ‘All right, it’s
all right, you can touch my knee.’

65
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:15,193
And the fellow got all right with his
trouble with his Nabhi.

66
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:18,410
So you see, the thing is, if your eyes
are clean,

67
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,976
you can understand what is clean
and what is unclean.

68
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:27,560
But if your eyes are not clean, you start
seeing something that you want to see.

69
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,757
Or sometimes you see something that
never exists.

70
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,516
So I would request all the new Sahaja Yogis
who are here,

71
00:06:34,717 --> 00:06:39,730
not to criticize the old Sahaja Yogis, and
this is very anti-God activity.

72
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:45,852
Never say a word about the old Sahaja
Yogis. Because I have heard complaints,

73
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,902
people came and complained to Me.
And I was amazed.

74
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:54,059
Those who are just now there, how can they
start criticizing other Sahaja Yogis?

75
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,586
That means you are trying to hit
the roots of Sahaja Yoga.

76
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:01,393
And this is not the way you are going
to help.

77
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:05,564
So I have to request you, please, look
after your own vibrations,

78
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:12,342
look after your own ascent, look after what
you have done for Sahaj Yog, and then talk.

79
00:07:12,543 --> 00:07:17,981
Suddenly, if you just enter into Sahaja
Yoga and start criticizing others

80
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:22,776
about their innocence, you are hitting
the Ganesha at the root of it.

81
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:26,797
So be careful; of course, you’ll be hit,
no doubt.

82
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:30,762
And such people, who have done like this,
I have seen, have ended up with cancer.

83
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:35,142
Because Ganesha is the one, when He gets
angry, the first thing you get is cancer.

84
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:39,351
So be careful, I’m warning you, don’t try
these tricks anymore.

85
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:45,898
Try to improve your spirituality, so that
you can enjoy the joy of Shri Ganesha.

86
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:52,963
This is one side; and the second side is,
that to keep Shri Ganesha intact

87
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:59,063
we have to have certain maryadas, everybody
must have certain maryadas.

88
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,274
Like that, I would say that I will ask
a lady

89
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:06,114
to put her hand even up to My heart point
from the front.

90
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:10,211
But I would not ask a man to do that,
because there is a maryada -

91
00:08:10,412 --> 00:08:13,390
if you are a man, you are not supposed
to touch My front side,

92
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:17,541
but you can touch My backside. There are
maryadas for everything,

93
00:08:17,742 --> 00:08:22,524
and if you do not observe these maryadas,
or these boundaries,

94
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:33,026
then you are apt to get out of it, despite
the fact that you are pure.

95
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,258
And you might create a problem
unnecessarily.

96
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,973
I’ll give you a very good example
of Shri Mahavira,

97
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:42,906
who was the incarnation of Bhairava.

98
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:47,746
Himself Bhairava took on this work, and to
Bhairava what is cloth? What is dress?

99
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:53,113
I mean He is a person - to Him the whole
universe is His clothes,

100
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:56,883
or the whole directions are His clothes,
He is a digambara.

101
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:02,502
To Him, what does it matter. He is so
innocent. He is absolute innocence Himself.

102
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:06,026
And the innocence that is destructive,
that will destroy.

103
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:10,224
Through Him only you get your cancer,
when you start misbehaving.

104
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:17,549
So it’s such a simple man like Him, in the
sense that He never knew what was impurity,

105
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,474
He didn’t know what sin was. Such
a personality came on this earth

106
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:27,347
to teach people to be innocent, to be
dharmic, to be good.

107
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:34,715
Now this one once had to go to some forest

108
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:40,613
where half of His cloth got caught up
in the bushes.

109
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,832
So He had to cut it off, and He was left
with half of the cloth.

110
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:51,490
And when He came out on the village
outskirts, He met a person,

111
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:56,112
who was actually Shri Krishna, who tried
to take His pariksha [ED: means ’test’],

112
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:59,936
just came there, and He said that:
‘Why should you have any cloth?

113
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:04,177
There is no need, but I am a human being,
I’ve no clothes on My body.

114
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:09,122
So You are a God, You are an Incarnation,
so why don’t You give your cloth to Me?’

115
00:10:09,323 --> 00:10:12,579
He said: ‘All right, take it.’ He gave away
the part that was there.

116
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,528
And that’s how, for a very short time,
He was without clothes – very short time.

117
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,875
But that people have exploited, and are
making Him nude,

118
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:24,969
and making all His private parts
in such details.

119
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,928
All nonsense they are doing. Now many
people ask Me:

120
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:31,775
‘How is it that Jains indulge into this
nudity and all that?’

121
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:37,247
This is all absurdity; it’s nothing,
nothing anywhere near Mahavira.

122
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:41,392
Nobody’s a Mahavira to become even nude,
even for a short time.

123
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:46,166
So why should they do it? Because
everybody tries to find out

124
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:52,848
something that is a loophole, just to cover
up their own weaknesses.

125
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:57,274
And all such weaknesses tell upon
the progenies.

126
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:02,775
Now that has gone so far, that they cannot
understand that Shri Mahavir –

127
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:07,833
He was a digambara, He was a person
who did not need any clothes.

128
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,641
Still, just to keep the samayachar, He did
wear His cloth throughout,

129
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:17,802
and later on also; but for a short time
He gave away His clothes.

130
00:11:18,003 --> 00:11:20,056
That doesn’t mean that in the public
He became nude,

131
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:23,460
suddenly He took out His clothes and
all that, it doesn’t mean that.

132
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:29,898
He respected the public and that, not only
but He respected His parents to begin with,

133
00:11:30,099 --> 00:11:34,746
before He took to real sannyasa.
He respected His parents,

134
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:39,957
and He said that: ‘Now the time has come
for Me to give up this worldly life.

135
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:46,098
He had - I have been indulging into worldly
affairs, and I have to take to sannyasa’.

136
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:49,742
Sannyasa doesn’t mean that He was not
a sannyasi, He was – but means

137
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:54,835
that the worldly life of His parents, and
other people, He had to give up.

138
00:11:55,036 --> 00:11:57,859
Because if you have to indulge sometimes
into this life –

139
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,693
like in the Hindu tradition, after certain
age, say, seventy-five they say,

140
00:12:03,894 --> 00:12:08,483
you have to take a sannyasa, in the sense
that your family, your children,

141
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:12,278
are settled down now, there’s no problem,
so you have to take a sannyasa.

142
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,646
But for that, the wisdom has to be gathered
in young age;

143
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:19,399
otherwise, in old age, still there is
no wisdom, and you are behaving

144
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,400
like a young man of sixteen years –
is better you don’t take sannyasa.

145
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:33,313
So the whole understanding about life
in India has to be very subtle.

146
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:36,955
And to understand these great and great
people,

147
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,506
you have to be little bit greater than
what you are.

148
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:46,693
If you are just mud, how can you see
the goal? You cannot.

149
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,163
So you have to remove this mud
from your eyes.

150
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:54,775
This is a very common feature in the West
that, either they are suspicious,

151
00:12:54,976 --> 00:12:58,620
or they are in it; there’s nothing
in between.

152
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:02,410
Either the people who are suspicious
of others,

153
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:08,714
or there are people who are indulging
into it, so have it a middle way.

154
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:12,453
First thing I have to request, because you
are the first Sahaja Yogis now,

155
00:13:12,654 --> 00:13:16,078
who have come for the first time to India,

156
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:25,534
that this soil of our country is full
of rhythm of Shri Ganesh.

157
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:30,560
You are sitting on it; you have to vow
that: ‘I will establish my Ganesha.’

158
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,844
Don’t worry about others, your attention
on others is wrong.

159
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:38,114
‘I’ll establish my Ganesha, and let this
Mother Earth

160
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:42,639
give me the full strength to establish
my Shri Ganesh.’

161
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,362
This is very important because, unless and
until your Shri Ganesh is established,

162
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:54,720
you cannot be connected to the whole, nor
can you have the enjoyment of your Spirit.

163
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,746
You’ll be a half-baked personality,
which you should not be.

164
00:13:58,947 --> 00:14:06,192
So far, I’ve seen that the western Sahaja
Yogis are extremely assiduous.

165
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:09,425
And they take things very seriously,
they get to it.

166
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:13,350
Because, they know, if they have to have
joy, they have to work it out.

167
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:17,646
So you have to be an introvert, as far
as you are concerned.

168
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:23,380
And as far as others are concerned, you have
to be just seeing the good points of others.

169
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,310
Always see the good points, not the bad
points.

170
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,963
Otherwise you’ll create problems
for yourself,

171
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:32,024
and a day will come, you’ll have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

172
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,997
It has happened with many who tried
these things.

173
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,198
And they are out, absolutely out
of Sahaja Yoga.

174
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,817
If you have to be in Sahaja Yoga, you have
to understand

175
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:46,409
that, to be one with the whole, try to look
after yourself.

176
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,183
Another thing I have told you that in every
country I have to have somebody

177
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:54,156
on whom I have to depend. Just like
Shri Ganesha,

178
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:57,735
I depend on Him for many things;
He looks after many things;

179
00:14:57,936 --> 00:15:02,087
in the same way, in every country, I have
to have somebody there.

180
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:05,595
I do not like that all the time you are
complaining about a person

181
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:09,588
with whom I’m in connection. You need
not correct that person;

182
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:12,479
I’ve told you a hundred times, ‘Don’t
correct that person.’

183
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,108
I know, because I’m in contact, I know
about that person; you don’t know anything.

184
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,331
I know everything about that person and
I can correct that person.

185
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:25,151
But I was surprised, in London also, some
people came and said something - you know -

186
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:29,395
funny about others, and I was surprised
that they think I don’t know anything.

187
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:34,615
I know each and everything. You leave it to
Me. It is not your job to do such things,

188
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:41,100
and this is very mediocre approach
to Sahaja Yoga, extremely mediocre.

189
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,482
And if you are going to be mediocre,
I cannot help it;

190
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:47,883
but a day will come you might have to get
out of Sahaja Yoga.

191
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:52,883
This is the first warning I want to give
you, because now we are going

192
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:55,977
into a interior of Maharashtra.

193
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:59,056
You will see women and men never sit
together in Maharashtra,

194
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,630
they sit separately, they keep a distance
with them; we must learn those things.

195
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:07,546
In the West we are very open people,
it’s all right, you could be open -

196
00:16:07,747 --> 00:16:12,427
there are methods and ways, how we are
open, how we keep distances.

197
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:17,340
Like I’ll be much more free with the son
of Mr. - Dr. Sanghvi,

198
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,603
but with him I’ll keep a little distance.

199
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:24,513
Is a style that, a lady, her elders,
she must keep a distance.

200
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:28,813
And a man, must keep a distance from
younger - younger generation.

201
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,691
This is a system by which this country
has worked out its innocence,

202
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,191
and we all should try to follow this point.

203
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:39,624
That keep a distance with the ladies
who are younger to you.

204
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:43,652
And keep a distance from the gentlemen
who are older than you.

205
00:16:43,853 --> 00:16:48,531
Is a - I mean, there even a eighty-year-old
woman marries an eighteen-year-old girl,

206
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:52,376
such a confused state of affairs where
you cannot talk of these things.

207
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:57,365
But here when we are trying to sort out
our confusions, our mistakes,

208
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:01,308
we should try to adhere to certain pattern
which has helped people,

209
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:06,298
our social life is much better. And to
understand why the social life is better,

210
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:10,600
is because of Shri Ganesha’s importance.
Where Shri Ganesha is not there,

211
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:14,217
you’ll find even Sahaja Yoga does not
work out.

212
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:18,253
Say in the north of India there’s no
Shri Ganesh much worshipped.

213
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,525
So the Muslims came in, if and Shri Ganesha
was there,

214
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:25,266
they would have fought the Muslims.
They accepted Islamic culture,

215
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,004
and when that culture came in from
the Nawabs and all that, licentious people,

216
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:31,909
it all trickled down. But not
to that extent,

217
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:39,084
still I would say that there is a sense
of chastity in people in India,

218
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,503
and we all should have that sense
of chastity.

219
00:17:41,704 --> 00:17:45,689
But the most thing is, that in your heart,
in your mind,

220
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,181
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

221
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:55,144
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is
not good, that man is not good.’

222
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:59,259
Just don’t listen to these things, just
listen to yourself,

223
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,342
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

224
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:10,121
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I
helping others?’ ‘Where is my attention?’

225
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:15,006
The attention has to be: ‘What am I doing
with what Mother has given to me?’

226
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,599
So today is a very great day, we must
all pray to Shri Ganesh

227
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,175
that He should give His blessings, because
He is the source of joy,

228
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:27,007
He is the source of joy. He is Christ,
He is in your heart,

229
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:31,846
resides as Spirit, so He is the one,
the innocence you have to achieve.

230
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:37,172
And that is the beginning of Shri Krishna –
(She corrects Herself) Shri Ganesha’s being,

231
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:45,203
which evolves at the head here, you see
on this [plan?] as Aum it becomes.

232
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:50,249
So the same Shri Ganesha ultimately becomes
‘Aum’ within ourselves.

233
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:56,551
So to have the purest form of enjoyment
of your Spirit,

234
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:00,988
we must try to see that we establish
our Shri Ganesha.

235
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:05,909
And let everyone follow a proper pattern;
you don’t try to correct each other.

236
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,809
That’s a very wrong attitude in Sahaja Yoga

237
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,606
and it’s very detrimental to the growth
of Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,666
Anybody who tries this is thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga in no time,

239
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:21,602
by some way or some other. And also
I have seen people getting cancer.

240
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:24,047
And they asked Me: ‘Mother, how is it
we were doing Sahaja Yoga

241
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,301
and how did we get cancer?’ Because
of this nonsense.

242
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:33,311
Don’t try to go against other Sahaja Yogis;
must respect, they are all saints.

243
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:36,258
And respect the older Sahaja Yogis because
they have been there,

244
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:40,737
you have to learn a lot. They have worked
very hard to establish Sahaja Yoga.

245
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,767
So I have to make a very simple
announcement today,

246
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:50,913
that on this day of Shri Ganesh,
all My children

247
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:55,044
who are born like Shri Ganesh only,
in the same pattern,

248
00:19:55,245 --> 00:20:01,971
should become dynamic like Him, innocent
like Him, great like Him,

249
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:07,939
working twenty-four hours - this little
Child is working

250
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,542
throughout the day and night to give you
this source of joy.

251
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:16,243
May God bless you all.
