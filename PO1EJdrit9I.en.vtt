[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -

00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:07.247
Good! I was thinking of how many songs

00:06:21.137 --> 00:06:24.277
Let them sing one more

00:06:56.807 --> 00:07:10.112

[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -

00:10:12.575 --> 00:10:24.322
[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -
Pehla naman Ganarala]

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:40.225
[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -
Pehla naman Ganarala]

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:54.455
[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -
Pehla naman Ganarala]

00:10:54.455 --> 00:11:16.611
[SAHAJA YOGA BHAJAN -
Pehla naman Ganarala]

00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:35.405
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:08.680
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:18.473
Yesterday, I was [UNCLEAR] that so many of
you have felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:25.570
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:33.824
This is the All-Pervading Power of God's love
about which all the Scriptures have written.

00:12:34.216 --> 00:12:42.426
[INTERPRETER]

00:12:42.925 --> 00:12:52.585
But in modern times because we never felt this
breeze, we have even denied the existence of God

00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:01.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:09.619
But once you get connected to this Divine
force, then it starts working through you

00:13:09.738 --> 00:13:16.418
in such a wonderful way that you are amazed.
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:16.418 --> 00:13:21.650
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:27.052
As you see this instrument that I have
here, has to be connected to the mains

00:13:27.052 --> 00:13:35.234
in the same way, every human-being is to be
connected to the mains and that is this Power,

00:13:35.234 --> 00:13:40.157
which I'm talking about.
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:46.069
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:49.725
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:49.725 --> 00:13:54.365
This is what Christ has said
[INTERPRETER]

00:13:54.365 --> 00:14:00.193
that you have to be born again.
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:07.177
Now in India, we call a person who is a
Brahmin, the one who has known this Brahma

00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:14.611
- the All-Pervading Power - as Dwijah
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:18.993
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:24.188
meaning, twice born.
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:30.416
And even a bird is called as 'Dwijah', in
Sanskrit language, meaning, twice born.

00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:37.334
It is an egg first and then it becomes a bird.
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:43.721
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:48.739
But we have many people in India
who just brand themselves as Brahmins

00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:51.231
though they are not twice born.

00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:57.899
[INTERPRETER]

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:05.208
In the same way, you find it everywhere that they
just take a brand, "I'm this, I'm that," but they're not

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:11.962
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:11.962 --> 00:15:20.162
If you are a twice born person then, you
have to feel this All-Pervading Power.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:26.939 --> 00:15:36.290
You have to feel the centers, your own centers,
on your finger-tips - one, two, three, four, five,

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.860
six and seven.
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.223
[INTERPRETER]

00:15:45.437 --> 00:15:53.737
Precisely, there is no doubt, when you
feel them, you know what is wrong with you

00:15:53.737 --> 00:16:00.001
or wrong with others.
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:04.975
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:13.980
Now supposing, you are feeling the pain here
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:20.193
Now these are the centers of your father
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:25.689
and this is the finger that shows the
Vishuddhi chakra, here.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:29.150
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.666
If you can telephone to your father and
ask him how is he, he will tell you that

00:16:34.666 --> 00:16:40.742
he's down with very bad bronchitis.
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:44.162
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:44.162 --> 00:16:48.910
This is the Science of the roots.
[INTERPRETER]

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:55.061
As I told you that we have the Science of
the tree but not the Science of the roots.

00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:59.894
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:05.325
This Science does not change,
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:09.397
is absolutely precise
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:09.397 --> 00:17:15.234
and it's so effective and efficient
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:24.396
that it works faster than even light
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:31.037
because the whole cosmos is connected,
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:31.037 --> 00:17:41.111
is all being vibrated with this Power.
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:48.528
You see this Power as small commas,
after realization, in the sky.

00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:55.032
[INTERPRETER]

00:17:55.032 --> 00:18:01.682
You see various things after realization
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:01.682 --> 00:18:07.640
and you have to know what those things are.
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:14.983
My job only is to decode it
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:19.802
and then you have to verify
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:19.802 --> 00:18:27.294
that what I have decoded is there or not.
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:27.294 --> 00:18:32.832
Anybody can get this knowledge.
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:32.832 --> 00:18:39.447
It has no limitation of any caste,
creed or race, religion or nation.

00:18:40.147 --> 00:18:45.027
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:45.738 --> 00:18:52.788
Everyone has this residual power of
Kundalini within themselves

00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:57.788
[INTERPRETER]

00:18:57.788 --> 00:19:07.011
and you can see in some people this Kundalini,
pulsating like a heart in the triangular bone.

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:12.614
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:18.115
And this triangular bone is called as
Sacrum, meaning sacred.

00:19:18.536 --> 00:19:23.326
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:31.478
That means, the Greek have given this name to
this bone, knowing that it contains the Kundalini.

00:19:31.654 --> 00:19:38.474
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:38.598 --> 00:19:44.218
Even the word 'Athena' - 'Ath' in
Sanskrit means Primordial.

00:19:44.377 --> 00:19:49.197
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:57.670
So, thus the Primordial Mother is Athena.
[INTERPRETER]

00:19:57.807 --> 00:20:04.117
I can give you thousands and thousands
of examples of quotations

00:20:04.483 --> 00:20:07.993
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:07.993 --> 00:20:12.951
but best thing is to face the Truth
yourself and see for yourself.

00:20:13.384 --> 00:20:18.034
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:25.478
People are advertising saying,
"There's a New Age that has come."

00:20:26.005 --> 00:20:31.865
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:31.865 --> 00:20:36.128
The people of New Age are
just the same like all others.

00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:39.345
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:39.345 --> 00:20:43.581
What is so special about them?
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:43.581 --> 00:20:47.767
If you have to go to their programs,
you have to pay

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:51.257
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:51.257 --> 00:20:57.336
and they say, "We can clear your chakras."
[INTERPRETER]

00:20:57.519 --> 00:21:02.639
But how can you clear the chakras unless
and until the Kundalini is awakened?

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:07.961
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:07.964 --> 00:21:12.804
When I went to America, they said, I must
make a copyright of all My lectures

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:19.010
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:24.638
because they will use My knowledge
and make some organizations.

00:21:24.638 --> 00:21:29.398
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:29.398 --> 00:21:34.309
I said, "Let them do it, very good."
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:43.009
Also if they can raise the Kundalini, nothing like it
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:43.009 --> 00:21:46.130
but they cannot.
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.582
They cannot.
[INTERPRETER]

00:21:49.582 --> 00:21:56.303
Unless and until they become realized
souls and know all about Kundalini,

00:21:56.303 --> 00:22:00.913
you cannot raise the Kundalini.
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:00.913 --> 00:22:05.792
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:05.966 --> 00:22:11.126
All those people, who are singing so
joyfully here, can do it.

00:22:11.126 --> 00:22:15.541
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:19.552
All those who will get realization among
you, also can do it.

00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:25.524
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:25.684 --> 00:22:33.224
William Blake, who was a great poet from
England, has said that, "All God's men,

00:22:33.224 --> 00:22:40.036
men of God, will get their realization
and they'll make others realized."

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:46.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.066
This he said hundred years back.
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:55.396 --> 00:23:02.956
Now we have to see one thing, that those
who say, "We are this and we are that,"

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.810
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:13.066
what is the speciality.
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:18.569
Supposing, you are a Jew, you are a Christian,
you are a Hindu, you are all just the same.

00:23:19.304 --> 00:23:26.294
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:30.284
What is the speciality?
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:33.895
Somebody says, "I go this guru,
that guru, this one,"

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:38.219
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:38.281 --> 00:23:42.561
but what is the speciality?
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:42.561 --> 00:23:49.380
You are all suffering, you are all having diseases,
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:55.347
you don't know anything about your inner being,
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:55.887 --> 00:24:01.877
so, the person who is a twice born,
has to be something very different.

00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:07.706
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:07.706 --> 00:24:15.042
As I told you yesterday, I'll tell you today about
what happens when the chakras get enlightened.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:22.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:34.560
The first chakra is the chakra of purity,
of holiness, of auspiciousness.

00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:43.094
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:43.094 --> 00:24:54.387
We are born with auspiciousness,
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:54.387 --> 00:24:57.799
we are holy.
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:57.799 --> 00:25:02.345
There is no original sin
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:05.334
which is attached to us.
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:05.369 --> 00:25:13.309
The original sin was done by Adam and
Eve that they disobeyed God Almighty.

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:20.783
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:21.016 --> 00:25:30.766
If they had not disobeyed, we would
have only shortened this event of New Age.

00:25:31.346 --> 00:25:39.446
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:39.446 --> 00:25:45.426
There would have been no necessity to have
all this evolutionary process to take this

00:25:45.426 --> 00:25:49.411
long route - come to the point.

00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:55.486
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:55.486 --> 00:26:09.428
So, we come to conclusion in this manner,
that if the prophets and Incarnations

00:26:09.522 --> 00:26:23.332
have proclaimed that there is an All-Pervading
Power of Divine love, let us find it out first of all.

00:26:24.118 --> 00:26:30.008
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:30.008 --> 00:26:34.871
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:35.148 --> 00:26:41.298
It is very unscientific to deny something
without finding it out

00:26:41.765 --> 00:26:46.555
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:46.555 --> 00:26:50.122
and is very dishonest.
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:50.122 --> 00:26:55.951
Unless and until you have found it out,
how can you say that it does not exist?

00:26:56.122 --> 00:27:01.032
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:01.199 --> 00:27:07.809
But atheists are alright because they have
not found anything, so they are saying,

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:10.413
"We don't believe in it," it's correct,
alright.

00:27:10.653 --> 00:27:16.830
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.381
So, whether you believe in it or
not, makes no difference.

00:27:20.404 --> 00:27:24.564
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:24.564 --> 00:27:30.185
Blind faith is not needed.
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:36.130
You have to get it yourself.
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:43.000
It's clearly said by all the saints.
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.229
I mean, the real saints.
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:53.664
Like Gurunanaka has said that, "Unless and
until you find it within yourself, it's all confusion."

00:27:54.301 --> 00:28:02.411
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:02.411 --> 00:28:08.255
Kabira has talked about Kundalini, about Sahaj
Samadhi - he's talked all about Sahaja yoga.

00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:14.409
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:14.457 --> 00:28:18.997
Gyaneshwara, in India, has written
a complete chapter on it.

00:28:19.146 --> 00:28:23.796
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:24.162 --> 00:28:32.632
Even in Koran there is such a lot about
the resurrection, the Qiyamah.

00:28:33.206 --> 00:28:38.026
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:38.563 --> 00:28:44.753
But like politics, religion also has
become a theory

00:28:44.753 --> 00:28:49.827
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:49.827 --> 00:28:55.172
and Adi Shakaracharya calls it,
'Shabd Jalam' meaning the net of words.

00:28:56.039 --> 00:29:01.159
Interpreter - Sorry?
- Shabd Jalam, means, net of words.

00:29:01.424 --> 00:29:06.124
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:06.292 --> 00:29:10.362
So, he says, "Mother, take me out 
of this net of words."

00:29:10.762 --> 00:29:18.092
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:18.307 --> 00:29:23.107
Now let us see the principle of politics
also, very interesting to see.

00:29:23.107 --> 00:29:26.968
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:26.968 --> 00:29:34.346
Now in politics, we believe, in the democratic
countries, that we all must have individual freedom

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.650
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:41.361 --> 00:29:45.831
They think that individual freedom
is above everything else.

00:29:46.252 --> 00:29:50.473
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:50.473 --> 00:29:56.748
But what about the collective freedom?
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:56.748 --> 00:30:04.364
If you go to America, you can't wear any
ornaments, you can't take your purse in your hand

00:30:04.603 --> 00:30:10.263
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:10.263 --> 00:30:13.465
Everybody is standing with a gun
around the corner,

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:17.065
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:17.768 --> 00:30:22.898
all kinds of funny women at every
corner - you find even here.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.930
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:27.351 --> 00:30:31.521
Very aggressive sight, I tell you,
horrible, you feel like vomiting

00:30:31.972 --> 00:30:36.042
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:36.225 --> 00:30:41.015
but they have individual freedom
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:46.137
to ruin as many as they want,
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:46.137 --> 00:30:50.851
to kill as many as they like.
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:51.158 --> 00:30:57.488
So this is all self-indulgence.
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:57.533 --> 00:31:02.273
accumulating money as much as you like
- if the rest are dying, doesn't matter.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.810
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:13.640
So democracy goes hand in hand or
capitalism goes hand in hand with money.

00:31:13.966 --> 00:31:19.196
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:19.198 --> 00:31:22.948
Also corruption follows.
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:22.948 --> 00:31:25.613
It has to be corrupt,
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:25.613 --> 00:31:28.156
you can't help it.
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:31.471
As long as you are not caught in
the lock you are alright.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:35.449
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.800
Now take the communism because I've
been to all Communist countries also.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.594
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:44.594 --> 00:31:48.362
There the collective freedom is more
important than the individual.

00:31:48.362 --> 00:31:52.898
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:52.898 --> 00:31:57.353
Now the individual becomes free.
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:57.353 --> 00:32:02.408
When those people come to free
countries, they drink likes fishes.

00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:06.493
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:06.493 --> 00:32:09.872
In Arab countries they are not
supposed to touch drinks.

00:32:09.948 --> 00:32:14.948
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:14.948 --> 00:32:23.319
Even Sikhs, that was the highest because
Nanaka was the last. They said that,

00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:30.687
"No drinking, no smoking," but if you see in
England, they drink much more than Scotchmen.

00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:39.254
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:39.254 --> 00:32:45.204
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:45.204 --> 00:32:52.099
Same in India. You'll see, it's said that,
"God resides in everyone," in Hindu philosophy

00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:58.078
and they have such horrid caste system.
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:58.078 --> 00:33:01.606
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:01.606 --> 00:33:06.584
So the collective cannot be strong unless
and until the individuals are strong.

00:33:06.584 --> 00:33:10.970
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.794
But when you want to make the individuals
strong, they go astray, they go mad.

00:33:15.794 --> 00:33:20.399
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:27.421
In America, you feel every third 
person is off his head.

00:33:27.688 --> 00:33:32.728
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:33.969 --> 00:33:41.419
They don't know - their eyes are twitching,
noses are twitching, the whole body is [UNCLEAR]

00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:46.135
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:46.186 --> 00:33:49.246
So nervous!
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:49.246 --> 00:33:52.661
If they have individual freedom, why
should be that nervous?

00:33:52.684 --> 00:33:56.884
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:56.884 --> 00:34:03.034
Now in this individual freedom they have
inherited AIDS, drugs, every sort of nonsense.

00:34:03.129 --> 00:34:08.049
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:08.564 --> 00:34:13.454
So, they realize sometimes, of course,
that, "We should come to the center,"

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.930
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:21.809
but still they miss the point.
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:26.971
We can say, this is the right side movement
which is disciplining and collective

00:34:26.971 --> 00:34:33.441
and the left side movement is individual.
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:41.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:47.163
So I met a very important politician in London, she
said that, "Now we have fed up of left and right,

00:34:47.163 --> 00:34:52.623
we have to be in the center."
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:56.011
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:56.011 --> 00:35:02.089
But I said, "You will be standing in the center."
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:06.387
So she said, "What should we do?"
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:10.864
I said, "You should ascend."
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:10.864 --> 00:35:13.874
That's what it is.
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:13.874 --> 00:35:17.392
They all these theories are now
standing before us.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.510
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:25.352
We see in the fundamentalists, we see all
these religions, we see all these hypocrites

00:35:25.352 --> 00:35:31.071
and on the other side we see the politics.
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:34.505
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:34.505 --> 00:35:42.336
All is a confusion for any sensible man.
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:42.336 --> 00:35:46.135
We have created Science - alright, 
Science, Science, Science, so what?

00:35:46.135 --> 00:35:53.466
There's an atom bomb like a devil sitting there.
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:53.466 --> 00:35:57.441
What is the epitome of Science? All 
kinds of destructive weapons.

00:35:57.441 --> 00:36:02.764
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:02.764 --> 00:36:08.290
So what has happened is that, when you put
your mental projection, it just goes linear

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:13.411
and attacks you back.
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:13.411 --> 00:36:18.303
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:18.303 --> 00:36:24.323
So, the human awareness has to take a new
dimension - the dimension of Spiritual awareness.

00:36:24.556 --> 00:36:30.886
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:37.329
This is the breakthrough which has to take place,
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:42.157
where we have to become the Spirit.
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:42.157 --> 00:36:50.626
We have to become the Spirit and when we
become the Spirit then, what do we see that

00:36:50.626 --> 00:36:56.043
we are absolutely integrated.
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:56.043 --> 00:37:00.065
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:00.065 --> 00:37:07.435
I will say that "I'm a capitalist or I'm
a democrat," and because I have powers.

00:37:08.283 --> 00:37:13.373
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:13.373 --> 00:37:19.202
but I'm a real communist because I can't enjoy
My powers unless and until I give it to you.

00:37:19.558 --> 00:37:25.088
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:25.088 --> 00:37:27.965
I have to share with you
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:27.965 --> 00:37:33.776
otherwise I'm not happy with Myself.
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:33.776 --> 00:37:37.331
So, these both things meet when
you become the Spirit.

00:37:37.331 --> 00:37:41.515
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:41.515 --> 00:37:48.499
You do not move in a linear way but you are
like rays going from the Sun from all sides.

00:37:49.132 --> 00:37:56.802
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:56.802 --> 00:37:59.515
No more you take, you just give.
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:00.223 --> 00:38:04.503
Interpreter: Sorry?
- No more you take, you just give

00:38:04.514 --> 00:38:07.704
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:07.704 --> 00:38:12.434
and enjoy your generosity,
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:12.434 --> 00:38:18.734
enjoy all the righteousness,
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:18.734 --> 00:38:26.137
enjoy the bliss and the peace within you.
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:26.265 --> 00:38:44.745
Now the diseases fall on to us is this way that we
have within us centers which are made like this.

00:38:46.089 --> 00:38:51.049
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:51.049 --> 00:38:57.035
This is the left side and this is the right side.
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:57.035 --> 00:39:01.671
The left side is the one that looks
after the emotional side, the desires

00:39:03.225 --> 00:39:08.655
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:08.655 --> 00:39:13.624
and the right side looks after your
physical side and your mental side.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:22.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:28.213
When you go to the left or to the right too much,
then you break your relations with the whole

00:39:28.289 --> 00:39:33.869
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:33.869 --> 00:39:38.060
or you get constricted,
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.479
your power gets less because all
the power is flown out.

00:39:42.735 --> 00:39:46.015
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:46.264 --> 00:39:54.534
So the imbalance is created in us 
creating problem on our chakras

00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:59.546
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:59.565 --> 00:40:04.455
and that's how we suffer.
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:04.458 --> 00:40:10.068
Now the dharma or the religion that is
established by great prophets

00:40:10.947 --> 00:40:16.867
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:23.393
starting right from Socrates, you can say,
even Adinatha up to Gurunanaka -

00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:31.467
you can say, that that was just to
establish the balance within us.

00:40:32.145 --> 00:40:38.235
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:38.235 --> 00:40:43.542
Moses, Abraham, all of them did that.
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:43.637 --> 00:40:52.557
They all tried to give us the idea of
balancing, of temperance within us

00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:59.335
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:59.335 --> 00:41:06.750
for our ultimate purification.
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:14.033
Now, all this balance we have lost
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:19.983
on the physical level, on mental level,
emotional level and also on Spiritual level.

00:41:20.026 --> 00:41:27.676
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:27.676 --> 00:41:31.233
going to fake gurus,
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:34.366
having false ideas.
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:34.366 --> 00:41:44.617
We have lost in those wildernesses.
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:44.659 --> 00:41:49.639
Now the only thing we have to do,
is to raise your Kundalini.

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:54.715
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:54.715 --> 00:41:59.417
When the Kundalini rises, She passes 
through these centers and puts them right,

00:41:59.417 --> 00:42:06.386
energizes them, gives them energy and
pierces through the fontanel bone so that

00:42:06.386 --> 00:42:10.309
She gives you the connection with the
All-Pervading Power.

00:42:10.534 --> 00:42:17.354
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:17.354 --> 00:42:23.422
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:23.422 --> 00:42:28.625
So most of the diseases get cured
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:28.625 --> 00:42:31.827
in no time
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:32.068 --> 00:42:39.938
and all the habits drop out.
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:39.938 --> 00:42:46.650
You are not slave of any temptations
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:58.142
and the innate morality is born within you, innate.
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:01.669
One does not have to say, "Don't do it,"
we just don't do it.

00:43:02.032 --> 00:43:06.122
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:13.281
So, this is just at your doorsteps
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:13.288 --> 00:43:20.958
but there is one small thing that in
Sahaja yoga you cannot pay, you cannot,

00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:30.399
you don't have to put in any effort but there
is one thing, that you have to become.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:37.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:42.007
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:42.007 --> 00:43:46.973
You have have your vibrations pure,
'khalis' as they call it, pure

00:43:47.382 --> 00:43:51.302
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:51.302 --> 00:43:56.688
and you have to know all about
Kundalini and vibrations

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.970
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:07.696
and that is how you are called as Sahaja yogis.
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:10.908
It is a state,
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:10.918 --> 00:44:15.858
state of personality,
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:16.325 --> 00:44:22.675
which is collectively conscious
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:22.675 --> 00:44:27.380
The consciousness is on your finger-tips
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:35.971
so that you can feel everybody's chakras
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:46.286
and a tremendous compassion and concern
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:57.037
starts flowing outward and inside
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:57.037 --> 00:45:01.855
but this compassion acts.
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:07.300
We don't have adulterous eyes anymore
Interpreter: Sorry?

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:14.766
We don't have adulterous eyes anymore,
adulterous eyes. What [UNCLEAR]?

00:45:14.766 --> 00:45:17.165
SY: Adulterous eyes
Interpreter: Haan, yes.

00:45:17.165 --> 00:45:19.732
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:19.732 --> 00:45:24.225
and you get pure eyes,
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:24.225 --> 00:45:27.532
light in your eyes.
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:27.532 --> 00:45:32.438
Such a person, even with a glance,
can do miracles

00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:36.534
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:42.245
but such a person is very humble,
unassuming and loving.

00:45:42.525 --> 00:45:47.975
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:48.292 --> 00:45:58.692
It's such a joy to give realizations to others
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:58.692 --> 00:46:02.454
and when you get realization,
you can give to others.

00:46:02.454 --> 00:46:06.826
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:06.826 --> 00:46:11.856
Happiness and unhappiness are
two phases of one coin

00:46:12.554 --> 00:46:17.314
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:17.315 --> 00:46:21.745
but joy is Absolute,
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:29.441
so you fall into the ocean of joy
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:29.523 --> 00:46:35.573
and then you become the witness
of the whole drama.

00:46:35.773 --> 00:46:39.083
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:44.420
Your attention becomes active.
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:51.457
You pay attention to something and that works,
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:51.457 --> 00:46:54.608
that acts.
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:55.426 --> 00:47:03.866
Above all, you know the Absolute Truth.
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:04.074 --> 00:47:08.134
No relative understanding.
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:08.134 --> 00:47:12.859
You lead a very healthy life.
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:12.867 --> 00:47:16.677
Somebody asked Me today, "Mother,
how can it be so easy?"

00:47:16.677 --> 00:47:20.531
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:20.616 --> 00:47:25.466
It is easy because it is so vital
Interpreter: Sorry?

00:47:25.466 --> 00:47:32.423
It is so vital, vital
SY: [GERMAN]

00:47:32.423 --> 00:47:36.609
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:36.609 --> 00:47:41.426
Like breathing is so vital. We don't have
to go to a guru to ask, "How to breathe?"

00:47:41.426 --> 00:47:48.929
otherwise we'll all die.
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:48.929 --> 00:47:55.110
In the same way today, it is so vital,
so important to get realization.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:59.524
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:59.524 --> 00:48:05.033
Now forget about the past,
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:05.033 --> 00:48:11.642
forget about your past lives - karma yoga
and this yoga and that yoga - forget it.

00:48:11.642 --> 00:48:16.393
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:23.695
When the Kundalini rises and passes
through the Agnya chakra, then,

00:48:25.049 --> 00:48:31.879
your all your problems are sucked by Christ
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:31.879 --> 00:48:37.647
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:37.647 --> 00:48:42.529
and you don't have to suffer at all.
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:42.529 --> 00:48:48.241
All your sufferings are over.
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:48.241 --> 00:48:51.912
There's a question about how the
saints have suffered?

00:48:52.204 --> 00:48:56.044
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:56.044 --> 00:49:05.024
Most of the saints have been certified people.
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:05.024 --> 00:49:16.495
Like a temple can certify some body and say it
or some, some organization can call it a saint

00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:20.861
or something like that.
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:25.082
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:25.082 --> 00:49:28.682
They are not real saints
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:28.682 --> 00:49:36.946
Real saints are the ones which are sent by God
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:41.297
and certified by God.
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:41.297 --> 00:49:44.258
They don't suffer,
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:45.197 --> 00:49:49.367
they don't have to suffer
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:49.367 --> 00:49:54.990
and you won't have to suffer either anymore.
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:05.882
The world has to be saved, is a big responsibility.
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:05.882 --> 00:50:10.650
Your children are to be saved
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:16.610
and we have to make them a new
generation of a new race.

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:21.479
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:22.232 --> 00:50:26.612
Thank you very much!
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:55.504 --> 00:51:00.914
[ASIDE - Who all are standing there [UNCLEAR]
can help Me in the realization.]

00:51:00.914 --> 00:51:06.409
[ASIDE - People can raise their kundalini. If you
can go on the back side, you can help Me more.]

00:51:15.186 --> 00:51:21.546
I'm sorry, you all have to take out your
shoes before we go in for meditation.

00:51:21.984 --> 00:51:27.104
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:30.108 --> 00:51:35.918
There's a one question some person has
asked about a severe type of Bronchitis.

00:51:35.918 --> 00:51:43.166
Who's the gentleman who has said he's got very
bad bronchitis? Should come and see us here,
later on.

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:49.863
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:49.863 --> 00:51:53.329
What other questions are there? You are?
Alright, please be seated.

00:51:53.329 --> 00:52:00.087
We'll see you after the session, alright?
Is there any question left now?

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:16.468
What? Yeah. Somebody says that when he moves
his these two fingers, he gets a cool breeze.

00:52:16.468 --> 00:52:25.476
So, that means these two fingers are not
alright. There is no need to close any fingers
in Sahaja yoga.

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:30.132
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:30.132 --> 00:52:34.876
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:34.931 --> 00:52:41.541
So, you have to keep all these mudras, all
these touching of fingers as a meaning.

00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:45.121
We also use them when there are problems.

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:51.955
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:51.955 --> 00:52:57.287
We also use Hatha yoga exercises whenever
it is needed, whatever is needed.

00:52:57.287 --> 00:53:03.785
There is a science behind it
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:03.785 --> 00:53:10.956
but, normally, they are not so much needed.
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:14.058 --> 00:53:18.038
Now, somebody asked Me the question,
if I was the Holy Ghost

00:53:18.038 --> 00:53:21.318
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:21.318 --> 00:53:26.377
that Christ has promised to send.
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:26.377 --> 00:53:29.849
I've told you already, I'm not going
to tell about Myself

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:33.197
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:33.197 --> 00:53:41.044
because Christ was the only Son of God
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:41.044 --> 00:53:48.353
and He's the gate and He's the path
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:54.585
but when He said that, you crucified Him.
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:54.585 --> 00:53:59.747
Human-beings are very funny.
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:59.747 --> 00:54:09.237
Forest people say, I'm God, they start wishing Me.
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:09.237 --> 00:54:12.246
When Rajnish said, "He's God,"
everybody worshiped him.

00:54:12.246 --> 00:54:15.821
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:15.821 --> 00:54:19.237
but a real person says something,
they'll murder that person.

00:54:19.237 --> 00:54:22.286
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:22.286 --> 00:54:27.973
So, I want you to find out about Me but
first of all, find out about yourself

00:54:28.537 --> 00:54:34.517
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:34.517 --> 00:54:37.711
because I still want to work and
don't want to get crucified.

00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:42.505
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:47.608 --> 00:54:52.968
So, most of the questions I've answered,
I think, in My lectures.

00:54:52.968 --> 00:54:58.526
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:58.526 --> 00:55:04.829
If there are any other questions left, you can
come to our follow-up program and ask there.

00:55:05.351 --> 00:55:10.201
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:14.897
But any amount of questioning and answering,
is again the same thing, net of words.

00:55:15.319 --> 00:55:20.979
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:21.106 --> 00:55:27.066
You have to get your realization,
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:27.066 --> 00:55:32.568
which I cannot guarantee,
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:33.237 --> 00:55:37.377
which you should get.
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:37.377 --> 00:55:40.694
That's My desire,
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:40.694 --> 00:55:43.677
that's what I want.
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:43.677 --> 00:55:47.830
It should work out.
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:00.650
Those who don't want to have their
Self-realization, should please go away

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:03.222
because as it is, I cannot force it.

00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:11.206
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:11.206 --> 00:56:16.473
But if you stay here, you will disturb
other people, so to be civil, you should go,

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.622
if you don't want to have your realization.

00:56:18.622 --> 00:56:25.124
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:29.076 --> 00:56:35.186
I requested you to take out your shoes, if you don't
mind and put your feet on the Mother Earth.

00:56:35.783 --> 00:56:43.643
[ASIDE - You can just push this back.
Thank you, thank you.]

00:56:45.033 --> 00:56:51.823
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:52.185 --> 00:56:59.835
Now, put both the feet apart from each other
as these represent two channels within us.

00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:07.712
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:07.712 --> 00:57:16.074
Left Sympathetic and Right Sympathetic.
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:16.074 --> 00:57:23.774
So the problems of these two Sympathetic
Nervous System will pass on to the Mother Earth

00:57:25.031 --> 00:57:30.701
because She's very kind and She
sucks in all our problems.

00:57:31.008 --> 00:57:37.468
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:37.468 --> 00:57:44.823
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:47.556 --> 00:57:57.106
So, please put your left hand towards Me, like this
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:06.978 --> 00:58:12.128
because this represents your desire
to get realization

00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:18.161
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:25.108
and the right hand represents the action.
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:25.108 --> 00:58:30.552
Of course, you don't have to do anything
but I'm just doing this for you to know

00:58:30.552 --> 00:58:34.546
how, later on, you can always
raise your Kundalini.

00:58:34.816 --> 00:58:41.228
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:41.228 --> 00:58:52.177
Because in the beginning it's a very thin,
just like your hair, the energy flows

00:58:52.631 --> 00:58:57.771
on to the top of your head and then,
when it opens it a little bit,

00:58:58.626 --> 00:59:05.981
the Grace falls on to to your Sympathetic
Nervous System, relaxes your chakras

00:59:06.351 --> 00:59:14.553
and then more energy starts flowing but you can
help later on to raise your Kundalini more.

00:59:15.267 --> 00:59:21.437
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:21.437 --> 00:59:28.935
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:28.935 --> 00:59:35.762
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:35.762 --> 00:59:43.446
Like the sprouting of the seed, is spontaneous,
effortless but later on, you have to look after it

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:51.606
till it becomes a proper tree.
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:51.606 --> 01:00:00.744
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:10.117
Alright, now please put your left hand, like this.
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:10.117 --> 01:00:14.868
Sit very comfortably,
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:14.868 --> 01:00:22.870
don't push your head backwards or forwards
but be in the center - no pressure on the neck.

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:33.025
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:33.099 --> 01:00:37.639
And first and foremost thing is that,
you must forgive yourself.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:48.161
Your body is a temple of God
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:48.161 --> 01:00:53.921
and you should not get angry with yourself.
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:54.133 --> 01:01:07.123
You should feel very pleasantly towards yourself.
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:12.940
Now, I'll show you which chakras to be
touched, one by one.

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:19.551
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:23.577
We are working only on the left hand
side with the right hand.

01:01:23.577 --> 01:01:27.565
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:33.785
Now, put the right hand on your heart,
where resides the Spirit.

01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:38.191
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:40.122 --> 01:01:47.112
Now, put this right hand on the upper part of
your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it.

01:01:47.694 --> 01:01:52.474
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:53.359 --> 01:02:00.389
Now here, is the center of your mastery.
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:01.547 --> 01:02:08.707
When this center opens, you become the master.
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:15.550
So, now you take it down in the lower part
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:02:16.111 --> 01:02:19.761
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:20.828 --> 01:02:27.728
This is the center through which we work
out the Pure Knowledge of Kundalini

01:02:28.546 --> 01:02:33.456
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:39.292
and that of Divine laws.
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:44.518
Then again we go back, put our
hand on the left hand side

01:02:46.587 --> 01:02:51.577
[INTERPRETER]
upper part of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:02:51.577 --> 01:02:56.109
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:58.798 --> 01:03:04.688
Then we go back again on the heart.
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:14.760
Then we put our right hand in the corner of the
shoulder and our head from the front side, like that

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:21.884
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:21.884 --> 01:03:26.077
and turn our head to the right.
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:26.077 --> 01:03:29.812
Hold it tight.
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:29.812 --> 01:03:34.373
This is the center which is always
caught very badly.

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:37.438
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:37.438 --> 01:03:45.031
This is the center which makes us feel guilty.
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:45.218 --> 01:03:49.838
Please forgive yourself.
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:49.991 --> 01:03:53.421
You are not guilty at all -
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:54.846 --> 01:04:01.866
you are at the epitome of evolution.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:01.866 --> 01:04:05.460
Don't judge yourself.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:05.657 --> 01:04:09.527
God will judge you
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:09.527 --> 01:04:13.067
in His compassion.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:13.067 --> 01:04:20.662
Now, put your hand on top of your forehead
and press it on both the sides, like this.

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:25.432
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:25.432 --> 01:04:33.216
This is the center of Christ, of forgiveness.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:34.283 --> 01:04:41.583
Now, you take this hand on the back side
of your head and allow your head to rest
on it with all the pressure.

01:04:41.872 --> 01:04:49.312
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:50.281 --> 01:04:55.781
Now, stretch your hand fully.
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:55.781 --> 01:05:05.960
Put the center of your palm on top of the
fontanel bone, which was a soft bone in
your childhood, like this

01:05:07.197 --> 01:05:15.067
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:15.067 --> 01:05:20.177
and put the left hand towards Me,
bend your head and press it,

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:27.390
seven times, your scalp slowly,
slowly, without [UNCLEAR]

01:05:28.152 --> 01:05:35.652
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:40.459 --> 01:05:43.059
Seven times.
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:45.198 --> 01:05:50.288
That's all now. So, we'll start.
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:53.879 --> 01:06:00.799
We start it now by closing our eyes and
putting our left hand towards Myself.

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:07.839
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:08.067 --> 01:06:16.697
Please put both the feet apart and also you
can take out your spectacles or anything
that weighs heavy anywhere.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:25.551
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:27.385 --> 01:06:30.715
Now, close your eyes and don't open
them, till I tell you.

01:06:31.759 --> 01:06:35.979
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:36.816 --> 01:06:40.246
Close your eyes.
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:40.737 --> 01:06:46.487
Put your right hand on your heart.
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:50.263
Ask the question,
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:50.263 --> 01:06:56.110
a very fundamental question to Me.
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:56.110 --> 01:07:00.420
You may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother,
whatever suits you.

01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:05.574
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:05.574 --> 01:07:13.095
So here you ask the question, a very fundamental
question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:19.770
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:20.545 --> 01:07:26.515
It's like asking the computer.
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:27.742 --> 01:07:33.492
Ask this question three times, please.
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:42.790
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are the
master of yourself,

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:48.496
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:48.496 --> 01:07:56.093
so now please, take down your hand, right
hand, on the left hand side of your stomach
and press it hard.

01:07:56.862 --> 01:08:01.692
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:02.299 --> 01:08:09.149
Here, ask another question which follows.
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:09.149 --> 01:08:18.628
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I
my own guru? Mother, am I my own guide?"

01:08:18.628 --> 01:08:21.753
whichever you like, you ask this
question three times.

01:08:21.891 --> 01:08:28.041
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:33.792
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:51.072 --> 01:08:57.892
Now, take down this right hand on the
lower part of your abdomen, on the left
hand side and press it hard.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:03.829
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:05.243 --> 01:09:17.723
Here, you have to say, because I cannot force,
is your freedom which is to be respected

01:09:19.006 --> 01:09:25.576
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:25.887 --> 01:09:30.957
You have to say, "Mother, please may
I have the Pure Knowledge?"

01:09:31.062 --> 01:09:40.102
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge," you
say it six times because this center has six petals.

01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:46.527
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:46.527 --> 01:09:54.446
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:54.731 --> 01:09:59.471
Please put your right hand on the lower part
of your abdomen on the left hand side -

01:09:59.471 --> 01:10:05.679
some people are not keeping it there
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:09.534
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:22.292
and saying, "Please Mother, give me
Pure Knowledge of the Divine."

01:10:23.555 --> 01:10:28.445
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:58.042
Say it six times.
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:04.345
Now, raise your hand, in the upper part of your
abdomen, on the left hand side and press it.

01:11:05.087 --> 01:11:11.537
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:11.932 --> 01:11:19.252
This is the center of your mastery.
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:19.252 --> 01:11:23.830
Because you have asked for the Pure
Knowledge, Kundalini has started moving.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:30.652
We have to open, help to open this
chakra, this center.

01:11:31.905 --> 01:11:40.975
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:40.975 --> 01:11:49.931
With full confidence in yourself, please say
it ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:11:51.356 --> 01:11:57.426
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:02.557
Ten times please.
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:32.057
Now, raise your right hand on your heart
and say, twelve times, with full confidence,

01:12:32.057 --> 01:12:40.095
the fundamental truth about yourself, "Mother,
I am the Spirit." Please say it twelve times.

01:12:41.243 --> 01:12:52.313
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:12.261 --> 01:13:27.181
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of love and ocean of bliss but above all
it is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:40.224
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:41.658 --> 01:13:48.028
so, whatever mistakes you commit,
are not greater than this ocean.

01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:54.350
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:54.559 --> 01:13:59.309
So, forgive yourself,
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:03.284
forget the past.
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:16.820
Please now, put your hand, right hand on
the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:25.863
and turn your head to the right.
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:25.863 --> 01:14:31.332
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:31.332 --> 01:14:38.849
This center is caught when you feel guilty
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:50.040
So, please say sixteen times, with full confidence
in yourself, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:58.250
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:59.366 --> 01:15:05.256
If you still think you are guilty, you better
have the punishment of saying it 108 times.

01:15:05.577 --> 01:15:11.287
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:16.136
I've already told you that you should be
pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:22.269
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:28.478 --> 01:15:38.448
Now, stretch your hand on your forehead
across and press it on both the sides.

01:15:39.958 --> 01:15:45.848
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:53.213
Now here, you have to say,
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:15:54.732 --> 01:15:59.552
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:00.645 --> 01:16:04.186
Not how many times but from your heart.

01:16:05.203 --> 01:16:12.433
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:12.433 --> 01:16:20.914
Many people think it is difficult but it is a myth.
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:20.988 --> 01:16:28.608
If you don't forgive or forgive, you do not
do anything but if you don't forgive,
then you play into wrong hands.

01:16:29.223 --> 01:16:37.003
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:37.322 --> 01:16:42.872
So please say it from your heart. Yesterday
everybody could not say it from their hearts,

01:16:42.872 --> 01:16:49.133
that's why they couldn't get their realization. You
say it sincerely that, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:16:49.133 --> 01:16:52.997
Just say that. It's the greatest 
weapon we have got.

01:16:52.997 --> 01:16:59.171
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:59.171 --> 01:17:05.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:06.112 --> 01:17:17.712
Now, please take your right hand on the back
side of your head and place your head upwards

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:27.030
holding it with your hand. In this center,
you have to say without feeling guilty,

01:17:27.032 --> 01:17:36.412
without counting your mistakes, for your own
satisfaction, "O Divine, if we have done any wrong,

01:17:36.412 --> 01:17:41.761
please forgive us or forgive me."
But don't count your mistakes.

01:17:43.315 --> 01:17:50.588
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:50.588 --> 01:18:00.039
From your heart
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:00.039 --> 01:18:05.807
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:05.989 --> 01:18:15.329
So now, you stretch your hand and put the
center of your palm on top of your head

01:18:15.329 --> 01:18:22.179
and stretch your fingers, press it hard 
as much as you can easily and turn

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:35.812
it seven times, clockwise and put
your head bent forward.

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:43.142

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

01:19:19.567 --> 01:19:24.317
Now, please take down your hand.
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:24.317 --> 01:19:28.692
Please open your eyes.
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:30.134 --> 01:19:37.294
Now, put your right hand towards Me, like this.
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:37.294 --> 01:19:40.643
Bend your head
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:44.461
and see if you are getting cool
breeze out of your head.

01:19:44.461 --> 01:19:48.905
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:49.211 --> 01:19:53.011
Above, little above
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:01.221 --> 01:20:07.661
Now, put the left hand towards Me.
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:07.661 --> 01:20:10.974
Bend your head
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:10.974 --> 01:20:14.987
and see with your right hand, if there's a
cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:20:14.987 --> 01:20:19.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:24.962 --> 01:20:33.252
Hmm. Now, put your right hand towards Me
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:33.351 --> 01:20:40.631
and see again bending your head with the
left hand, if there's a cool breeze coming out.

01:20:41.313 --> 01:20:50.333
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:51.689 --> 01:20:58.019
Now, raise both your hands in the air and
put your neck back and ask a question,

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:04.858
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:04.858 --> 01:21:10.737
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:10.737 --> 01:21:18.583
"Is this the All-Pervading Power of God's love?"
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:22.581
"Is it Brahma Chaitanya?"
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:26.826
"Is it Ruh?"
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:29.391 --> 01:21:33.921
Just ask this question in your heart.
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:35.525 --> 01:21:40.505
Put down your hands, please.
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:41.384 --> 01:21:50.614
Now, those who have felt cool breeze out
of their heads or out of their hands,
please raise both your hands.

01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:58.100
[INTERPRETER]

nothing, but you mature your realization.

You have to respect your realization
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:48.243
and you will understand about it.
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:48.243 --> 01:22:54.842
Supposing, somebody gives Me shilling and
I do not spend it, how will I know it's value?

01:22:55.448 --> 01:23:01.318
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:01.318 --> 01:23:07.844

for yourself and for others.
[INTERPRETER]

that you feel very relaxed

guilty.

the architect of all the architects?"

01:26:48.427 --> 01:26:58.197
SY: Is God the architect of all the architects?
- Again

01:27:08.297 --> 01:27:15.657
You've been to some guru before?
Nobody? Now, feeling it now?

01:27:16.695 --> 01:27:21.335
So now remember that God is the architect
of all the architects.

SY: [GERMAN]

01:27:30.322 --> 01:27:35.822

May God bless you!

What's the matter? How is it?

01:27:59.076 --> 01:28:04.446
SY: He worked too much in the garden,
he wasn't used to it, maybe.

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:19.880
You should use gloves. Garden is good work
but you must use, alright?

01:28:27.674 --> 01:28:33.374
They hurt you? But don't use your gloves now.

01:28:33.374 --> 01:28:40.645
Your hands are important because now
the cool breeze is coming in, alright?
SY: [GERMAN]

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:21.284
SY: He feels cool but he feels tingling
and he feels a block on this part.

01:29:21.419 --> 01:29:27.209
That's because you feel guilty again. 
This is the center for feeling guilty.

01:29:31.855 --> 01:29:36.815
SY: He smokes
- Unnh... and then you feel guilty after smoking

01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:47.430
SY: He wants to stop smoking
- You will.

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:59.089
Whenever you feel like, just think of Me, you'll
stop smoking, alright? Good, you are a seeker.

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:05.825
You'll stop it no time.
SY: [GERMAN]

01:30:16.464 --> 01:30:19.834
SY: She meet You Shri Mataji but
she couldn't feel it

01:30:23.142 --> 01:30:37.122
Now? What work you do? Now you ask a
question, "Mother, are You the teacher

01:30:37.122 --> 01:30:40.469
of all the teachers?" just ask the
question three times.

01:30:42.173 --> 01:30:45.083
SY: Shri Mataji, You are the teacher of
all the teachers.

01:30:45.083 --> 01:30:48.930
Are You?
SY: "Are You the teachers of all the teachers?"

01:31:10.034 --> 01:31:24.804
You got it. You got the cool breeze now?
Got it? Got it, sure?

01:31:41.923 --> 01:31:51.453
SY: She is a reporter, a Sahaja yogi. She has
arthritis, she cannot stand on her knees.

01:31:51.453 --> 01:31:59.758
What's the matter?
SY: and she doesn't see very well
and work with the eyes

01:32:00.132 --> 01:32:07.822
SY: because there's a chronic inflammation in the
eyes. Arthritis in the knees and the chronic
inflammation in the eyes.

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:11.799
Let her sit here and put light behind her
SY: Just try to sit down

01:32:11.799 --> 01:32:14.522
She can sit down [UNCLEAR - GREGOIRE?]
SY: Yeah, yeah, she can, she can sit.

This way or just [UNCLEAR] this. Kathmandu?
She went to Kathmandu, there she got it?

01:32:31.382 --> 01:32:33.906
SY: No, no, no

Put your hand here. You ask a question. Slowly. I
don't want them to hear. I don't want the TV people
to hear.

01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:19.620
Holy Ghost.
SY: [GERMAN]

01:35:04.116 --> 01:35:10.436
What is it?
SY: And she's the lady which has crunchy eyeface.

But aren't you not better now?
SY: [GERMAN] Not yet

On the left hand side or the right?
SY: [GERMAN]

SY: In the center, Shri Mataji.

Take her at the back]

01:35:32.299 --> 01:35:35.370
I'm doing such a great work. 
You all have to help Me.

01:35:47.526 --> 01:36:01.366
Haan, now, better? Put it here. Say,
"Mother, I'm the Spirit."

01:36:11.337 --> 01:36:20.607
Haan, now. Better? No, nothing?
SY: No, it's there but not much, not much.

01:36:51.591 --> 01:36:56.751
Yes. Yeah

You felt the cool breeze? So now, you must come

So, how are you?
SY: [GERMAN]

01:38:46.779 --> 01:38:52.109
SY: She felt it shri Mataji but she's not very 
health sick
- What's the matter?

01:38:57.762 --> 01:39:02.522
SY: She has to finish the chores
and she feels very bad.

01:39:02.522 --> 01:39:08.499
Left is giving her a problem. Haan, better now?

01:39:08.499 --> 01:39:15.575

And She? She's great. What 's your name?

Haww!
SY: Feel a little bit [UNCLEAR] 
she says she will overcome

01:39:49.488 --> 01:39:56.081
That's why she catches on the heart.
SY: There were problems with her so,

Forget it. You have to become great
Sahaja yogis, alright? Not ordinary.

How are you feeling now?
SY: She cannot say

01:43:10.408 --> 01:43:24.288
Her eyes are dilated. Just see how black they are.
See her pupils. Alright, you come and
see them. You are alright.

01:43:26.366 --> 01:43:38.466
Come. What is it? Now she's alright?
She's alright now? Right heart.

[HINDI - Has he been to any guru, ask him.
He's holding his stomach. What?]

01:43:44.718 --> 01:43:49.603
SY: [HINDI - Catches on the left side]

SY: Irritation of the nerves, Shri Mataji,
and it's quite painful

I know, I know that. I know, I know, I know.

SY: Her doctor, he's a wise man. He said, he's
very happy that she's going to You, Shri Mataji.

01:44:58.415 --> 01:45:03.755
Alright, she's alright. It's only
obstruction of the Kundalini.

01:45:04.191 --> 01:45:08.931
You are a liver patient, that's why
the Kundalini is acting like this.

01:45:10.461 --> 01:45:18.691
Now please, on your liver.
SY: But it's cool, Shri Mataji, no doubt.

01:45:18.691 --> 01:45:34.691
Better now? Burning. Forgive,
forgive everyone, forgive, forgive everyone.

Now, is it better that side?
Is it burning now around you?

SY: and during the program the
pains disappeared.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:14.549
Now you are alright, there's no pain,
isn't it?

01:46:15.401 --> 01:46:19.871
It's cured because, you see, she, your
Nabhi chakra was caught up,

01:46:19.871 --> 01:46:26.016
so Kundalini went on the sides, that's how
you got this but now it's coming up straight.

01:46:26.746 --> 01:46:42.376
It's the sympathetic activity. Trying to slim, alright.

May God bless you! Alright, come along.
No more Sahaja yogis, unnh?

01:47:13.342 --> 01:47:23.922
What about you? You started thinking about it.
You can't think about it. It's beyond thinking.

your eyes, come forward, come forward.

Alright, come here. Don't think, 
don't think, don't think.

burning. Today in the afternoon maybe he saw

01:49:15.523 --> 01:49:23.180
SY: the program, he felt it very strong and
during the program, again not strong enough.
He wants to feel now.

01:49:24.606 --> 01:49:30.626
He's quite temperamental. His Kundalini
is temperamental.

01:49:31.698 --> 01:49:37.758
SY: He's saying, to forgive himself,
is the most difficult for him.

01:49:37.776 --> 01:49:41.956
To keep?
SY: To forgive himself it's very difficult for him

01:49:48.051 --> 01:50:00.891
What crime have you committed?
SY: [GERMAN] He doesn't know. 
It's a blockage, Shri Mataji

01:50:01.695 --> 01:50:16.685
Then just say, "I forgive," that's all, finished.
Say it. Again. Just come forward

01:50:20.115 --> 01:50:23.615

and parcel of the Whole."

once from You but then she again went back

SY: to the Catholic Church and now she's
afraid to oppose her friends and go there.

01:51:27.402 --> 01:51:34.222
Which friends?
SY: In the Catholic Church, friends 
who are in the Catholic Church

01:51:34.222 --> 01:51:37.782
It's nothing to deny them, it's alright,
let them be there.

You see, but Christ once they said,
"Your brothers and sisters have come."

and who are My sisters?"

SY: [GERMAN]

01:52:07.504 --> 01:52:11.653
Non realized souls are your brothers and
sisters, you are but realized souls are,

01:52:11.653 --> 01:52:14.485
because you have one Mother.

SY: They can become your real ones
but not now [UNCLEAR]

01:52:17.683 --> 01:52:23.060
Because you have one Mother, you see.
All realized souls have one Mother.

Then thinking you don't get it, you don't get it.
They have achieved nothing so far,
what have they achieved?

Yeah, yeah, it's okay, it's no problem

then they are very nice and she understands

SY: where we stand and she's afraid
when she goes she will lose them.

01:53:07.564 --> 01:53:10.216

then you can't lose them

yoga. Don't wear a black, don't wear black

after some time they'll take to drugs.

obligation you'll do on them.

to bring them to reality

Understand? Annh?

so we said we'll make a program there.

you should not bother about anything else, isn't it?

Mataji - not a real one though.

01:55:08.163 --> 01:55:12.673
SY: She felt the cool breeze but she
cannot be yet thoughtless

01:55:14.484 --> 01:55:17.114
She has a Left Agnya
SY: Left Agnya

01:55:19.325 --> 01:55:23.205
You must take the treatment of Sahaja
yoga, that's all.

01:55:23.205 --> 01:55:26.237
SY: Okay, then we will work on you. 
Left Agnya is not such a problem.

01:55:26.237 --> 01:55:28.632
You just say, "Mother, You are
Nirvichar," say like that.

01:55:28.632 --> 01:55:35.285
SY: "Shri Mataji, You are Nirvichara."
- Or you say, thoughtless awareness.

01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:49.870
SY: [GERMAN]

01:55:56.485 --> 01:56:10.275
Now, see? Can you think?
SYogini: No
- Now you have got it!

01:56:11.568 --> 01:56:22.218
Now, next. Felt it, I can see that.

01:56:22.384 --> 01:56:30.454
Very happy? No?
SY: She couldn't feel it, she said.
But she said, she couldn't.

01:56:30.454 --> 01:56:33.158
See eyes are sparkling!
SY: Yeah, she's okay.

01:56:33.158 --> 01:56:39.818
This will be your Vishuddhi. You smoke?
SY: [GERMAN] No, she doesn't.

01:56:39.818 --> 01:56:48.961
Now? Are you feeling now? Don't doubt,
if you're feeling you're feeling it.

01:56:51.994 --> 01:56:55.624
SY: She's thinking

01:56:58.086 --> 01:57:04.576
Come forward, don't think about it. If it is there,
it is there, if it is not there, it is not there.

01:57:05.083 --> 01:57:20.123
Forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. 
Hunh, you're feeling now?

01:57:21.905 --> 01:57:26.555
You see, for this, you come and they'll tell
you what is to be done. This is dried out.

01:57:26.555 --> 01:57:34.538
This portion, is the Hamsa chakra, must be
cleared out - alright? But better now, better.
May God bless you!

01:57:44.942 --> 01:57:50.902
My handkerchief, it's fallen off
somewhere. Alright

01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:06.730
SY: So, you can ask. Okay. She just wanted
to see You, Shri Mataji.

01:58:06.730 --> 01:58:08.785
I'll work it out.

01:58:20.606 --> 01:58:29.226
So, how are you? Did you feel the
cool breeze? No! What do you do?

01:58:29.534 --> 01:58:38.084
You are a student? Then what do you do? Unnh?
SY: He's assistant on the University, Shri Mataji

01:58:38.282 --> 01:58:42.222
SY: Assistant on the University
- That means like a teacher?

01:58:42.222 --> 01:58:48.841
SY: No, he has to do all the work and the
Professor is facing the [UNCLEAR]

01:58:55.643 --> 01:59:00.963
Agnya is too much. Put your hand down,
like this [UNCLEAR]

01:59:03.474 --> 01:59:11.424
SY: "Shri Mataji, are You the teacher
of all the teachers?"

01:59:11.424 --> 01:59:16.247
Ask the question, just ask them the
question that's [UNCLEAR]

01:59:32.943 --> 01:59:36.132
It's started.

01:59:36.132 --> 01:59:42.073
SY: "Shri Mataji or Mother, are You
the teacher of all the teachers?"

01:59:42.073 --> 01:59:56.583
Again. Alright? Feeling it? You say,
"Mother, You are...."

01:59:57.402 --> 02:00:06.792
SY: Then say, "Shri Mataji, You are the
teacher of all the teachers."
- [UNCLEAR] Horrible Agnya! Now say

02:00:06.996 --> 02:00:12.776
SY: Say, "Shri Mataji, You are
the teacher of all the teachers."

02:00:12.776 --> 02:00:16.159
SY: Once again, "Shri Mataji, You are
the teacher of all the teachers."

02:00:16.159 --> 02:00:20.029
And let him not say that. Simply ask the
question but with him the problem is,

02:00:20.029 --> 02:00:22.980
a very bad Agnya he has got. You think
too much? What do you think about?

02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:28.500
SY: [GERMAN]
- Which subject are you teaching?

02:00:33.010 --> 02:00:37.925
SY: He wants to know because he's Medical
student and this thought You might help.

02:00:42.639 --> 02:00:52.179
He's in the Medical?
SY: "Shri Mataji [GERMAN]"

02:00:55.298 --> 02:01:02.118
Ask again.
SY: "Shri Mataji [GERMAN]

02:01:02.924 --> 02:01:10.434
Again 
Seeker: [UNCLEAR]

02:01:11.815 --> 02:01:30.345
Started? Started now, little? Better?
Have you seen Me without thinking?

02:01:33.003 --> 02:01:37.553
SY: [GERMAN]

02:01:43.054 --> 02:01:51.604
Concentrate. So now, better? That fellow
got it when I did this.

02:01:51.604 --> 02:01:55.100
SY: Yeah, yeah, the other one got it.
- [UNCLEAR]

02:01:55.215 --> 02:02:00.785
[HINDI - See, just settle his Vishuddhi]
Let him try. Come along

02:02:02.489 --> 02:02:04.559
So now?

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:18.232
She's cured now, that girl.

02:02:24.389 --> 02:02:26.079
What's it?

02:02:32.172 --> 02:02:37.062
Better? [HINDI - He does the work of electricity]

02:02:39.212 --> 02:02:44.148
[HINDI - Didn't come? Didn't rise?]
SY: [HINDI - (UNCLEAR) Vishuddhi opened]

02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:47.158
[HINDI - What? Did It rise from
the bottom or not?]

02:02:47.158 --> 02:02:52.811
SY: What do you feel? You feel heat, you
feel anywhere [UNCLEAR]?

02:02:53.287 --> 02:02:59.317
[HINDI - Is not rising? See whether it is
rising from below or now? Heart is catching?]

02:03:01.665 --> 02:03:05.205
SY: [HINDI - too much heaviness. 
Heart and Left Vishuddhi together.]

02:03:05.205 --> 02:03:08.837
SY: He just comes to lose his spectacle
issue, Shri Mataji

02:03:08.845 --> 02:03:15.005
It's very easy. You put the light behind your
... with the photograph, yes you can.

02:03:18.718 --> 02:03:27.398
SY: He didn't feel much, he was quite sure
and thought [UNCLEAR] but it's really cool

02:03:27.398 --> 02:03:37.262
On your right? Alright, raise his
Kundalini. Do you smoke?

02:03:37.539 --> 02:03:44.885
SY: [GERMAN] Yeah
- Burning

02:03:45.144 --> 02:03:52.014
SY: [HINDI - Left Vishuddhi is too much]
- Left Vishuddhi? [HINDI - Say it (UNCLEAR)]

02:03:55.360 --> 02:04:01.180
Hunh, what is it?
SY: Agnya

02:04:01.224 --> 02:04:13.004
Heart. Heart, Left Vishuddhi. That means,
put him left to the right. Too much right side.

02:04:13.004 --> 02:04:17.099
SY: He's also Left Nabhi also. Left 
Vishuddhi, left Nabhi Shri Mataji

02:04:17.099 --> 02:04:21.980
You're married?
SY: [GERMAN] Not anymore

02:04:25.337 --> 02:04:36.377
You're married before. You left your wife?
SY: [GERMAN] [UNCLEAR]

02:04:38.134 --> 02:04:49.704
Doesn't matter, don't matter but just saying.
He doesn't have problem.. Come along now.

02:05:02.583 --> 02:05:11.933
Once more. Haan, now better. Feeling it now?
See now, so better say it, "Alright, I'll manage."

02:05:16.054 --> 02:05:32.934
Say now, it's better. Left Nabhi. Sahaja yoga is
something, you just have to be happy and joyous

02:05:33.888 --> 02:05:42.128
and just say something that will please you, so it
works out. To please the Deity, that's only

02:05:42.128 --> 02:05:49.926
SY: [GERMAN]

02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:58.790
Better now. It's better now, you see. 
Alright, it's good! May God bless you!

02:06:09.108 --> 02:06:18.098
Yes, so now, did you feel anything?
SY: [GERMAN]

02:06:22.448 --> 02:06:26.708
SY[ASIDE]: Do you feel any difference now?
Are you getting any thoughts when you ...?

02:06:26.708 --> 02:06:33.092
SY: Shri Mataji [UNCLEAR] he doesn't
think him much [UNCLEAR]

02:06:33.909 --> 02:06:36.639
Have you been to some guru or someone
[UNCLEAR]?

02:06:36.639 --> 02:06:38.249
SY: [GERMAN]

02:06:38.249 --> 02:06:42.979
No one, no one. You never read about
these trans these people?

02:06:43.943 --> 02:06:47.343
SY: [GERMAN]

02:06:47.343 --> 02:07:02.202
Read, who? Alright, now you put it down there
and just say, "Mother, I'm my own master,"
just say that.

02:07:02.246 --> 02:07:08.926
Seeker: [GERMAN]

02:07:14.679 --> 02:07:21.269
Difficult, hunh?
SY: But he's thoughtless

02:07:21.269 --> 02:07:28.897
Thoughtless, haan. Now? Now have
confidence.

02:07:32.602 --> 02:07:36.652
Now put your hand here and say,
"Mother, I'm the Spirit."

02:07:36.652 --> 02:07:52.706
Seeker: [GERMAN]
- See? It's true. So, have confidence in yourself.

02:07:52.706 --> 02:07:57.138
Alright? Not to be worried about.
It's alright.

02:07:57.138 --> 02:08:01.936
Little bit you catch there because you
have read these books but it will be alright.

02:08:01.936 --> 02:08:10.594
You'll get it permanently. [APPLAUSE]

02:08:19.506 --> 02:08:23.666
SY: He has no patience, he just wants 
to be with You, Shri Mataji.

02:08:23.666 --> 02:08:30.157
Oh.. Catching on the heart
SY: The Kundalini?

02:08:41.459 --> 02:08:50.979
It's alright, just see over there. You'll be fine.
Work very hard, do you? What's your job?

02:08:53.878 --> 02:08:58.168
SY: He's cleaning the windows, Shri Mataji.
- That's why, works very hard

02:08:58.333 --> 02:09:07.403
Take some other job - not so hard. Better now.
SY: Yeah, it's there.

02:09:07.536 --> 02:09:21.416
Yes, good! May God bless you!
He's got it very well. Felt it?

02:09:21.882 --> 02:09:32.302
No but, what are you wearing?
That's the problem

02:09:34.806 --> 02:09:47.976
You better take it out.Tibetan [UNCLEAR] horrible!
Take it out. No, no, no - not near the heart

02:09:55.443 --> 02:10:14.083
Feel it? Not yet. That's what, Buddha's
thing you were doing? Put [UNCLEAR] properly

02:10:15.306 --> 02:10:25.816
You say, "Mother, I am my own master." 
Again, "Mother, I am my own master."

02:10:44.911 --> 02:10:52.371
Better now? Slightly, feel it there.
Alright, now. You go on saying.

02:11:01.810 --> 02:11:06.980
Alright now, put it here. Now say,
"Mother, I'm the Spirit."

02:11:12.227 --> 02:11:19.547
Please put a bandhan on his back on the
Left Swadhishthana, left, all this, haan.

02:11:32.393 --> 02:11:40.123
You are the Spirit. Yes, of course but
what I'm saying, just now you are the body

02:11:43.278 --> 02:11:53.458
Yes, that's what. You just say that. Now.

02:11:57.105 --> 02:12:04.685
See, he's got it now. Alright.
It's gone up here on your head.

02:12:04.717 --> 02:12:09.537
Is it on your head, just see? Put your hand
on top and say, "Mother, come in my head."

02:12:09.537 --> 02:12:24.335
"Mother, please come in my head," say
that. Again say that. It's coming already.

02:12:24.896 --> 02:12:30.176
You can feel it, the cool breeze?
[UNCLEAR]

02:12:38.256 --> 02:12:43.460
Now don't wear this, throw it away.
Don't wear, it's not good.

02:12:44.567 --> 02:12:46.697
Throw it away.

02:12:46.697 --> 02:12:51.420
SY: You cannot discriminate if it is a ...If you
are good in vibrations, take the vibrations

02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:56.673
Even holding in your hands is not good, 
because that's all false. It's not true, that's false.

02:13:02.298 --> 02:13:04.968
See, whatever good or bad, 
now the point is, throw it.

02:13:04.968 --> 02:13:07.488
Seeker: It's a direct line of the Shakti

02:13:07.488 --> 02:13:13.380
Arre, all that they tell, the direct line and indirect
line. Forget it. You got the realization na,

02:13:13.380 --> 02:13:18.258
you forget it, that's no good, throw it 
away. Alright, give it to Me.

02:14:04.188 --> 02:14:10.428

SY: they get picture of a special person. I don't
want to say what she saw but it was Divine.

02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:32.919
SY: She said that she saw there's a picture of a
very Divine person, then she got the Grace

02:14:35.965 --> 02:14:44.455
Afraid of what?
Seeker: [GERMAN]

What problem?

Don't wear such a heavy thing. Let Me see

Yes, so, how did you feel?

02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:09.410
SY: She's said, she's not sure. She
doesn't feel it very much.

02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:18.498
She has a heart. What work do you do?
SY: Programming and as a computer specialist

[KI - JAI ... KI - JAI]

02:58:14.073 --> 02:58:22.113
You're so very happy and joyous and tomorrow I'm
going to [UNCLEAR - PRAGUE?] and we're going
to work it out there.

02:58:24.687 --> 02:58:28.677
It has been such a nice time,
between such nice people.

02:58:28.677 --> 02:58:33.634
They all got their realization and they're very
much with us. Now we have so many people

02:58:33.634 --> 02:58:38.563
in Austria. It's a great thing, so
now we leave Austria

02:58:38.563 --> 02:58:53.446
SYogis: Wow! [APPLAUSE]

02:59:05.062 --> 02:59:11.642
Children must be fast asleep now, just
[UNCLEAR] are sitting here. Wonderful!

02:59:12.330 --> 02:59:17.010
It's real Ekadasha Rudra, I tell you. 
The way it has worked out.

02:59:17.010 --> 02:59:26.444
Everybody looked so clear, so nice,
so happy. We'll meditate everyday.

02:59:26.444 --> 02:59:32.228
In the evening time, if you can meditate just before
sleep, everything will be fine and very enjoyable.

02:59:32.228 --> 02:59:39.869
Alright? Enjoy it, that's the main part.
Enjoy each other. We have to show the world

02:59:39.869 --> 02:59:50.438
that all Sahaja yogis can live very
happily with each other. Cleanse yourself,

02:59:50.438 --> 02:59:59.475
do meditation, cleanse yourself and you'll be
alright. So what is this you've brought for Me?

02:59:59.654 --> 03:00:05.594
Hunh?
SY: You should look at it, Shri Mataji.

03:00:05.594 --> 03:00:09.599
Wow!

03:00:09.599 --> 03:00:13.967
SYogini: I made it myself.
SYogi: She made it herself.

03:00:13.967 --> 03:00:25.265
Really? Beautiful! Ah, you must have one like
that!

03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:36.290
It's very nice.Thank you very much!

03:00:36.410 --> 03:00:43.748
That is very special! [UNCLEAR] 
Thank you very much, it's beautiful!

03:01:01.071 --> 03:01:06.541
Now that's not important. Your realization
is important. Forget all of them.

03:01:06.541 --> 03:01:12.703
What is important is yourself and your realization
and you have to grow out of all of that, alright?

03:01:12.703 --> 03:01:18.574
You have to clear it out yourself.
SYogini: I know [UNCLEAR]

[CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOGI AND YOGINI]

03:01:35.708 --> 03:01:42.668
What you have to do is to look after yourself,
annh? Best thing is to get your realization,

03:01:42.668 --> 03:01:49.517
get to your vibrations and enjoy. First you
be equipped. What you know is to fulfill.

03:01:49.517 --> 03:01:54.481
You have to understand the theme
- see the point?

03:01:58.394 --> 03:02:03.314

to everybody?
