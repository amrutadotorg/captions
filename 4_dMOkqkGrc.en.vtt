00:00:17.942 --> 00:00:23.624
I bow all the  seekers of spirit.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.499
The seeking of spirit has been described

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:34.515
by so many people from ancient times.

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.808
It is nothing new that I’m telling you

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:42.178
that a human awareness reaches a point

00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:47.462
where it starts seeing that there has to be something beyond

00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.580
and at that time  the seeking starts.

00:00:50.682 --> 00:00:54.179
And the person starts looking forward to  something

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.649
that will make that person the spirit,

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:03.815
as all this scriptures have described and talked about it.

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:09.333
There is no amount of talking is going to improve on that

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:14.592
because, spirit is within us it resides within us in our heart .

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:19.148
Now as it is you must have heard many people talking about it

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:23.748
that you have to be spirit that

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:29.853
you have to get your self realization,
you have to  have self knowledge you have to know yourself

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:35.123
but in Sahaja Yoga today what one has to do is to establish that

00:01:35.236 --> 00:01:39.368
to actualize that make it an experience of your own

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.368
and this is a very big gift I think a very unique discovery

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:46.974
that has come to us that we can actualize.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.639
Now  we have to understand one simple think

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.485
that when this spirit manifest within us,

00:01:52.604 --> 00:01:56.900
what should happen on the very gross level what should happen.

00:01:57.094 --> 00:01:59.823
Firstly it must be invigorated,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.210
means you must get more energy in the body,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:06.480
You must feel physical limit.

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:12.045
By going to any process or any method or any experience

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.777
if health wise if you cannot improve then must know that it is not the spirit.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:20.678
Because spirit is complete health,

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:24.217
or it never get sick, that is what Spirit is.

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.609
So first thing that should happen to you, is that

00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:31.917
it should  be an invigorating life a very dynamic life.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.575
Second thing that should happen to you is, that you become a very peaceful

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.684
and a relax personality, not like the ones who were agitated

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:42.904
and very angry and shout.

00:02:43.023 --> 00:02:48.165
There is nothing to shout and get angry its a kind of a fear this people have perhaps

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:52.255
that if the truth they face, or the reality that comes

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.104
they will have no place in this world.

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:58.259
That might be one of the reasons which makes them agitated.

00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:01.513
A person  like Christ, about who people talk

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.740
and think that the Christ was, is in their pocket.

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.425
You must know that first and foremost thing the greatness of Christ

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:14.037
was that, He used a weapon of forgiveness.

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:17.209
He was such a peaceful person, on the cross also

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.256
that He said that forgive those

00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:24.841
who are doing this O Father,
because they do not know what they are doing.

00:03:24.944 --> 00:03:30.016
That kind of a personality, you can say is a spiritual personality.

00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:34.208
and not a person who gets agitated and hot tempered

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:36.149
and start shouting at people.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.126
The time today is extremely precarious, which we do not realize.

00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:45.220
For example, if you ask these people if Christ comes and stands here

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:47.428
how will they recognize Christ?

00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.453
Is there any way of recognizing Christ?

00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:56.106
They might be those who crucified Christ,
because they did not recognize at that time.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.246
How we will recognize Christ, is a very simple question.

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:01.208
which we never try to answer.

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:05.940
There’s no way to understand how we are going to recognize Christ.

00:04:06.168 --> 00:04:12.388
A very very simple question has no answer because you can't.

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:14.226
You cannot recognize Him.

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:17.854
Because your awareness cannot make you understand.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:21.858
Like somebody told me that there’s somebody who claims that he is Christ.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.748
I said all right, ask him to  walk on the water.

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:31.946
If he can walk on the water then think that is Christ.
That's one of the qualities of Christ

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:38.430
Now, whatever is the quality of a particular advent
is to be seen in that advent.

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:42.059
Every advent has a particular quality

00:04:42.113 --> 00:04:46.161
which is being already described in the ancient books.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:50.191
You should not accept anybody
because he says I'm this  and I'm that.

00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.715
This is the problem with us, that we get ourselves value,

00:04:53.897 --> 00:04:56.539
to some sort of mental conception live with  it,

00:04:56.637 --> 00:04:59.698
our forefathers lived with it, their forefathers have lived with it

00:04:59.753 --> 00:05:02.973
and ultimately we find there is nothing left.

00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:07.627
So one has to know that when you,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.441
at least when you say that you believe in Christ,

00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:14.389
how will you recognise if Christ comes.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.034
Is there any matter?

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.753
Is there any shown matter that will tell you that He is Christ?

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:20.989
There is!

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:24.396
You should become the spirit. You have vibrations.

00:05:24.555 --> 00:05:25.663
You feel coolness.

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:29.150
You have a new awareness a vibrated awareness, the fifth dimension

00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:34.377
within you rises into that point  by which, when you ask,

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.710
"Is this Christ?"

00:05:36.926 --> 00:05:41.712
The vibrations will flow, tremendously.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.444
You will know, this is Christ.

00:05:44.535 --> 00:05:48.489
If he is  a fake person, you might even get blisters in your cap,

00:05:48.637 --> 00:05:52.083
you might even get terrible heat from such a person.

00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:57.184
But if it is Christ, you'll get tremendous breeze in your hand.

00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:02.194
This is the sign how to make out whether he is Christ or not.

00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:05.998
That’s why he said that you will be calling me Christ, Christ

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:11.152
I won’t recognize you, neither you will recognize Him.
That's a fact.

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:14.033
You live with an idea with a mental projection

00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:18.115
and then you came all your

00:06:18.717 --> 00:06:22.859
possibilities, chances of your ascent.

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:26.581
You must keep yourself open like a scientist  does,

00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:30.198
keep yourself open. Your mind should be open.

00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:33.163
You should not close down by any dogma

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:37.083
or any time off such theory that makes you

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:43.124
completely excluded from the rest of the thing,

00:06:43.215 --> 00:06:46.329
or which makes you non reflect,

00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.777
which makes you a person who cannot reflect,

00:06:49.936 --> 00:06:53.773
cannot think anymore about.

00:06:54.106 --> 00:07:00.215
Such a personality who developed,
which is going to be very, very dangerous for you.

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:04.320
So the personality should be open,

00:07:04.989 --> 00:07:09.484
should be receptive you understand.

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:13.589
Now, as I told you yesterday back it is a spontaneous happening

00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:17.222
is the happening off the living process within you.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:20.227
It is nothing to do with artifical things.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.671
Of course in the churches were established
they try to be good to people in the sense

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:28.111
they told them that to be in the balance
you keep the balance another

00:07:28.173 --> 00:07:32.444
but it went too far with certain things like baptism, I think

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:35.657
that where they everybody started putting their hands

00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:39.917
on top of anyone I'm said that your baptised

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:42.541
that's not proper

00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.935
but you call [....Hindi] means it is unauthorized.

00:07:46.088 --> 00:07:49.183
To baptize someone is not the authority

00:07:49.272 --> 00:07:55.154
that you can get from any school colleges
but you have to get it from God.

00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:58.730
If you are a realized soul then you can baptize others.

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.554
Everybody cannot baptize, everyone.

00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:07.050
Even, I don't think Christ disciples baptize anyone, they did not.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.003
It is later on, I don't know how it croul

00:08:10.172 --> 00:08:15.530
into the organization, that you could ask somebody
to go and baptize someone.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.514
William Blake has clearly said,

00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:22.195
that the priest cursed me on my head and I cried and wept.

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:25.539
Actually, that person who has to baptize,

00:08:25.619 --> 00:08:27.443
has to be realized soul

00:08:27.535 --> 00:08:30.374
because, baptism means awakening of the Kundalini

00:08:30.486 --> 00:08:34.179
and breaking up this fontanel bone area

00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:39.925
open to the subtle and that
you cannot do it, so you better not do it.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.702
You are unauthorized.

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:48.690
in all humbleness and humility one
must understand that that is not your job.

00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:54.959
Say for example, I do not know anything about the machinery,

00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:57.084
or about a car

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.670
I start driving, what will happen?

00:08:59.816 --> 00:09:03.876
But same thing happens with people who do not have the authority

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:06.746
to do God's work, start doing God's work.

00:09:06.849 --> 00:09:11.426
they lang everybody into difficulties,
and ultimately they neutralize themselves.

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:14.417
It is high time for all of them now to see,

00:09:14.542 --> 00:09:19.519
that what they have to do, all these institutions, is no dogma

00:09:19.656 --> 00:09:22.377
nothing like that, but what you have to do

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:26.634
is to transform people through their Kundalini awakening.

00:09:26.748 --> 00:09:29.738
through their real baptism.

00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:33.352
This is what people have realized

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:37.593
that there’s something wrong somewhere
that we are not connected to the mains.

00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:40.769
When it happens, the first thing that happens to you

00:09:40.904 --> 00:09:43.392
that you become collectively conscious as

00:09:43.472 --> 00:09:45.634
Warren has told.

00:09:45.736 --> 00:09:48.322
this collectively consciousness is nothing but

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.162
that your attention itself, your attention which is felt

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.622
on the central nervous system gets enlightened.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.832
in the sense that as like ether, when you touch ether

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:05.247
you can communicate anything from here to every place.

00:10:05.497 --> 00:10:11.489
In the same way, when you touch that All Pervading Power

00:10:11.696 --> 00:10:15.186
you can communicate through that power,

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:20.232
anywhere sitting down, it is collectively conscious.

00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:25.596
Moreover collectively conscious means that, you can feel a person

00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.250
whether he is the person he is

00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:32.171
allright or he has a problem or his...

00:10:32.296 --> 00:10:35.916
Kundalini is in this part of the body or

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:38.252
if he has got some disease,

00:10:38.332 --> 00:10:40.517
you can feel also about yourself.

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:42.071
That’s the sign of light,

00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:45.279
that you automatically feel how the person is.

00:10:45.462 --> 00:10:47.533
You may not of [INAUDABLE] a meeting

00:10:47.644 --> 00:10:51.423
say it loudly or you may not try to inform the person

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:56.242
the other lady came to me and she was,
she was having cancer no doubt.

00:10:56.713 --> 00:11:00.825
But I didn't tell him, I tried and I think now she is cured.

00:11:01.054 --> 00:11:03.016
So, you don’t have to tell a person

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.442
because you don’t have to achieve anything by telling,

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:08.273
what you have to do is to achieve if she can be all right

00:11:08.356 --> 00:11:10.075
if you can give them realization.

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:13.394
But your attitude is not to cure people.

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:15.413
That's not the attitude of the Divine.

00:11:15.515 --> 00:11:17.194
Because it has got common sense.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.245
If you know that a certain car is going to be a junk forever,

00:11:21.318 --> 00:11:25.132
it is of no use, you don’t repair such cars.

00:11:25.563 --> 00:11:29.589
So, despite the affection and compassion you have for everyone,

00:11:29.725 --> 00:11:33.237
you want to see that by giving realization to this man

00:11:33.328 --> 00:11:36.477
who is absolutely good for nothing and all that

00:11:36.568 --> 00:11:41.277
you are just doing, throwing pearls before him.

00:11:42.128 --> 00:11:45.859
So you don’t even want to talk to such a man about realization,

00:11:45.954 --> 00:11:47.666
leave alone giving realization.

00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:51.569
This is such a headache to give realization to a man

00:11:51.618 --> 00:11:54.044
who is absolutely against God.

00:11:54.143 --> 00:11:58.100
Like Hitler for example, if he says that
"Mother, give me realization."

00:11:58.237 --> 00:12:00.588
What should I do?

00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:02.497
It is just like that.

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:06.835
So you have to have basically a temprament of seek.

00:12:07.007 --> 00:12:10.035
If you are a seeker, then you get your realization

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:13.448
and you become collectively conscious.

00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:19.364
With collective consciousness
you can also raise the Kundalini of people.

00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:21.881
You can cure.

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:24.516
You can mentally improve them.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:27.150
You can settle them with peace.

00:12:27.276 --> 00:12:29.823
Then sitting down here,

00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:33.664
you can tell about everyone, what’s wrong with that person,

00:12:33.738 --> 00:12:37.852
and sitting down here, you can try to help others.

00:12:38.782 --> 00:12:42.203
It is not a difficult thing at all, because you become that.

00:12:42.295 --> 00:12:44.332
Like, you have seen a television.

00:12:44.457 --> 00:12:49.457
if it puts to the mains,
it start acting in such a fantastic manner,

00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:54.217
that nobody can believe that this little box can behave like this.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.822
In the same way this little box start
behaving in that fantastic manner.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.338
This should happen to you, otherwise
you should not believe that you have got realization.

00:13:04.664 --> 00:13:06.426
It is not a 'make believe' thing.

00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:09.128
It is not just a mental understanding,

00:13:09.272 --> 00:13:11.956
that you are twice born, it is none of these things.

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:15.532
It is something that has sprouted within you, which has to

00:13:15.702 --> 00:13:17.362
If you are lower [INAUDABLE]

00:13:17.442 --> 00:13:19.729
and if you really respect yourself,

00:13:19.876 --> 00:13:23.213
as people seeking the truth and nothing else,

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.247
it happens to you, and grow completely in your growing.

00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:35.997
Secondly, what happens to you is that
you start understanding that it is the truth. How?

00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:39.296
Because supposing there were, as I told you,

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.877
that there was a gentleman whose father was sick,

00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:45.056
and we did not know about it.
He wanted to know about his father.

00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:49.721
So I said, all right.
Put your hands and ask how is your father.

00:13:49.817 --> 00:13:54.742
He just asked his father and got
a burning sensation on this finger here.

00:13:55.363 --> 00:14:00.664
So he asked Me, so I called it,
I said this finger relates to this portion,

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:03.263
and these are the center’s of your father.

00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:07.984
If it is so, then you better ask your father

00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:11.309
but I’m sure he must be down with very bad bronchitis.

00:14:11.544 --> 00:14:13.814
He telephoned to his mother in Scotland

00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:18.934
because she came on the phone and she said,
your father is down with very bad bronchitis.

00:14:19.086 --> 00:14:22.393
Sitting down there, I told him how you can cure him,

00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:26.968
and after that four,five hours he was out.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.560
It can be done.

00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:31.637
You are that fantastic, you are that glories.

00:14:31.735 --> 00:14:34.512
So your attention becomes enlightened.

00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:39.786
There is no question of you trying to put some spirits into things

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.913
and do all these useless things.

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:46.589
Only thing you have to do is, to awaken the spirit in that person

00:14:46.692 --> 00:14:49.827
who is sick and the spirit takes over.

00:14:51.819 --> 00:14:54.681
Because it becomes also the truth.

00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:58.175
You start understanding that this the truth.

00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:01.752
Because you verified.

00:15:01.871 --> 00:15:04.032
Every moment, you verify.

00:15:04.128 --> 00:15:05.629
First the thing it's a fluke.

00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.553
Sometimes you think by chance,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.985
you think, "Oh maybe so", like later on, start seeing

00:15:12.134 --> 00:15:14.152
that it is true. It is so.

00:15:14.296 --> 00:15:18.296
You put ten children, if they are realized souls
and there are many these days,

00:15:18.359 --> 00:15:22.446
even in your country, we have seen lots of children
who are born realized.

00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:27.736
You should tie up their eyes and put one person in front of them

00:15:28.182 --> 00:15:32.421
and you asked them, "What’s the matter with this man?"
you tell us what's the thing.

00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:35.205
They raise one finger, this finger, supposing.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.654
You asking, "Did you have a heart attack?"
This shows the heart.

00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:43.615
"Yes I have. How do?" I said,
"All of them are showing one finger. This is the heart."

00:15:45.234 --> 00:15:48.353
And then you start understanding that, this is the truth.

00:15:48.449 --> 00:15:54.641
There is no argument, there is no other opinion about it,

00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.875
only one opinion, because truth is absolute!

00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:02.204
Somebody says, this is Christ, somebody says that is Christ,

00:16:02.284 --> 00:16:04.743
somebody says this is Krishna, that is Rama.

00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:06.603
It is never like that!

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:10.794
It is one. The truth is one, you cannot have two opinion.

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:16.998
And is absolutely your subject, becomes enlightened
and  you can say this is the truth.

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:23.158
So the second thing that happens to you,
that you start knowing the truth, which is absolute.

00:16:24.176 --> 00:16:26.915
Now, if you put your hands say like this.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.212
now, as you have become and a computer,

00:16:29.313 --> 00:16:31.615
you are a computer, which has starting.

00:16:31.727 --> 00:16:35.848
Even all these instruments that have come
are parallel to our evolution.

00:16:36.007 --> 00:16:38.133
Whatever is within us, has come.

00:16:38.316 --> 00:16:40.471
But, if you see a computer,

00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:44.848
it has to think. But without thinking,

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:48.867
I mean, I look at you, I know you are there.
I don’t have a think about it.

00:16:49.153 --> 00:16:50.816
This kind of a computer

00:16:50.912 --> 00:16:53.515
human beings will take thousands of years,
even to make

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.602
that just thinks and spontaneously knows.

00:16:57.078 --> 00:16:59.542
We are already such a big computer, but

00:16:59.653 --> 00:17:03.148
we are even become absolute computers, when

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:06.058
we start asking a question, "Is there God?"

00:17:06.394 --> 00:17:09.322
Now those who are atheist, if they ask the question,

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.764
they start getting cool breeze on the hands.

00:17:13.023 --> 00:17:16.106
You ask any absolute question, "Was Christ the son of God?"

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:18.100
Why should people accept Bible?

00:17:18.194 --> 00:17:20.749
Why should they accept anything?
The accept this.

00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:26.360
Because if you ask, you get the breeze,
cool breeze in the hands as an answer.

00:17:26.535 --> 00:17:28.364
Then you know it as a truth.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.805
But could be, people should know that, how is it absolute?

00:17:31.903 --> 00:17:36.934
I’ll tell you an example like us we have some fanatics here
in India we also have lots of fanatics.

00:17:37.199 --> 00:17:41.094
and in Pune they have arranged my program in a hall

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:45.673
where, which was belonging to brahmins
they another type of

00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:49.054
twice born people. Self certified.

00:17:49.766 --> 00:17:53.072
So, they learned that I’m not a brahmin.

00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:56.736
So they were very angry and said,"We can not have your program."

00:17:56.891 --> 00:18:02.395
And our, these organizers did not tell me that
"Mother they don’t want to have your program,

00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:04.667
because you are not a brahmin." nothing they told me.

00:18:04.826 --> 00:18:09.432
But  they went and told that, "All right. If you don’t want
to have will publish it in the newspaper, because

00:18:09.542 --> 00:18:11.199
Mataji is not a brahmin,

00:18:11.325 --> 00:18:13.794
so they don’t want to have the program there."

00:18:13.882 --> 00:18:16.236
This was too much for them, to take upon themselves,

00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:20.157
So they said, "No, no, no, no. If you have published
it in the newspaper, let's have the program."

00:18:20.368 --> 00:18:22.852
So I said, "I start the speaking",

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:25.204
and I just say spontaneously

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:30.175
I said, "Please come forward those who are boothing that
the real brahmins."

00:18:30.693 --> 00:18:32.870
Four, five of them, you see walked.

00:18:33.184 --> 00:18:37.389
Of course, I mean, in India you don’t find
people of this kind, normally.

00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:39.537
They don’t challenge a seat normally.

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:44.589
So they came forward and sat down
and their hands where shaking, like this. You see.

00:18:45.177 --> 00:18:48.555
So I said,"Now, if you are real brahmins,why are you shaking?"

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:50.243
"You should not shake before Me."

00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:53.740
They said, "Mother we are shaking because you are Shakti,
You are the power."

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:55.176
"That's why we are shaking."

00:18:55.313 --> 00:18:57.205
I said, "No, nobody is shaking here."

00:18:57.426 --> 00:19:00.317
So they said, "No, but these three, four are shaking,
who are they?"

00:19:00.425 --> 00:19:02.750
I said, "Go and ask them. Who are they?"

00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:04.817
So, they went and asked, "Who are you?"

00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:08.756
They said, "We are certified lunatics, coming from lunatic asylum,

00:19:08.852 --> 00:19:10.298
our doctor has brought us

00:19:10.365 --> 00:19:13.459
that because one of us was cured by Mataji,
so we are here."

00:19:13.539 --> 00:19:16.923
Let's us see. There is no difference between those
lunatics and you.

00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:19.988
You’re shaking the same way and they’re also shaking.

00:19:20.182 --> 00:19:24.247
So, this fanaticism is making you shake.

00:19:26.285 --> 00:19:31.549
And this is the main point is, that when you become the truth,

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:34.793
you start understanding the absolute nature of truth.

00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:37.977
There is no another, for truth.

00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:41.870
If this is so, this is so. If this is so, this is so.

00:19:41.993 --> 00:19:43.809
You cannot compromise.

00:19:43.963 --> 00:19:47.098
You cannot make it little different,

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.959
you cannot synthesize it.

00:19:49.134 --> 00:19:53.710
You cannot analyze it. It is so, it is so, it is so.

00:19:54.282 --> 00:19:56.998
And you get confirmed about it, when you

00:19:57.109 --> 00:20:01.025
growing in your awarness,
you start finding out that this is the truth.

00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:06.641
So, you understand the truth through your mental activity first,

00:20:06.787 --> 00:20:10.980
through your rationality is goes in to your logic
and then you start accept it.

00:20:11.337 --> 00:20:15.077
But third thing that happens to you, ist the best of all.

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:19.812
Is the third thing that you see the whole world as fun.

00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:22.914
You see the whole world as a big joke.

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:26.188
You see the whole world as a witness.

00:20:26.316 --> 00:20:28.945
Like a thougth rises within us and falls off,

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:31.116
and another thought rises and falls off.

00:20:31.204 --> 00:20:33.253
When we are on the waves of the thought,

00:20:33.372 --> 00:20:37.612
we are frighten, we have fear, we have worries,
we have jealousies and all these things.

00:20:37.827 --> 00:20:40.180
But supposing you get into the boat,

00:20:40.363 --> 00:20:43.286
then you start watching waves with fun.

00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:47.147
in the same way, you jump onto such an awareness

00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:51.199
where you start watching the whole thing as a joke.

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:53.496
As a fun, as a play.

00:20:53.623 --> 00:20:57.117
And the whole thing becomes a play to your mind, you start seeing.

00:20:57.266 --> 00:21:00.236
And then the joy, stars pouring in you.

00:21:00.515 --> 00:21:04.756
Like you all say that, Mona Lisa painting is very good.

00:21:05.154 --> 00:21:06.274
How do you know?

00:21:06.434 --> 00:21:08.339
Why should wait about Mona Lisa?

00:21:08.653 --> 00:21:12.653
She is not one of these modern women.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.087
She is a very old fashioned woman, quite plump.

00:21:17.175 --> 00:21:20.835
And why do you say that that painting is so beautiful?
What is so much about it?

00:21:20.976 --> 00:21:25.119
Now, if you are a realized soul, you can see it gives vibrations.

00:21:25.548 --> 00:21:27.433
It soothes your Spirit.

00:21:28.155 --> 00:21:30.331
That's why, it is the best.

00:21:30.595 --> 00:21:32.356
If you go to the Sistine Chapel,

00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:35.678
of the Vatican.

00:21:35.955 --> 00:21:39.523
What Michelangelo has done is nothing,
but he has created vibrations,

00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:41.424
tremendous vibrations.

00:21:41.573 --> 00:21:43.903
And you see Christ, how they are show Christ?

00:21:44.045 --> 00:21:46.155
A robust, tall

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.106
fellow standing there, throwing people here and there.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.130
This is, what is happen today.

00:21:51.273 --> 00:21:53.071
This is the time of judgement.

00:21:53.214 --> 00:21:57.136
and the whole thing is nothing but the Kundalini they've shown,
and at agnya chakra

00:21:57.216 --> 00:22:00.831
Christ is sierving there and throwing people
this side and that side.

00:22:01.387 --> 00:22:03.842
This is what it is. He is depicted there

00:22:03.937 --> 00:22:07.011
through His own understanding, because was a realized soul.

00:22:07.135 --> 00:22:08.576
He shows it very clearly.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.886
But then on the altar you find a lanky panky

00:22:12.013 --> 00:22:15.849
Christ, you see, absolutely like a TV  patient about to die,

00:22:15.955 --> 00:22:21.060
only the bones, you see covered with the what you call a skin.

00:22:21.245 --> 00:22:25.246
How can Christ be like that! Is silly [INAUDABLE] .

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.840
Like these people who try onces to carry the cross.

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:31.573
And they will know that He could no be like that.

00:22:31.715 --> 00:22:35.183
He could not be such a lanky panky. He is a Person of Joy,

00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:38.927
health, happiness and exuberance.

00:22:38.989 --> 00:22:43.911
How can be anyone who is a man of God, is sickly,

00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:54.089
agitated, hot temper and horrible looking.
He has to have that serene on his face.

00:22:54.244 --> 00:23:01.607
He has to have that beautiful soothing, impression on others.

00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:09.593
How can it be that a person who is such a
great incarnation came on this earth

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.508
to be a bony structure like that?

00:23:12.629 --> 00:23:14.074
This is what it is.

00:23:14.138 --> 00:23:18.664
We have such misconceptions about all of them, such misconceptions,

00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:21.739
and we want to put all this conception on God,

00:23:21.787 --> 00:23:24.122
but you cannot conceptualize.

00:23:24.657 --> 00:23:30.178
The thing that stands between you and yourself is your ego,

00:23:30.464 --> 00:23:35.390
an your conditiion. Both things stand against, theiy are like barriers.

00:23:35.596 --> 00:23:40.046
When this Kundalini rises, as you see here. Is not here.

00:23:40.213 --> 00:23:45.082
When she rises and crosses over this center.
(Yogi: I didnt put a chart...)

00:23:45.637 --> 00:23:52.582
Then what happens your ego and superego,
it represents your conditioning, is sucked in.

00:23:52.971 --> 00:23:58.470
When it is sucked in, that is the, that is the center of Christ,
when is awaken within you,

00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:01.918
He sucks in. That's the place where He is at the cross.
Tomorrow,

00:24:01.998 --> 00:24:06.668
I think they’ll bring the chart and I'll be able
to explain in more details.

00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:13.928
And that is the time when you are neither the ego nor the superego
and you become the self. The joy starts singing [INAUDABLE].

00:24:14.023 --> 00:24:15.952
Whole thing is joy.

00:24:16.592 --> 00:24:18.496
The joy starts coming in you.

00:24:18.933 --> 00:24:21.699
The all other pursuits are joyous.

00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:24.494
There is no joy in the whole things,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:30.141
and joy doesn't have duality like happiness or unhappiness.

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:33.015
Happiness comes to you when your ego is pampered.

00:24:33.178 --> 00:24:37.059
And unhappiness comes to you,
when your conditionings troubles you.

00:24:37.301 --> 00:24:39.813
But, joy has no duality.

00:24:39.973 --> 00:24:45.055
It's just a feeling of complete elevated soul.

00:24:45.142 --> 00:24:51.522
You feel completely elevated about everything else,
enjoy the bliss of God.

00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:53.821
Actually, if you see, I mean

00:24:53.952 --> 00:24:55.712
Mona Lisa's painting even

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.022
you feel the joy is pouring, just like torrential rain.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:06.052
The person who did it, must have been the one
who has felt that joy, has broughten.

00:25:06.394 --> 00:25:11.290
But, if there is a person who is always thinking,

00:25:11.536 --> 00:25:16.264
and trying to think it out, what should be done.

00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:24.708
Then, he doesn't get the joy at all.
You look at a thing, and there is a thought in between.

00:25:24.876 --> 00:25:26.617
It kills the joy completely.

00:25:26.737 --> 00:25:31.358
Supposing I am here and I see something beautiful here,
and I start thinking about it,

00:25:31.488 --> 00:25:34.434
then I start thinking, "How much it must have cost,

00:25:34.528 --> 00:25:38.738
how to insure it. What to do with it", but there is no thought.

00:25:38.949 --> 00:25:43.053
The complete creation of that beauty, flows inside you.

00:25:43.168 --> 00:25:44.288
Just like joy.

00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:48.465
And this is, what has to happen to you, if you become the spirit.

00:25:48.722 --> 00:25:53.219
If it does not happen to you, don't believe in anyone.
Also me.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.242
You should not beleive,

00:25:55.398 --> 00:26:01.059
into anything, unless and until you get your spirit
which manifest all this things.

00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:05.896
It has nothing to do with your intellectualizing, your
your analyses, or anything.

00:26:05.986 --> 00:26:09.028
It is something that you have within yourself. It's your own.

00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:15.885
It is within you, and you have to get it within yourself,
by your own achievements.

00:26:15.978 --> 00:26:20.943
In the sense your own Kundalini rises and touches here
and opens it out.

00:26:21.168 --> 00:26:24.741
Now, as I told you, what I do is a simple thing.

00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:32.329
That I enlighten and alight, which is ready

00:26:32.418 --> 00:26:36.882
which is a, which is again in turn, becomes enlightened

00:26:36.969 --> 00:26:39.139
and can enlighten other light.

00:26:39.455 --> 00:26:42.111
Now, this Dr. Warren who was here, you have seen.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.360
He came to Me with his friend.

00:26:44.653 --> 00:26:48.298
and he just telephoned to Me, had nothing,
had just the telephone number.

00:26:48.468 --> 00:26:51.914
and when he telephoned to Me, he came to Me,
he got his realisation

00:26:52.034 --> 00:26:56.052
and he must have given realization in thousands.

00:26:56.295 --> 00:27:00.078
In the same way, you can also give realization to people.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.603
That’s how we can spread the knowledge,

00:27:04.263 --> 00:27:06.227
that is reality.

00:27:06.573 --> 00:27:09.943
knowledge of God's law's,

00:27:10.198 --> 00:27:17.240
of Divine mechanism within us, how it works.

00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:24.372
It is not, that everyone can get it.

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:29.296
I must say that, that I do not say that
all off you will get it.

00:27:29.616 --> 00:27:35.391
But should get it. That's my desire is, if you get it,
you're very fortunate

00:27:35.966 --> 00:27:39.102
you have found, what you have been finding it.

00:27:39.507 --> 00:27:43.978
And if you don’t get it, I would say that I'll try again.

00:27:44.339 --> 00:27:47.619
It has to happen to you,

00:27:47.782 --> 00:27:50.845
and that, it should happen in a way

00:27:51.021 --> 00:27:57.812
that it becomes part and parcel of your central nervous system
that you can manouver it.

00:27:58.432 --> 00:28:03.468
So, I have to tell you one thing. The One who has created us,

00:28:03.606 --> 00:28:08.529
is anxious that you enter into His Kingdom,

00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:11.468
and enjoy the bliss of His truth.

00:28:12.762 --> 00:28:14.748
May God bless you. I would like you

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.735
to ask me questions. But not like the way yesterday it happened.

00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:21.419
People said that,"Mother don't ask to him to ask questions,
because as soon as

00:28:21.509 --> 00:28:25.613
they, you asked them to ask questions,
they start behaving like devils."

00:28:25.727 --> 00:28:28.304
There is no need to be aggressive with Me.

00:28:28.398 --> 00:28:31.529
What is the need? I have come here to give, what is your own.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.942
Why should you be angry with me?
I just don't understand, the psychology.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:41.406
I have not come to take away anything from you.
(Yogi: I think they are outside

00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:45.267
Yogi: They are not in here)
All right. Ask your questions please.

00:28:45.674 --> 00:28:51.543
(Someone is asking a question to Shri Mataji. But it's not clear.)

00:29:05.263 --> 00:29:06.847
What is he say?

00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:10.584
He said, just just a moment, he said that,

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:15.006
as you have said, [INAUDABLE]  universal and

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.070
that it is reality, but everybody is concept
the reality may be different.

00:29:20.211 --> 00:29:22.054
Yes, it is so. I know that.

00:29:22.464 --> 00:29:26.900
It is too, that the concept has to be different, isn't it?

00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:29.935
Has to be different because

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:35.667
everybody has their own brain,
to understand, and thinking to their brain.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.221
But when you become the reality,

00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:42.142
then there is no more concept, this reality is sucked.

00:29:42.964 --> 00:29:48.657
Because you start working through your consciousness,
through your central nerves system.

00:29:48.803 --> 00:29:53.012
It is no more a concept, it becomes the reality itself.

00:29:53.437 --> 00:29:59.246
That's true that it has to be different,
naturally, I understand that.

00:29:59.361 --> 00:30:02.466
I don't mind having them different concept,

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:06.699
but, don’t believe in your concept.
Because it has given no results.

00:30:07.974 --> 00:30:12.476
It has shown no result so far, that's all.

00:30:14.959 --> 00:30:16.959
Yogi: Concept is dissolved.

00:30:16.984 --> 00:30:21.113
Concept is dissolved. Yes that is what's happened,
concept is dissolved. This is the reality.

00:30:21.185 --> 00:30:24.259
For example supposing, I'm not  seeing this

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:27.549
church and some people say that's in a church

00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:31.235
I may have some funny concept about church.
I have not seen it. All right?

00:30:31.335 --> 00:30:37.853
when I come and I see it for myself, and I know this it is so.
I have no concept, I know what it is, it’s like that.

00:30:38.129 --> 00:30:42.838
Simple, very it's common sense,
I tell you, it is really common sense.

00:30:43.051 --> 00:30:46.569
Actually will be shocked how people live in concepts.

00:30:46.847 --> 00:30:50.799
Sometimes i'm really surprised how they are build upon their

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.990
lives after  lives of  falsehood.

00:30:55.093 --> 00:31:00.582
It's a really surprising, but they live
because you see, ego likes the myth.

00:31:00.912 --> 00:31:02.554
It wants to live with myth.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:06.350
Like Hitler believing that they are superior race. Imagine.

00:31:06.634 --> 00:31:11.176
He kill millions and millions of people with that kind
of a myth that he had in his head

00:31:11.295 --> 00:31:16.699
Like so many thinks he is the greatest religious man in that God,
it's going to put him in his throne

00:31:17.652 --> 00:31:22.514
It’s true, you see. You see the effects
of this concepts everywhere.

00:31:25.761 --> 00:31:28.382
The problem is, the concept only

00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:31.628
that's the main problem why we're fighting.

00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:36.147
Now, see. Let one by one, right please.

00:31:36.304 --> 00:31:40.584
Now, who? One this side, one this side.

00:31:45.717 --> 00:31:51.314
"He’s asking you to speak about the love and compassion
of the divine Mother. And her qualities."

00:31:51.433 --> 00:31:54.206
Now, This is embarassing. Isn't it?

00:31:54.885 --> 00:31:57.784
How can a Mother talk about her love?

00:31:58.148 --> 00:32:01.206
You can judging by the Mother Earth.

00:32:01.948 --> 00:32:05.281
Mother Earth has the capacity, who nourishes.

00:32:06.157 --> 00:32:09.168
She has a capacity to soothe us.

00:32:09.474 --> 00:32:13.585
She has a capacity, to sustain all that we do,

00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:15.668
how cruel we have been with her.

00:32:15.824 --> 00:32:20.558
First of all, we commit all kinds of sins, we do all kind of
wrong things on her back.

00:32:21.151 --> 00:32:23.558
Then we extract.

00:32:23.796 --> 00:32:30.065
For our stupid ideas of having all kinds of things of extracting.

00:32:30.418 --> 00:32:33.023
Still, she doesn't say anything.

00:32:33.507 --> 00:32:36.017
She doesn't bother about those things.

00:32:36.312 --> 00:32:39.863
But sometimes if you go to far with her,
then she punishes.

00:32:40.146 --> 00:32:44.184
She does punishes. Like you have earthquakes,
you have  many things like that.

00:32:44.447 --> 00:32:46.879
But she has a very special capacity,

00:32:47.094 --> 00:32:50.510
which is in Sanskrit described as the "Tambara".

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:54.294
Means, by which she creates seasons to please us.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.897
To make us happy. That innocence,

00:32:57.022 --> 00:33:01.275
creation of seasons that she has. You see the flowers,
you see the everything

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:07.454
how she makes a life so beautiful humanes, so joyful.

00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:13.444
That thing is 'pragya' means the knowledge which is enlightened.
When you get that knowledge,

00:33:14.544 --> 00:33:17.340
then you are amazed how [INAUDABLE]  she is.

00:33:17.634 --> 00:33:20.700
How she looks after little, little,

00:33:20.862 --> 00:33:23.623
and how she soothes.

00:33:24.508 --> 00:33:29.549
And I do quite some thimes [INAUDABLE]  how I try to console people.

00:33:29.777 --> 00:33:31.432
In my own symbol.

00:33:31.624 --> 00:33:36.941
One day,there is a very great saint living in a mountain

00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:40.605
who I think, his legs and hands are broken and all disappear

00:33:40.751 --> 00:33:43.666
he lives in a cave, some like a monch.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.512
And, he can not move, so got a tiger so he can move.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:52.261
And I told the people I must see him, he is my son.

00:33:52.347 --> 00:33:56.168
They said " Mother, you don't like these gurus.
Why you want to see him?

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.105
That time, he is real one.

00:33:58.253 --> 00:34:01.360
They said, "How will you ??",
I said, "Feel his vibrations."

00:34:01.487 --> 00:34:05.014
They said "Yes, lot's of vibrations."
I went to see this gentlemen.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:10.652
Now, he is a very evolve personality
and he can control the rain.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:15.996
So when I was going up the hill, it started raining heavily

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.688
and he was very angry with the rain.

00:34:18.802 --> 00:34:22.000
Actually he felt that, "Whats happen, this rain is

00:34:22.113 --> 00:34:24.208
completely drenching my Mother.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.130
She is coming up, and I can't even control this rain.

00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:30.032
What will she think. I sit here and she has to come up to see me."

00:34:30.128 --> 00:34:33.250
Because, he has broken legs and broken hands.

00:34:33.607 --> 00:34:36.439
And when I went to talk to him, He was sitting

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.174
on a little stone and just doing like this, with anger.

00:34:40.456 --> 00:34:42.922
So, I just smiled at him and sat.

00:34:42.978 --> 00:34:49.316
Then he came, he said, "Is it that you control my ego,
who did all this that you make

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:55.111
this place like this. You come to my house
and I can not welcome you properly?"

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.467
I said, "No at all, why you get angry?

00:34:58.581 --> 00:35:01.249
I know you have bought a sari for Me,

00:35:01.421 --> 00:35:06.991
and I don't take a sari from a sanyasi,
becouse I'm [INAUDABLE] , I'm the one who has a household.

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:10.895
Then how will I get a sari
unless and untill this sari is not drenched.?"

00:35:11.012 --> 00:35:14.605
The whole thing become such a sweet thing. Really.

00:35:14.785 --> 00:35:16.878
He forgot his all temper and everything.

00:35:16.992 --> 00:35:19.110
"How do you know Mother, I have a sari for you?"

00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:23.058
"I know you bought a sari for Me,
so I have to change it and how will I change"

00:35:23.128 --> 00:35:27.371
So, the whole thing soothe down and he was normal.
But I said [INAUDABLE] .

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:33.090
I'm permeating, and the whole place must be drenched.
This is, is the joy of loving.

00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:37.621
So, why you should felle bad about it?
And that is how you soothe down.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.059
So, the mothers love is such, that She

00:35:42.184 --> 00:35:44.520
soothes you, she knows your problems,

00:35:44.646 --> 00:35:46.725
she knows that you make mistakes.

00:35:46.904 --> 00:35:49.467
Like, I tell you about Mr. Warren,

00:35:49.553 --> 00:35:53.272
one of his stories. When he ..... he can tell one after another.

00:35:53.342 --> 00:35:57.951
One day, I was in Singapore
and we are going to have a program.

00:35:58.138 --> 00:36:02.186
So, I said, "We go about six o clock.
It's all right becouse I have to see somebody

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.968
Why do you have to go

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:09.670
They said, "No, no, we must go make arrangements
another lady who was organising even very much more worried.

00:36:09.795 --> 00:36:12.642
So, they have decided, we must go to the hall.

00:36:12.743 --> 00:36:17.576
I said, "I'm go out and wait for [INAUDABLE] ."
But they just thought, better go.

00:36:17.735 --> 00:36:19.744
So, they took a

00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:24.825
plane two hours earlier and went to the place of organizing.

00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:33.423
When, I were there, I saw that when my car
reached there, their car also reached there they just came down at that time

00:36:33.564 --> 00:36:35.078
And I knew why it happened,

00:36:35.164 --> 00:36:38.164
I said, "All right come drive a but, they feel very embarrassing"

00:36:38.227 --> 00:36:40.099
Becouse they came with such a

00:36:40.177 --> 00:36:44.794
determination that they have to reach there,
and same time I arrived there.

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:48.763
So, I went draw walk, when I came back

00:36:49.044 --> 00:36:51.654
they said, "Mother we are sorry."

00:36:51.872 --> 00:36:53.155
I said, "What happen?

00:36:53.389 --> 00:36:55.300
They said,"We reached there, all right.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.027
but from the airport to this place,
there was such a bad jam, they have never see.

00:37:00.363 --> 00:37:02.652
So, we thought we better drive through the

00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:06.097
sideway, so we got stucked into the mud.

00:37:06.244 --> 00:37:08.902
Then we start pulling the car out.

00:37:09.003 --> 00:37:12.300
and all our clothes were dirty,
then we had a very bad time.

00:37:12.402 --> 00:37:15.261
And we have arrived, after You have arrived.

00:37:15.502 --> 00:37:16.839
I said, "It's all right."

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:21.331
Now, we never do such a thing Mother,
we should have coming with you. It was a mistake.

00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:23.935
So, like that litle little things

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:26.285
Mother teaches you, how to be

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.560
all right, how to be on the right path.

00:37:28.716 --> 00:37:33.567
But it is never a big pinch, never a big
punishment. Because you are children.

00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:36.846
So, here this life by which
you should advanced

00:37:36.939 --> 00:37:39.235
you should go further, you should be encouraged.

00:37:39.337 --> 00:37:44.877
But if you ego get's pampered, and you think
I am a great Sahaja Yogi. There are many who behaving like that

00:37:45.073 --> 00:37:47.924
And then they have this correction point.

00:37:48.136 --> 00:37:53.713
That's how it works out. And gradually I find,
people come up very sweetly understanding

00:37:53.783 --> 00:37:56.807
that we should not try to

00:37:57.018 --> 00:38:00.784
do things which are no all right.
And we should try to do something

00:38:00.862 --> 00:38:02.932
that is helpful, which is very collective.

00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:06.417
And that's what it is, and it works in a such a beatiful manner

00:38:06.526 --> 00:38:11.885
that you don't have to should to anyone,
or to do anything. Whole thing works out beautifully.

00:38:12.113 --> 00:38:17.100
The blessings are so great like Krishna has said (in Hindi)

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.522
He says, when yoga takes place

00:38:19.921 --> 00:38:23.156
then, "kshema" - that means

00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:26.093
the well-being of a person [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:26.304 --> 00:38:28.210
Even material you are [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:31.306
in so many ways. Is very suprising, is [INAUDABLE] .

00:38:31.697 --> 00:38:37.596
You are helped in material in so many ways. There was a girl,
a little girl about ten years. She wrote to Me,

00:38:37.702 --> 00:38:42.059
But I am dying to see you.
How can I come to India, I have no money to travel

00:38:42.555 --> 00:38:46.516
And she wrote a letter to Me.
I just get the letter and I didn't answered her.

00:38:46.673 --> 00:38:49.069
And eight years later she had a field day

00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:52.543
in her school. So she took a trinket from her house

00:38:52.637 --> 00:38:57.441
just to sell it in the field. So the teachers said,
"This is real gold, how can you sell this here?"

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.301
She couldn't believe.
She went to her mother, she said

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:04.053
This trinket of our house, is real gold.
She couldn't believe either

00:39:04.139 --> 00:39:08.640
So they wen to the goldsmith,
and goldsmith said "Yes, it is."

00:39:08.859 --> 00:39:10.008
It is gold.

00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:18.889
And he valued with the price which he wanted to buy was exactly
the same as they would have to pay for their travel both of them.

00:39:19.623 --> 00:39:22.272
So, it is in such a sweet manner.

00:39:22.581 --> 00:39:26.115
You see, you must know, a loving mother
when you are asleep

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.859
she looks after you.

00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:30.054
When you awake, she looks after you.

00:39:30.187 --> 00:39:34.866
But she doesn't show that you are someting

00:39:35.077 --> 00:39:36.366
more then others,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.898
better then others. She doesn't like
you to have your ego.

00:39:40.008 --> 00:39:41.827
but she wants that you to share.

00:39:42.023 --> 00:39:43.913
Share your love with everyone.

00:39:44.311 --> 00:39:49.293
That's the greates joy for Me
to see when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other.

00:39:49.527 --> 00:39:51.198
When they would, you should see

00:39:51.347 --> 00:39:53.277
How they  meet and

00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:58.080
how they hold each other to themselves.
Just pure love and pure understanding.

00:39:58.158 --> 00:39:59.754
Is the greatest thing to see.

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:01.756
I'm happyyou asked such a nice question

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:07.859
but I feel rather embarassed, because
it is realy so great to enjoy your love from everyone.

00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:09.968
May God bless you.

00:40:11.299 --> 00:40:13.690
Yogi: this fire by Adi Shankara...

00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:24.048
Ah, you must read Adi Shankaracharya to know the love of God,
love of Mother. I mean he was a child, a beautiful child.

00:40:24.397 --> 00:40:28.719
Even Christ has said, "behold the mother".

00:40:29.592 --> 00:40:31.047
Behold the mother.

00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:32.969
It's very significant.

00:40:37.453 --> 00:40:39.148
Is water in this.

00:40:45.773 --> 00:40:48.386
Should have a Realization.

00:40:50.525 --> 00:40:53.275
Yogi: Ok. So we have it now?

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.587
Have I answered your all questions, this side?

00:40:57.953 --> 00:41:01.930
Just on,  All right.

00:41:05.693 --> 00:41:08.131
Loudly please.

00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:09.775
Yogi: loudly!

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:44.442
Yogi: She's refereing to the, how you said

00:41:44.653 --> 00:41:47.294
how you would you recognise Christ you referd to that.

00:41:47.612 --> 00:41:49.708
So she raises the question,

00:41:50.057 --> 00:41:52.903
what is your idea, your theorie

00:41:53.184 --> 00:41:58.167
your concept on Christ, will he be coming on a white horse

00:41:58.442 --> 00:42:00.592
is he going to come and is this going to happen.

00:42:00.705 --> 00:42:04.056
Yes, this is going to happen. No doubt!

00:42:04.378 --> 00:42:06.908
[INAUDABLE]  that's a fact.

00:42:07.197 --> 00:42:11.198
Yes, but that doesn't going to give any [INAUDABLE].

00:42:11.417 --> 00:42:14.214
He's not going to ask you any questions.

00:42:14.464 --> 00:42:16.479
He's not to going to give any answer.

00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:21.377
No realization, nothing. Just [INAUDABLE]

00:42:21.495 --> 00:42:24.266
He has eleven powers of destruction

00:42:24.406 --> 00:42:27.596
is called as ekadesha. Once he arrives

00:42:27.774 --> 00:42:32.159
you will have no place to hide your faces if you are [INAUDABLE]

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.130
[UNCLEAR]  ....right now

00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:37.856
at this moment.

00:42:38.027 --> 00:42:42.949
Otherwise [INAUDABLE]  . Is a fact, no doubt. [INAUDABLE]

00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:48.815
[UNCLEAR]

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:57.013
Becouse that's what you ???
I don't want to ??? It's a fact.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.077
That will be last [INAUDABLE]

00:43:08.645 --> 00:43:11.934
Already he has startet working in us

00:43:12.027 --> 00:43:15.661
All [INAUDABLE]  are also what Krishna has said

00:43:16.146 --> 00:43:22.063
According to Sahaja Yoga there are eleven destroying powers.

00:43:22.143 --> 00:43:27.047
They are here, which we call as ekadesha rudra.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:33.819
And when people get any [INAUDABLE]  disease, all this centers [INAUDABLE] .

00:43:34.497 --> 00:43:39.282
So, the destruciton now [INAUDABLE].

00:43:39.469 --> 00:43:43.686
You did not get [INAUDABLE] .

00:43:49.788 --> 00:43:56.335
Yogi: One more and this is the last. Yes

00:43:57.577 --> 00:44:05.336
a visitor is asking a question, but it is not audible

00:44:22.212 --> 00:44:27.424
Yogi: I'm sorry, I can't...
would you please stand and just say it again.

00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:30.548
Shri Mataji: Make it short.
Yogi: make it briefly.

00:44:35.056 --> 00:44:37.832
Yogi: the idea of [INAUDABLE].

00:44:38.293 --> 00:44:40.792
that one soul [INAUDABLE]  another soul

00:44:41.026 --> 00:44:45.745
Visitor: not clear

00:44:57.602 --> 00:45:01.233
Yogi: I think you have a, another concept about healing

00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:03.056
but let's finalise it

00:45:03.174 --> 00:45:11.163
Yogi: She is talking about a healing process, and
is there any particular way, we should do this.

00:45:11.421 --> 00:45:15.117
No, no. You should never bother about the source

00:45:15.274 --> 00:45:16.426
[INAUDABLE]

00:45:16.575 --> 00:45:22.161
Christ has said that, leave
them alone they have nothing to do with [INAUDABLE]

00:45:22.615 --> 00:45:26.350
Living souls you would say, or death souls?

00:45:26.603 --> 00:45:28.072
Yogi: living

00:45:28.257 --> 00:45:34.747
living. Now the living soul,
they not talk to another soul unless there [INAUDABLE]  spirit.

00:45:35.207 --> 00:45:40.698
At that level you need to speek
to each other on a very different language.

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:43.514
The language is different, the style is different

00:45:43.592 --> 00:45:47.077
and the communication is different.
The whole priority changes.

00:45:47.155 --> 00:45:49.202
You become a different person.

00:45:49.397 --> 00:45:50.694
All right?

00:45:51.366 --> 00:45:57.345
That the egg becomes a bird, and
the birds have a different language among themselves.

00:45:57.525 --> 00:45:59.088
Yogi: That's fine she's happy.

00:45:59.197 --> 00:46:03.361
She's happy about it. All right.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:07.525
All right.
Yogi: Ok, that's it Mother.

00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:11.478
All right, are you all satisfied?

00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:14.916
Now, just one or two more. All right.

00:46:15.164 --> 00:46:17.681
Four, ah that for me...
Yogi: One of the men.

00:46:17.743 --> 00:46:20.613
All right. [INAUDABLE]

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:25.320
Question: What is a death soul?
It just acts as a death soul or living soul?

00:46:25.703 --> 00:46:27.343
What did he say?

00:46:27.976 --> 00:46:31.616
Yogi: What if a death soul is acting like a living soul?

00:46:32.796 --> 00:46:35.936
Oh, it's a very big question my child.

00:46:36.007 --> 00:46:40.499
I'll tell you later on, after the program. All right.
It [INAUDABLE]  my lecture. Doesn't matter.

00:46:40.624 --> 00:46:41.820
[INAUDABLE]

00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:47.282
We are made of [INAUDABLE], all right. And then is
Kundalini within us and also the spirit.

00:46:47.508 --> 00:46:52.150
Now, if a death sould [INAUDABLE]

00:46:52.283 --> 00:46:56.048
What happens, that the earth element [INAUDABLE]

00:46:56.197 --> 00:46:57.946
water element also comes out

00:46:58.103 --> 00:47:00.103
the rest of the trhee element remain

00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:03.527
and the spirit and the Kundalini means top of that.

00:47:03.785 --> 00:47:07.074
And that is the death soul. And the living soul with a person

00:47:07.215 --> 00:47:10.238
which has got the spirit, and thinks that is a soul,

00:47:10.386 --> 00:47:13.075
I don't know [INAUDABLE]

00:47:13.266 --> 00:47:15.895
But [INAUDABLE]  person,

00:47:16.106 --> 00:47:24.209
who is living, has got a spirit, has
got a Kundalini and has got a ....

00:47:24.428 --> 00:47:27.426
Yogi: 5 elements
Shri Mataji: also the, all five elements.

00:47:27.543 --> 00:47:31.660
representing in those centers. But

00:47:32.152 --> 00:47:34.387
when he becomes a realized soul,

00:47:34.465 --> 00:47:37.568
then he is not as a

00:47:37.763 --> 00:47:42.756
living soul.
But he's called as an enlightened soul.

00:47:46.528 --> 00:47:49.909
Visitor is asking a question.

00:48:10.042 --> 00:48:13.786
Yogi: She's peda grow on her own.
She has lot of

00:48:14.255 --> 00:48:19.060
good experiences, but she' also had a lot of pain.
Is an nessesary experience

00:48:19.342 --> 00:48:21.130
that she should have the pain?

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.614
No, not nessesary at all.

00:48:23.755 --> 00:48:25.599
Actually you got some good experiences.

00:48:25.748 --> 00:48:27.474
[INAUDABLE]

00:48:27.662 --> 00:48:32.273
The good experience should not [INAUDABLE]

00:48:32.406 --> 00:48:37.078
Now, what is the experience you get first of all.
You get the coole breeze coming out of your head.

00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:38.609
On the very gross level.

00:48:38.851 --> 00:48:43.000
And out of you head and there should
bee cool breeze you should feel arround.

00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:45.750
Then the second experience we should have is

00:48:45.883 --> 00:48:48.789
that you should be peaceful with yourself.

00:48:48.899 --> 00:48:52.705
Absolutely silent, and there is no problem at all.

00:48:52.923 --> 00:48:57.018
And, if you get any pain. Suposing
after Realization also

00:48:57.182 --> 00:49:00.205
you might be some sort of [INAUDABLE]

00:49:00.314 --> 00:49:03.932
as soon as put your hand there you can get rid of that pain.

00:49:04.182 --> 00:49:09.174
So, it is the experience that you have had,
should be an experience [INAUDABLE]

00:49:09.627 --> 00:49:13.057
And, if it a person who has given you realization,

00:49:13.198 --> 00:49:16.158
you [INAUDABLE]

00:49:16.556 --> 00:49:18.869
You see, this is a [INAUDABLE]

00:49:19.134 --> 00:49:23.128
the guru that give you realization,
that makes you an expert.

00:49:24.472 --> 00:49:26.472
Visitor talks, bu it's not clear.

00:49:31.089 --> 00:49:35.074
[INAUDABLE]

00:49:35.277 --> 00:49:39.230
Yogi: She wasn't just refering to phycical pain,
she was refering to

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:42.784
pain in face up to life and so.

00:49:43.401 --> 00:49:45.081
Be in what?

00:49:45.378 --> 00:49:48.488
Yogi: pain in facing up to life's problems and wider

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.620
meaning of her pain.
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.284
That must stop, that must stop completely.

00:49:54.604 --> 00:49:57.300
Becouse you start to see the whole thing

00:49:57.956 --> 00:50:03.644
as a drama. You are so detached see the
whole thing. You solve the problem.

00:50:03.808 --> 00:50:05.583
You see the things,

00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:08.086
if you become,

00:50:08.446 --> 00:50:11.649
the spectator of the whole drama,

00:50:12.149 --> 00:50:14.914
and you know that you can cure

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.414
you don't feel the pain. You get [INAUDABLE]

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:23.618
All rigth? May god bless you!
Yogi: Ok, let's have it.

00:50:23.946 --> 00:50:28.634
All right. One more [INAUDABLE]

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.641
What is it?

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:40.573
Visitor is asking: I have two questions, actually.
What is your feeling [INAUDABLE]

00:50:40.918 --> 00:50:45.596
Yogi: What is the base of cause of disease?

00:50:46.338 --> 00:50:48.338
Is inbalance.

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:52.648
Tomorrow I'm going to thell you all about. Is inbalances.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.163
Yogi: Second.
Shri Mataji: Second one?

00:50:56.506 --> 00:50:59.265
Visitor...

00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:01.313
I'm not [INAUDABLE]

00:51:01.509 --> 00:51:05.188
If that is Shri Sai Nath. He gives it perfectly all right

00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:09.870
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:10.464 --> 00:51:15.393
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:16.565 --> 00:51:18.294
[INAUDABLE]

00:51:18.755 --> 00:51:21.091
Yogi: Can you speek about carma?

00:51:21.318 --> 00:51:23.887
Ah. The carma a [INAUDABLE]  thing.

00:51:24.067 --> 00:51:27.786
but actually, what you do [INAUDABLE]

00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:31.786
is activated with you ego.

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:35.223
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:51:35.621 --> 00:51:36.841
when She

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:39.130
passes through this center

00:51:39.489 --> 00:51:43.231
that is sucked in. That's why it has said, Christ

00:51:43.449 --> 00:51:45.419
forgive us [INAUDABLE]

00:51:45.817 --> 00:51:50.278
since he's taking our work, he died for our sin.

00:51:50.559 --> 00:51:53.233
In the sense that carma is sucked by Him.

00:51:53.624 --> 00:51:54.726
And we

00:51:54.991 --> 00:51:57.312
are left without an ego,

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.640
and it is only the ego that has [INAUDABLE]

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:05.655
Once the ego is sucked in there is no carma left.

00:52:09.374 --> 00:52:11.374
[INAUDABLE]

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:14.460
All rigth.

00:52:14.912 --> 00:52:18.804
Now, let's ask one more question,
all right? They are anxious

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.711
to have we the experience.

00:52:20.945 --> 00:52:23.931
Please ask. One question more.

00:52:24.555 --> 00:52:27.150
Visitor: You mean we create karma?

00:52:27.884 --> 00:52:30.291
Yogi: Do you mean that, do we create karma?

00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:31.634
Yes, we do!

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.861
Where we do action,

00:52:34.009 --> 00:52:35.009
you see,

00:52:35.158 --> 00:52:40.037
karma is only the myth that human beings have. Animals don't have.

00:52:40.349 --> 00:52:43.030
They don't have this problem. The problem is

00:52:43.186 --> 00:52:46.811
when ego [INAUDABLE]  of you head,

00:52:46.936 --> 00:52:49.037
then we develope a personality.

00:52:49.155 --> 00:52:53.022
Which is I. I'm Mr. so, I'm Mrs.

00:52:53.241 --> 00:52:54.944
The I ness we develope.

00:52:55.170 --> 00:53:00.037
When we develope I'ness,
we think that we are uniques. This is a big [INAUDABLE]

00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:02.334
Like a, I give a

00:53:02.428 --> 00:53:05.756
an expample from the villagers [INAUDABLE]

00:53:05.866 --> 00:53:08.373
that you don't have to take to much luggage

00:53:08.537 --> 00:53:09.983
on an aeroplane.

00:53:10.351 --> 00:53:13.063
So, they sat in the aeroplane

00:53:13.173 --> 00:53:15.508
and they put all their luggage on their heads.

00:53:15.633 --> 00:53:18.203
and the said, "Now we should lessing the weight.

00:53:18.311 --> 00:53:22.651
of the aeroplane. It is something like that with our karma.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:26.269
That we take the responsibility of doing the work.

00:53:26.465 --> 00:53:29.924
Why we [INAUDABLE]  , you see [INAUDABLE]

00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:31.189
Is all there.

00:53:31.431 --> 00:53:34.869
[INAUDABLE]  said, so we mak them ???. All right.

00:53:35.049 --> 00:53:38.330
Death from the death to the death. That's all we do.

00:53:38.604 --> 00:53:40.338
We make [INAUDABLE]

00:53:40.783 --> 00:53:42.783
We make this, we make that

00:53:42.884 --> 00:53:46.533
and then we start using matter for our comfort.

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:49.971
And then, matter sits on our head. We can't get rid of it.

00:53:50.487 --> 00:53:53.627
Our spirit is supressed becouse of the matter.

00:53:53.955 --> 00:53:55.642
And then we have to

00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:58.760
use the matter, otherwise we just can't exsist.

00:53:59.174 --> 00:54:02.619
So, what we are doing is, we are creating death after death.

00:54:02.979 --> 00:54:05.744
But, not the scenery we [INAUDABLE]

00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:09.549
We can not transform one flower to a fruit. Can we?

00:54:09.823 --> 00:54:11.064
We can not do it!

00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:16.860
So, what ever is done is done by
God Allmighty, By His living powers.

00:54:17.266 --> 00:54:23.719
Whatever being is all there [INAUDABLE]

00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:30.619
Yogi: Ok. Let's everyone slip their shoes off.

00:54:31.033 --> 00:54:33.666
So, let's us do make the better contact with the Earth.

00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:36.682
Shri Mataji: What is ....?
yogi: and put your hands up.

00:54:38.768 --> 00:54:41.963
Yogi: So, they recording?

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:47.510
Yogi: Be comfortable, sit with your hands on your lap.

00:54:49.573 --> 00:54:54.492
When Shri Mataji asks, just close the eyes.

00:54:58.029 --> 00:55:04.404
Speaking every day....

00:55:04.943 --> 00:55:08.906
Yogi: All that you do at this stages, be hungry for it!

00:55:09.258 --> 00:55:11.578
And do ask hungry for it in you heart.

00:55:11.805 --> 00:55:15.031
Please Mother, give me my realization!

00:55:15.305 --> 00:55:19.554
Becouse you have to desire it.
And that's where She can not cross your freedom.

00:55:19.812 --> 00:55:23.307
If you don't want it, then as She says you are free to go.

00:55:23.604 --> 00:55:24.846
But if you wanted

00:55:24.995 --> 00:55:27.689
put your hands up and ask humbly in your heart

00:55:27.868 --> 00:55:30.486
"Please Mother, give me my realization".

00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:32.931
We have to humble us all down.

00:55:33.252 --> 00:55:38.334
Now, we have to put our hands just like this.

00:55:39.334 --> 00:55:41.870
Yesterday I told you, day before,

00:55:41.995 --> 00:55:48.382
that left hand presents, our desire
and the right hand our action.

00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:54.512
So we have to [INAUDABLE]  put it in you lap,

00:55:54.645 --> 00:55:57.098
like this. With your finger stretched,

00:55:57.215 --> 00:56:00.192
and sit comfortable. That's very important to sit comfortable.

00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:02.780
[INAUDABLE]

00:56:02.937 --> 00:56:06.405
Shoes go back, ounder the chair,

00:56:06.538 --> 00:56:08.928
and put your feet straight. Like this.

00:56:09.108 --> 00:56:12.920
On the ground, not teaching each other.

00:56:16.154 --> 00:56:18.383
Put the left hand on your lap,

00:56:19.545 --> 00:56:21.180
and the right hand

00:56:21.438 --> 00:56:25.297
[INAUDABLE]  put the both of your hands on your lap.

00:56:25.695 --> 00:56:27.524
And now, close your eyes.

00:56:27.954 --> 00:56:31.399
Now, don't open you eyes till I tell you.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.680
Becouse Kundalini want rise

00:56:34.117 --> 00:56:37.828
[INAUDABLE]  something has to happen within.

00:56:38.023 --> 00:56:40.594
So, just keep your eyes

00:56:41.165 --> 00:56:42.774
completely closed

00:56:42.978 --> 00:56:44.978
till I tell you.

00:56:47.392 --> 00:56:49.766
Now, put your right hand

00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:54.617
on your heart.

00:56:54.914 --> 00:56:58.110
on the lefhand side and press it.

00:56:59.298 --> 00:57:01.656
Now, you are the Spirit,

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.117
and the Spirit resides in your heart.

00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:08.120
So, you have to just ask a questions three times.

00:57:08.784 --> 00:57:11.667
Mother, am I the spirit?

00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:13.831
Just ask, in a humble way,

00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:15.831
and full confidence.

00:57:15.979 --> 00:57:19.253
Mother, am I the spirit?

00:57:23.135 --> 00:57:28.268
Please don't feel guilty. That is one thing
I'm requesting, not to feel guilty at this moment.

00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:32.448
Forget the past, just forget the past.

00:57:55.694 --> 00:57:59.034
Now, keep the right and, left hand as it is

00:57:59.198 --> 00:58:00.846
bring the left hand down.

00:58:00.956 --> 00:58:03.691
on you stomach, on the lefthand side.

00:58:03.769 --> 00:58:08.488
to the center which is of the Primordial master.

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.371
right hand sorry, left hand towards Me

00:58:11.489 --> 00:58:15.433
left hand. Sorry I made a mistake, left hand towards Me.

00:58:17.058 --> 00:58:20.550
And right hand the stomach and press it hard.

00:58:20.753 --> 00:58:24.410
Press it hard on your lefthand side of your stomach.

00:58:24.817 --> 00:58:28.777
Put the right hand on the lefthand side of the stomach.

00:58:30.198 --> 00:58:36.338
At this point, you have to say with full confidence

00:58:36.769 --> 00:58:40.441
Mother, I'm my own guide.

00:58:40.738 --> 00:58:43.386
Mother, I'm my own guru.

00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:46.722
Mother, I'm my own master.

00:58:47.745 --> 00:58:49.745
With full confidence.

00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:55.291
Try to sit comfortably.

00:59:09.287 --> 00:59:12.785
Now, this has to be said ten times.

00:59:12.965 --> 00:59:17.378
Because we have ten benances.
Human beings have to ten benances.

00:59:17.503 --> 00:59:19.902
So, we have to say ten times.

00:59:37.478 --> 00:59:41.528
Now, please put your right hand again to nurish,

00:59:42.145 --> 00:59:44.145
on your heart.

00:59:46.277 --> 00:59:48.988
Here you now assert

00:59:49.168 --> 00:59:53.066
by saying "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:59:55.668 --> 00:59:58.136
Please say, twelve times.

00:59:59.761 --> 01:00:04.230
To assert, without feeling guilty. Without feeling guilty.

01:00:04.387 --> 01:00:07.873
Without feeling guilty, you must assert

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:10.732
and

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:15.096
Mother, I am the spirit.

01:00:29.047 --> 01:00:31.047
Twelve times, please.

01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:40.992
Please don't feel guilty.

01:00:41.265 --> 01:00:44.195
Next thing could be to put your right hand on the

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.195
base of your neck, on your shoulder on the lefthand side.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:49.757
Right hand.

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:54.515
From front, on the left hand side.

01:00:55.933 --> 01:01:03.321
Here, you hold it tight. From the front you take your hand [INAUDABLE].

01:01:04.466 --> 01:01:08.640
And hold it tight. Here we say "Mother,

01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:14.933
I'm not guilty, please say sixteen times, please say it.

01:01:17.338 --> 01:01:21.074
It's too much...

01:01:28.683 --> 01:01:31.102
Please say it with

01:01:31.248 --> 01:01:36.161
all your understanding that, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

01:02:14.582 --> 01:02:20.335
Now, put your right hand across your forehead.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.669
Across your forehead at this one you have to say,

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.217
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:34.811
Please say "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:49.542
It is very easy to say, just say and it will workout.

01:02:55.268 --> 01:03:01.051
Now, put your right hand
on the back of your head. Hold it tight.

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.456
If the know the optic loop, where it is placed,

01:03:04.642 --> 01:03:06.713
on the back of your head.

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:13.889
At this point, you have to now say
without feeling guilty, you have to say

01:03:13.974 --> 01:03:18.419
that is, If I have done any mistakes,
"Oh Lord please forgive me", that's all.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:22.279
But don't feel guilty.
Please don't feel guilty, don't count them,

01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:26.007
just say that "Please forgive me."

01:03:26.843 --> 01:03:29.828
From your heart.

01:04:23.201 --> 01:04:26.619
Now, put your hand on the top of your head.

01:04:26.734 --> 01:04:30.734
Put it just on top, your hand your palm should touch

01:04:30.845 --> 01:04:36.492
the fontanel bone area,
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:40.806
And press it, and try to move it clockwise.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.209
Now, at this point as a said,
I cannot cross your freedom and

01:04:46.525 --> 01:04:51.908
you have to ask for your realisation, otherwise I cannot force it.

01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:54.554
Then just say seven times

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.128
Mother, I want my realisation.
Please give me realisation.

01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:02.094
Seven time.

01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:13.548
Shri Mataji blows...

01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:57.731
Now, raise your hand and seek if there is a cool breeze coming in.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.873
Now, change your hand please.

01:06:17.992 --> 01:06:21.732
Put your right hand down,
and the left hand on top of your head.

01:06:21.804 --> 01:06:24.656
And now see, [INAUDABLE] .

01:06:56.242 --> 01:06:58.455
You got it, most of you.

01:06:59.124 --> 01:07:01.536
All can raise both your hands.

01:07:01.868 --> 01:07:07.772
On top of your head,
open your eyes. Please take m higer, higher.

01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:11.477
And now ask a question, in your heart.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.725
Is this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:16.688
Is this the Brahmachaitanya?

01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:22.914
Is this the call pervading power of love of God's all living work?

01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:40.744
Now feel it yourself.

01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:49.467
Those who are proper on second time, must have definitely felt it.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.671
But I tell you today what is
to done tonight and work it out would be better.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:58.287
You may get a photograph [INAUDABLE].

01:07:58.497 --> 01:08:02.897
In the beginning, is better to use my
photograph because it has got vibrations.

01:08:03.007 --> 01:08:09.570
Now what you can do is the put a candle in front of the photograph, and you can see the vibrations are coming from the photograph.

01:08:09.642 --> 01:08:13.253
Now, put the left hand towards photograph
and the right hand like this, just now you can do it

01:08:13.305 --> 01:08:15.884
put the left hand towards me at the right hand like this.

01:08:16.033 --> 01:08:18.627
Now this is the balance. This is the balance [INAUDABLE]

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.665
Put left hand towards Me, and right hand out like this at the back.

01:08:22.776 --> 01:08:25.355
You see like this so we are [INAUDABLE]

01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:29.075
All right. Now see on the left hand if it is coming.

01:08:36.768 --> 01:08:40.077
You're all thoughtless, if you see that.

01:08:42.498 --> 01:08:47.196
Now, you put your right hand towards Me and your left hand up.

01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:51.834
Heart.

01:08:53.537 --> 01:08:55.918
You have to believe that you are the spirit.

01:08:56.039 --> 01:08:57.463
that's all we believe,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.072
Your believe in yourself. Tthat's all we have to believe in

01:09:01.589 --> 01:09:04.144
that you are the spirit.

01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:10.786
Good?

01:09:12.267 --> 01:09:17.801
All right. Then I teach you how to raise
your Kundalini tonight when you go home.

01:09:18.106 --> 01:09:20.931
So this is what you can do on the photograph

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:23.553
and you can see that it starts moving

01:09:23.741 --> 01:09:28.384
from both your hands. At the most of very much, sort of intention

01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:32.096
and If you are very sick, then you can take a

01:09:32.597 --> 01:09:37.099
little bowl of water with little salt in it, and put your feet in

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:41.561
that bowl and take the vibrations from the photograph.

01:09:41.763 --> 01:09:46.652
But if you feel cool breeze in your hand and
cool breeze moving in this hand. Then everything is perfect.

01:09:46.793 --> 01:09:49.023
Now you have to learn, tomorrow I'll tell you

01:09:49.204 --> 01:09:53.367
what it means how to use it,
how to become a master. Is a simple thing.

01:09:53.579 --> 01:09:57.500
Now today, I teach you how to raise
your own your Kundalini . Which is your own.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.234
Now put your left hand in front of the Kundalini, here.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.650
All of you sitting down.
Can you see me? Put your left hand like this.

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:09.484
Just like this in front. Like this in front. This hand like this.

01:10:10.214 --> 01:10:11.983
The right hand has to be moved

01:10:12.195 --> 01:10:16.565
up, front, down, back. Like that clockwise.

01:10:16.861 --> 01:10:21.008
We have to raise. Now, let us raise our Kundalini. Start it moving,

01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:24.861
slowly, like this, like this, like this.

01:10:25.111 --> 01:10:31.247
Throw your hands up, absolutely lose and then give it a twist.

01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:35.356
Throw your head back, and now give it a knot.

01:10:36.368 --> 01:10:39.931
That's one, we have to do it trice. Again let's do it!

01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:44.145
Hold the hand in front and start moving it.

01:10:49.565 --> 01:10:52.596
Take it up through your hands and

01:10:52.712 --> 01:10:55.441
just give it a twist and here it is.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.767
Third time we have to give give three twist.

01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:02.105
You can do it at home.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:07.516
Throw  back your hands

01:11:07.759 --> 01:11:11.679
head and hands loose, and give it one,

01:11:12.556 --> 01:11:14.817
then the second one,

01:11:15.623 --> 01:11:20.916
and then the third one like this. Now see if you ???

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.541
Now, that's one thing more one must learn, how to give

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:40.011
protection to your aura? That is very important!

01:11:40.269 --> 01:11:42.371
Protection to your aura, I wish

01:11:42.517 --> 01:11:45.945
people knew how to do it,
they would have saved themselves in many troubles.

01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:49.131
Iis to put your left hand like this.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.198
And with the right hand you move it

01:11:52.404 --> 01:11:56.268
Like this, from here. Move it, one

01:11:57.943 --> 01:12:01.522
Go back. Two.

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:08.400
Is Three,

01:12:10.812 --> 01:12:12.636
Four

01:12:16.245 --> 01:12:18.395
Five

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:21.752
Six

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.169
Seven

01:12:27.655 --> 01:12:34.102
This is how you give protection to yourself. Now, see you vibrations.

01:12:37.129 --> 01:12:39.002
All right? Is better.

01:12:39.248 --> 01:12:42.660
Now, what happens that when you are judging other’s vibrations,

01:12:42.794 --> 01:12:47.183
you can just start judging like this,
it's all right. Or giving bandage like this.

01:12:47.342 --> 01:12:49.839
bandage of love. Because it is felt your hands

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.575
when you move your hands actually

01:12:51.737 --> 01:12:54.673
the powers is flowing to, through your hands [INAUDABLE].

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:56.397
So watch your manouvering

01:12:56.544 --> 01:13:00.242
So you give it a bandhan, like you have a [INAUDABLE].

01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.673
like that to him, and then sit the vibrations.

01:13:02.835 --> 01:13:05.136
Now, if you want to see your own vibrations

01:13:05.289 --> 01:13:09.629
you give yourself a bandhan like
this, and then see your own rubbish.

01:13:11.759 --> 01:13:16.917
You try tonight. Don’t talk too much
about it, don't argue. You are beyond mind.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:19.192
And that’s why I don’t argue about it.

01:13:19.497 --> 01:13:21.949
The becoming is the most important part

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:24.698
that it is the difficult part of Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:27.095
It is like no other thing that

01:13:27.187 --> 01:13:31.234
here, unless and until become it is of no use. You have to become

01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:38.021
then you have to grow, then you
have to become the expert, ultimately the master.

01:13:38.452 --> 01:13:41.300
That’s what it is. And for whrich you can not pay.

01:13:41.527 --> 01:13:43.347
May God bless you.

01:13:48.556 --> 01:13:53.715
Yogi: [INAUDABLE]  Tomorrow night program is here.

01:13:54.449 --> 01:13:55.980

01:13:56.099 --> 01:13:59.066

Please give your address and telephone
number. We’ll contact you to let you know the followup meetings.

01:14:05.422 --> 01:14:10.908

01:14:11.787 --> 01:14:17.915
We’ll see you tomorrow night. Good evening.

01:14:30.492 --> 01:14:38.031
Those who want to meet Shri Mataji tomorrow evening,
She will spare a few minutes to meet you all. Tonight

01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:41.597
She’s just come back from San Diego, and rather tired.

01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:43.825
So, tomorrow evening it will be a good chance.

01:14:43.992 --> 01:14:48.472
She’ll spend some time with you all here after the program.

01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:51.384
Yogini: [INAUDABLE]  Shri Mataji some tea?

01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:54.525
Yogi: No, no let's go.

01:14:55.009 --> 01:14:56.689
How are you?

01:14:56.954 --> 01:15:03.542
Shri Mataji: Lookin fine.
"I assume so." [INAUDABLE]

01:15:20.264 --> 01:15:26.137
Someone: It's shameful what She said.
Yogi: We will do something. Thank you very much.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.771
Anybody going to the seminar at the weekend?

01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:49.787
Would you be kind enough to just have
a word with Brian Bell, who’s standing here with his hand up.

01:15:49.973 --> 01:15:53.809
Because you may be able to help
with transport arrangements for other people.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:55.054
It’s a long way

01:15:55.155 --> 01:16:00.221
Brian will deal with those people
going to the seminar, who may be able to help with transport.
