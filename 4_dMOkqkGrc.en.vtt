00:17.942 --> 00:23.624
I bow all the  seekers of spirit.

00:25.839 --> 00:31.499
The seeking of spirit has been described

00:31.751 --> 00:34.515
by so many people from ancient times.

00:34.859 --> 00:37.808
It is nothing new that I’m telling you

00:38.002 --> 00:42.178
that a human awareness reaches a point

00:42.337 --> 00:47.462
where it starts seeing that there has to be something beyond

00:47.621 --> 00:50.580
and at that time  the seeking starts.

00:50.682 --> 00:54.179
And the person starts looking forward to  something

00:54.576 --> 00:57.649
that will make that person the spirit,

00:57.877 --> 01:03.815
as all this scriptures have described and talked about it.

01:04.548 --> 01:09.333
There is no amount of talking is going to improve on that

01:09.486 --> 01:14.592
because, spirit is within us it resides within us in our heart .

01:14.853 --> 01:19.148
Now as it is you must have heard many people talking about it

01:19.251 --> 01:23.748
that you have to be spirit that

01:23.998 --> 01:29.853
you have to get your self realization,
you have to  have self knowledge you have to know yourself

01:30.148 --> 01:35.123
but in Sahaja Yoga today what one has to do is to establish that

01:35.236 --> 01:39.368
to actualize that make it an experience of your own

01:39.509 --> 01:43.368
and this is a very big gift I think a very unique discovery

01:43.516 --> 01:46.974
that has come to us that we can actualize.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.639
Now  we have to understand one simple think

01:49.776 --> 01:52.485
that when this spirit manifest within us,

01:52.604 --> 01:56.900
what should happen on the very gross level what should happen.

01:57.094 --> 01:59.823
Firstly it must be invigorated,

01:59.960 --> 02:03.210
means you must get more energy in the body,

02:03.323 --> 02:06.480
You must feel physical limit.

02:06.651 --> 02:12.045
By going to any process or any method or any experience

02:12.159 --> 02:16.777
if health wise if you cannot improve then must know that it is not the spirit.

02:16.902 --> 02:20.678
Because spirit is complete health,

02:20.746 --> 02:24.217
or it never get sick, that is what Spirit is.

02:24.331 --> 02:27.609
So first thing that should happen to you, is that

02:27.671 --> 02:31.917
it should  be an invigorating life a very dynamic life.

02:32.020 --> 02:36.575
Second thing that should happen to you is, that you become a very peaceful

02:36.700 --> 02:40.684
and a relax personality, not like the ones who were agitated

02:40.775 --> 02:42.904
and very angry and shout.

02:43.023 --> 02:48.165
There is nothing to shout and get angry its a kind of a fear this people have perhaps

02:48.267 --> 02:52.255
that if the truth they face, or the reality that comes

02:52.380 --> 02:54.104
they will have no place in this world.

02:54.184 --> 02:58.259
That might be one of the reasons which makes them agitated.

02:58.373 --> 03:01.513
A person  like Christ, about who people talk

03:01.661 --> 03:05.740
and think that the Christ was, is in their pocket.

03:05.831 --> 03:09.425
You must know that first and foremost thing the greatness of Christ

03:09.513 --> 03:14.037
was that, He used a weapon of forgiveness.

03:14.185 --> 03:17.209
He was such a peaceful person, on the cross also

03:17.391 --> 03:20.256
that He said that forgive those

03:20.381 --> 03:24.841
who are doing this O Father,
because they do not know what they are doing.

03:24.944 --> 03:30.016
That kind of a personality, you can say is a spiritual personality.

03:30.141 --> 03:34.208
and not a person who gets agitated and hot tempered

03:34.288 --> 03:36.149
and start shouting at people.

03:36.300 --> 03:41.126
The time today is extremely precarious, which we do not realize.

03:41.217 --> 03:45.220
For example, if you ask these people if Christ comes and stands here

03:45.297 --> 03:47.428
how will they recognize Christ?

03:47.531 --> 03:50.453
Is there any way of recognizing Christ?

03:50.552 --> 03:56.106
They might be those who crucified Christ,
because they did not recognize at that time.

03:56.359 --> 03:59.246
How we will recognize Christ, is a very simple question.

03:59.315 --> 04:01.208
which we never try to answer.

04:01.322 --> 04:05.940
There’s no way to understand how we are going to recognize Christ.

04:06.168 --> 04:12.388
A very very simple question has no answer because you can't.

04:12.672 --> 04:14.226
You cannot recognize Him.

04:14.464 --> 04:17.854
Because your awareness cannot make you understand.

04:17.957 --> 04:21.858
Like somebody told me that there’s somebody who claims that he is Christ.

04:21.960 --> 04:25.748
I said all right, ask him to  walk on the water.

04:26.485 --> 04:31.946
If he can walk on the water then think that is Christ.
That's one of the qualities of Christ

04:32.756 --> 04:38.430
Now, whatever is the quality of a particular advent
is to be seen in that advent.

04:38.589 --> 04:42.059
Every advent has a particular quality

04:42.113 --> 04:46.161
which is being already described in the ancient books.

04:46.385 --> 04:50.191
You should not accept anybody
because he says I'm this  and I'm that.

04:50.351 --> 04:53.715
This is the problem with us, that we get ourselves value,

04:53.897 --> 04:56.539
to some sort of mental conception live with  it,

04:56.637 --> 04:59.698
our forefathers lived with it, their forefathers have lived with it

04:59.753 --> 05:02.973
and ultimately we find there is nothing left.

05:03.893 --> 05:07.627
So one has to know that when you,

05:07.740 --> 05:11.441
at least when you say that you believe in Christ,

05:11.521 --> 05:14.389
how will you recognise if Christ comes.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.034
Is there any matter?

05:16.125 --> 05:19.753
Is there any shown matter that will tell you that He is Christ?

05:19.989 --> 05:20.989
There is!

05:21.175 --> 05:24.396
You should become the spirit. You have vibrations.

05:24.555 --> 05:25.663
You feel coolness.

05:25.732 --> 05:29.150
You have a new awareness a vibrated awareness, the fifth dimension

05:29.218 --> 05:34.377
within you rises into that point  by which, when you ask,

05:34.899 --> 05:36.710
"Is this Christ?"

05:36.926 --> 05:41.712
The vibrations will flow, tremendously.

05:42.449 --> 05:44.444
You will know, this is Christ.

05:44.535 --> 05:48.489
If he is  a fake person, you might even get blisters in your cap,

05:48.637 --> 05:52.083
you might even get terrible heat from such a person.

05:52.232 --> 05:57.184
But if it is Christ, you'll get tremendous breeze in your hand.

05:57.627 --> 06:02.194
This is the sign how to make out whether he is Christ or not.

06:02.467 --> 06:05.998
That’s why he said that you will be calling me Christ, Christ

06:06.109 --> 06:11.152
I won’t recognize you, neither you will recognize Him.
That's a fact.

06:11.265 --> 06:14.033
You live with an idea with a mental projection

06:14.244 --> 06:18.115
and then you came all your

06:18.717 --> 06:22.859
possibilities, chances of your ascent.

06:23.108 --> 06:26.581
You must keep yourself open like a scientist  does,

06:26.661 --> 06:30.198
keep yourself open. Your mind should be open.

06:30.298 --> 06:33.163
You should not close down by any dogma

06:33.266 --> 06:37.083
or any time off such theory that makes you

06:37.185 --> 06:43.124
completely excluded from the rest of the thing,

06:43.215 --> 06:46.329
or which makes you non reflect,

06:46.421 --> 06:49.777
which makes you a person who cannot reflect,

06:49.936 --> 06:53.773
cannot think anymore about.

06:54.106 --> 07:00.215
Such a personality who developed,
which is going to be very, very dangerous for you.

07:00.476 --> 07:04.320
So the personality should be open,

07:04.989 --> 07:09.484
should be receptive you understand.

07:09.566 --> 07:13.589
Now, as I told you yesterday back it is a spontaneous happening

07:13.654 --> 07:17.222
is the happening off the living process within you.

07:17.375 --> 07:20.227
It is nothing to do with artifical things.

07:20.490 --> 07:24.671
Of course in the churches were established
they try to be good to people in the sense

07:24.751 --> 07:28.111
they told them that to be in the balance
you keep the balance another

07:28.173 --> 07:32.444
but it went too far with certain things like baptism, I think

07:32.535 --> 07:35.657
that where they everybody started putting their hands

07:35.703 --> 07:39.917
on top of anyone I'm said that your baptised

07:40.485 --> 07:42.541
that's not proper

07:42.621 --> 07:45.935
but you call [....Hindi] means it is unauthorized.

07:46.088 --> 07:49.183
To baptize someone is not the authority

07:49.272 --> 07:55.154
that you can get from any school colleges
but you have to get it from God.

07:55.301 --> 07:58.730
If you are a realized soul then you can baptize others.

07:58.855 --> 08:01.554
Everybody cannot baptize, everyone.

08:01.671 --> 08:07.050
Even, I don't think Christ disciples baptize anyone, they did not.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.003
It is later on, I don't know how it croul

08:10.172 --> 08:15.530
into the organization, that you could ask somebody
to go and baptize someone.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.514
William Blake has clearly said,

08:17.649 --> 08:22.195
that the priest cursed me on my head and I cried and wept.

08:22.367 --> 08:25.539
Actually, that person who has to baptize,

08:25.619 --> 08:27.443
has to be realized soul

08:27.535 --> 08:30.374
because, baptism means awakening of the Kundalini

08:30.486 --> 08:34.179
and breaking up this fontanel bone area

08:34.285 --> 08:39.925
open to the subtle and that
you cannot do it, so you better not do it.

08:40.050 --> 08:41.702
You are unauthorized.

08:42.043 --> 08:48.690
in all humbleness and humility one
must understand that that is not your job.

08:51.237 --> 08:54.959
Say for example, I do not know anything about the machinery,

08:55.085 --> 08:57.084
or about a car

08:57.210 --> 08:59.670
I start driving, what will happen?

08:59.816 --> 09:03.876
But same thing happens with people who do not have the authority

09:03.979 --> 09:06.746
to do God's work, start doing God's work.

09:06.849 --> 09:11.426
they lang everybody into difficulties,
and ultimately they neutralize themselves.

09:11.619 --> 09:14.417
It is high time for all of them now to see,

09:14.542 --> 09:19.519
that what they have to do, all these institutions, is no dogma

09:19.656 --> 09:22.377
nothing like that, but what you have to do

09:22.491 --> 09:26.634
is to transform people through their Kundalini awakening.

09:26.748 --> 09:29.738
through their real baptism.

09:31.107 --> 09:33.352
This is what people have realized

09:33.409 --> 09:37.593
that there’s something wrong somewhere
that we are not connected to the mains.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.769
When it happens, the first thing that happens to you

09:40.904 --> 09:43.392
that you become collectively conscious as

09:43.472 --> 09:45.634
Warren has told.

09:45.736 --> 09:48.322
this collectively consciousness is nothing but

09:48.390 --> 09:52.162
that your attention itself, your attention which is felt

09:52.270 --> 09:55.622
on the central nervous system gets enlightened.

09:56.270 --> 10:00.832
in the sense that as like ether, when you touch ether

10:00.959 --> 10:05.247
you can communicate anything from here to every place.

10:05.497 --> 10:11.489
In the same way, when you touch that All Pervading Power

10:11.696 --> 10:15.186
you can communicate through that power,

10:15.447 --> 10:20.232
anywhere sitting down, it is collectively conscious.

10:20.702 --> 10:25.596
Moreover collectively conscious means that, you can feel a person

10:25.711 --> 10:28.250
whether he is the person he is

10:28.417 --> 10:32.171
allright or he has a problem or his...

10:32.296 --> 10:35.916
Kundalini is in this part of the body or

10:36.019 --> 10:38.252
if he has got some disease,

10:38.332 --> 10:40.517
you can feel also about yourself.

10:40.609 --> 10:42.071
That’s the sign of light,

10:42.184 --> 10:45.279
that you automatically feel how the person is.

10:45.462 --> 10:47.533
You may not of [INAUDABLE] a meeting

10:47.644 --> 10:51.423
say it loudly or you may not try to inform the person

10:51.501 --> 10:56.242
the other lady came to me and she was,
she was having cancer no doubt.

10:56.713 --> 11:00.825
But I didn't tell him, I tried and I think now she is cured.

11:01.054 --> 11:03.016
So, you don’t have to tell a person

11:03.096 --> 11:05.442
because you don’t have to achieve anything by telling,

11:05.486 --> 11:08.273
what you have to do is to achieve if she can be all right

11:08.356 --> 11:10.075
if you can give them realization.

11:10.269 --> 11:13.394
But your attitude is not to cure people.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.413
That's not the attitude of the Divine.

11:15.515 --> 11:17.194
Because it has got common sense.

11:17.330 --> 11:21.245
If you know that a certain car is going to be a junk forever,

11:21.318 --> 11:25.132
it is of no use, you don’t repair such cars.

11:25.563 --> 11:29.589
So, despite the affection and compassion you have for everyone,

11:29.725 --> 11:33.237
you want to see that by giving realization to this man

11:33.328 --> 11:36.477
who is absolutely good for nothing and all that

11:36.568 --> 11:41.277
you are just doing, throwing pearls before him.

11:42.128 --> 11:45.859
So you don’t even want to talk to such a man about realization,

11:45.954 --> 11:47.666
leave alone giving realization.

11:47.805 --> 11:51.569
This is such a headache to give realization to a man

11:51.618 --> 11:54.044
who is absolutely against God.

11:54.143 --> 11:58.100
Like Hitler for example, if he says that
"Mother, give me realization."

11:58.237 --> 12:00.588
What should I do?

12:01.284 --> 12:02.497
It is just like that.

12:02.678 --> 12:06.835
So you have to have basically a temprament of seek.

12:07.007 --> 12:10.035
If you are a seeker, then you get your realization

12:10.149 --> 12:13.448
and you become collectively conscious.

12:14.208 --> 12:19.364
With collective consciousness
you can also raise the Kundalini of people.

12:19.682 --> 12:21.881
You can cure.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.516
You can mentally improve them.

12:24.709 --> 12:27.150
You can settle them with peace.

12:27.276 --> 12:29.823
Then sitting down here,

12:29.911 --> 12:33.664
you can tell about everyone, what’s wrong with that person,

12:33.738 --> 12:37.852
and sitting down here, you can try to help others.

12:38.782 --> 12:42.203
It is not a difficult thing at all, because you become that.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.332
Like, you have seen a television.

12:44.457 --> 12:49.457
if it puts to the mains,
it start acting in such a fantastic manner,

12:49.557 --> 12:54.217
that nobody can believe that this little box can behave like this.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.822
In the same way this little box start
behaving in that fantastic manner.

12:58.940 --> 13:04.338
This should happen to you, otherwise
you should not believe that you have got realization.

13:04.664 --> 13:06.426
It is not a 'make believe' thing.

13:06.601 --> 13:09.128
It is not just a mental understanding,

13:09.272 --> 13:11.956
that you are twice born, it is none of these things.

13:12.069 --> 13:15.532
It is something that has sprouted within you, which has to

13:15.702 --> 13:17.362
If you are lower [INAUDABLE]

13:17.442 --> 13:19.729
and if you really respect yourself,

13:19.876 --> 13:23.213
as people seeking the truth and nothing else,

13:23.310 --> 13:27.247
it happens to you, and grow completely in your growing.

13:28.428 --> 13:35.997
Secondly, what happens to you is that
you start understanding that it is the truth. How?

13:36.209 --> 13:39.296
Because supposing there were, as I told you,

13:39.390 --> 13:41.877
that there was a gentleman whose father was sick,

13:42.037 --> 13:45.056
and we did not know about it.
He wanted to know about his father.

13:45.169 --> 13:49.721
So I said, all right.
Put your hands and ask how is your father.

13:49.817 --> 13:54.742
He just asked his father and got
a burning sensation on this finger here.

13:55.363 --> 14:00.664
So he asked Me, so I called it,
I said this finger relates to this portion,

14:00.792 --> 14:03.263
and these are the center’s of your father.

14:03.422 --> 14:07.984
If it is so, then you better ask your father

14:08.024 --> 14:11.309
but I’m sure he must be down with very bad bronchitis.

14:11.544 --> 14:13.814
He telephoned to his mother in Scotland

14:13.933 --> 14:18.934
because she came on the phone and she said,
your father is down with very bad bronchitis.

14:19.086 --> 14:22.393
Sitting down there, I told him how you can cure him,

14:22.481 --> 14:26.968
and after that four,five hours he was out.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.560
It can be done.

14:28.809 --> 14:31.637
You are that fantastic, you are that glories.

14:31.735 --> 14:34.512
So your attention becomes enlightened.

14:34.671 --> 14:39.786
There is no question of you trying to put some spirits into things

14:39.846 --> 14:41.913
and do all these useless things.

14:41.981 --> 14:46.589
Only thing you have to do is, to awaken the spirit in that person

14:46.692 --> 14:49.827
who is sick and the spirit takes over.

14:51.819 --> 14:54.681
Because it becomes also the truth.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.175
You start understanding that this the truth.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.752
Because you verified.

15:01.871 --> 15:04.032
Every moment, you verify.

15:04.128 --> 15:05.629
First the thing it's a fluke.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.553
Sometimes you think by chance,

15:07.910 --> 15:11.985
you think, "Oh maybe so", like later on, start seeing

15:12.134 --> 15:14.152
that it is true. It is so.

15:14.296 --> 15:18.296
You put ten children, if they are realized souls
and there are many these days,

15:18.359 --> 15:22.446
even in your country, we have seen lots of children
who are born realized.

15:23.042 --> 15:27.736
You should tie up their eyes and put one person in front of them

15:28.182 --> 15:32.421
and you asked them, "What’s the matter with this man?"
you tell us what's the thing.

15:32.606 --> 15:35.205
They raise one finger, this finger, supposing.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.654
You asking, "Did you have a heart attack?"
This shows the heart.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.615
"Yes I have. How do?" I said,
"All of them are showing one finger. This is the heart."

15:45.234 --> 15:48.353
And then you start understanding that, this is the truth.

15:48.449 --> 15:54.641
There is no argument, there is no other opinion about it,

15:54.801 --> 15:58.875
only one opinion, because truth is absolute!

15:59.082 --> 16:02.204
Somebody says, this is Christ, somebody says that is Christ,

16:02.284 --> 16:04.743
somebody says this is Krishna, that is Rama.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.603
It is never like that!

16:06.699 --> 16:10.794
It is one. The truth is one, you cannot have two opinion.

16:10.959 --> 16:16.998
And is absolutely your subject, becomes enlightened
and  you can say this is the truth.

16:18.208 --> 16:23.158
So the second thing that happens to you,
that you start knowing the truth, which is absolute.

16:24.176 --> 16:26.915
Now, if you put your hands say like this.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.212
now, as you have become and a computer,

16:29.313 --> 16:31.615
you are a computer, which has starting.

16:31.727 --> 16:35.848
Even all these instruments that have come
are parallel to our evolution.

16:36.007 --> 16:38.133
Whatever is within us, has come.

16:38.316 --> 16:40.471
But, if you see a computer,

16:41.631 --> 16:44.848
it has to think. But without thinking,

16:44.975 --> 16:48.867
I mean, I look at you, I know you are there.
I don’t have a think about it.

16:49.153 --> 16:50.816
This kind of a computer

16:50.912 --> 16:53.515
human beings will take thousands of years,
even to make

16:53.610 --> 16:56.602
that just thinks and spontaneously knows.

16:57.078 --> 16:59.542
We are already such a big computer, but

16:59.653 --> 17:03.148
we are even become absolute computers, when

17:03.267 --> 17:06.058
we start asking a question, "Is there God?"

17:06.394 --> 17:09.322
Now those who are atheist, if they ask the question,

17:09.420 --> 17:11.764
they start getting cool breeze on the hands.

17:13.023 --> 17:16.106
You ask any absolute question, "Was Christ the son of God?"

17:16.218 --> 17:18.100
Why should people accept Bible?

17:18.194 --> 17:20.749
Why should they accept anything?
The accept this.

17:20.916 --> 17:26.360
Because if you ask, you get the breeze,
cool breeze in the hands as an answer.

17:26.535 --> 17:28.364
Then you know it as a truth.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.805
But could be, people should know that, how is it absolute?

17:31.903 --> 17:36.934
I’ll tell you an example like us we have some fanatics here
in India we also have lots of fanatics.

17:37.199 --> 17:41.094
and in Pune they have arranged my program in a hall

17:41.226 --> 17:45.673
where, which was belonging to brahmins
they another type of

17:45.766 --> 17:49.054
twice born people. Self certified.

17:49.766 --> 17:53.072
So, they learned that I’m not a brahmin.

17:53.191 --> 17:56.736
So they were very angry and said,"We can not have your program."

17:56.891 --> 18:02.395
And our, these organizers did not tell me that
"Mother they don’t want to have your program,

18:02.505 --> 18:04.667
because you are not a brahmin." nothing they told me.

18:04.826 --> 18:09.432
But  they went and told that, "All right. If you don’t want
to have will publish it in the newspaper, because

18:09.542 --> 18:11.199
Mataji is not a brahmin,

18:11.325 --> 18:13.794
so they don’t want to have the program there."

18:13.882 --> 18:16.236
This was too much for them, to take upon themselves,

18:16.261 --> 18:20.157
So they said, "No, no, no, no. If you have published
it in the newspaper, let's have the program."

18:20.368 --> 18:22.852
So I said, "I start the speaking",

18:23.035 --> 18:25.204
and I just say spontaneously

18:25.338 --> 18:30.175
I said, "Please come forward those who are boothing that
the real brahmins."

18:30.693 --> 18:32.870
Four, five of them, you see walked.

18:33.184 --> 18:37.389
Of course, I mean, in India you don’t find
people of this kind, normally.

18:37.501 --> 18:39.537
They don’t challenge a seat normally.

18:39.608 --> 18:44.589
So they came forward and sat down
and their hands where shaking, like this. You see.

18:45.177 --> 18:48.555
So I said,"Now, if you are real brahmins,why are you shaking?"

18:48.733 --> 18:50.243
"You should not shake before Me."

18:50.361 --> 18:53.740
They said, "Mother we are shaking because you are Shakti,
You are the power."

18:53.817 --> 18:55.176
"That's why we are shaking."

18:55.313 --> 18:57.205
I said, "No, nobody is shaking here."

18:57.426 --> 19:00.317
So they said, "No, but these three, four are shaking,
who are they?"

19:00.425 --> 19:02.750
I said, "Go and ask them. Who are they?"

19:02.861 --> 19:04.817
So, they went and asked, "Who are you?"

19:04.897 --> 19:08.756
They said, "We are certified lunatics, coming from lunatic asylum,

19:08.852 --> 19:10.298
our doctor has brought us

19:10.365 --> 19:13.459
that because one of us was cured by Mataji,
so we are here."

19:13.539 --> 19:16.923
Let's us see. There is no difference between those
lunatics and you.

19:17.064 --> 19:19.988
You’re shaking the same way and they’re also shaking.

19:20.182 --> 19:24.247
So, this fanaticism is making you shake.

19:26.285 --> 19:31.549
And this is the main point is, that when you become the truth,

19:31.709 --> 19:34.793
you start understanding the absolute nature of truth.

19:34.905 --> 19:37.977
There is no another, for truth.

19:38.335 --> 19:41.870
If this is so, this is so. If this is so, this is so.

19:41.993 --> 19:43.809
You cannot compromise.

19:43.963 --> 19:47.098
You cannot make it little different,

19:47.260 --> 19:48.959
you cannot synthesize it.

19:49.134 --> 19:53.710
You cannot analyze it. It is so, it is so, it is so.

19:54.282 --> 19:56.998
And you get confirmed about it, when you

19:57.109 --> 20:01.025
growing in your awarness,
you start finding out that this is the truth.

20:01.508 --> 20:06.641
So, you understand the truth through your mental activity first,

20:06.787 --> 20:10.980
through your rationality is goes in to your logic
and then you start accept it.

20:11.337 --> 20:15.077
But third thing that happens to you, ist the best of all.

20:15.193 --> 20:19.812
Is the third thing that you see the whole world as fun.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.914
You see the whole world as a big joke.

20:23.079 --> 20:26.188
You see the whole world as a witness.

20:26.316 --> 20:28.945
Like a thougth rises within us and falls off,

20:29.065 --> 20:31.116
and another thought rises and falls off.

20:31.204 --> 20:33.253
When we are on the waves of the thought,

20:33.372 --> 20:37.612
we are frighten, we have fear, we have worries,
we have jealousies and all these things.

20:37.827 --> 20:40.180
But supposing you get into the boat,

20:40.363 --> 20:43.286
then you start watching waves with fun.

20:43.469 --> 20:47.147
in the same way, you jump onto such an awareness

20:47.235 --> 20:51.199
where you start watching the whole thing as a joke.

20:51.319 --> 20:53.496
As a fun, as a play.

20:53.623 --> 20:57.117
And the whole thing becomes a play to your mind, you start seeing.

20:57.266 --> 21:00.236
And then the joy, stars pouring in you.

21:00.515 --> 21:04.756
Like you all say that, Mona Lisa painting is very good.

21:05.154 --> 21:06.274
How do you know?

21:06.434 --> 21:08.339
Why should wait about Mona Lisa?

21:08.653 --> 21:12.653
She is not one of these modern women.

21:12.840 --> 21:17.087
She is a very old fashioned woman, quite plump.

21:17.175 --> 21:20.835
And why do you say that that painting is so beautiful?
What is so much about it?

21:20.976 --> 21:25.119
Now, if you are a realized soul, you can see it gives vibrations.

21:25.548 --> 21:27.433
It soothes your Spirit.

21:28.155 --> 21:30.331
That's why, it is the best.

21:30.595 --> 21:32.356
If you go to the Sistine Chapel,

21:32.559 --> 21:35.678
of the Vatican.

21:35.955 --> 21:39.523
What Michelangelo has done is nothing,
but he has created vibrations,

21:39.604 --> 21:41.424
tremendous vibrations.

21:41.573 --> 21:43.903
And you see Christ, how they are show Christ?

21:44.045 --> 21:46.155
A robust, tall

21:46.280 --> 21:49.106
fellow standing there, throwing people here and there.

21:49.190 --> 21:51.130
This is, what is happen today.

21:51.273 --> 21:53.071
This is the time of judgement.

21:53.214 --> 21:57.136
and the whole thing is nothing but the Kundalini they've shown,
and at agnya chakra

21:57.216 --> 22:00.831
Christ is sierving there and throwing people
this side and that side.

22:01.387 --> 22:03.842
This is what it is. He is depicted there

22:03.937 --> 22:07.011
through His own understanding, because was a realized soul.

22:07.135 --> 22:08.576
He shows it very clearly.

22:08.710 --> 22:11.886
But then on the altar you find a lanky panky

22:12.013 --> 22:15.849
Christ, you see, absolutely like a TV  patient about to die,

22:15.955 --> 22:21.060
only the bones, you see covered with the what you call a skin.

22:21.245 --> 22:25.246
How can Christ be like that! Is silly [INAUDABLE] .

22:25.940 --> 22:28.840
Like these people who try onces to carry the cross.

22:28.975 --> 22:31.573
And they will know that He could no be like that.

22:31.715 --> 22:35.183
He could not be such a lanky panky. He is a Person of Joy,

22:35.334 --> 22:38.927
health, happiness and exuberance.

22:38.989 --> 22:43.911
How can be anyone who is a man of God, is sickly,

22:45.821 --> 22:54.089
agitated, hot temper and horrible looking.
He has to have that serene on his face.

22:54.244 --> 23:01.607
He has to have that beautiful soothing, impression on others.

23:01.771 --> 23:09.593
How can it be that a person who is such a
great incarnation came on this earth

23:09.690 --> 23:12.508
to be a bony structure like that?

23:12.629 --> 23:14.074
This is what it is.

23:14.138 --> 23:18.664
We have such misconceptions about all of them, such misconceptions,

23:18.781 --> 23:21.739
and we want to put all this conception on God,

23:21.787 --> 23:24.122
but you cannot conceptualize.

23:24.657 --> 23:30.178
The thing that stands between you and yourself is your ego,

23:30.464 --> 23:35.390
an your conditiion. Both things stand against, theiy are like barriers.

23:35.596 --> 23:40.046
When this Kundalini rises, as you see here. Is not here.

23:40.213 --> 23:45.082
When she rises and crosses over this center.
(Yogi: I didnt put a chart...)

23:45.637 --> 23:52.582
Then what happens your ego and superego,
it represents your conditioning, is sucked in.

23:52.971 --> 23:58.470
When it is sucked in, that is the, that is the center of Christ,
when is awaken within you,

23:58.589 --> 24:01.918
He sucks in. That's the place where He is at the cross.
Tomorrow,

24:01.998 --> 24:06.668
I think they’ll bring the chart and I'll be able
to explain in more details.

24:06.801 --> 24:13.928
And that is the time when you are neither the ego nor the superego
and you become the self. The joy starts singing [INAUDABLE].

24:14.023 --> 24:15.952
Whole thing is joy.

24:16.592 --> 24:18.496
The joy starts coming in you.

24:18.933 --> 24:21.699
The all other pursuits are joyous.

24:21.915 --> 24:24.494
There is no joy in the whole things,

24:24.830 --> 24:30.141
and joy doesn't have duality like happiness or unhappiness.

24:30.309 --> 24:33.015
Happiness comes to you when your ego is pampered.

24:33.178 --> 24:37.059
And unhappiness comes to you,
when your conditionings troubles you.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.813
But, joy has no duality.

24:39.973 --> 24:45.055
It's just a feeling of complete elevated soul.

24:45.142 --> 24:51.522
You feel completely elevated about everything else,
enjoy the bliss of God.

24:51.872 --> 24:53.821
Actually, if you see, I mean

24:53.952 --> 24:55.712
Mona Lisa's painting even

24:55.840 --> 24:59.022
you feel the joy is pouring, just like torrential rain.

24:59.390 --> 25:06.052
The person who did it, must have been the one
who has felt that joy, has broughten.

25:06.394 --> 25:11.290
But, if there is a person who is always thinking,

25:11.536 --> 25:16.264
and trying to think it out, what should be done.

25:16.934 --> 25:24.708
Then, he doesn't get the joy at all.
You look at a thing, and there is a thought in between.

25:24.876 --> 25:26.617
It kills the joy completely.

25:26.737 --> 25:31.358
Supposing I am here and I see something beautiful here,
and I start thinking about it,

25:31.488 --> 25:34.434
then I start thinking, "How much it must have cost,

25:34.528 --> 25:38.738
how to insure it. What to do with it", but there is no thought.

25:38.949 --> 25:43.053
The complete creation of that beauty, flows inside you.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.288
Just like joy.

25:44.417 --> 25:48.465
And this is, what has to happen to you, if you become the spirit.

25:48.722 --> 25:53.219
If it does not happen to you, don't believe in anyone.
Also me.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.242
You should not beleive,

25:55.398 --> 26:01.059
into anything, unless and until you get your spirit
which manifest all this things.

26:01.266 --> 26:05.896
It has nothing to do with your intellectualizing, your
your analyses, or anything.

26:05.986 --> 26:09.028
It is something that you have within yourself. It's your own.

26:09.091 --> 26:15.885
It is within you, and you have to get it within yourself,
by your own achievements.

26:15.978 --> 26:20.943
In the sense your own Kundalini rises and touches here
and opens it out.

26:21.168 --> 26:24.741
Now, as I told you, what I do is a simple thing.

26:25.376 --> 26:32.329
That I enlighten and alight, which is ready

26:32.418 --> 26:36.882
which is a, which is again in turn, becomes enlightened

26:36.969 --> 26:39.139
and can enlighten other light.

26:39.455 --> 26:42.111
Now, this Dr. Warren who was here, you have seen.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.360
He came to Me with his friend.

26:44.653 --> 26:48.298
and he just telephoned to Me, had nothing,
had just the telephone number.

26:48.468 --> 26:51.914
and when he telephoned to Me, he came to Me,
he got his realisation

26:52.034 --> 26:56.052
and he must have given realization in thousands.

26:56.295 --> 27:00.078
In the same way, you can also give realization to people.

27:00.340 --> 27:03.603
That’s how we can spread the knowledge,

27:04.263 --> 27:06.227
that is reality.

27:06.573 --> 27:09.943
knowledge of God's law's,

27:10.198 --> 27:17.240
of Divine mechanism within us, how it works.

27:17.963 --> 27:24.372
It is not, that everyone can get it.

27:24.555 --> 27:29.296
I must say that, that I do not say that
all off you will get it.

27:29.616 --> 27:35.391
But should get it. That's my desire is, if you get it,
you're very fortunate

27:35.966 --> 27:39.102
you have found, what you have been finding it.

27:39.507 --> 27:43.978
And if you don’t get it, I would say that I'll try again.

27:44.339 --> 27:47.619
It has to happen to you,

27:47.782 --> 27:50.845
and that, it should happen in a way

27:51.021 --> 27:57.812
that it becomes part and parcel of your central nervous system
that you can manouver it.

27:58.432 --> 28:03.468
So, I have to tell you one thing. The One who has created us,

28:03.606 --> 28:08.529
is anxious that you enter into His Kingdom,

28:08.647 --> 28:11.468
and enjoy the bliss of His truth.

28:12.762 --> 28:14.748
May God bless you. I would like you

28:14.860 --> 28:17.735
to ask me questions. But not like the way yesterday it happened.

28:17.838 --> 28:21.419
People said that,"Mother don't ask to him to ask questions,
because as soon as

28:21.509 --> 28:25.613
they, you asked them to ask questions,
they start behaving like devils."

28:25.727 --> 28:28.304
There is no need to be aggressive with Me.

28:28.398 --> 28:31.529
What is the need? I have come here to give, what is your own.

28:31.600 --> 28:36.942
Why should you be angry with me?
I just don't understand, the psychology.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.406
I have not come to take away anything from you.
(Yogi: I think they are outside

28:41.859 --> 28:45.267
Yogi: They are not in here)
All right. Ask your questions please.

28:45.674 --> 28:51.543
(Someone is asking a question to Shri Mataji. But it's not clear.)

29:05.263 --> 29:06.847
What is he say?

29:07.691 --> 29:10.584
He said, just just a moment, he said that,

29:10.719 --> 29:15.006
as you have said, [INAUDABLE]  universal and

29:15.590 --> 29:20.070
that it is reality, but everybody is concept
the reality may be different.

29:20.211 --> 29:22.054
Yes, it is so. I know that.

29:22.464 --> 29:26.900
It is too, that the concept has to be different, isn't it?

29:27.514 --> 29:29.935
Has to be different because

29:30.460 --> 29:35.667
everybody has their own brain,
to understand, and thinking to their brain.

29:36.130 --> 29:38.221
But when you become the reality,

29:38.341 --> 29:42.142
then there is no more concept, this reality is sucked.

29:42.964 --> 29:48.657
Because you start working through your consciousness,
through your central nerves system.

29:48.803 --> 29:53.012
It is no more a concept, it becomes the reality itself.

29:53.437 --> 29:59.246
That's true that it has to be different,
naturally, I understand that.

29:59.361 --> 30:02.466
I don't mind having them different concept,

30:02.538 --> 30:06.699
but, don’t believe in your concept.
Because it has given no results.

30:07.974 --> 30:12.476
It has shown no result so far, that's all.

30:14.959 --> 30:16.959
Yogi: Concept is dissolved.

30:16.984 --> 30:21.113
Concept is dissolved. Yes that is what's happened,
concept is dissolved. This is the reality.

30:21.185 --> 30:24.259
For example supposing, I'm not  seeing this

30:24.650 --> 30:27.549
church and some people say that's in a church

30:27.597 --> 30:31.235
I may have some funny concept about church.
I have not seen it. All right?

30:31.335 --> 30:37.853
when I come and I see it for myself, and I know this it is so.
I have no concept, I know what it is, it’s like that.

30:38.129 --> 30:42.838
Simple, very it's common sense,
I tell you, it is really common sense.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.569
Actually will be shocked how people live in concepts.

30:46.847 --> 30:50.799
Sometimes i'm really surprised how they are build upon their

30:50.990 --> 30:53.990
lives after  lives of  falsehood.

30:55.093 --> 31:00.582
It's a really surprising, but they live
because you see, ego likes the myth.

31:00.912 --> 31:02.554
It wants to live with myth.

31:02.650 --> 31:06.350
Like Hitler believing that they are superior race. Imagine.

31:06.634 --> 31:11.176
He kill millions and millions of people with that kind
of a myth that he had in his head

31:11.295 --> 31:16.699
Like so many thinks he is the greatest religious man in that God,
it's going to put him in his throne

31:17.652 --> 31:22.514
It’s true, you see. You see the effects
of this concepts everywhere.

31:25.761 --> 31:28.382
The problem is, the concept only

31:28.541 --> 31:31.628
that's the main problem why we're fighting.

31:31.772 --> 31:36.147
Now, see. Let one by one, right please.

31:36.304 --> 31:40.584
Now, who? One this side, one this side.

31:45.717 --> 31:51.314
"He’s asking you to speak about the love and compassion
of the divine Mother. And her qualities."

31:51.433 --> 31:54.206
Now, This is embarassing. Isn't it?

31:54.885 --> 31:57.784
How can a Mother talk about her love?

31:58.148 --> 32:01.206
You can judging by the Mother Earth.

32:01.948 --> 32:05.281
Mother Earth has the capacity, who nourishes.

32:06.157 --> 32:09.168
She has a capacity to soothe us.

32:09.474 --> 32:13.585
She has a capacity, to sustain all that we do,

32:13.833 --> 32:15.668
how cruel we have been with her.

32:15.824 --> 32:20.558
First of all, we commit all kinds of sins, we do all kind of
wrong things on her back.

32:21.151 --> 32:23.558
Then we extract.

32:23.796 --> 32:30.065
For our stupid ideas of having all kinds of things of extracting.

32:30.418 --> 32:33.023
Still, she doesn't say anything.

32:33.507 --> 32:36.017
She doesn't bother about those things.

32:36.312 --> 32:39.863
But sometimes if you go to far with her,
then she punishes.

32:40.146 --> 32:44.184
She does punishes. Like you have earthquakes,
you have  many things like that.

32:44.447 --> 32:46.879
But she has a very special capacity,

32:47.094 --> 32:50.510
which is in Sanskrit described as the "Tambara".

32:50.677 --> 32:54.294
Means, by which she creates seasons to please us.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.897
To make us happy. That innocence,

32:57.022 --> 33:01.275
creation of seasons that she has. You see the flowers,
you see the everything

33:01.379 --> 33:07.454
how she makes a life so beautiful humanes, so joyful.

33:07.709 --> 33:13.444
That thing is 'pragya' means the knowledge which is enlightened.
When you get that knowledge,

33:14.544 --> 33:17.340
then you are amazed how [INAUDABLE]  she is.

33:17.634 --> 33:20.700
How she looks after little, little,

33:20.862 --> 33:23.623
and how she soothes.

33:24.508 --> 33:29.549
And I do quite some thimes [INAUDABLE]  how I try to console people.

33:29.777 --> 33:31.432
In my own symbol.

33:31.624 --> 33:36.941
One day,there is a very great saint living in a mountain

33:37.095 --> 33:40.605
who I think, his legs and hands are broken and all disappear

33:40.751 --> 33:43.666
he lives in a cave, some like a monch.

33:43.930 --> 33:48.512
And, he can not move, so got a tiger so he can move.

33:48.720 --> 33:52.261
And I told the people I must see him, he is my son.

33:52.347 --> 33:56.168
They said " Mother, you don't like these gurus.
Why you want to see him?

33:56.260 --> 33:58.105
That time, he is real one.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.360
They said, "How will you ??",
I said, "Feel his vibrations."

34:01.487 --> 34:05.014
They said "Yes, lot's of vibrations."
I went to see this gentlemen.

34:05.270 --> 34:10.652
Now, he is a very evolve personality
and he can control the rain.

34:10.830 --> 34:15.996
So when I was going up the hill, it started raining heavily

34:16.139 --> 34:18.688
and he was very angry with the rain.

34:18.802 --> 34:22.000
Actually he felt that, "Whats happen, this rain is

34:22.113 --> 34:24.208
completely drenching my Mother.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.130
She is coming up, and I can't even control this rain.

34:27.151 --> 34:30.032
What will she think. I sit here and she has to come up to see me."

34:30.128 --> 34:33.250
Because, he has broken legs and broken hands.

34:33.607 --> 34:36.439
And when I went to talk to him, He was sitting

34:36.580 --> 34:40.174
on a little stone and just doing like this, with anger.

34:40.456 --> 34:42.922
So, I just smiled at him and sat.

34:42.978 --> 34:49.316
Then he came, he said, "Is it that you control my ego,
who did all this that you make

34:49.359 --> 34:55.111
this place like this. You come to my house
and I can not welcome you properly?"

34:55.250 --> 34:58.467
I said, "No at all, why you get angry?

34:58.581 --> 35:01.249
I know you have bought a sari for Me,

35:01.421 --> 35:06.991
and I don't take a sari from a sanyasi,
becouse I'm [INAUDABLE] , I'm the one who has a household.

35:07.115 --> 35:10.895
Then how will I get a sari
unless and untill this sari is not drenched.?"

35:11.012 --> 35:14.605
The whole thing become such a sweet thing. Really.

35:14.785 --> 35:16.878
He forgot his all temper and everything.

35:16.992 --> 35:19.110
"How do you know Mother, I have a sari for you?"

35:19.251 --> 35:23.058
"I know you bought a sari for Me,
so I have to change it and how will I change"

35:23.128 --> 35:27.371
So, the whole thing soothe down and he was normal.
But I said [INAUDABLE] .

35:27.660 --> 35:33.090
I'm permeating, and the whole place must be drenched.
This is, is the joy of loving.

35:33.215 --> 35:37.621
So, why you should felle bad about it?
And that is how you soothe down.

35:38.020 --> 35:42.059
So, the mothers love is such, that She

35:42.184 --> 35:44.520
soothes you, she knows your problems,

35:44.646 --> 35:46.725
she knows that you make mistakes.

35:46.904 --> 35:49.467
Like, I tell you about Mr. Warren,

35:49.553 --> 35:53.272
one of his stories. When he ..... he can tell one after another.

35:53.342 --> 35:57.951
One day, I was in Singapore
and we are going to have a program.

35:58.138 --> 36:02.186
So, I said, "We go about six o clock.
It's all right becouse I have to see somebody

36:02.280 --> 36:03.968
Why do you have to go

36:04.062 --> 36:09.670
They said, "No, no, we must go make arrangements
another lady who was organising even very much more worried.

36:09.795 --> 36:12.642
So, they have decided, we must go to the hall.

36:12.743 --> 36:17.576
I said, "I'm go out and wait for [INAUDABLE] ."
But they just thought, better go.

36:17.735 --> 36:19.744
So, they took a

36:19.978 --> 36:24.825
plane two hours earlier and went to the place of organizing.

36:25.949 --> 36:33.423
When, I were there, I saw that when my car
reached there, their car also reached there they just came down at that time

36:33.564 --> 36:35.078
And I knew why it happened,

36:35.164 --> 36:38.164
I said, "All right come drive a but, they feel very embarrassing"

36:38.227 --> 36:40.099
Becouse they came with such a

36:40.177 --> 36:44.794
determination that they have to reach there,
and same time I arrived there.

36:45.505 --> 36:48.763
So, I went draw walk, when I came back

36:49.044 --> 36:51.654
they said, "Mother we are sorry."

36:51.872 --> 36:53.155
I said, "What happen?

36:53.389 --> 36:55.300
They said,"We reached there, all right.

36:55.480 --> 37:00.027
but from the airport to this place,
there was such a bad jam, they have never see.

37:00.363 --> 37:02.652
So, we thought we better drive through the

37:02.761 --> 37:06.097
sideway, so we got stucked into the mud.

37:06.244 --> 37:08.902
Then we start pulling the car out.

37:09.003 --> 37:12.300
and all our clothes were dirty,
then we had a very bad time.

37:12.402 --> 37:15.261
And we have arrived, after You have arrived.

37:15.502 --> 37:16.839
I said, "It's all right."

37:16.979 --> 37:21.331
Now, we never do such a thing Mother,
we should have coming with you. It was a mistake.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.935
So, like that litle little things

37:24.137 --> 37:26.285
Mother teaches you, how to be

37:26.450 --> 37:28.560
all right, how to be on the right path.

37:28.716 --> 37:33.567
But it is never a big pinch, never a big
punishment. Because you are children.

37:33.747 --> 37:36.846
So, here this life by which
you should advanced

37:36.939 --> 37:39.235
you should go further, you should be encouraged.

37:39.337 --> 37:44.877
But if you ego get's pampered, and you think
I am a great Sahaja Yogi. There are many who behaving like that

37:45.073 --> 37:47.924
And then they have this correction point.

37:48.136 --> 37:53.713
That's how it works out. And gradually I find,
people come up very sweetly understanding

37:53.783 --> 37:56.807
that we should not try to

37:57.018 --> 38:00.784
do things which are no all right.
And we should try to do something

38:00.862 --> 38:02.932
that is helpful, which is very collective.

38:03.041 --> 38:06.417
And that's what it is, and it works in a such a beatiful manner

38:06.526 --> 38:11.885
that you don't have to should to anyone,
or to do anything. Whole thing works out beautifully.

38:12.113 --> 38:17.100
The blessings are so great like Krishna has said (in Hindi)

38:17.194 --> 38:19.522
He says, when yoga takes place

38:19.921 --> 38:23.156
then, "kshema" - that means

38:23.429 --> 38:26.093
the well-being of a person [INAUDABLE] .

38:26.304 --> 38:28.210
Even material you are [INAUDABLE] .

38:28.351 --> 38:31.306
in so many ways. Is very suprising, is [INAUDABLE] .

38:31.697 --> 38:37.596
You are helped in material in so many ways. There was a girl,
a little girl about ten years. She wrote to Me,

38:37.702 --> 38:42.059
But I am dying to see you.
How can I come to India, I have no money to travel

38:42.555 --> 38:46.516
And she wrote a letter to Me.
I just get the letter and I didn't answered her.

38:46.673 --> 38:49.069
And eight years later she had a field day

38:49.233 --> 38:52.543
in her school. So she took a trinket from her house

38:52.637 --> 38:57.441
just to sell it in the field. So the teachers said,
"This is real gold, how can you sell this here?"

38:57.550 --> 39:00.301
She couldn't believe.
She went to her mother, she said

39:00.467 --> 39:04.053
This trinket of our house, is real gold.
She couldn't believe either

39:04.139 --> 39:08.640
So they wen to the goldsmith,
and goldsmith said "Yes, it is."

39:08.859 --> 39:10.008
It is gold.

39:10.171 --> 39:18.889
And he valued with the price which he wanted to buy was exactly
the same as they would have to pay for their travel both of them.

39:19.623 --> 39:22.272
So, it is in such a sweet manner.

39:22.581 --> 39:26.115
You see, you must know, a loving mother
when you are asleep

39:26.240 --> 39:27.859
she looks after you.

39:28.109 --> 39:30.054
When you awake, she looks after you.

39:30.187 --> 39:34.866
But she doesn't show that you are someting

39:35.077 --> 39:36.366
more then others,

39:36.600 --> 39:39.898
better then others. She doesn't like
you to have your ego.

39:40.008 --> 39:41.827
but she wants that you to share.

39:42.023 --> 39:43.913
Share your love with everyone.

39:44.311 --> 39:49.293
That's the greates joy for Me
to see when the Sahaja Yogis meet each other.

39:49.527 --> 39:51.198
When they would, you should see

39:51.347 --> 39:53.277
How they  meet and

39:53.355 --> 39:58.080
how they hold each other to themselves.
Just pure love and pure understanding.

39:58.158 --> 39:59.754
Is the greatest thing to see.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.756
I'm happyyou asked such a nice question

40:01.849 --> 40:07.859
but I feel rather embarassed, because
it is realy so great to enjoy your love from everyone.

40:07.968 --> 40:09.968
May God bless you.

40:11.299 --> 40:13.690
Yogi: this fire by Adi Shankara...

40:14.079 --> 40:24.048
Ah, you must read Adi Shankaracharya to know the love of God,
love of Mother. I mean he was a child, a beautiful child.

40:24.397 --> 40:28.719
Even Christ has said, "behold the mother".

40:29.592 --> 40:31.047
Behold the mother.

40:31.531 --> 40:32.969
It's very significant.

40:37.453 --> 40:39.148
Is water in this.

40:45.773 --> 40:48.386
Should have a Realization.

40:50.525 --> 40:53.275
Yogi: Ok. So we have it now?

40:54.650 --> 40:57.587
Have I answered your all questions, this side?

40:57.953 --> 41:01.930
Just on,  All right.

41:05.693 --> 41:08.131
Loudly please.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.775
Yogi: loudly!

41:41.249 --> 41:44.442
Yogi: She's refereing to the, how you said

41:44.653 --> 41:47.294
how you would you recognise Christ you referd to that.

41:47.612 --> 41:49.708
So she raises the question,

41:50.057 --> 41:52.903
what is your idea, your theorie

41:53.184 --> 41:58.167
your concept on Christ, will he be coming on a white horse

41:58.442 --> 42:00.592
is he going to come and is this going to happen.

42:00.705 --> 42:04.056
Yes, this is going to happen. No doubt!

42:04.378 --> 42:06.908
[INAUDABLE]  that's a fact.

42:07.197 --> 42:11.198
Yes, but that doesn't going to give any [INAUDABLE].

42:11.417 --> 42:14.214
He's not going to ask you any questions.

42:14.464 --> 42:16.479
He's not to going to give any answer.

42:16.611 --> 42:21.377
No realization, nothing. Just [INAUDABLE]

42:21.495 --> 42:24.266
He has eleven powers of destruction

42:24.406 --> 42:27.596
is called as ekadesha. Once he arrives

42:27.774 --> 42:32.159
you will have no place to hide your faces if you are [INAUDABLE]

42:32.210 --> 42:35.130
[UNCLEAR]  ....right now

42:35.301 --> 42:37.856
at this moment.

42:38.027 --> 42:42.949
Otherwise [INAUDABLE]  . Is a fact, no doubt. [INAUDABLE]

42:46.161 --> 42:48.815
[UNCLEAR]

42:51.635 --> 42:57.013
Becouse that's what you ???
I don't want to ??? It's a fact.

43:02.530 --> 43:05.077
That will be last [INAUDABLE]

43:08.645 --> 43:11.934
Already he has startet working in us

43:12.027 --> 43:15.661
All [INAUDABLE]  are also what Krishna has said

43:16.146 --> 43:22.063
According to Sahaja Yoga there are eleven destroying powers.

43:22.143 --> 43:27.047
They are here, which we call as ekadesha rudra.

43:27.240 --> 43:33.819
And when people get any [INAUDABLE]  disease, all this centers [INAUDABLE] .

43:34.497 --> 43:39.282
So, the destruciton now [INAUDABLE].

43:39.469 --> 43:43.686
You did not get [INAUDABLE] .

43:49.788 --> 43:56.335
Yogi: One more and this is the last. Yes

43:57.577 --> 44:05.336
a visitor is asking a question, but it is not audible

44:22.212 --> 44:27.424
Yogi: I'm sorry, I can't...
would you please stand and just say it again.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.548
Shri Mataji: Make it short.
Yogi: make it briefly.

44:35.056 --> 44:37.832
Yogi: the idea of [INAUDABLE].

44:38.293 --> 44:40.792
that one soul [INAUDABLE]  another soul

44:41.026 --> 44:45.745
Visitor: not clear

44:57.602 --> 45:01.233
Yogi: I think you have a, another concept about healing

45:01.381 --> 45:03.056
but let's finalise it

45:03.174 --> 45:11.163
Yogi: She is talking about a healing process, and
is there any particular way, we should do this.

45:11.421 --> 45:15.117
No, no. You should never bother about the source

45:15.274 --> 45:16.426
[INAUDABLE]

45:16.575 --> 45:22.161
Christ has said that, leave
them alone they have nothing to do with [INAUDABLE]

45:22.615 --> 45:26.350
Living souls you would say, or death souls?

45:26.603 --> 45:28.072
Yogi: living

45:28.257 --> 45:34.747
living. Now the living soul,
they not talk to another soul unless there [INAUDABLE]  spirit.

45:35.207 --> 45:40.698
At that level you need to speek
to each other on a very different language.

45:40.871 --> 45:43.514
The language is different, the style is different

45:43.592 --> 45:47.077
and the communication is different.
The whole priority changes.

45:47.155 --> 45:49.202
You become a different person.

45:49.397 --> 45:50.694
All right?

45:51.366 --> 45:57.345
That the egg becomes a bird, and
the birds have a different language among themselves.

45:57.525 --> 45:59.088
Yogi: That's fine she's happy.

45:59.197 --> 46:03.361
She's happy about it. All right.

46:05.330 --> 46:07.525
All right.
Yogi: Ok, that's it Mother.

46:07.861 --> 46:11.478
All right, are you all satisfied?

46:12.111 --> 46:14.916
Now, just one or two more. All right.

46:15.164 --> 46:17.681
Four, ah that for me...
Yogi: One of the men.

46:17.743 --> 46:20.613
All right. [INAUDABLE]

46:20.810 --> 46:25.320
Question: What is a death soul?
It just acts as a death soul or living soul?

46:25.703 --> 46:27.343
What did he say?

46:27.976 --> 46:31.616
Yogi: What if a death soul is acting like a living soul?

46:32.796 --> 46:35.936
Oh, it's a very big question my child.

46:36.007 --> 46:40.499
I'll tell you later on, after the program. All right.
It [INAUDABLE]  my lecture. Doesn't matter.

46:40.624 --> 46:41.820
[INAUDABLE]

46:42.031 --> 46:47.282
We are made of [INAUDABLE], all right. And then is
Kundalini within us and also the spirit.

46:47.508 --> 46:52.150
Now, if a death sould [INAUDABLE]

46:52.283 --> 46:56.048
What happens, that the earth element [INAUDABLE]

46:56.197 --> 46:57.946
water element also comes out

46:58.103 --> 47:00.103
the rest of the trhee element remain

47:00.230 --> 47:03.527
and the spirit and the Kundalini means top of that.

47:03.785 --> 47:07.074
And that is the death soul. And the living soul with a person

47:07.215 --> 47:10.238
which has got the spirit, and thinks that is a soul,

47:10.386 --> 47:13.075
I don't know [INAUDABLE]

47:13.266 --> 47:15.895
But [INAUDABLE]  person,

47:16.106 --> 47:24.209
who is living, has got a spirit, has
got a Kundalini and has got a ....

47:24.428 --> 47:27.426
Yogi: 5 elements
Shri Mataji: also the, all five elements.

47:27.543 --> 47:31.660
representing in those centers. But

47:32.152 --> 47:34.387
when he becomes a realized soul,

47:34.465 --> 47:37.568
then he is not as a

47:37.763 --> 47:42.756
living soul.
But he's called as an enlightened soul.

47:46.528 --> 47:49.909
Visitor is asking a question.

48:10.042 --> 48:13.786
Yogi: She's peda grow on her own.
She has lot of

48:14.255 --> 48:19.060
good experiences, but she' also had a lot of pain.
Is an nessesary experience

48:19.342 --> 48:21.130
that she should have the pain?

48:21.310 --> 48:23.614
No, not nessesary at all.

48:23.755 --> 48:25.599
Actually you got some good experiences.

48:25.748 --> 48:27.474
[INAUDABLE]

48:27.662 --> 48:32.273
The good experience should not [INAUDABLE]

48:32.406 --> 48:37.078
Now, what is the experience you get first of all.
You get the coole breeze coming out of your head.

48:37.351 --> 48:38.609
On the very gross level.

48:38.851 --> 48:43.000
And out of you head and there should
bee cool breeze you should feel arround.

48:43.344 --> 48:45.750
Then the second experience we should have is

48:45.883 --> 48:48.789
that you should be peaceful with yourself.

48:48.899 --> 48:52.705
Absolutely silent, and there is no problem at all.

48:52.923 --> 48:57.018
And, if you get any pain. Suposing
after Realization also

48:57.182 --> 49:00.205
you might be some sort of [INAUDABLE]

49:00.314 --> 49:03.932
as soon as put your hand there you can get rid of that pain.

49:04.182 --> 49:09.174
So, it is the experience that you have had,
should be an experience [INAUDABLE]

49:09.627 --> 49:13.057
And, if it a person who has given you realization,

49:13.198 --> 49:16.158
you [INAUDABLE]

49:16.556 --> 49:18.869
You see, this is a [INAUDABLE]

49:19.134 --> 49:23.128
the guru that give you realization,
that makes you an expert.

49:24.472 --> 49:26.472
Visitor talks, bu it's not clear.

49:31.089 --> 49:35.074
[INAUDABLE]

49:35.277 --> 49:39.230
Yogi: She wasn't just refering to phycical pain,
she was refering to

49:39.590 --> 49:42.784
pain in face up to life and so.

49:43.401 --> 49:45.081
Be in what?

49:45.378 --> 49:48.488
Yogi: pain in facing up to life's problems and wider

49:48.785 --> 49:50.620
meaning of her pain.
Shri Mataji: All right.

49:50.800 --> 49:54.284
That must stop, that must stop completely.

49:54.604 --> 49:57.300
Becouse you start to see the whole thing

49:57.956 --> 50:03.644
as a drama. You are so detached see the
whole thing. You solve the problem.

50:03.808 --> 50:05.583
You see the things,

50:05.771 --> 50:08.086
if you become,

50:08.446 --> 50:11.649
the spectator of the whole drama,

50:12.149 --> 50:14.914
and you know that you can cure

50:15.070 --> 50:18.414
you don't feel the pain. You get [INAUDABLE]

50:20.250 --> 50:23.618
All rigth? May god bless you!
Yogi: Ok, let's have it.

50:23.946 --> 50:28.634
All right. One more [INAUDABLE]

50:28.720 --> 50:32.641
What is it?

50:33.040 --> 50:40.573
Visitor is asking: I have two questions, actually.
What is your feeling [INAUDABLE]

50:40.918 --> 50:45.596
Yogi: What is the base of cause of disease?

50:46.338 --> 50:48.338
Is inbalance.

50:48.479 --> 50:52.648
Tomorrow I'm going to thell you all about. Is inbalances.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.163
Yogi: Second.
Shri Mataji: Second one?

50:56.506 --> 50:59.265
Visitor...

50:59.601 --> 51:01.313
I'm not [INAUDABLE]

51:01.509 --> 51:05.188
If that is Shri Sai Nath. He gives it perfectly all right

51:05.329 --> 51:09.870
[INAUDABLE]

51:10.464 --> 51:15.393
[INAUDABLE]

51:16.565 --> 51:18.294
[INAUDABLE]

51:18.755 --> 51:21.091
Yogi: Can you speek about carma?

51:21.318 --> 51:23.887
Ah. The carma a [INAUDABLE]  thing.

51:24.067 --> 51:27.786
but actually, what you do [INAUDABLE]

51:28.099 --> 51:31.786
is activated with you ego.

51:32.450 --> 51:35.223
And when the Kundalini rises,

51:35.621 --> 51:36.841
when She

51:37.130 --> 51:39.130
passes through this center

51:39.489 --> 51:43.231
that is sucked in. That's why it has said, Christ

51:43.449 --> 51:45.419
forgive us [INAUDABLE]

51:45.817 --> 51:50.278
since he's taking our work, he died for our sin.

51:50.559 --> 51:53.233
In the sense that carma is sucked by Him.

51:53.624 --> 51:54.726
And we

51:54.991 --> 51:57.312
are left without an ego,

51:57.430 --> 52:00.640
and it is only the ego that has [INAUDABLE]

52:00.984 --> 52:05.655
Once the ego is sucked in there is no carma left.

52:09.374 --> 52:11.374
[INAUDABLE]

52:13.030 --> 52:14.460
All rigth.

52:14.912 --> 52:18.804
Now, let's ask one more question,
all right? They are anxious

52:19.070 --> 52:20.711
to have we the experience.

52:20.945 --> 52:23.931
Please ask. One question more.

52:24.555 --> 52:27.150
Visitor: You mean we create karma?

52:27.884 --> 52:30.291
Yogi: Do you mean that, do we create karma?

52:30.471 --> 52:31.634
Yes, we do!

52:31.900 --> 52:33.861
Where we do action,

52:34.009 --> 52:35.009
you see,

52:35.158 --> 52:40.037
karma is only the myth that human beings have. Animals don't have.

52:40.349 --> 52:43.030
They don't have this problem. The problem is

52:43.186 --> 52:46.811
when ego [INAUDABLE]  of you head,

52:46.936 --> 52:49.037
then we develope a personality.

52:49.155 --> 52:53.022
Which is I. I'm Mr. so, I'm Mrs.

52:53.241 --> 52:54.944
The I ness we develope.

52:55.170 --> 53:00.037
When we develope I'ness,
we think that we are uniques. This is a big [INAUDABLE]

53:00.405 --> 53:02.334
Like a, I give a

53:02.428 --> 53:05.756
an expample from the villagers [INAUDABLE]

53:05.866 --> 53:08.373
that you don't have to take to much luggage

53:08.537 --> 53:09.983
on an aeroplane.

53:10.351 --> 53:13.063
So, they sat in the aeroplane

53:13.173 --> 53:15.508
and they put all their luggage on their heads.

53:15.633 --> 53:18.203
and the said, "Now we should lessing the weight.

53:18.311 --> 53:22.651
of the aeroplane. It is something like that with our karma.

53:22.933 --> 53:26.269
That we take the responsibility of doing the work.

53:26.465 --> 53:29.924
Why we [INAUDABLE]  , you see [INAUDABLE]

53:30.049 --> 53:31.189
Is all there.

53:31.431 --> 53:34.869
[INAUDABLE]  said, so we mak them ???. All right.

53:35.049 --> 53:38.330
Death from the death to the death. That's all we do.

53:38.604 --> 53:40.338
We make [INAUDABLE]

53:40.783 --> 53:42.783
We make this, we make that

53:42.884 --> 53:46.533
and then we start using matter for our comfort.

53:46.650 --> 53:49.971
And then, matter sits on our head. We can't get rid of it.

53:50.487 --> 53:53.627
Our spirit is supressed becouse of the matter.

53:53.955 --> 53:55.642
And then we have to

53:55.861 --> 53:58.760
use the matter, otherwise we just can't exsist.

53:59.174 --> 54:02.619
So, what we are doing is, we are creating death after death.

54:02.979 --> 54:05.744
But, not the scenery we [INAUDABLE]

54:05.908 --> 54:09.549
We can not transform one flower to a fruit. Can we?

54:09.823 --> 54:11.064
We can not do it!

54:11.375 --> 54:16.860
So, what ever is done is done by
God Allmighty, By His living powers.

54:17.266 --> 54:23.719
Whatever being is all there [INAUDABLE]

54:25.242 --> 54:30.619
Yogi: Ok. Let's everyone slip their shoes off.

54:31.033 --> 54:33.666
So, let's us do make the better contact with the Earth.

54:33.901 --> 54:36.682
Shri Mataji: What is ....?
yogi: and put your hands up.

54:38.768 --> 54:41.963
Yogi: So, they recording?

54:43.820 --> 54:47.510
Yogi: Be comfortable, sit with your hands on your lap.

54:49.573 --> 54:54.492
When Shri Mataji asks, just close the eyes.

54:58.029 --> 55:04.404
Speaking every day....

55:04.943 --> 55:08.906
Yogi: All that you do at this stages, be hungry for it!

55:09.258 --> 55:11.578
And do ask hungry for it in you heart.

55:11.805 --> 55:15.031
Please Mother, give me my realization!

55:15.305 --> 55:19.554
Becouse you have to desire it.
And that's where She can not cross your freedom.

55:19.812 --> 55:23.307
If you don't want it, then as She says you are free to go.

55:23.604 --> 55:24.846
But if you wanted

55:24.995 --> 55:27.689
put your hands up and ask humbly in your heart

55:27.868 --> 55:30.486
"Please Mother, give me my realization".

55:30.931 --> 55:32.931
We have to humble us all down.

55:33.252 --> 55:38.334
Now, we have to put our hands just like this.

55:39.334 --> 55:41.870
Yesterday I told you, day before,

55:41.995 --> 55:48.382
that left hand presents, our desire
and the right hand our action.

55:49.999 --> 55:54.512
So we have to [INAUDABLE]  put it in you lap,

55:54.645 --> 55:57.098
like this. With your finger stretched,

55:57.215 --> 56:00.192
and sit comfortable. That's very important to sit comfortable.

56:00.333 --> 56:02.780
[INAUDABLE]

56:02.937 --> 56:06.405
Shoes go back, ounder the chair,

56:06.538 --> 56:08.928
and put your feet straight. Like this.

56:09.108 --> 56:12.920
On the ground, not teaching each other.

56:16.154 --> 56:18.383
Put the left hand on your lap,

56:19.545 --> 56:21.180
and the right hand

56:21.438 --> 56:25.297
[INAUDABLE]  put the both of your hands on your lap.

56:25.695 --> 56:27.524
And now, close your eyes.

56:27.954 --> 56:31.399
Now, don't open you eyes till I tell you.

56:31.610 --> 56:33.680
Becouse Kundalini want rise

56:34.117 --> 56:37.828
[INAUDABLE]  something has to happen within.

56:38.023 --> 56:40.594
So, just keep your eyes

56:41.165 --> 56:42.774
completely closed

56:42.978 --> 56:44.978
till I tell you.

56:47.392 --> 56:49.766
Now, put your right hand

56:52.617 --> 56:54.617
on your heart.

56:54.914 --> 56:58.110
on the lefhand side and press it.

56:59.298 --> 57:01.656
Now, you are the Spirit,

57:01.851 --> 57:04.117
and the Spirit resides in your heart.

57:04.508 --> 57:08.120
So, you have to just ask a questions three times.

57:08.784 --> 57:11.667
Mother, am I the spirit?

57:11.831 --> 57:13.831
Just ask, in a humble way,

57:14.097 --> 57:15.831
and full confidence.

57:15.979 --> 57:19.253
Mother, am I the spirit?

57:23.135 --> 57:28.268
Please don't feel guilty. That is one thing
I'm requesting, not to feel guilty at this moment.

57:28.362 --> 57:32.448
Forget the past, just forget the past.

57:55.694 --> 57:59.034
Now, keep the right and, left hand as it is

57:59.198 --> 58:00.846
bring the left hand down.

58:00.956 --> 58:03.691
on you stomach, on the lefthand side.

58:03.769 --> 58:08.488
to the center which is of the Primordial master.

58:08.840 --> 58:11.371
right hand sorry, left hand towards Me

58:11.489 --> 58:15.433
left hand. Sorry I made a mistake, left hand towards Me.

58:17.058 --> 58:20.550
And right hand the stomach and press it hard.

58:20.753 --> 58:24.410
Press it hard on your lefthand side of your stomach.

58:24.817 --> 58:28.777
Put the right hand on the lefthand side of the stomach.

58:30.198 --> 58:36.338
At this point, you have to say with full confidence

58:36.769 --> 58:40.441
Mother, I'm my own guide.

58:40.738 --> 58:43.386
Mother, I'm my own guru.

58:43.511 --> 58:46.722
Mother, I'm my own master.

58:47.745 --> 58:49.745
With full confidence.

58:53.291 --> 58:55.291
Try to sit comfortably.

59:09.287 --> 59:12.785
Now, this has to be said ten times.

59:12.965 --> 59:17.378
Because we have ten benances.
Human beings have to ten benances.

59:17.503 --> 59:19.902
So, we have to say ten times.

59:37.478 --> 59:41.528
Now, please put your right hand again to nurish,

59:42.145 --> 59:44.145
on your heart.

59:46.277 --> 59:48.988
Here you now assert

59:49.168 --> 59:53.066
by saying "Mother, I am the spirit."

59:55.668 --> 59:58.136
Please say, twelve times.

59:59.761 --> 01:00:04.230
To assert, without feeling guilty. Without feeling guilty.

01:00:04.387 --> 01:00:07.873
Without feeling guilty, you must assert

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:10.732
and

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:15.096
Mother, I am the spirit.

01:00:29.047 --> 01:00:31.047
Twelve times, please.

01:00:38.992 --> 01:00:40.992
Please don't feel guilty.

01:00:41.265 --> 01:00:44.195
Next thing could be to put your right hand on the

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.195
base of your neck, on your shoulder on the lefthand side.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:49.757
Right hand.

01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:54.515
From front, on the left hand side.

01:00:55.933 --> 01:01:03.321
Here, you hold it tight. From the front you take your hand [INAUDABLE].

01:01:04.466 --> 01:01:08.640
And hold it tight. Here we say "Mother,

01:01:09.227 --> 01:01:14.933
I'm not guilty, please say sixteen times, please say it.

01:01:17.338 --> 01:01:21.074
It's too much...

01:01:28.683 --> 01:01:31.102
Please say it with

01:01:31.248 --> 01:01:36.161
all your understanding that, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

01:02:14.582 --> 01:02:20.335
Now, put your right hand across your forehead.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:25.669
Across your forehead at this one you have to say,

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:29.217
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:34.811
Please say "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:49.542
It is very easy to say, just say and it will workout.

01:02:55.268 --> 01:03:01.051
Now, put your right hand
on the back of your head. Hold it tight.

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.456
If the know the optic loop, where it is placed,

01:03:04.642 --> 01:03:06.713
on the back of your head.

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:13.889
At this point, you have to now say
without feeling guilty, you have to say

01:03:13.974 --> 01:03:18.419
that is, If I have done any mistakes,
"Oh Lord please forgive me", that's all.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:22.279
But don't feel guilty.
Please don't feel guilty, don't count them,

01:03:22.405 --> 01:03:26.007
just say that "Please forgive me."

01:03:26.843 --> 01:03:29.828
From your heart.

01:04:23.201 --> 01:04:26.619
Now, put your hand on the top of your head.

01:04:26.734 --> 01:04:30.734
Put it just on top, your hand your palm should touch

01:04:30.845 --> 01:04:36.492
the fontanel bone area,
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:40.806
And press it, and try to move it clockwise.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:46.209
Now, at this point as a said,
I cannot cross your freedom and

01:04:46.525 --> 01:04:51.908
you have to ask for your realisation, otherwise I cannot force it.

01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:54.554
Then just say seven times

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.128
Mother, I want my realisation.
Please give me realisation.

01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:02.094
Seven time.

01:05:11.296 --> 01:05:13.548
Shri Mataji blows...

01:05:54.243 --> 01:05:57.731
Now, raise your hand and seek if there is a cool breeze coming in.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.873
Now, change your hand please.

01:06:17.992 --> 01:06:21.732
Put your right hand down,
and the left hand on top of your head.

01:06:21.804 --> 01:06:24.656
And now see, [INAUDABLE] .

01:06:56.242 --> 01:06:58.455
You got it, most of you.

01:06:59.124 --> 01:07:01.536
All can raise both your hands.

01:07:01.868 --> 01:07:07.772
On top of your head,
open your eyes. Please take m higer, higher.

01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:11.477
And now ask a question, in your heart.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.725
Is this the wind of the Holy Ghost?

01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:16.688
Is this the Brahmachaitanya?

01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:22.914
Is this the call pervading power of love of God's all living work?

01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:40.744
Now feel it yourself.

01:07:44.701 --> 01:07:49.467
Those who are proper on second time, must have definitely felt it.

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.671
But I tell you today what is
to done tonight and work it out would be better.

01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:58.287
You may get a photograph [INAUDABLE].

01:07:58.497 --> 01:08:02.897
In the beginning, is better to use my
photograph because it has got vibrations.

01:08:03.007 --> 01:08:09.570
Now what you can do is the put a candle in front of the photograph, and you can see the vibrations are coming from the photograph.

01:08:09.642 --> 01:08:13.253
Now, put the left hand towards photograph
and the right hand like this, just now you can do it

01:08:13.305 --> 01:08:15.884
put the left hand towards me at the right hand like this.

01:08:16.033 --> 01:08:18.627
Now this is the balance. This is the balance [INAUDABLE]

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.665
Put left hand towards Me, and right hand out like this at the back.

01:08:22.776 --> 01:08:25.355
You see like this so we are [INAUDABLE]

01:08:25.608 --> 01:08:29.075
All right. Now see on the left hand if it is coming.

01:08:36.768 --> 01:08:40.077
You're all thoughtless, if you see that.

01:08:42.498 --> 01:08:47.196
Now, you put your right hand towards Me and your left hand up.

01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:51.834
Heart.

01:08:53.537 --> 01:08:55.918
You have to believe that you are the spirit.

01:08:56.039 --> 01:08:57.463
that's all we believe,

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.072
Your believe in yourself. Tthat's all we have to believe in

01:09:01.589 --> 01:09:04.144
that you are the spirit.

01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:10.786
Good?

01:09:12.267 --> 01:09:17.801
All right. Then I teach you how to raise
your Kundalini tonight when you go home.

01:09:18.106 --> 01:09:20.931
So this is what you can do on the photograph

01:09:21.046 --> 01:09:23.553
and you can see that it starts moving

01:09:23.741 --> 01:09:28.384
from both your hands. At the most of very much, sort of intention

01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:32.096
and If you are very sick, then you can take a

01:09:32.597 --> 01:09:37.099
little bowl of water with little salt in it, and put your feet in

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:41.561
that bowl and take the vibrations from the photograph.

01:09:41.763 --> 01:09:46.652
But if you feel cool breeze in your hand and
cool breeze moving in this hand. Then everything is perfect.

01:09:46.793 --> 01:09:49.023
Now you have to learn, tomorrow I'll tell you

01:09:49.204 --> 01:09:53.367
what it means how to use it,
how to become a master. Is a simple thing.

01:09:53.579 --> 01:09:57.500
Now today, I teach you how to raise
your own your Kundalini . Which is your own.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.234
Now put your left hand in front of the Kundalini, here.

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.650
All of you sitting down.
Can you see me? Put your left hand like this.

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:09.484
Just like this in front. Like this in front. This hand like this.

01:10:10.214 --> 01:10:11.983
The right hand has to be moved

01:10:12.195 --> 01:10:16.565
up, front, down, back. Like that clockwise.

01:10:16.861 --> 01:10:21.008
We have to raise. Now, let us raise our Kundalini. Start it moving,

01:10:21.266 --> 01:10:24.861
slowly, like this, like this, like this.

01:10:25.111 --> 01:10:31.247
Throw your hands up, absolutely lose and then give it a twist.

01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:35.356
Throw your head back, and now give it a knot.

01:10:36.368 --> 01:10:39.931
That's one, we have to do it trice. Again let's do it!

01:10:40.209 --> 01:10:44.145
Hold the hand in front and start moving it.

01:10:49.565 --> 01:10:52.596
Take it up through your hands and

01:10:52.712 --> 01:10:55.441
just give it a twist and here it is.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.767
Third time we have to give give three twist.

01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:02.105
You can do it at home.

01:11:05.696 --> 01:11:07.516
Throw  back your hands

01:11:07.759 --> 01:11:11.679
head and hands loose, and give it one,

01:11:12.556 --> 01:11:14.817
then the second one,

01:11:15.623 --> 01:11:20.916
and then the third one like this. Now see if you ???

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.541
Now, that's one thing more one must learn, how to give

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:40.011
protection to your aura? That is very important!

01:11:40.269 --> 01:11:42.371
Protection to your aura, I wish

01:11:42.517 --> 01:11:45.945
people knew how to do it,
they would have saved themselves in many troubles.

01:11:46.124 --> 01:11:49.131
Iis to put your left hand like this.

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:52.198
And with the right hand you move it

01:11:52.404 --> 01:11:56.268
Like this, from here. Move it, one

01:11:57.943 --> 01:12:01.522
Go back. Two.

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:08.400
Is Three,

01:12:10.812 --> 01:12:12.636
Four

01:12:16.245 --> 01:12:18.395
Five

01:12:20.632 --> 01:12:21.752
Six

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:26.169
Seven

01:12:27.655 --> 01:12:34.102
This is how you give protection to yourself. Now, see you vibrations.

01:12:37.129 --> 01:12:39.002
All right? Is better.

01:12:39.248 --> 01:12:42.660
Now, what happens that when you are judging other’s vibrations,

01:12:42.794 --> 01:12:47.183
you can just start judging like this,
it's all right. Or giving bandage like this.

01:12:47.342 --> 01:12:49.839
bandage of love. Because it is felt your hands

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.575
when you move your hands actually

01:12:51.737 --> 01:12:54.673
the powers is flowing to, through your hands [INAUDABLE].

01:12:54.810 --> 01:12:56.397
So watch your manouvering

01:12:56.544 --> 01:13:00.242
So you give it a bandhan, like you have a [INAUDABLE].

01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:02.673
like that to him, and then sit the vibrations.

01:13:02.835 --> 01:13:05.136
Now, if you want to see your own vibrations

01:13:05.289 --> 01:13:09.629
you give yourself a bandhan like
this, and then see your own rubbish.

01:13:11.759 --> 01:13:16.917
You try tonight. Don’t talk too much
about it, don't argue. You are beyond mind.

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:19.192
And that’s why I don’t argue about it.

01:13:19.497 --> 01:13:21.949
The becoming is the most important part

01:13:22.159 --> 01:13:24.698
that it is the difficult part of Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:24.858 --> 01:13:27.095
It is like no other thing that

01:13:27.187 --> 01:13:31.234
here, unless and until become it is of no use. You have to become

01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:38.021
then you have to grow, then you
have to become the expert, ultimately the master.

01:13:38.452 --> 01:13:41.300
That’s what it is. And for whrich you can not pay.

01:13:41.527 --> 01:13:43.347
May God bless you.

01:13:48.556 --> 01:13:53.715
Yogi: [INAUDABLE]  Tomorrow night program is here.

01:13:54.449 --> 01:13:55.980

Please give your address and telephone
number. We’ll contact you to let you know the followup meetings.

01:14:05.422 --> 01:14:10.908

01:14:11.787 --> 01:14:17.915
We’ll see you tomorrow night. Good evening.

01:14:30.492 --> 01:14:38.031
Those who want to meet Shri Mataji tomorrow evening,
She will spare a few minutes to meet you all. Tonight

01:14:38.134 --> 01:14:41.597
She’s just come back from San Diego, and rather tired.

01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:43.825
So, tomorrow evening it will be a good chance.

01:14:43.992 --> 01:14:48.472
She’ll spend some time with you all here after the program.

01:14:49.283 --> 01:14:51.384
Yogini: [INAUDABLE]  Shri Mataji some tea?

01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:54.525
Yogi: No, no let's go.

01:14:55.009 --> 01:14:56.689
How are you?

01:14:56.954 --> 01:15:03.542
Shri Mataji: Lookin fine.
"I assume so." [INAUDABLE]

01:15:20.264 --> 01:15:26.137
Someone: It's shameful what She said.
Yogi: We will do something. Thank you very much.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:44.771
Anybody going to the seminar at the weekend?

01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:49.787
Would you be kind enough to just have
a word with Brian Bell, who’s standing here with his hand up.

01:15:49.973 --> 01:15:53.809
Because you may be able to help
with transport arrangements for other people.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:55.054
It’s a long way

01:15:55.155 --> 01:16:00.221
Brian will deal with those people
going to the seminar, who may be able to help with transport.
