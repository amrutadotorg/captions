00:05.200 --> 00:09.120
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

00:09.280 --> 00:13.240
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:13.400 --> 00:18.280
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.440
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

00:38.600 --> 00:41.520
and new has started.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.800
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:55.520 --> 01:01.440
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.840
And gradually –

01:21.680 --> 01:27.520
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

01:29.120 --> 01:36.120
and gradually moving towards the completion,

01:37.000 --> 01:45.120
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

01:58.600 --> 02:04.040
It is a very natural process of growth

02:04.200 --> 02:07.240
that you have gone through.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.760
The first one was, we can say,

02:17.920 --> 02:22.680
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

02:27.480 --> 02:33.400
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

02:38.120 --> 02:42.920
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

02:43.080 --> 02:47.960
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.680
And you have the chakras same way built in,

02:58.840 --> 03:01.840
in your Sahasrara.

03:09.280 --> 03:15.200
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

03:15.360 --> 03:19.400
the deities in your centers,

03:20.000 --> 03:27.120
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

03:36.320 --> 03:41.400
But now the time has come for us to spread it

03:42.160 --> 03:45.600
on a horizontal level.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.920
And to move it on the horizontal level,

03:55.080 --> 03:59.160
we have to understand how to go about it.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.000
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.720
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.800
of the chakras.

04:33.480 --> 04:38.840
And when we start it from the back,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.320
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

04:43.480 --> 04:52.920
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

04:53.080 --> 04:56.160
if you see it clearly.

05:14.920 --> 05:22.600
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

05:22.760 --> 05:27.200
because it's a concave replacement,

05:27.360 --> 05:34.040
is important to understand that the center

05:34.200 --> 05:44.120
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

05:59.160 --> 06:07.560
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.720
I hope you understand what I mean.

06:31.120 --> 06:37.120
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

06:37.280 --> 06:43.160
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

06:53.440 --> 07:01.160
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

07:01.320 --> 07:05.680
the Atma, coincide.

07:12.480 --> 07:19.840
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

07:20.000 --> 07:22.400
that is the Atma.

07:34.760 --> 07:39.200
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

07:45.400 --> 07:54.280
At this point of time it is very important to understand

07:54.440 --> 08:00.080
that we have to take a bigger step.

08:10.920 --> 08:17.960
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

08:18.120 --> 08:23.040
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

08:23.200 --> 08:34.320
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

08:51.840 --> 08:57.880
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

08:58.040 --> 09:03.440
of all the incarnations is compassion,

09:03.600 --> 09:09.520
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

09:23.080 --> 09:27.520
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

09:27.680 --> 09:32.560
we have to have compassion.

09:42.960 --> 09:48.680
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

09:51.920 --> 09:56.600
If God Almighty had no compassion,

09:56.760 --> 10:05.720
He would not have created this great universe.

10:12.520 --> 10:16.560
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

10:16.720 --> 10:21.720
is the embodiment of His compassion.

10:28.760 --> 10:35.360
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

10:35.520 --> 10:42.360
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

10:52.720 --> 10:58.600
And compassion is always completely covered

10:58.760 --> 11:01.760
with forgiveness.

11:10.640 --> 11:16.640
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

11:19.320 --> 11:25.760
The Son of God is forgiveness,

11:25.920 --> 11:29.120
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

11:34.760 --> 11:40.040
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

11:40.880 --> 11:43.520
the Mother who is the compassion

11:43.680 --> 11:45.760
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

11:45.920 --> 11:52.720
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

12:08.120 --> 12:19.000
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

12:26.840 --> 12:32.800
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

12:39.440 --> 12:47.520
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

12:47.680 --> 12:49.840
as you think it to be,

12:50.000 --> 12:55.840
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

13:05.200 --> 13:10.360
To develop this, you have to pay attention

13:10.520 --> 13:16.760
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

13:30.160 --> 13:34.960
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

13:35.120 --> 13:42.280
then there you must establish the deity.

13:53.720 --> 14:00.520
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.160
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

14:08.320 --> 14:11.160
in person with you.

14:24.120 --> 14:29.520
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

14:29.680 --> 14:33.560
had to imagine the deities,

14:41.480 --> 14:47.600
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

14:52.240 --> 14:58.280
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

15:03.000 --> 15:06.280
that is how it is described –

15:07.240 --> 15:11.720
so if you also see the person,

15:11.880 --> 15:14.840
you may not be knowing fully that person

15:15.000 --> 15:19.200
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.720
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

15:29.880 --> 15:32.600
than your imagination.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.400
That is why one has to surrender.

15:44.440 --> 15:50.200
With your limited imagination of brain,

15:50.360 --> 15:55.840
one cannot see the deity.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.200
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

16:05.360 --> 16:10.280
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.680
So the devotion has to be there,

16:17.840 --> 16:23.040
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

16:23.200 --> 16:25.880
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.200
Heart should be clean.

16:37.280 --> 16:41.520
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

16:48.120 --> 16:53.320
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

16:53.480 --> 16:56.320
of reality,

16:59.520 --> 17:03.360
but reality is absolute.

17:04.680 --> 17:10.200
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

17:10.360 --> 17:17.320
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

17:22.400 --> 17:30.320
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.160
not with very clean heart.

17:42.760 --> 17:46.520
At that time we had lots of attachments,

17:48.520 --> 17:53.600
we were identified with false things.

17:56.200 --> 18:02.000
And also we thought by getting realization

18:02.160 --> 18:06.360
we’ll become very powerful people.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.520
After realization also,

18:18.680 --> 18:23.520
we started indulging into petty things.

18:29.920 --> 18:35.760
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

18:35.920 --> 18:39.080
mothers, sisters;

18:43.200 --> 18:46.920
and the women thought of their husbands

18:47.080 --> 18:52.120
and their brothers, children.

18:55.200 --> 19:00.120
They all asked for the blessings of all those

19:00.280 --> 19:04.200
with whom they were entangled.

19:14.200 --> 19:20.280
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.360
Now the job of a Avatara is such

19:34.520 --> 19:40.480
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

19:45.920 --> 19:51.880
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

19:52.040 --> 19:58.120
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

20:11.600 --> 20:16.200
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

20:16.360 --> 20:18.080
“we want You to be with us,

20:18.240 --> 20:22.080
individually with every one of us.”

20:31.200 --> 20:34.760
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

20:34.920 --> 20:39.880
and He was with every one of them.

20:46.200 --> 20:50.600
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

20:50.760 --> 20:55.760
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

20:57.280 --> 21:00.040
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

21:00.200 --> 21:03.840
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.080
whatever was possible.

21:12.680 --> 21:16.120
Also the kshema that you asked for,

21:16.280 --> 21:18.520
ashrams you asked for,

21:18.680 --> 21:22.800
all the things that you needed,

21:24.360 --> 21:30.520
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.960
So at the Krishna's level it was

21:43.120 --> 21:45.200
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

21:45.360 --> 21:50.040
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

21:59.320 --> 22:02.760
because it was promised.

22:03.960 --> 22:08.960
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

22:13.960 --> 22:18.160
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

22:18.320 --> 22:27.360
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

22:41.960 --> 22:46.840
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

22:49.320 --> 22:54.280
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

22:58.480 --> 23:03.440
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

23:03.600 --> 23:08.600
may dim out, or may be defective.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.360
So, all the chakras that are within us

23:19.520 --> 23:22.520
are to be looked after.

23:28.360 --> 23:35.680
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

23:36.920 --> 23:41.920
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

23:57.080 --> 24:01.160
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

24:05.040 --> 24:09.640
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

24:09.800 --> 24:14.640
establish Him through your thought –

24:14.800 --> 24:18.320
because now your thought is divine –

24:18.480 --> 24:23.320
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

24:44.600 --> 24:50.680
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

24:50.840 --> 24:54.200
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

24:54.360 --> 24:55.720
of these things to you, of …

24:55.880 --> 25:02.400
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

25:08.520 --> 25:13.760
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.760
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

25:17.920 --> 25:21.920
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.880
And that's the country.

25:32.240 --> 25:36.920
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

25:37.080 --> 25:42.040
put your feelings towards Him,

25:49.760 --> 25:58.680
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.120
And then to manifest compassion,

26:06.280 --> 26:10.160
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

26:10.320 --> 26:16.960
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

26:17.120 --> 26:22.080
to all the people of the world."

26:31.280 --> 26:35.480
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

26:35.640 --> 26:40.160
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

26:40.320 --> 26:44.240
you have no right to ask.

26:53.160 --> 26:58.080
So to understand innocence

26:58.240 --> 27:00.720
you should try to understand yourself,

27:00.880 --> 27:04.800
how your mind is working.

27:10.640 --> 27:17.480
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

27:17.640 --> 27:20.640
should possess that person?

27:20.800 --> 27:26.160
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

27:26.320 --> 27:30.240
comes into your mind?

27:44.200 --> 27:46.600
For an innocent person,

27:46.760 --> 27:50.360
a beautiful person, or a woman,

27:50.520 --> 27:54.720
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

27:54.880 --> 27:57.720
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

27:57.880 --> 28:00.760
there’s no thought.

28:14.480 --> 28:18.360
So if there is no thought, there's no question

28:18.520 --> 28:21.640
of having any expression of possessiveness

28:21.800 --> 28:25.720
or any kind of a baser feeling.

28:38.280 --> 28:44.760
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

28:44.920 --> 28:48.480
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

28:48.640 --> 28:53.720
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

28:53.880 --> 29:03.680
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

29:17.160 --> 29:24.480
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

29:24.640 --> 29:28.520
they feel I am innocent."

29:36.280 --> 29:39.360
This is compassion,

29:40.840 --> 29:44.840
the compassion to ask Him to give you

29:45.000 --> 29:49.920
the power of compassion itself.

30:01.320 --> 30:07.520
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

30:07.680 --> 30:14.640
the light starts moving horizontally;

30:26.160 --> 30:33.160
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

30:34.920 --> 30:40.840
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.960
You don't become stupid or childish,

30:48.120 --> 30:51.200
but you become child-like.

30:58.280 --> 31:06.320
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.880
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

31:14.040 --> 31:19.000
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

31:22.800 --> 31:25.960
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

31:26.120 --> 31:28.960
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

31:29.120 --> 31:31.800
to impress others.

31:38.160 --> 31:42.640
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

31:42.800 --> 31:49.720
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

31:49.880 --> 31:53.040
of deliberations.

32:01.640 --> 32:09.520
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

32:17.920 --> 32:22.440
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

32:22.600 --> 32:28.320
expressing itself on horizontal level,

32:28.480 --> 32:32.600
that you become discreet.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.760
But that is a power, I'm again say,

32:43.920 --> 32:47.920
the power of discretion you develop.

32:52.480 --> 32:55.800
Now one must understand the difference between

32:55.960 --> 33:00.800
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

33:03.880 --> 33:07.880
So “the power” means it acts.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.360
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

33:16.280 --> 33:18.320
but if you are standing somewhere

33:18.480 --> 33:23.440
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

33:32.600 --> 33:36.200
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

33:36.360 --> 33:39.840
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

33:56.200 --> 34:04.640
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

34:04.800 --> 34:07.480
that acts by itself.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.360
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

34:10.520 --> 34:12.760
but you just become the vehicle,

34:12.920 --> 34:17.720
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

34:31.560 --> 34:34.080
Then you should believe,

34:34.240 --> 34:38.200
now you are spreading horizontally.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.600
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

34:51.760 --> 34:56.440
you needed to see Me in person.

34:57.440 --> 35:01.120
You needed to see Me in person.

35:05.680 --> 35:10.840
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.120
You wanted the target in front of you.

35:23.200 --> 35:28.360
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

35:28.800 --> 35:32.400
whatever is to be achieved.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.960
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

35:38.120 --> 35:42.000
So now when you wanted that all the time,

35:42.160 --> 35:47.720
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

35:47.880 --> 35:52.720
when you had that in person before you.

36:03.320 --> 36:07.080
Then in the second era, now,

36:07.240 --> 36:12.640
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

36:12.800 --> 36:16.200
you'll take it over from Me.

36:30.560 --> 36:35.400
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

36:38.560 --> 36:44.600
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.360
I am with you, you know that;

36:53.520 --> 36:55.320
but need not be in this body,

36:55.480 --> 37:00.360
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.880
But once this desire starts working,

37:10.040 --> 37:14.760
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.960
When the child is born to a mother,

37:26.120 --> 37:30.520
automatically she gets milk.

37:37.440 --> 37:42.520
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

37:42.680 --> 37:47.800
In your divine desire also it is connected.

37:56.760 --> 38:01.840
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.400
So you may find Me anywhere:

38:06.560 --> 38:08.480
you are walking on the street,

38:08.640 --> 38:12.720
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

38:24.880 --> 38:29.320
So this is the second era we have started,

38:29.480 --> 38:31.760
and you should not be shocked

38:31.920 --> 38:35.600
if you see Me sitting on your bed

38:35.760 --> 38:40.520
and putting My hand on your head.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.600
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

39:00.760 --> 39:03.800
walking into your room,

39:08.160 --> 39:11.560
or as Shri Rama.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.520
That has to happen,

39:15.680 --> 39:18.720
so you should be prepared.

39:25.960 --> 39:29.280
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

39:29.440 --> 39:32.520
but on a grosser level.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.400
We have seen the light coming on My head,

39:40.560 --> 39:45.320
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.360
But many things will happen,

39:54.520 --> 39:59.480
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.040
This has to happen, just to convince you

40:11.200 --> 40:16.640
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

40:16.800 --> 40:22.880
in the new area of Pragyalok.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.480
Because this is a new state into which

40:34.640 --> 40:39.600
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

40:46.360 --> 40:54.520
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

41:01.920 --> 41:11.320
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.080
The asking will disappear,

41:19.520 --> 41:24.400
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

41:29.280 --> 41:33.400
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

41:36.840 --> 41:46.760
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

41:54.640 --> 42:04.680
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

42:09.960 --> 42:14.840
Now the new work of compassion,

42:15.000 --> 42:21.160
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

42:33.880 --> 42:37.320
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

42:37.480 --> 42:44.400
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

42:52.600 --> 42:57.360
So you become the giver of compassion.

43:01.400 --> 43:04.840
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

43:05.000 --> 43:10.160
I have requested you how to do tapah.

43:12.720 --> 43:15.360
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

43:26.840 --> 43:34.040
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

43:34.200 --> 43:39.880
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.560
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

43:59.720 --> 44:02.160
that you have to do, because I am told

44:02.320 --> 44:08.160
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

44:08.320 --> 44:10.760
and you people suffered a little bit

44:10.920 --> 44:14.920
on your way for the pilgrimage.

44:23.280 --> 44:33.920
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

44:34.080 --> 44:37.480
where the devils dare not go.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.040
Fun: no word!

44:43.200 --> 44:49.280
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

45:03.360 --> 45:09.040
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

45:09.200 --> 45:12.400
discomforts, then you should know

45:12.560 --> 45:14.680
you are on the right lights.

45:27.360 --> 45:32.440
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

45:32.600 --> 45:36.440
you should know you are progressing well.

45:42.800 --> 45:45.800
As you become more peaceful and your temper

45:46.040 --> 45:49.920
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

45:50.080 --> 45:56.080
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

46:14.680 --> 46:23.320
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

46:23.480 --> 46:28.240
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

46:28.400 --> 46:31.840
then know that you are progressing.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.880
No amount ….

46:45.880 --> 46:52.280
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

46:52.440 --> 46:56.280
then know that you are progressing.

47:04.360 --> 47:13.200
No amount of material well-being in others

47:13.360 --> 47:18.240
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

47:18.400 --> 47:22.360
then know that you are progressing well.

47:32.200 --> 47:37.000
No amount of

47:42.680 --> 47:45.840
labor or

47:46.960 --> 47:58.000
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

47:58.160 --> 48:02.560
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

48:02.720 --> 48:08.760
while you have got it without any effort.

48:08.920 --> 48:12.800
So you are something special.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.800
So this, once you understand that you are special,

48:25.960 --> 48:29.960
you will become humble about it.

48:35.440 --> 48:41.120
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

48:41.280 --> 48:43.920
when you see you have achieved something,

48:44.080 --> 48:46.160
that you have some powers,

48:46.320 --> 48:52.080
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

48:52.400 --> 48:56.800
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

48:56.960 --> 49:01.040
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

49:01.200 --> 49:04.440
then you should believe

49:04.600 --> 49:09.480
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

49:27.920 --> 49:35.120
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

49:35.280 --> 49:44.760
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

49:55.840 --> 50:02.080
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

50:02.240 --> 50:05.200
you will be in meditation;

50:10.600 --> 50:16.160
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

50:24.520 --> 50:33.040
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.960
This is what you are in for;

50:39.120 --> 50:45.160
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

50:45.320 --> 50:49.360
on this great day of Sahasrara.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.640
May God bless you all.
