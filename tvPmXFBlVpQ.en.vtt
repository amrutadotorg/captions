00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.120
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.240
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.280
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.440
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.520
and new has started.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.800
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.440
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.840
And gradually –

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.520
(it’s not on My …, that’s the point, it’s …, that’s better) –

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.120
and gradually moving towards the completion,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.120
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.040
It is a very natural process of growth

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.240
that you have gone through.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.760
The first one was, we can say,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.680
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.400
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.920
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.960
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.680
And you have the chakras same way built in,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.840
in your Sahasrara.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.200
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.400
the deities in your centers,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.120
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.400
But now the time has come for us to spread it

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.600
on a horizontal level.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.920
And to move it on the horizontal level,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.160
we have to understand how to go about it.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.000
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.720
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.800
of the chakras.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.840
And when we start it from the back,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.320
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:52.920
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.160
if you see it clearly.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.600
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.200
because it's a concave replacement,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.040
is important to understand that the center

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:44.120
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.560
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.720
I hope you understand what I mean.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.120
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.160
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:01.160
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.680
the Atma, coincide.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:19.840
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.400
that is the Atma.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.200
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:54.280
At this point of time it is very important to understand

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.080
that we have to take a bigger step.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.960
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:23.040
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:34.320
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.880
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.440
of all the incarnations is compassion,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.520
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.520
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.560
we have to have compassion.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:48.680
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.600
If God Almighty had no compassion,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:05.720
He would not have created this great universe.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.560
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.720
is the embodiment of His compassion.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:35.360
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.360
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.600
And compassion is always completely covered

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.760
with forgiveness.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.640
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.760
The Son of God is forgiveness,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.120
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.040
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.520
the Mother who is the compassion

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.760
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.720
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:19.000
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.800
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:47.520
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.840
as you think it to be,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.840
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.360
To develop this, you have to pay attention

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.760
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.960
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:42.280
then there you must establish the deity.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.520
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.160
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.160
in person with you.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.520
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.560
had to imagine the deities,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.600
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:58.280
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.280
that is how it is described –

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.720
so if you also see the person,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.840
you may not be knowing fully that person

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.200
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.720
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.600
than your imagination.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.400
That is why one has to surrender.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.200
With your limited imagination of brain,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.840
one cannot see the deity.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.200
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.280
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:17.680
So the devotion has to be there,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.040
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.880
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.200
Heart should be clean.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.520
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.320
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.320
of reality,

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.360
but reality is absolute.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:10.200
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.320
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:30.320
So in the beginning we try to achieve our realization,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.160
not with very clean heart.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.520
At that time we had lots of attachments,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.600
we were identified with false things.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:02.000
And also we thought by getting realization

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.360
we’ll become very powerful people.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.520
After realization also,

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.520
we started indulging into petty things.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.760
We started asking for favors for our relations, friends,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.080
mothers, sisters;

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.920
and the women thought of their husbands

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:52.120
and their brothers, children.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.120
They all asked for the blessings of all those

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.200
with whom they were entangled.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.280
All this entanglement you got over, I know, very soon.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.360
Now the job of a Avatara is such

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:40.480
that He has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.880
The job of an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.120
the desires of His bhaktas, His disciples.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.200
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by gopis that

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.080
“we want You to be with us,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.080
individually with every one of us.”

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.760
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.880
and He was with every one of them.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.600
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.760
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.040
But when you asked Me about your brothers, sisters,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.840
mothers, fathers, I tried to do that,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.080
whatever was possible.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.120
Also the kshema that you asked for,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.520
ashrams you asked for,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.800
all the things that you needed,

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:30.520
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.960
So at the Krishna's level it was

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.200
"Yoga kshemam vahamyaham."

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.040
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's level,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.760
because it was promised.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.960
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.160
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:27.360
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:46.840
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.280
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.440
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.600
may dim out, or may be defective.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.360
So, all the chakras that are within us

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.520
are to be looked after.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:35.680
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.920
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.160
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.640
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha and

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.640
establish Him through your thought –

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.320
because now your thought is divine –

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.320
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great respect.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.680
Here now, you have to know that in the first era

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.200
of Sahaja Yoga I could not have talked of these things to

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.720
of these things to you, of …

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.400
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.760
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.760
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.920
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.880
And that's the country.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.920
Now when you put your attention onto that chakra,

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.040
put your feelings towards Him,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:58.680
of feeling of love and adoration to Him, to begin with.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.120
And then to manifest compassion,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.160
you have to ask nothing but one thing,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:16.960
that "O God of Innocence, give innocence

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.080
to all the people of the world."

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.480
But first you have to be innocent to ask that;

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.160
otherwise it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:44.240
you have no right to ask.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:58.080
So to understand innocence

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.720
you should try to understand yourself,

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.800
how your mind is working.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:17.480
When you, say, look at anyone, do you feel that you

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.640
should possess that person?

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.160
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something base feeling

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.240
comes into your mind?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.600
For an innocent person,

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.360
a beautiful person, or a woman,

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.720
or a beautiful scene or a beautiful creation,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.720
the first thing should happen that he becomes thoughtless –

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.760
there’s no thought.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.360
So if there is no thought, there's no question

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.640
of having any expression of possessiveness

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.720
or any kind of a baser feeling.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:44.760
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also unauthorized

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.480
a little bit, that "Please make me innocent,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.720
so that I'm empowered to ask You for this boon,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:03.680
that wherever I go I become the source of innocence.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:24.480
So that I emit innocence: when people look at me,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.520
they feel I am innocent."

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.360
This is compassion,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.840
the compassion to ask Him to give you

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.920
the power of compassion itself.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:07.520
So that, as you see here these beautiful centers, as if

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:14.640
the light starts moving horizontally;

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:33.160
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous system.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.840
So you become the powerful innocence yourself.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.960
You don't become stupid or childish,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.200
but you become child-like.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:06.320
The whole behavior is extremely dignified and innocent.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.880
Normally if you find a person who is dignified,

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.000
is normally he’s not an innocent person,

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.960
because he puts up a show – it's a deliberation

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.960
to become serious and show that he’s very dignified,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.800
to impress others.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.640
And child doesn’t put up the show of innocence, of

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:49.720
of dignity or anything, because the child is not aware

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.040
of deliberations.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:09.520
But you develop that rare combination of innocent dignity.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.440
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha starts

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:28.320
expressing itself on horizontal level,

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.600
that you become discreet.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.760
But that is a power, I'm again say,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.920
the power of discretion you develop.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.800
Now one must understand the difference between

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.800
the power of discretion, and discretion itself.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.880
So “the power” means it acts.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.360
For example, you may not speak, but if you are

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.320
but if you are standing somewhere

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.440
the discretion itself will act in the situation.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.200
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good Sahaja yogi,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.840
is going in a train, and the train has an accident –

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
mostly it will not have, but has – nobody will die.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:04.640
So you establish the discretion which is power itself,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.480
that acts by itself.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.360
You don't have to say that you act, it acts,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.760
but you just become the vehicle,

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.720
a beautiful clean vehicle of that discretion.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.080
Then you should believe,

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:38.200
now you are spreading horizontally.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.600
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:56.440
you needed to see Me in person.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.120
You needed to see Me in person.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.840
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”: is the target.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.120
You wanted the target in front of you.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.360
(But see, there’s no word in English!) Dhyeya:

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.400
whatever is to be achieved.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.960
(Because there’s no word in the English language, what to do?)

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:42.000
So now when you wanted that all the time,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:47.720
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.720
when you had that in person before you.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.080
Then in the second era, now,

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.640
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.200
you'll take it over from Me.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.400
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:44.600
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.360
I am with you, you know that;

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.320
but need not be in this body,

00:36:55.480 --> 00:37:00.360
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.880
But once this desire starts working,

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.760
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.960
When the child is born to a mother,

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.520
automatically she gets milk.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:42.520
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.800
In your divine desire also it is connected.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.840
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.400
So you may find Me anywhere:

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.480
you are walking on the street,

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.720
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.320
So this is the second era we have started,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.760
and you should not be shocked

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.600
if you see Me sitting on your bed

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.520
and putting My hand on your head.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.600
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.800
walking into your room,

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.560
or as Shri Rama.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.520
That has to happen,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.720
so you should be prepared.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.280
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.520
but on a grosser level.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.400
We have seen the light coming on My head,

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.320
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.360
But many things will happen,

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.480
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.040
This has to happen, just to convince you

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.640
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.880
in the new area of Pragyalok.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.480
Because this is a new state into which

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.600
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:54.520
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:11.320
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.080
The asking will disappear,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:24.400
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:33.400
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:46.760
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:04.680
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.840
Now the new work of compassion,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.160
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.320
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:44.400
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.360
So you become the giver of compassion.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.840
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.160
I have requested you how to do tapah.

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.360
(Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.)

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:34.040
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:39.880
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:59.560
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.160
that you have to do, because I am told

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:08.160
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.760
and you people suffered a little bit

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.920
on your way for the pilgrimage.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:33.920
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.480
where the devils dare not go.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.040
Fun: no word!

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:49.280
They have never fun! Let us see, it is miserable!

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.040
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.400
discomforts, then you should know

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.680
you are on the right lights.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.440
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:36.440
you should know you are progressing well.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.800
As you become more peaceful and your temper

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.920
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.080
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:23.320
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.240
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.840
then know that you are progressing.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.880
No amount ….

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:52.280
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:56.280
then know that you are progressing.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:13.200
No amount of material well-being in others

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.240
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.360
then know that you are progressing well.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.000
No amount of

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.840
labor or

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:58.000
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.560
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:08.760
while you have got it without any effort.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.800
So you are something special.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.800
So this, once you understand that you are special,

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.960
you will become humble about it.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.120
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.920
when you see you have achieved something,

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.160
that you have some powers,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.080
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.800
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.040
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.440
then you should believe

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:09.480
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:35.120
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:44.760
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:02.080
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.200
you will be in meditation;

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:16.160
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:33.040
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.960
This is what you are in for;

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:45.160
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.360
on this great day of Sahasrara.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.640
May God bless you all.
