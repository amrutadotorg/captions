00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.160
I've heard that You've been [UNCLEAR] in some of very great [UNCLEAR] and myself I was born in

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.900
- [UNCLEAR - LIFEBERG?] island in the Indian Sea and have heard that You've been to Greece.
- Oh, Greece tremendous!

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.500
Tremendous people -  Greeks.  You see, they're very traditional; They're very traditional people and

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.980
they understand this, you see, and you had such great philosophers like Socrates, so, I mean,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.320
is all in-built within them absolutely

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.080
and they're very subtle people also. They understand serenity. I mean,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.880
in the whole of Europe I never heard this word anywhere except in Greece - the word serenity

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.300
- and it's beautiful.
- Could you tell me what's the record of your philosophy?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.840
Alright. The, you see, the philosophy is actually the practical side of it.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.580
Whatever has been the philosophy so far that you have to know yourself. 'Know Thyself' - also Socrates said the same thing

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.600
and Christ said the same thing, that you are to be born again.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.240
All the scriptures, all the saints have said, 'You are to be born again' or 'You have to know yourself.' Now how to do it.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.820
See, how to achieve it was the problem which now is being solved.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.880
Not only that is solved for one person but solved for many because you can do it enmasse

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
because we have a power within us; I think the Greeks knew about it

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.880
because they called this triangular bone as Sacrum, meaning sacred.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.580
So they knew there's this power, sacred power inside that and this is the power when is awakened

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.640
and passes through six subtle centers, pierces through your fontanel bone area, you

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.460
get in touch with that All-Pervading subtle power about which all these saints have talked

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.240
and then you start feeling the cool breeze on your finger-tips - also you start feeling the cool breeze on top of your head.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.500
Then this power is your new dimension to your Central Nervous system.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.340
You see, early Christians called themselves 'Gnostics'.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.440
'Gna' in Sanskrit language means to know and we used to call it same thing.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.620
- How do you get to know yourself?
- Haan, yes. Now this is what happens that yourself, is the seat of yourself is here

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.440
but is reflected in your heart and as soon as this happens, first of all,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.140
you come to know about your subtle centers which are within you - which you do not know so far - on your finger-tips you know.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.880
These are all Sympathetic Nervous system uh..

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.980
centers which are expressed on the right and the left hand so,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.800
whatever is the problem you can feel it on your finger-tips, so you know at least the centers that you have.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.460
Now these centers are for your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being so immediately you find out what's the problem with you.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.420
Then also you develop another dimension on your Central Nervous system

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.660
that you become collectively conscious - means you can feel others.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.160
You can feel everyone what's the problem with that person - only on the centers. When that happens

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.900
and if you know how to correct it, you can cure diseases, you can cure mental troubles

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.460
and whatever is promised; Then you become the Spirit, you become the witness

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.720
and you become the peaceful personality, you and also you become joy.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.340
- But in practical terms, how do we start, what do we do first?
- It's very simple. It's a, it's a living process of evolution.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.060
As we have become human-beings, we can also become super human-beings - not so difficult but only it's like this that one enlightened,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.040
- one enlightened candle can enlighten another - that's all. So supposing, I
 - I want to be enlightened

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.960
- Yes
- what do I do?
- Nothing, you just have to put hands like this and you get it.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.000
Once you get it, you just practice it a little bit and understand all the permutations and combination, then you can give it to others.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.720
It's so simple as that.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.180
You believe that there are no problems, that there are no problems that human-beings cannot handle - is that so?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.260
So many problems. First of all they are not at all collective by temperament

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.420
- they are collective outside. Now supposing, you follow any religion, any religion whatsoever, you can commit any sin - there's no bondage

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.820
but once it happens, you just become absolutely righteous - just don't do wrong things;

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.660
Become so powerful and so compassionate; So many diseases which are incurable are cured by this.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.000
- Could You explain little bit on this?
- How it happens?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.260
- How it happens, yes.
- Okay, it's very simple.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:25.000
Like this is the left and the right side - left sympathetic and right sympathetic - in the center is the Parasympathetic Nervous system.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:33.000
Now this, these are the centers, you can say, at different positions in the spinal cord and it's all them play.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:40.940
Now what happens that, any diseases caused by the, by the constriction of these

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.880
centers. Now supposing you are using your left side - means you are very emotional, cry too much, think of your past and all that

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.640
- supposing, supposing
- [LAUGHTER] exactly. Could you take it further from that side? That's exactly what

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.860
[YOGINIS CONVERSATION UNCLEAR]

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.600
- Yes I'm very emotional, how can I [UNCLEAR]
- I could see that. On your centers I can feel in it you are an emotional personality.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.020
- Yes, I don't like [UNCLEAR] - how can I cope with the situation?
- That's what I was saying. Now what happens, the right side

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.660
is the one which balances it here - now the left and the right - but you start moving out because you use too much of left

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.020
so the control of the right is gone - the balance is lost; Apart from that, sometimes you may just break and then

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.460
all kinds of diseases can start on it's own and you cannot control it because there's no connection with the whole.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.580
- So you need what, self-discipline?
- No, nothing. You just have to get realization so that this power, which I call as Kundalini,

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.320
which is placed in the Sacrum bone, rises, passes through this and integrates them

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:00.540
and pierces through this so that you become in contact with the mains, you can say; Like any machinery has to be in contact with the mains,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.600
you become in contact with that all the time - you feel very energetic, very dynamic

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.280
and very compassionate, very righteous and you enjoy your virtues.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.920
- So what do I say to my readers that they want to be enlightened? How do they start - I still don't get it.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.800
You just come to My programs and it will happen. I, I'll do it for them and then they have to do it for others - that's all.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.980
- It will work out in the programs.
- I'll be here throughout all the time but

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:42.100
- You may be in other part of the world.
- Beg your pardon? Yes, I am, I am.
- And uh..

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.620
- I believe that You had a grand success but personally are You satisfied with your results?
- Very much!

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:55.940
Even in Russia I was very much satisfied; Russian people are the best. Turned out to be the best - who never believed in God,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:02.040
no religion, nothing but such a clean slate, you see - wonderful people! Even the government has accepted us there;

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.120
Even in India because there are three doctors who got their MD from, for sahaja yoga,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:16.220
that the way they cured Psychosomatic diseases, epilepsy, asthma, so many diseases; Even in Russia we have cured some people.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:22.500
- What's the place of God in Your philosophy?
- God is everywhere - without Him nothing.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.480
His power, All-Pervading power - it's His own power of love, so God is everything.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:37.600
Uh..but You don't seem to approve of the way the various religious [UNCLEAR] all of God or the way that

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:45.000
Even interpretations are wrong absolutely because they are money-oriented but

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.760
actually if you see the interpretation of God is we should go to the Incarnations,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.000
to the people who established it, to Christ. Say, if you are a Muslim, then

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.520
ask Mohammad. Mohammad himself has said, "Your hands will speak when the resurrection will come," He said it.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.440
What about [UNCLEAR] Christianity, for instance, I mean Orthodox Christians?

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:14.700
You see, Christianity is just a, it's a - I was also born in a Christian religion so there's no problem to explain that

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:23.100
but Christ has said that, "You are to be born again," but it's a social thing, only it's a just a social thing

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.120
and Christians can go to any limit of uh.. doing all kinds of wrong things - converting people.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:37.020
Like in India, they came with a gun, gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand;

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:43.400
See this kind of a thing - imagine Christ! And what Christ has said in a very subtle way,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.520
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:56.340
It's very difficult to find Christians without adulterous eyes, very difficult, so we have missed the point.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.960
We are not following Christ, we are following some sort of a Christianity which was later on made by Paul, maybe,

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.160
more organisational. You cannot organize God, you cannot pay for it.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.960
How many sahaja yogis there are all over the world - do You know? How many followers do You have?

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.900
I don't know. They have already crossed the mark what John has said about

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.780
144 thousand he said - we have already crossed that mark so, I don't know.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.180
- 144 thousand?
- Yes, maybe more because we are in forty nations.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:44.140
Uh..Forgive me because I ask but in what way sahaja yoga differs from the other forms of

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.420
- Yoga.
- yoga?
- Other yogas are just the wee part of it, you see.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.980
Patanjali wrote about Hatha yoga; He didn't write about this standing on the heads business and all that - that's just a wee part of it

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:04.600
but Hatha yoga means 'Ha' 'Tha', means you have to deal with your right side as well as with your left side

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.800
but they just deal with the right side and physically you may feel fit but such a person can become very dry, might get heart attacks

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:19.280
and is very one-sided life but he talked about the same thing as I did, was to get to your

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.700
state of your mind in thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness - we do the same thing.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.980
Then another yoga is Raja yoga is very prevalent thing which is also [ASIDE - NAKO PANKHA NAHIN]

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.860
which is also a very, uh.. I should say, uh.. very mechanical thing

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:44.600
like, unless and until you ignite the car, the machines won't work

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:52.180
but the modern Raja yoga is like this, that you move the wheels without starting the car. So, in sahaja yoga we start the car

00:11:52.560 --> 00:12:00.260
and then we find out what's wrong with you and then we correct it; It's the other way round and that's why they cut the tongues of people Raja yoga

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.700
and push them back because it happens when Kundalini rises - you won't feel it, nobody feels it -

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.360
but the tongue is little bit pulled in, a little bit, to hold the flow of Kundalini.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:19.960
But that doesn't mean you cut your tongue and push it back and there are people who are wagging their tongues in Los Angeles - some good doctors from here.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.440
Horrible things these yogas have done!

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.940
What place does the exercise in yoga?

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:36.120
Not much. If you, I mean, exercise should be for just for little bit, not much is needed. If you want for your health, is alright

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.180
but not too much of it; Also not good because that puts a strain on your, on your right side.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.080
For example, I have to have lot of water in My body otherwise how will I manage because

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.600
I'm dealing with people and I'm to be protected so, it's alright, I accept it.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:57.800
But these days everybody wants to be like mosquitoes.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.960
- What do You think of the state of the war with as it is today?
- Ah!

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:12.600
Now, one problem is solved because Gorbachev is a enlightened man; One problem is solved to a great extent because he has withdrawn

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.240
from one side so the other side doesn't know whom to fight now so they are also receding back.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:25.060
So this one tension is much less in a way. Also when I went to Russia,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:32.620
actually they were all these third, this Eastern Bloc was there - all of them - and I gave all of them realization.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.560
When they came back to their own countries, the Berlin wall fell down.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.480
So, the enlightenment gives you strength and sense of honor - just fell down -

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.720
and, so now, that problem, is partially or quite a lot, is solved

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.520
but the second problem is of fundamentalism. Everybody thinks they are chosen ones,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.000
and they think they are the best. They are all just the same - no difference.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:11.600
- Are You talking about the politicians or [UNCLEAR]
- Oh everyone! Whatever religion they may follow - fundamentalist.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.980
You see, "We are the best," then the politicians. Politicians, I think, they don't believe in God,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.000
that God exists really. If they believed, they would have understood that

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.100
God resides in human-beings and we have to look after them; That's the first duty.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.700
It will happen. People will start coming. We'll have people like Gorbachev then things will change.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:42.820
- So, You are optimistic of
- Very optimistic, very, very optimistic because such a transformation is taking place

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.220
and if human-beings are transformed, things will be transformed completely; All the mess is because of us.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:53.660
But are You happy with the rate at which this transformation is taking place?

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:01.380
- Beg your pardon?
- The rate, the speed. Is it a slow process, are You happy with the

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.520
- the speed, the process, the rate that this change takes place or

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:13.080
- is it too slow or would you like
- It started very slow to begin with because it's a living process.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:21.280
See, if you have to produce one flower, it takes time - real flower - but plastic flowers you can produce any number but now it's taken over, I think

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:28.040
the speed has increased very much everywhere - it's progressing very fast and things will work out.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.980
Now, what we need is this, certain number of people in any country and it will trigger out.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:40.080
It's like that 100 monkey phenomena, as you call it, that kind - that has to happen. A certain number of

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.500
of people have to really become established and the whole thing will be transformed.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.160
In which part of the world Your sahaja yogis are spread more than any other,

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.820
- than other parts of the world?
- Of course in India.
- India, yes.
- India is the maximum.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.340
- About India.
- Indians are very, sort of, they have these basics with them

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.000
-  but I should say the best sahaja yogis now are in Austria; They are very good sahaja yogis in Austria

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.200
and also we have now Russia, I should say.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.840
Can you imagine that Germans went to Russia to give them enlightenment! To Russians - Germans.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:27.040
- Such a change!
- Hmm, [UNCLEAR] the Western. Germans.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:35.240
Germans are from Germany. We have disciples there in Germany; They all went down, rushed to Russia to help them out.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.360
- Remarkable!
- So,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:46.520
- what are You going to do during Your visit here apart from giving lectures?
- I have programs. I think, we have two programs tomorrow and day after

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.940
and there I'll give enlightenment to people. Now it works enmasse, it works enmasse.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:58.980
- Can You give enlightenment to me now?
- They are all enlightened people sitting here.
- What about me now - I'm not.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:06.360
- To you I'll give you, I'll give you, I'll give you
- I would love to be realized [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, that's very great. That's why Greeks are very good.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:13.780
When I went to Athens - now Athena word comes from the Primordial Mother. 'Ath' 'Ath' in Sanskrit means Primordial

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.220
so Athens is very much there. Uh.. and when I went there

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.940
you should have seen the hall and even where we had the hall, the gentleman who owned it, came down he said,

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:36.060
"Better stop now. With so many people we can't have it under certain laws, this," but the people were shouting, big problem there

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:41.500
- two days I had.
- Very emotional Greeks are!
- Very. And apart from that, they are seeking Truth -

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.480
very sincere about it. They don't care for other things much.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.660
It's beautiful people; We have a lawyer here [UNCLEAR] he's looking after them.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.100
And do You [UNCLEAR -THINK?] temperament has anything to do with the enlightment?

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:06.040
- the type of temperament a person has?
- No, no, nothing. You get into balance itself - balance is to be established.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:14.160
I mean, of course, as you said, you are emotional and also Greeks are very emotional people; I mean, when they saw Me there were tears in their eyes, you see,

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.560
and gradually they settled down and things worked; Most of them got realization -

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.960
thousands. Greeks were great, I must say.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.940
I was so happy that You are coming here. I was so happy to hear that because I know Greeks are the ones who will touch very fast.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.120
So, Greeks, Egyptians, Indians, Italians

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.640
- are [UNCLEAR - ANCIENT?] people
- You think they are tuned that way, 'We are seeking the truth [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, because they are very ancient people

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.360
so they have been doing this, you see, trial and error and then trial

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:50.620
and that's how they are, sort of, at a point; They have reached at a point where they,

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.440
they think that now, 'We must find it out what is it.'

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:03.860
- Such philosophies you had!
- When were You in Greece, how long ago?
- About, I think, about 8 months back.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:11.140
Eight months back because I travel the whole year round. In summer time I'm travelling in Europe

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.260
and winter time I'm travelling in India.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:22.680
You always get the same satisfaction, get positive results out there?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.140
In the beginning it was not because is too fantastic to believe, people were not so

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:35.660
but still, I must say, everywhere; I started with one lady and now it's going to be - I started 1970, 5th May

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.600
slowly. Now it's about 19 years completed in May.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.760
What do You do with people that are skeptical about, that they have to worship You?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.280
I don't bother about them. You see, you cannot force it on anyone,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:58.280
you cannot force, you cannot convince it - it's not mental. It has to be asked for, then it works.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.600
It is, gradually they also come

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:08.000
because they see the results on other people, they see the results on their friends and all that - the change, the transformation

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.320
and the beauty of their temperament and then they come themselves but,

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:19.120
you see, we cannot force it on anyone, cannot be forced - so improper.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.020
What position, what place materialism has in Your philosophy?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.620
Materialism has to have a balance, has to have a balance. You see, we are in imbalance, like

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:37.080
produce plastic, plastic, plastic so much that we produced, so much of mountains of plastic.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.360
Then this machinery, you see - machinery is for us, we are not for machinery; There has to be a balance for everything.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.880
There's no balance and that's why we have gone into this problem of ecology and all that.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:56.080
But there is - you don't see any harm in having some comfort in life which the material things give us.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:03.340
In a way they do in a way they don't. It's a headache also sometimes to have material things with you.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:11.360
But the comfort you seek of your Spirit. Of course, I mean, you can live very comfortably - no problem uh..

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:19.520
the way you want to live, you can live you don't have to run away from your house, you don't have to live in jungles - nothing - you can live very comfortably, whichever way you like

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:27.360
but actually, I have seen after realization people seek the comfort of the Spirit. I'ts alright, if it is there, is there. Now,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.660
I must say, I come from a rich family - My husband is rich and My parents are rich and all that

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.020
so, I have lots of comforts in My family but I can live anywhere.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.320
You send Me to a jungle - I can be there; I can live anywhere - I enjoy everything.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:48.700
- So part of Your philosophy is to adapt to various situations
- No, we don't force on anything, just automatically it happens.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:53.780
You see, people are used to alcoholism, drugs, this - everything drops off.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:01.580
Just I don't tell them; Just because you become the Spirit. In the light of Spirit and whatever Spirit enjoys that's you like -

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:09.740
you're more worried about that. And matter is for the expression of your love so that you can give it to others. Even when

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:16.780
we want to wear good dress or want to keep a good house or anything - it is just, we want to please others innately,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.360
not for our sake; We don't do all this for our sake, we do it for others. Actually, one has work very hard

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:28.640
to keep the house clean and make it beautiful and all - we don't mind because really, innately we want to please others

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:35.460
and then ultimately it happens that by giving others or by expression through the matter, we can

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.880
say,  'I love you very much.'

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:47.300
I found, if you are after progress and you want to progress as

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.120
and develop as a person in your sphere, in your profession

00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:00.620
and we all know that in order to do this, you have to be tough in today's world

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.760
- What do You think about that?
- You see, love is such a great power

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:13.000
- that you don't have to be tough at all - it works.
- But we are so tough if you want to survive

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:20.600
No, no, you survive through the power, this subtle power, which is love, it looks after you.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:29.060
- Don't have to be at all, at all, tough.
- But I find myself, if I'm kind to the others all the time

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:38.140
- the others take advantage of me. In my profession
- It's true but when you get your realization, you'll be surprised, you'll be in the Kingdom of God

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.340
and everything will be done in such a way that you'll be amazed how things work out.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:50.080
Today only these musicians have come and they were telling Me that, "They were very hard with us.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.660
When we entered, they wouldn't give us their immigration because some were not graduates." The artists were not graduates.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:02.060
And just they saw them and these people, just in their hearts said, "Now we have to go somehow,"

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.780
and immediately the everything changed and they got it. Everything works out and everyone of them can tell you

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:14.240
the story how things worked out in their lives and how everything is so beautiful.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:22.060
Alright. Do You think that mind can [UNCLEAR], mind can swallow through different things.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:26.740
I mean, sometimes you say, I say to myself, "Don't do it,"

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:34.040
- Are we divided, do we have two selves?
- Yeah, yeah, yes. There's a disintegration but with this you get integrated.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:41.200
- Whatever you feel, you do it and enjoy it. It's just that; You get completely integrated.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.840
And you know the Absolute Truth also because whenever you want to find out the Truth, you can just put your hands and find out,

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.720
so you know the Absolute, what is right; You do that, you're alright - no problem.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.580
- Hmm, but who's telling me what to do, I mean, our two selves within me?

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:05.080
Yes, there are already - the one is the ignorance, one is the knowledge but the knowledge has not come into the light.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:12.400
Once the knowledge comes in, you can feel it on these. Then there are vibrations. You can feel it, cool breeze and that tells you. Supposing, there's a man

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.820
who wants to cheat you. Immediately you'll feel the heat from that man.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:24.240
How come that sometimes I struggle with myself; I know that what I'm going to do or to say rather because I'm an impulsive person;

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:32.180
I know what I'm going to say it's not right and probably it's going to hurt the other person, it's going to hurt me as a result as well

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:38.540
but I can't help not doing it, not saying which gives me the,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.680
I realize that there are two people, there are two selves inside me.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.920
But that becomes one now so that whatever you do, you don't mind - it's alright.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.060
If somebody hurts you, it's alright, you don't feel it - it's alright but you say

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:03.360
- whatever
- How can I suppose the other person, what happens to the other self, that I feel that they don't always approve?

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.060
Doesn't matter, you don't have to worry - it will all work out. You don't have to mentally make them approve - it works out.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:18.300
You see and sometimes the desires, which do not sometimes, you see, sometimes I'm going in the car

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:26.420
and you get lost; Then I think, I have to be lost - there's something to be done here, I have to pass through this lane - it's alright.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:35.160
- So even the hardships that You have in life they, they have a positive message.
- Absolutely

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:41.960
Whatever you do, you know that it's for your good - you just don't bother. You keep

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:48.600
uh.. in a very joyous mood and you don't worry about it; There must be something - why am I here?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:53.860
Why this happened? Alright, there must be something - let's see. You become a witness of the whole drama.

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:57.780
Like in a drama you are watching - this event has come - now what must be the reason,

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:03.520
then it shows you. In the same way everything starts unfolding beautifully

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.740
- What do You believe is the role of human-beings on earth?
- Beg your pardon?
- What is the role of human-beings on earth?

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:18.960
- So?
- The role, the role? What's the purpose, the meaning of life?

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.860
Is to, is to enjoy - that's all.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:28.400
- And do You believe in Incarnation?
- Yes, enjoy, enjoy the bounties of God

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:36.260
and to spread the news of God and to give realization to people and to evolve them

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:45.120
- that's the purpose.
- And You believe in reincarnation that when we
- Yes, we are reincarnated, no doubt.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.380
We've been born again and again and again and now we have come to this stage as human-beings also

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:57.140
and now human-beings have to just go through a little breakthrough - that's all; It's not purposeless.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:03.680
So, what happens to me when I die? What happens to my soul? Does it immediately goes to another human-being that is

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:11.620
No, no, it depends on - now you become your own master. If you want to be born again, if you want to save more people, you may be born again.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:16.440
If you don't want to be born again, you need not be born again; It's, it's your desire.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.260
Then you become the master of yourself; You decide what you want to do.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:30.540
- What do You want to say to my readers?
- To whom?
- To my readers, to the people that I am writing the article [UNCLEAR]

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:39.060
I should say, they must now take their realization, the time has come. I call it a blossom time, it's a great chance, it's a very great thing that's happening

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.360
all over the world and should happen and the Greeks, who have come from Greece, should not lose their

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.300
moorings and their traditions and should get their realization.

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:55.580
Now, I am glad to hear, if You don't mind, some of Your style [UNCLEAR]

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:04.140
- [UNCLEAR]
- Shirley, is it possible to have a, did you mind [UNCLEAR]

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.200
I mean, a journalist [UNCLEAR] write an article for a great newspaper with

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:19.060
[UNCLEAR] circulation and... do you mind having a part of [UNCLEAR]

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:26.700
telling people what happened to you and... You don't - good. Okay.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:32.740
and great, could you take [UNCLEAR] while She's talking to me and

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:41.020
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry.. this seems very sort of business to me.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:49.000
- Yes.
- I was take my realization ten years ago.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.800
I was a very hectic person, very busy, hectic. I had a lot

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.880
- Annh?
- very busy mind

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:09.140
Take your chair there. Better take her chair. This will be nice for her [UNCLEAR]

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:14.940
[SAHAJA YOGIS CONVERSING]

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.780
and after I received my realization through the Grace of Shri Mataji

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:27.620
I [UNCLEAR], I felt [UNCLEAR] coming within me

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.700
and the next morning [UNCLEAR] happened

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.660
[UNCLEAR] all more problems were just there.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.340
I gave up smoking overnight, I gave up drinking overnight,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:54.880
gave up [UNCLEAR - SWIMMING?] only really gross things I used to do just there

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:02.840
and I didn't know whether that happened to other people [UNCLEAR]

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.080
[UNCLEAR] it was just so amazing and I felt

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:14.860
really peaceful inside and it happened overnight.

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:21.140
- You must show Shirley's photographs to her. Shirley's photographs that...
- One with the light?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:27.460
[UNCLEAR] and then I together realization

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.580
[UNCLEAR] Shri Mataji [UNCLEAR] was given by Herself

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:38.840
and I went to India and while I was in India,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:46.000
I took these photographs that Shri Mataji will show you

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:54.960
and when we had them developed, it was just absolute great flames of light just radiating down from Her

00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:00.440
but whole day I felt like that couldn't explain [UNCLEAR] it was just not there

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:07.180
[UNCLEAR] stained glass window [UNCLEAR] it was just not there

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.800
and [UNCLEAR]

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:21.280
- improving in [UNCLEAR]
- So how do you [UNCLEAR]

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:30.400
[UNCLEAR] problems as I used to but just

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:38.900
slight within you begin to know yourself and when we do something wrong it's like

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:46.480
innate knowing that you've done something wrong and we got the means to fix it

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.100
through realization it's like

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:57.660
you look the same calm way and [UNCLEAR]

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:06.460
clear attention, perfect drama going on and we need to cope up in it

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:13.500
you suddenly see you are in the middle, "What am I doing?" you know it's all just a drama.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:48.080
In the beginning [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:55.740
These are the ones, you see. He was the first to get it.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.660
See he got these and in a village, just think of it.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:31.400
Why we put another one on this one?

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:46.300
You take it out. This [UNCLEAR]

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.640
- [UNCLEAR] other photographs are
- Hmm

00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:00.360
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, but that's too much for her. Better show her this much only. This much is alright.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:08.040
[UNCLEAR] You can say there are many miraculous photographs I'll show you later.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:35.740
Go show her this later. Hmm, beautiful! Yes, I'm laughing.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:51.620
For, what, where are we, where are you going to?

00:35:55.260 --> 00:36:01.460
- Where are you going to send the interview?
- It's for the afternoon newspaper 'The Noble Herald' Shri Mataji.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.760
- Hmm?
- For the afternoon newspaper 'The Noble Herald'. I want to [UNCLEAR] interview.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:16.340
[ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.140
I better sit facing it. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:28.260
That's Mataji from the [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION] She's already broken the

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:39.260
- Your book is very good. You gave Me the book you wrote [UNCLEAR] long time back
- Yes, Mother

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:46.220
It's very good and you should come and see our garden in Pratishthan. It requires lot of

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:54.540
uh.. understanding and I have no time to look after it but all these flowers can come there, I think, all of them could be

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.960
Show her this one that she will show that you should say

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:15.440
- This is the one 1990 New Zealand in Mahane, after puja
- Hmm, hmm

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.520
- The New Parliament of New Zealand in Mahane
- Oh

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
- Really. [UNCLEAR] in England, the other day.
- That's the summer storm

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.600
Here there are three - one, two, three. This is the Kundalini, these are two

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.100
but actually in another photograph this one more or less - one, two and three

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.000
Here is also

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:12.160
The [UNCLEAR] is of vibration

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.860
Here also there are three - one, two and three but slight

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:26.780
- Fantastical!
- These are [UNCLEAR] actually [UNCLEAR] - just imagine!

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
- We got this on photograph
- Cameras are clever!

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.180
- That one was the one
- Oh!
- Is that the one the deities above the
- No, no, no, no

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:44.960
- These are all on your head.  You see, this is My name written in Urdu language - it's My name

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:54.160
- on your heads
- Fantastic!
- but not this one. There's another one that this year they were going to give you

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.940
- So, that's the one on the patrium [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm. Look at that [UNCLEAR]

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.940
- [UNCLEAR]
- There was a star!

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:11.180
- Is that the window?
- This was the window. The vision was nearly black and there was no flash

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:16.540
- So shouldn't have really come out [UNCLEAR]
- I know, I know. I know.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.580
- This is remarkable - annh? This one of course was there, no doubt.

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.680
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:41.420
This one is tremendous! No that's not the one of the deities. They were going to give you in the ... I think, I'll ask them. They have enlarged

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:48.300
for Ganpatipule. They must have given to some people, I'm sure, very enlarged ones.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.500
- Hmm, we didn't see them, the deities.
- I think, they've sent them to Sydney, Shree Mataji
- Annh?

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:00.780
- I think they've reached Sydney but don't
- Might be. I didn't see there. They can make copies.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:07.920
I'm sitting here and all of them sitting [UNCLEAR]. It's wonderful and the way they are, there are also angels and you can see also the ganas and

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:14.720
every bride they have got Divine flowers on their head.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:21.460
Beautiful flowers falling on them and the boys also are all having vibrations on top of them.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.900
That's what is your marriage is!

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.480
I wanted to talk to him about Taiwan.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.480
See, what they told Me - what's the name of the gentleman from New York?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:53.220
- New York, it is Nelson. Nelson [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, and he, he wanted Me to go to Taiwan

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.380
but what I told him that, "First of all, you people go there and work it out, then I'll come,"

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.180
because there's just raw just now, no one will know there so they said, "Yes," but I said I'll fix a...

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:11.920
they said May is a good month for Taiwan. Is it a good month for Taiwan - May?

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:20.340
Shree Mataji it's a very mild and pleasant, maybe a little humid but very mild and pleasant

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:29.140
- very mild.
- Is it? What do you think is the best month for Taiwan to go to?
- Well, uh..

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:33.180
- November?
- I think,

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:42.680
You see, it's been five years or six years since I've been there and if I remember basically is that the bad months are

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.160
summer from late May until early September is

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:54.980
- not only warm but very, very humid as they are rainy months and
- Early December will be alright?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:03.780
Yeah, it certainly will be alright by November. The heat is all gone by the end of September.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.880
-  The hot months are [UNCLEAR]
- See, because I'm coming to India on the, say, 18th of December

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:17.800
- and before that I could go there and then go from there to India would be much better.
- Yes, Shree Mataji.
- And you'll have more time to work it out.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.940
- Yes, Shree Mataji.
- Can you write to him about it?
- Yes, Shree Mataji.
- I'll also talk to him from England.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:31.160
- Yes, Shree Mataji.
- I'll fix it up like this. First I said, "I'll come in April," but then I can also go to Singapore, Malaysia -

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.120
Malaysia now we have 30 people. They came at the airport - I was surprised; Thirty of them,

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.980
all Chinese - very beautiful! If Chinese take to it, they can go very far

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:53.240
and also Toronto we have lots of Chinese, Vancouver we have lots of Chinese now, New York now we have some, not many but

00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:01.400
- they're very dynamic. So if you think it alright then we'll do it in the early December
- Yes, Mother.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:08.380
- on My way to India.
- Yes, Mother. May I ask Mother, is it auspicious time for me to go to Taiwan?
- Beg your pardon?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:15.140
- Is it auspicious time for me to go to Taiwan yet?
- Should be before just I go

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:22.100
- if you could go there and find out what you can work it out or you can go earlier and again you can go

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:30.020
but you better talk to him and both of you consult what you can do. I've been to Taiwan once,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.900
I've been there. I think the Chinese are alright even in China - they're very good to Me

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:43.560
but this news nonsense that has come has spoiled the image of China but the government has tremendous respect for Me.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.640
Whenever I went there, they respected Me, they were very kind to me

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.440
but as far as Sahaja yoga is concerned, I don't know how far they'll react - can't say.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:06.120
- The Chinese in Taiwan are easier than
- Much easier
- than the overseas
- because there's no suppression on them;

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:14.600
They are not suppressed people and they're doing well now because lots of people are using their labor and things - much better.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.420
- You came from where, which part?
- From Kuala Lumpur, from
- Kuala Lumpur

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.060
but I was surprised there are thirty of them now.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:32.280
- They're all very new are there
- But very good, very dedicated

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:40.380
- and the children know how to give realization, they know the mantras and everything - so beautiful! NG has done that.
- Hmm.

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:52.920
Indians are horrible in Kuala Lumpur, horrible! They've all kinds of funny problems in. I said you give up Indians. You see, Indians are like

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:59.560
uprooted people - anywhere. Once they, when they're uprooted from India, they become very funny.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:07.740
I always say, a mango tree if you take it to England, it won't give you mangoes but also not give you an apple - it's like that, useless thing.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.680
Yes Mother, we have a, a, an Indian man who comes to one of the programs in John Wayne

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:22.840
- he comes and he is from Kuala Lumpur also and he was just in Kuala Lumpur
- He's Chinese?
- No, Indian.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:30.680
- [UNCLEAR - THAT'S IT?]
- He was there last month and he got in some pro-activist trouble with

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:36.820
- lot of other Indians there who are
- Very [UNCLEAR]

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:44.580
- for one of the
- All kinds of false people have gone there, very stupid, absolutely stupid people
- He told everybody that sahaja yoga

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:51.720
- [UNCLEAR]
- No but Chinese are very good - Chinese are very good in Kuala Lumpur, extremely alert

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:58.020
- Are you satisfied with that?
- Yes, yes.
- So, would you like to have your realization?
- Yes

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.660
- Alright, better take out your shoes. You can sit on the chair now. Please be seated.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:12.820
- Give her the chair, please. Just, if you can face Me here, will be better.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.340
No, no on the chair.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.920
Just be seated. Now, you put your hands, like this towards Me, that's all.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.120
Just see on her head if it's already there.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:45.060
- Beautiful feeling!
- She's got it already. Feeling the cool breeze already.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:53.980
- It's tingling, my feet.
- Feet are tingling but hands because you got down from there - but hands you've got the cool breeze

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.360
- Now don't doubt if they are on the finger-tips
- Hmm
- They are

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.100
You got it so fast.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:21.900
Only thing is you also very hard-working person. Despite the fact you are emotional

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:26.060
[LAUGHTER] so

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.840
but you must forgive, must forgive people - that's very important.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:38.400
Just say, "I forgive." Don't think of them who they are or anything, just say, "I forgive everyone." Just say in your heart, "I just forgive them," just say that.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:51.760
Good and you are relaxed, no thought. Watch Me without thinking - you can do it.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.540
Very simple. You see as a seed you can put in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself so you are

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:15.460
built-in within you, built-in; Sahaja means born with you, is there. Only this yoga - the union with the Divine has to take place - that works out. See now.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:24.060
I told you Greeks are very good. They're wonderful, wonderful people.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.840
Alright, May God bless you!

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:35.420
But you must know what it is and you must understand what it is and how to work it out, how to help people - it's wonderful!

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:43.800
You should see these people again. Can you give her some address of yours where you're going to have the program today

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:53.700
and tomorrow? [YOGIS CONVERSING]

00:48:54.180 --> 00:49:00.720
Just in really [UNCLEAR] and the necklace  that Francis is wearing is Bruna's work

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:04.260
- Wow!
- and that's his

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:14.880
- What's it?
- Bruna's, Bruna's work, Mother.
- Bruna [UNCLEAR], Shree Mother.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:19.040
- Really?
- Yes. 
- Bruna, yeah
- You made it?

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.880
- It's wonderful man!
- It is a very beautiful jewel!

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:30.700
They all have become so dynamic, I must say, the. She must show her the ceramics these sahaja yogis have made.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:37.780
Beautiful ceramics they have made just as a jewellery - Greek style.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:46.840
- So fine!
- Last year [UNCLEAR] jewellery too.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.080
- Remarkable! And there are people who never knew much of ceramic have done such good work

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:16.820
- Did you tell her where is the - annh? Program
- She has the pamphlet with the addresses.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.700
Show her this. You must see this. Sheryll is the one who got all these photograph.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.580
Now we have many more but you should see and many more like this. You show her the others.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.700
- This one?
- Not this.
- The one You are talking is that this?

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:40.320
- In a village
- In a village, in an Indian village and

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.540
Oh, there are photographs and photographs and you'll be amazed.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:53.200
It started off fine and the it got bigger and bigger

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:05.420
and then at the end Mother put up Her hand to stop the light and then after that there was no more light.

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.940
This is [UNCLEAR]

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:19.180
There're so many photographs like this that you'll be amazed and we'll show you later on but you must join this and you must develop it.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:27.180
- Is there the photograph in the dark you took?
- Shree Mataji, one of the other ladies in Norway who was also at this program

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:33.680
took some photographs she has some in the album but there's no light [UNCLEAR]

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:41.340
- [UNCLEAR - THAT?] she's the same photograph and there's no light?
- I know
- That photograph was taken in a pitch black room

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:49.420
with no light whatsoever, just as an experiment and that turned out no flash was

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:55.860
- really dark
- I'm sure the Sahasrara day it's also possible. She has some photographs but we have so many of them

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:59.660
and the one which is with the, on the heart there's light.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:08.240
- When there're subtle saints, you know, the camera takes photos of the different lights that

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.840
- emit from us.
- On top of their heads

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:18.980
On top of everybody's heads. Now this one here - this is, Shree Mother - this is in Austria or so

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:25.760
- the one with the star
- No, no, no this was in uh.. Italy
- [UNCLEAR]

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:33.020
- Now, we were going on a boat
- This was number one, then number two

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:39.620
- this is all in a room - then, wait, number three,

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:52.080
number four and then number five was; This was all coming from Shree Mataji. Yes, this is the Sahasrar

00:52:52.360 --> 00:53:00.260
This is the day when the last center was opened - the seventh center - and they wanted to have the

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:07.680
celebration on the 6th but it was on the 5th, so they said, "6th is a Sunday everybody will be there," and we were in a boat,

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.820
suddenly this happened - one fellow got it - everybody doesn't get.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:20.020
- and this and Shree Mataji is just here, next is
- This is My head and these look like, when

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:28.140
-  we enlarge them they look like as if the bones are cut, you see, little, little things - these
- That's all.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:37.120
- and this is the sort of photographs
- This one is also there - one with the light coming from the heart.
- Light coming from the heart chakra

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:45.980

- Ganapatipule

00:53:52.740 --> 00:54:00.320
- Is in a, in a, on the sea-shore, in India
- What would you like this for your paper? Can she print this in her paper?
- Yes, yes, why not.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:07.620
- Which part is?
- Beg your pardon.This is in India, in Ganapatipule
- India, hm, hmm.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:16.020
- The next

- No, no we had some people also around

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:23.280

- There's lots and lots more. We haven't got them more here even

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:36.900
[UNCLEAR] This one here with the New Zealand and Shree Mataji like the map

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:42.100
This is [UNCLEAR] and the new Parliament of New Zealand  - the

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.900
You know the new parliament of New Zealand looks like in the honey.

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:52.200
- Also in England the whole of England came in, yeah.
- Came into the honey, yes [UNCLEAR]

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:59.200
- And the one, the face has come in the clouds on the sky
- Yeah.
- You can see it in the clouds. Everything even

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:06.240
- [UNCLEAR]
- Even I teeth and all. Also I used to wear this thing here, that also came in.
- [LAUGHTER]

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:13.620
- I don't know whether you have that one or not.
- And somebody just took a photo of the cloud
- It's often in Sydney for the big enlargement [UNCLEAR]

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:22.140
- Are you Mother's companion?
- Ah, children hai

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:37.220
- So there's many more miracle photos like that.
- Somehow the camera sees things, all that people can see.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:01.440
- How long tomorrow's lecture is going to last?
- It takes about one hour
- Hmm, hmm

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:09.140
- to explain everything because somebody else will say something and then I'll say and then about 15 minutes for realization only;

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:15.240
You took hardly any time. You just opened your hands and you got it. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:22.700
So the people are good like you, it will take only one second [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] if they have to be like you

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.560
seekers, you see they have to be truthful people - seekers, it works out.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:34.560
But supposing they are sick or something, there's conditionings, this, that, it takes little time but not much.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.280
- Mataji, Aapne cha peena?
- Unnh?
- Cha
- Haan, [UNCLEAR - GIVE IT?]

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.280
[MARATHI]

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:09.540
Her sister has come all the way but she's busy with Me. I said, "You go and see her."  She's, "No Mother, I will be with You."

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:16.060
Her sister has come all the way from India but she wants to be with Me. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:23.520
All love, you see, just love and that is feel so protected

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:31.260
and God loves you, He doesn't want you to suffer; This is a nonsensical idea of Christianity. Actually, recently

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:39.800
Thomas, when on his way to India, was in Egypt and he wrote all the treatise about Christ and put it in a big jar.

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:46.240
They opened it and in that they found so many things written just what I say.

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:53.360
He said, "God doesn't want you to suffer. Christ has suffered for you, you don't have to suffer," so the whole thing is

00:57:53.620 --> 00:58:01.300
absolutely challenging the theories that, "You must suffer for God." It's all nonsense. Why should you suffer? He's your father;

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:06.340
No father wants his children to suffer and He's the Father of all the fathers.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.120
Why will He want you to suffer? - Is illogical.

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:19.740
And the priests say that they seem to go, to have a good time like on Saturday you are not allowed to go out

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.740
and have a good time because next day you have to go to church - what do You think about that?

00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:30.500
- Nothing of the kind.
- Hmm?
- You see, [LAUGHTER] Sunday is for enjoyment actually

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:38.180
[LAUGHTER] All these things are, I don't know why they say, "You are sinners." This

00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:45.420
this is not the way to talk to people, I mean, to make them feel miserable and the first condition in sahaja yoga - you are not to feel guilty for anything.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.340
- after all
- Even if you do something
- wrong. Doesn't matter, after all you are human-being.

00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:59.660
God cannot do anything wrong but human-beings can do, so it's alright. At a human level is alright. Once you get a,

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:05.620
your enlightenment, then you don't do wrong things, so you are excused.

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:09.880
Forgiveness is there. You have to be completely forgiven.

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:18.140
You see, these All-Pervading power of God's love is an ocean of forgiveness.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:24.280
What can we commit mistakes, all the time to feel guilty?

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:31.520
Is all money-making proposition, I think,

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:42.240
that, "You have committed sins, alright, you pay us the money and sins will be wiped out." Common with every religion. Even in India

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:50.680
they do the same thing. Now, "You committed a sin. Alright, you give us this things, so we'll tell God, it will be all cleared out."

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:58.360
[LAUGHTER] If you confess and then

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:05.640
- You see,
- your sins will be wiped out.
- after all we must understand God He is, He is love,

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:11.240
is love and He understands human-beings, He loves them.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.400
He doesn't go on punishing all the time - that's not His job.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:27.080
Actually, we in our, in our stupidity, we are the ones who create problems -

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:32.140
He does not - for each other.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:52.940
- How many hours do You sleep? [LAUGHTER]
- Not many.
- Not many.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:01:01.320
- [LAUGHTER] [UNCLEAR]
- Very little
- Very little.
- Also I eat very little, sleep, very little.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:08.820
Also, you see, I don't need much sleep - I'm quite full of energy. I'm now 67 years of age.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:17.300
- Nice!
- And I travel so much and this. Last night must have slept at 2 0'clock or 3 0'clock
- Two 0'clock.
- Two 0'clock I must have slept.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:25.380
- Up again three hours later.
- Yeah, I was up.
- So, You have energy with five, six hours of sleep per night?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:31.720
- Daytime I sleep for a while, always, little bit but night time, I can keep awake.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:39.540
[LAUGHTER] and I can travel - I have no problems of this jet lag and all that;

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.320
Never I have these problems. Supposing I'm travelling now - some people who travel

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:52.880
they have to adjust to the timing - the timing adjusts according to My (sleep); There's no problem, nothing.

01:01:53.700 --> 01:02:01.780
Travelling is no problem; I travel such a lot, such a lot I travel but I don't think there's anything uh..

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:09.180
wrong with travelling - wrong with ourselves because you just think you are there. You are there - that's all.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.380
Whether you are travelling or sitting at home or going anywhere, you are there - that's all.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:22.200
Why to think you are travelling? If you start you are travelling, then you start feeling that Oh, something you have done - you've done nothing, you're just there.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:28.240
- And where do You get all this energy from?
- Beg your pardon?

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:34.660
- Where do You get all this energy that?
- It's coming, you see, there All-Pervading.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.000
You are connected to the mains now.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:53.080
- You should have given her some tea or something like a. [MARATHI] What would you like to have, some cold drink?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.480
- What?
- I'm fine
- Some tea or
- No, thanks

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:04.260
- Something? Anything - you have come to Mother's house, better have something.[LAUGHTER]
- I'll have a cup of tea - thanks.
- Better give her something good to drink.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.280
- I'll have a cup of tea - thank you.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.820
- You made something else?
- Yes, Mother.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:24.780
- I was making [UNCLEAR]
- Let Me see

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.320
- [INAUDIBLE]
-  [UNCLEAR]

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.380
- This called all the Australian [UNCLEAR]
- Really?

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:50.440
- [MARATHI]
- [MARATHI]

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:58.540
[MARATHI] The combination is tremendous but the central one is not the real stone

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.900
- Yes, Shree Mataji.
- Is real?
- No, emerald.
- All of them are real stones?
- Yes

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:09.060
- Diamonds?
- Real diamonds.
- This emerald is real? Very delicate, I must say.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:17.020
- It's a very delicate thing you have done, really.
- Hmm. Yes, your designs are very delicate and
- The combination is [UNCLEAR]
- and they have a rhythm

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:23.520
- really. Hmm.
- Just have a look
- Show me.
- It's very delicate

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:31.720
[UNCLEAR]

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.800
- [UNCLEAR]
- What is the material around the
- [UNCLEAR]

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:47.100
[MARATHI]

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:51.940
- [MARATHI]
- Archana? [MARATHI]

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.600
[MARATHI]

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:05.360
[MARATHI]

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:11.260
[MARATHI]

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:20.720
- Garam hai.
- Are you going to interview?
- Yes, please.
- Can I stay. Can I hear?

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.200
I have some questions, Mother, I have to put.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:30.300
- Do you have cot deaths? Really?
- Yes, very big problem in [UNCLEAR] and in  Melbourne.

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:43.820
- They're spending quite a lot of money trying to research it, Shree Mother.
- They won't believe Me if I tell them the truth.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:52.120
- That's what I heard Mother if You could find a way of explaining
 - Yes of course, we can but will they listen to Me, I don't know if they will listen to Me

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:57.420
- Once [UNCLEAR] it must help.
- Alright.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:08.700
The first question is, "Why was Melbourne chosen for the first initial spiritual education experiment?"

01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:12.340
It was not chosen, it was sahaja, you see.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:20.720
- [LAUGHTER]
- It is that the readers of the Herald don't understand that.
- [LAUGHTER]

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:27.440
You see, in the sense that, we had a building and we had students, we had teachers

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:31.620
so, naturally, the whole thing worked out.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:40.760
Moreover, I think, Melbourne has a temperant uh..

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.900
climate, in the sense that, people are not extremist also here;

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.180
There're many people who do not drink and go to extremes and

01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:02.460
- I mean, good parents. They are temperant because of their children, you see.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:06.580
So that was also a good thing - there were good parents here.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:21.780
Yes, it has been tried elsewhere. We have one in Dharamshala,

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:27.620
which is at the foothill of Himalayas - that's one school - one in Delhi,

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:37.000
uh.. one in Rome, one in, now, in Milan.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:46.620
Now another we starting near Bombay, Vashi and Vaitarna, ultimately.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.300
Why did you choose again Russia and why are they [UNCLEAR - EXCELLENT SAHAJA YOGIS?]

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:08.820
Again I never chose it, as far as I know. [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:21.000
It so happened that - it's a just a chance. Uh.. one of the sahaja yogis  -

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:26.760
it's Yogi Mahajan; He met an ambassador,

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.940
Russian ambassador, in Delhi

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.680
who asked him, "How are you so

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.100
peaceful and relaxed and all that."

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.560
Who is your guru, sort of thing? And he said about sahaja yoga

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:03.380
because they were surprised, he was in a party and everybody's getting drunk and saying all kinds of things and...

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:09.960
So they were surprised at him the way he was looking at everyone and the way he was absolutely so dignified.

01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:15.040
Then they asked the question, you see, and he said that such and such thing.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.460
Then he said, "Can She come to Russia?"

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:30.240
And there was one minister that time there, who also

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:38.160
- was interested and they both got realization.
- Russian minister came?
- The minister, yes, he got realization

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.800
He was amazed that how could Yogi, another, just a disciple of sahaja yoga, could give realization.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.580
So he told him, "Can we get Shree Mataji here, to Russia?"

01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:01.200
That's all and we arranged the timing and I was there.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.540
And we had some Russians in London

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:14.660
Bagdaan you know; He actually is an, he is Australian but he's Russian and also he's a doctor.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:21.340
So went him first, we sent him first, few people went there and they worked it out

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:32.120
and I was surprised that they were, as if they were waiting for Me. you know, there were two thousand people on the first program we went to,

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:39.960
out side and two thousand inside and they said, "No we cannot go inside because there's no room."

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.260
My lecture lasted for about one and a half hour or so and then realization, all that. I came out

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:52.900
and I find they were all sitting there still waiting for Me. They said, "Now what about us?"

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:59.200
So I said, "Alright, you come here and we'll have the program outside." Next day, in the morning,

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.480
the two thousand outside ones and the two thousand inside ones - all of them there.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.380
And then the second question is that

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:20.600
Did the Russian government become interested in sahaja yoga teachings and apply it to their education system from there?

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.500
Yeah, they did. You see, to begin with, uh.. we have got

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:34.720
three doctors, who have got MD, in Delhi. They're very open-minded people, as far as the scientific side is concerned

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:43.200
and they were surprised at the papers we produced and also we have so many people cured in sahaja yoga.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:50.420
But when they saw all these things, you see, they just said, "We must have it here, on the medical terms."

01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:56.140
And the doctor, who was the head of the Health Ministry,

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:03.620
invited us to his office and he said that, "I'll give You an independent charge

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:11.960
and do what You like but this the easiest because you don't have to pay for anything, you get cured - I mean, this is something they could not understand.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:17.060
So, he gave us an independent charge on the medical side.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.460
Then, I think, somebody visited the school in Delhi, perhaps - I don't know what happened

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.980
but they wanted, very much, the school on the side

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:34.260
because they're having the same problems, as you have, with their children. They have drug problem,

01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:40.860
uh.. there are parents who are separated and children are becoming quite violent;

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:46.860
All the same problems as you have so they wanted to change the lives of the children.

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:54.040
And they asked us if they could, we could take over one school. They're willing to give us a big building,

01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:02.340
students, everything and free passage to the teachers and also payment to them

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.700
and to Me also.[SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS] I said, I don't need, I have money, I can come." "No, no, no, no we would like to pay for You."

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.740
So the whole thing is so spontaneous, as if they have found something very great they know

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.020
and that's what they wanted to implement.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:25.540
Can You explain the nature what is so different about sahaja yoga education than normal education?

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:30.060
- Other schools?
- Yes.
- You see, in other schools

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:35.140
they just give mental studies to children, only mental

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:43.500
but they don't teach then to respect themselves and to respect others -

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.200
minimum of minimum they should have taught - that is not there; They don't even respect the teachers.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:59.160
Also the teachers may not be of that quality to command that respect; Possibly, I don't know what is the situation.

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:07.640
Now, in sahaja yoga when the children come in, first of all, they are all given realization,

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:15.240
their parents are given realization - as a result there's a transformation

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:24.060
and children become extremely obedient, respectful,

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.600
sensible, tolerant and they're so beautiful.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:39.120
And as you know, there are many children born are realized souls so they also have a

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:47.540
- place to go to. Even Russia has so many children.
- Could You explain what's a realized soul children to unrealized soul?

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:52.320
Realized soul children are those who are in connection with the All- Pervading power.

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:06.100
- How does this make things different?
- Because that, that transforms them completely.

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:13.780
They become uh.. righteous and they become so powerful, they're not afraid of anything

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:21.060
at the same time they become compassionate because these are the powers of this All-Pervading power.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:29.780
I still [UNCLEAR] people understand how these children are being born now what's their purposes?

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:37.480
I mean, many people don't know these children. You see, they are born to them. They don't understand them why children behave like this,

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:44.700
why they react like this, why this is - like if you see to the Freudian theories are all absurd -

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:52.920
that if a child puts a finger in the mouth, he says, "It's sex," - it's not. He's trying to show that this is the center, is catching and you are in him.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.980
They don't understand how to depict it so, everything goes to sex, you see - it's not true.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:07.440
So, they're brought up in the right perspective with love, affection and respect.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:14.680
In all these schools we respect the children and teach them that, "You are now yogis.

01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:23.000
You have your own dignity and you have to behave like a yogi. You can't behave like ordinary stray dogs."

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:32.620
And then they understand the difference - you shouldn't go on barking at people. They understand that, "We are human-beings, we are not dogs."

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:38.300
So the way we teach them also the whole system is such a system

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:42.960
that they develop their own dignity, serenity, their deeper

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:49.140
personality and they mature very fast - mature. They're very matured people.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:58.260
How would ordinary parents that their, discover that their children are these born realized children?

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:06.860
From everything. First of all, they don't tell lies,

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:15.000
they don't steal things, they're very satisfied, contented

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:20.060
but they stand against injustice.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.820
I'll give an example of My own grand-daughter. They went down to Ladakh.

01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:33.100
My son-in-law, you know, he's written this book about Himalayas, so they went down to Ladakh

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.560
and there was one lama sitting on a mound and talking something, wearing some sort of a

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:47.340
big choga, as we call there, you see, and everybody was bowing.

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:52.760
This girl couldn't bear it, you see, but still she watching - she was hardly five years

01:18:53.960 --> 01:19:00.040
and then she saw her parents because out of everybody's touching his feet, so they also went and bowed

01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:06.900
then she couldn't bear it, you see. She went and stood before him like this with her hands like [UNCLEAR]. She said, "Aye you, the one who is wearing such a long dress,

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:14.700
you're not a realized soul. Why are you making everybody touch your feet?" and these two poor parents were so embarrassed.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.800
Also once we had a meeting. They invited Me as a Chief Guest for this Raman Maharshi, who was a realized soul,

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:29.900
and all his disciples are hopelessly bad but they had invited somebody from Ram Krishna Ashram, who was wearing the same sort of a dress and sitting next to Me.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:35.160
So the another grand-daughter was - they were all sitting in the front line - so many sahaja yogis had come

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:42.440
so she suddenly got up, she said, "O Grandmother, please ask this man with a maxi to get out. He's emitting so much of heat we can't bear it."

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.380
[LAUGHTER] and he's supposed to be [UNCLEAR -BIG?] uh.. Vivekananda there, sitting there.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.440
His name was Akhandananda, he got, later on he got a cancer and died also.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:59.320
So that's how they behave, you know, their behaviour is something very unique

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:10.020
and they have great affection and compassion, right attitude

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:20.140
but people find them absurd because if they are girls and boys,

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:24.940
they don't like to have dates and things like that, they don't indulge into sex,

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.340
uh.. before marriages and they don't have - they're very innocent.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:40.980
How can parents nurture these children and look after them, protect them?

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.520
Parents must get their realization to understand these children, you see.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.300
Actually these children have ventured to be born to people like that, is rather dangerous;

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:59.420
Mostly they are born to people who are sahaja yogis. All sahaja yogis get children like that, all sahaja yogis.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:11.840
- Will there be another school in Melbourne for these children?
- Oh, we should try, I've been telling you. You should try to have one more, will be good idea.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.060
School is very important. These children, I look at them, the society is so bad.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.640
They were telling Me children under twelve also take drugs here, you see. Is such a challenging society

01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:27.800
and these children will be lost. If you have a proper school, it will help everyone.

01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:39.900
What do You see as the future in Russia now? Will the President form a different form of government?

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:44.480
Of course, they will. See, there're two types of people in Russia, I found out.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:49.760
There're people who are taxi drivers and ordinary labour class and all that kind of people

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:56.900
and there are very well-educated people also, very well-educated, intelligent people, very well-read,

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:04.720
professionals, doctors, very enlightened people as far as

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:09.960
education is concerned. So these drivers and all that, they hanker after

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.920
and if you go there, they'll ask for an American cigarettes or things like that -

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:20.480
their, their level is different but most of these people, they just want their Spirit.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.340
Now this, these Muslim what's they're called as Ai, Ai

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.920
- Azerbaijan.
- Azer, what's they called as?
- Azerbaijan
- Azerbaijan.

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.340
They were, when I had gone to Russia earlier also,

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:47.960
they were really rolling in complete wealth.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.240
They had big, big beds - what we call as takhatas - as big as this

01:22:55.680 --> 01:23:00.200
and under the grape vines, you see, vines

01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.660
and they would take out the grapes and eat like, you see, once upon a time

01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:11.600
- [UNCLEAR]
- same style, you see, lordly and will have hookas and all that to smoke

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.380
while on the other side, the Afghanis, poor things, are poor people.

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.460
and there were very rich people there I saw, in the sense that food

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:28.980
and wines and drinks and everything, clothes they wear;

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:35.220
Russians have very good clothes also, very cheap. You won't believe how cheap the clothes are.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:42.460
Everything so very cheap there, so very cheap. Travelling is five P

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:50.060
for miles together - beautiful trains and all. Now the problem came in when Gorbachev came

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:57.000
that the bureaucrats didn't want democracy because they'll be losing the power

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:05.280
so they created this problem, artificial problem. This is just an artificial problem; They have lots of food, they have everything.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.020
but what Gorbachev has found out that unless and until

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:17.420
you have incentives, people don't want to produce more.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:25.640
And in Russia everybody gets a house, everybody; As soon as you get married, you get a flat.

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:34.720
And they have no idea - they think in the West it's all paved with gold. They think like that - which is not.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:44.140
So their life was not such a struggling one but he felt that after some time the incentive to work will go away

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:51.580
and was little bit diminishing also. They couldn't produce sufficient food and things like that, their interests changed

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:56.480
so he thought is best is to bring democracy by which people will feel that

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.840
this is their own land and they should work it out and they should have incentives.

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:10.120
Australia is in the middle of a Federal election campaign and do You feel that there're any enlightened

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:15.780
- politicians among our lot?
- [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:22.320
I think New Zealand had one but he's no more now. I don't know where is he gone.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:31.100
- He's retired.
- He's still in the government there Mother but he's taken another post other than Prime Minister
- He's taken another?

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:37.920
He's another, he's Minister, he's Attorney General or something like that rather than Prime Minister, Mother.

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:43.880
They must have tortured his life, he's alone. You see, for that you have to have many people [UNCLEAR].

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.500
I don't know; Just pray you get somebody like that.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:56.340
I work with two politicians also. I work with State politician and the Federal one so, they're nice people.

01:25:56.580 --> 01:26:04.500
- I've heard that [UNCLEAR]
- Better give them realization.
- I'm expert at training [UNCLEAR] but they're still little bit stand [UNCLEAR]

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:14.220
- Could we talk of the National Ordination of Women?
- [UNCLEAR - HAVE OR I MEAN?] an absurd,

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.760
absolutely absurd.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:27.100
You see, I asked My father why, at least Martin Luther should have brought forth

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:33.680
the rule of Christ's Mother? Why didn't he do that?

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.900
And he said, "Perhaps, this was expediency on his part

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:45.520
because he thought at that there were Muslims and Muslims would not accept a woman to be

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:52.380
something like that, so just to please the Muslims he must have done it." I said, "This is the biggest mistake because

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.380
women are the shaktis, they are the power." They are the potential power of

01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:07.700
and to say they cannot have ordination, I mean, is absurd absolutely. Actually,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.060
all this is the work of the Primordial Mother, of Athena.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.340
Also to say that there is Holy Ghost like a dove is another

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.500
misleading point. You have Father

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.540
alright, you have the Son as God - what about the Mother?

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:38.540
- Yeah.
- [UNCLEAR]
- Logically, that's the Mother missing

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.280
which we call as the Holy ghost, is the Mother.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.760
And Christ has said, "I will send you the Holy Ghost."

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:52.920
How can he send the Holy Ghost - is He going to send a dove from there or what?

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:08.260
- It's more with the Catholics or with the Protestants also?
- It's the end of all church, Shree Mother. It's split them in half over the issue.

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:16.560
- Anglica from where, from England?
- Yes, and it's very big [UNCLEAR]

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:25.160
- In fact, today Shree Mother, they're electing a new Archbishop today.
- Your bandhan
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:31.460
- But they are funny people, I must say.
- This is the last one. The last Saint Archbishop was in

01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:37.720
favour of ordination and he had a heart attack and died recently.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.900
They have gone too far in England. There was this Bishop of York

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:54.520
and this Bishop of York is a person who started talking about Christ as a human-being - it's all Pauleen Christianity.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:29:00.620
which is, which is being challenged everywhere. Even I read a book that Christ was in India;

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.960
There also He's talks of Pauleen Christianity - is all Pauleen Christianity, you see.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:10.300
And Paul, I don't know why he didn't want any woman to be there.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:15.500
He himself was a epileptic. He died of epilepsy.

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:24.820
According to us he was just a supra conscious stuff organizing the religion

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:36.620
and when this York fellow said all kinds of nonsensical things about Christ, you see,

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:43.000
this Archbishop of Canterbury honoured him in that church

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:50.540
and after that, that church was burnt by, you know that and that

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:57.080
is true in such a way they said that, "The electrical charge of this lightning

01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.680
was looming around," - people could see it. That church but most of it

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:09.180
so they say that, "See the Grace of God that the lower part was not burnt."

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:21.020
And this Bishop of Canterbury was very much, somehow, impressed by sahaja yoga, once upon a time, I would say,

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.440
and also he sent his adviser to My program.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:33.140
I didn't know he was sitting there. That day, I don't know why, I lashed out at Paul how he has ruined Christianity,

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:40.540
how he came back as Augustine and all that - I said all kinds of things and the fellow was so

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:47.860
upset. He went out and people asked, "How are you?" He said, "I'm appalled,"

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:54.780
[LAUGHTER] because I said against Paul so, "I'm appalled."

01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.760
I said, "This is no Christianity." Another person who's talked against him is Khalil Gibran - Paul.

01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:07.880
He said, "I can't understand this strange man," but despite all that uh..

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.800
this Christianity can only have a some sort of a social organization, a club - that's all -

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:25.720
which is not bothered about Spiritual life at all; It doesn't stop anybody from doing anything wrong.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:35.940
Just by saying you're Christians, you don't become. You have to be actually baptized.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:43.220
Actualisation of the baptise, baptism is through your fontanel bone; You must get the Holy Ghost coming out.

01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:52.440
And the early Christians were called as Gnostics - those who knew about it - they didn't have these problems

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.780
and Thomas in his treatise didn't write about it.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:05.860
When is it written there should be no ordination? Who has written this in the Bible? - forget Paul part.

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:10.280
Even I don't think Paul has written that.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:17.800
Though a lot of organisations now are calling themselves Born Again Christians and they put the hand on people's

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:23.200
foreheads and they [UNCLEAR - CONNECT?] backwards and they become very strange.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:27.480
Must be Christ must be doing that to them.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:35.940
They, they just pass out on the floor and then they wake, when they wake up, they say some strange things.

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:44.000
You see, if you do not go to reality, to your Super Consciousness, either you'll go to the Collective Subconscious or to the Collective Supraconscious.

01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:51.640
If you go to the Collective Subconscious, you become like that, you get possessed - they are all possessed -

01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:02.000
or you go to the Collective Supra Conscious in which you see light this, that - you don't become the light, you just see the light.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:13.700
- Could You answer me that cot deaths?
- Of what
- The Cot Death syndrome
- Pardon?
- Cot Deaths

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:20.720
- The last questions.
- Cot deaths. Will they believe Me, if I tell them?

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.720
- I, I don't know, Mother. I just love to try Mother because the ...

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:32.320
You see, there are so many mediums in your country,

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:40.260
who are calling Spirits and this Planchet and what you call them also

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.940
- Ouija board
- Annh?
- Ouija board
- Haan.

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:55.120
They are more than your insects, I think, in them [LAUGHTER]

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:05.880
because the first few who came to Me in sahaja yoga, all were infected by that. Now,

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.740
when you start calling the spirits and all that, where the children are sleepy -

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:27.720
actually the culture is funny that the children should sleep outside and the dogs must sleep inside the bedrooms -

01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:34.180
and we can't believe it. Can you believe in China such a thing?

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:40.920
They put the little, sweet little children outside the bed and the dogs are inside the bed.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.460
Children in China they eat dogs.

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:52.540
- Chinese what?
- Eat dogs.
- Eat dogs. That's better than keep them in the bedroom.

01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:59.140
Alright, so what happens, the child is outside, is fast asleep

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:07.160
and in his sleep from subconscious area, these people can, when they are using those

01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:12.980
dead spirits and everything, they may just possess.

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:20.600
It's a long story actually, to tell you the truth, is the soul and the soul is on our back

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:29.700
and this - you have seen after realization you can see them, little, little loops like that - you have seen many a times.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.160
Also you have seen the Chaitanya, you have seen the power also that way. Now, I have told you that these are the dead souls

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:44.300
and these are the dead souls because our soul, which is on our back, goes into seven loops

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:51.020
and is reflected on our cells; There is reflector on our cell which is called receptor

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:58.680
and all remote control in the body is done by the soul - all remote controls, like ductless glands and things like that,

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:06.320
the reflex actions and everything done by the soul and soul is the causal of all the elements

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:12.340
and it looks after the protection

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:19.040
of the spinal cord and the brain and of the human-being from evil spirits and things like that.

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:27.820
Now when these people die, who have got dissatisfied minds and who are cruel,

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:37.400
who are ambitious, who are sly, they hang around

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:48.100
and when their soul jumps on our soul, they start controlling. Now depends on what center they are controlling.

01:36:55.220 --> 01:37:03.260
Now the proof has come out also scientifically. They have seen on the receptor of a cell, the seven

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:08.800
loops and they can't explain - exactly the same that you see.

01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:14.640
If you see the picture of that, Dr. Mishra has brought it out - exactly the same.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:23.120
So when the children are sleeping in the night, you see, these souls capture them

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:30.260
and take away their souls with them because after all they are very small children

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.060
and the child is dead; They are let lose by these mediums.

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:52.720
But the children should sleep with parents then they are protected.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:03.920
There's one more question I'd like to ask You. You have said that people had Polio Mellitus

01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.100
- and they were seekers and there was an attack on the center. 
- Haan
- Now this

01:38:10.660 --> 01:38:16.900
- Polio [UNCLEAR - I WOULD SAY?] 
- Yes. People who had polio are now having a new problem. Umm..

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:24.960
When is the virus who has gone away originally stay on to your home cells on the spinal cord

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:32.120
recur but that recur finally lasted for about thirty years and now it's

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.580
dying away or something is happening to it and people who had polio are getting

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.860
strange fatigues [UNCLEAR]

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:48.760
abrasions, having muscle cramps and pains and it's affecting about

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:55.900
50% of people who had polio that is in America it would be about 300 thousand people

01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:01.340
and in Australia quite a lot also, several thousand and

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:08.820
Same thing - same, the mediums, you see. In America there's openly it's freedom na - you can have witchcraft.

01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.300
All kinds of false gurus are there - here too.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.960
- There are three sahaja yogis in Melbourne [UNCLEAR] who had polio and are suffering these symptoms
- Oh, that we can correct

01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:27.700
That we can correct. We'll correct it, that's no problem. That's only Mooladhara we'll have to work it out, you see - the heat on the Mooladhara.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:35.420
That can be corrected, no problem - that can be corrected; With the sahaja yogis we can but not non sahaja yogis.

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.880
- Yesterday we, day before yesterday we cured uh.. AID patient,
- Oh!

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:49.720
husband and wife, cured them but I told them you have to have will power now because I have cured before also - you remember that?

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:58.400
But they go back to the same bad habits. Now they are married so that's not such a problem but I said you have to - and he was a policeman to begin with.

01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:02.760
this fellow. I said, "If you can just have your will-power,

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:07.360
we'll get you perfectly alright." Their faces were changed, they're looking so beautiful.

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:14.460
So, AIDS is curable - with one candle, both of them.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:23.500
- Is, is there something specific that we can do for this polio?
- Yeah, we will, we can work it out.

01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:29.140
- Because it is, it's affecting me and
- You said that the virus is gone, is wrong. Virus is still there
- Still there

01:40:29.340 --> 01:40:33.500
We have to take out the virus, that's all - it's not difficult.

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:41.700
It's affecting Peter Patter and [UNCLEAR] Abraham, a new sahaja yogi in [UNCLEAR] and myself.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:48.920
- They were not sahaja yogis before?
- Before they had polio
- Hmm
- [UNCLEAR]

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:56.580
- It's come on to since smaller sahaja yogis too.
- They got polio before or after?
- As children

01:40:57.940 --> 01:41:05.800
- As children they got it.
- Yeah. It's affecting people in their age and middle age so thirty years after the disease is

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:14.620
Polio get cured also in sahaja yoga; Not after a certain age but children and all that they get cured of polio

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.660
so we'll see, we'll see them, we'll see.

01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:28.480
There are so many other new diseases which I described before, like Yuppies disease, you see is another one and it has come now.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.700
I told them about 3-4 years back; I had told them about AIDS and now I told them about Yuppies disease - it has come

01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:40.380
where the people are overactive, this, that; Now the conscious mind doesn't work;

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:46.160
Anything you want to do consciously, you cannot do it - unconsciously you can do it. Very serious disease.

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:52.220
And if you want to get up, say from your chair, you cannot but unconsciously you can get up.

01:41:55.620 --> 01:42:01.900
They're very common disease. Then over-activity of the children, speediness of the children - so many things there are coming.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:08.840
That I told them, they won't listen to Me - especially in France because of Sartre

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:16.720
who was another fellow who talked about will power that, "You must have, your will is everything and sex is nothing," I mean, sex is there but

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:24.300
emotions is nothing, so he put people on the right side, as a result now this Yuppies disease has started.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.140
- You have to be in balance.
- [INAUDIBLE] a question

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:40.500
- Alright?
- Yes, thank You [UNCLEAR]
-  May God bless you!
- Can I ask You one question now, Shree Mother?

01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:48.440
- Yes.
- Umm, what do you think of the equality - talking about balance - what do You think of the equality of two sexes?

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.620
- Quality?
- Between men and women. What are Your views on [UNCLEAR]

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:58.520
- You see, man and women are like two, two wheels of a chariot.

01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:04.620
One is on the left, another is on the right

01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:11.980
so, one has to be emotional, another has to be more mental.

01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:18.860
One has to be emotional because they are left-sided, women and the men have to be mental - it's important.

01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:27.240
We have to have two wheels and you can't fix left to the right and the right to the left. So they are as they are - it's perfect.

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:43.040
They are equal but not similar.

01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.340
And what do You think of all this movements towards equality?

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:02.840
You see, women should understand that they are complementary to men

01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.960
and they should know how to handle men - it's a trick.

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:21.780
How can they be equal when they are complementary, complementary to men?

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:29.740
From my understanding it means that it's something that helps, supports,

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:36.120
- but you are not on the same standard.
- No, in nature they are different, you see.

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:44.140
Women are spiritually more evolved, much more evolved spiritually than men

01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:04.220
because they are, they are the preservers of the society - they create the society.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:22.360
Men are more towards economics and politics

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:38.980
The theories go on changing one after another. You see, politics changes it's own theories

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:44.560
and economics changes it's own theories and they go on producing theories after theories and then they

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:52.020
again come back - it's all mental, you see, the mental projections are there. So the mental projection goes in a linear way, again collapses like

01:45:52.360 --> 01:46:00.260
They'll produce Science, of the Science they'll produce something so destructive; They start on constructive lines, like Hydrogen bomb -

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:08.520
see, it's like that but women are preservers. They must know their quality. They are the ones who preserve.

01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.580
All, they're chosen to be mothers. I mean, they think, to be mother they think is a very low thing because

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.860
I don't know how this idea has come to you; To be a mother is the greatest thing, I think.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:43.480
I'm a Mother now; Only because I'm a Mother, they all respect Me and only a Mother can do this kind of work also.

01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:50.920
Supposing in My place there was anybody else - any man - take Krishna, Rama, Christ, any one

01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:58.180
Christ would have got Himself crucified - finished with everyone else [SHREE MATAJI  LAUGHS] fed up,

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:03.440
then Krishna would have taken the Sudarshan chakra, would have killed everyone

01:47:03.700 --> 01:47:07.560
Rama would have taken his arrow, killed everyone.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:12.420
You have to have patience, you have to have love, you have to

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:17.900
uh.. look after them and I'm the only one, I've seen, among all of them who has lived so long

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.580
because I've to finish the job - see they're not bothered.

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.900
- But you're not old.
- Annh?
- You're not old.
-  You're not?

01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:40.380
- You're not old.
- Old inside but if you see, I was born in 1923, is a birth certificate is there

01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:45.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:49.180
What's your age, now let's see. What's your age?

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:54.760
- What do You think?
- Annh?
- I'm forty-nine.
- Forty-nine. My daughter is forty-two

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.160
- Thank You!
- May God bless you!

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:14.440
So, women should not think they are low by any chance. Even if men [UNCLEAR - SHOW?], just laugh at it. You see, Indian women are very clever.

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:23.840
First of all, they know how to cook very well and what their husbands like so husband is back at home.

01:48:25.420 --> 01:48:31.600
He has to eat the food cooked by his wife - he can't stand anything else. Then they know

01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:40.640
why he gets angry, what are his weak points, on what he gets angry. She doesn't say anything about, she just keeps quiet on that point.

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:46.400
And when he is in a sweet mood, then she will tell him that this should be done

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:51.460
but the woman has to be wise. If she is wise, she can handle it.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:49:00.340
- And where she gets, get the wisdom from?
- Wisdom because they are women.
- Hmm

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:07.400
They should not try to copy men, then they are wise. Once they start copying men, then they get lost

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:16.480
otherwise they are born wise. Wisdom has to be with them because they have to produce children, look after them, they have to

01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:22.240
uh.. create a family, they have to look after the whole society - is a very responsible job.

01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.500
but here I find, most of the men are looking after the children and the women are going out for work.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.280
God save the children! [SHREE MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.520
- Don't You think that men can look after children as well as women?
- No, they can't.

01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:54.080
Like mother they cannot - they haven't got tolerance of a mother.

01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.680
They can't. You have to have that tolerance which only mother has.

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:09.100
From the very beginning, you see, when she conceives the child [UNCLEAR -GROWS?], she's worried for it.

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.400
She doesn't worry for her own comfort. When the child is born,

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:20.420
till the child is born she gets terrible pains, she takes all the labour pains. As soon as the child is born, she forgets everything.

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:28.120
She doesn't blame the child for that, at all - never. Never a mother has blamed the child for the labour pains she has gone through.

01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:35.940
But men, if they have to exert anything for the boys, you see or girls, they get fed up.

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:49.100
But nowadays women are becoming more like men, so you can't say, you see it's such a mixture - they're becoming unisex.

01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:56.700
So it's impossible to find out a woman sometimes who's so emotionally attached to the children, looking after them

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:03.800
so sometimes the men might be more emotional but that doesn't mean that it's a fact of life.

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:11.500
Fact of life is that, the women are endowed with this wisdom of love. They are endowed, they shouldn't lose it.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:18.680
- How many children you have?
- Three.
- That's good.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:25.320
- And you're doing your work also. You're doing everything.
- Yes.
- And you have children too.

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:31.240
Imagine without children what this world would be! They are like flowers.

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:41.000
- Alright.
- Thank You.
- Thank you very much. You had your tea or not?

01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:45.140
- Yes I had my tea. Thank you very much.
 - Yes, thank you.
- Thank you, Mother.

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:52.300
Shree Mother, we [UNCLEAR - CONVEY?] our thank You, during the interviews I was going to ask you later

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:59.300
about the radio program I'm doing for the ABC about Science and religion coming together.

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:06.020
And in the middle of Your answers, You spontaneously answered one of the major questions that I had to ask so [UNCLEAR]

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:14.020
No, also I'll tell you about this; I told them, the scientist, about the Carbon atom for the - we have got Dr. Worlikar

01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:20.240
and Dr. Misra and Dr. Yohan - all these are scientists. They said that, "Mother, how do You say that

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:27.080
uh.. Mooladhara is made of Carbon?" I said, "Alright, you take a Carbon atom and make a photograph of that

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:35.740
and make a model. Now see that from right to left what do you see?"

01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:43.820
They see a Swastika. They made a model. "Then you make a model and same thing you see the other way round

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.640
from left to right,"  and they see Onkara

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:55.140
and from down below, you see a cross; It's proved.

01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:03.020
- [UNCLEAR] Marvellous! Marvellous [UNCLEAR] Shree Mother.
- I mean, Science is what,-

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:10.080
is what you see and religion is what, which indicates what you have to see further.

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:19.500
But religion should be real, not this kind of religion so called - there's no conflict of any kind.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.100
Now we have proved Parasympathetic Nervous system; Everything we have proved now.

01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.540
How we have medically we have cured the people if there was no combination between the two!

01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:38.140
Thank You for the [UNCLEAR] Shree Mother - it's marvellous!

01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:52.420
- I hope you are satisfied.
- We are very thankful, Mother.
- But as far as,

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.880
as far as this question of cot deaths,

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:04.360
I don't know, if they'll believe Me. [LAUGHTER] You must get rid of all these mediums.

01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:12.120
You have so many in Australia and they are, compared to your population they are too many, I think.

01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:22.420
And this Torat and all that they have and what is, no they have some sort of a  - what's that Jew stuff is called as?

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:29.920
- Jew?
- There's something Jewish they use for telling future?
- Tarot cards
- Annh?

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.600
- Tarot cards
- Tarak
- Tarot
- Tarot, tarot

01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:42.840
and then this Pentecostals, they are the same, Charismatics are the same and also this

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:49.520
twice born people. Any fainting means that.

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.120
Rajneesh's people, before Me they just faint, I mean, become like stones.

01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:03.120
[UNCLEAR] Eucalyptus Shree Mataji, I'm trying to get people to plant something else.

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:12.560
- Is, is that good advice?
- Something else what?
- Other than Eucalyptus trees. [UNCLEAR]

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:19.120
But the Eucalyptus is alright if there is water, sufficient water, if it rains more

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.660
but otherwise drains out the water, sucks in the water.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.660
How can they help to make Australia more fertile again other trees [UNCLEAR]?

01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:38.800
See, what I find there are too many insects here and that may be because you are so artificially treating everything here.

01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:45.060
See, like in India, if we have worms in the garden, we don't mind because the parrots come and eat the worms

01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:53.280
and they don't eat your fruits - they're non-vegetarian people, you see, [LAUGHTER]

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:58.960
but when there's nothing, they eat that. And I'm surprised, you have white ant problem,

01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:02.780
while we don't have anything in India now - how they have solved it.

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:11.320
There is one another kind of a centipede which eats those white ants

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:18.520
but by removing all these things, you see, there's no balance.

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:24.600
In the nature there's a balance, one eats the other and doesn't require too much of insecticides

01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:34.520
but they won't have those here, I think. They're extremely, extremely particular

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:39.340
about not getting any worms and things but there are maximum here, I think.

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:47.020
All kinds of viruses, this, that - you cannot plant any tree because

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:55.020
there are viruses or even if you have some good then eaten up by white ants and this and that - I can't understand.

01:56:55.660 --> 01:57:02.720
One of our major rivers is so [UNCLEAR] that they can't even get animals drink in it or wash in it

01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:08.120
- or put it on the crops anymore.
- Waters?
- River, yes.

01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:14.960
- Pollution?
- Yes.
- Is all due to imbalance
- In Adelaide to manage, Shree Mother, they have banned

01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:21.800
the whole of Eastern half of the Adelaide from using the water from the river Murray - nobody's allowed to use it.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:30.260
It's actually got an allergy worm in it and it poisoning stock and people; They're not even allowing them to bathe in it.

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:38.340
Also, I think, uh.. because of all left-sided people here, like these mediums and all that, all these must be prospering so.

01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:41.800
Well, in a country like India, we don't have all these problems.

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:48.360
- [UNCLEAR] there're so many more people.
- I think, they are good people, they are religious

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:53.420
and they don't indulge into all these nonsensical habits, perhaps.

01:57:54.300 --> 01:58:00.060
We have never heard of an allergy coming like that or anything. Why do they grow here so much?

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:08.600
It's site is claiming Mother, that it's the leaking of the uh... fertilizers into the waters that are doing it.

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.380
but it seems also to do with heat - that on the days when it gets hot

01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:23.140
- it doubles with 100% per day
- We too have, you see, heat, much worse

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:31.340
but I personally think also you used all these uh.. seashores and the river-banks

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:39.880
for your resorts and you insulted the rivers, if you see basically,

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:48.780
that's why you are, you see this, you uh... new civilization of tourism, you see,

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:56.000
tourist; You have insulted the sea, you have insulted the rivers - you do all kinds of dirty things there

01:58:57.180 --> 01:59:02.500
- that might be the reason.
- [UNCLEAR]

01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:10.900
- speed-boat racing, water-skiing and head-on steamers, everything like this tourists
- tourist things.

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:18.160
But if you put vibrated water, the allergy will die immediately - it will die, it will go away.

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:25.740
In America, in New Jersey, I was there. The night, first night, there were those locusts,

01:59:26.100 --> 01:59:34.140
kind of locusts, which arrived and they were making noises tuk, tuk, tuk tuk, all the time. From next day they disappeared and they have never appeared since then.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:39.860
We too have mosquitoes but not to such an extent.

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:48.360
I mean, a city like Melbourne should not have any mosquito, whatsoever.

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:59.760
[ASIDE - I don't want, bas]. These insecticides also must be dangerous things.

02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:09.420
They're finding [UNCLEAR] of finding huge build-up of these insecticides in human brain, Shree Mother.

02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:14.340
They've been testing many women recently and finding people that [UNCLEAR]

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:21.200
accumulated deposits of these insecticides from the food - that have been carried through in the food.

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:25.300
Ah, ah, terrible!

02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:32.340
[UNCLEAR] I think,  that's what's have been to make the children so hyper-active.

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:38.020
Yeah, must be. No also this hybrid, hybrid food,

02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:46.740
hybrid animals, you see, your hybrid animals - I must tell you the story about it; Your hybrid animals are there in Rahuri

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:56.880
and cows from here famous and I went to see them, you see, because Chavan is in the animal husbandry, I went to see.

02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:05.760
And our Indian cows just came, you see, very sweetly stood there, put My hands on them - they had tears in their eyes, very sweet

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:13.220
and suddenly, I don't know what happened to the Australian cows, they all became violent

02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:21.140
and came running and started breaking this, breaking that. I said, "Now the bhoots must be there the way they were behaving." I, I just got out of it.

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:28.320
But they have now studied and they say that, "If you have even the chickens from

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:36.000
hens and the cocks from Australia or from anywhere, hybrid ones, they're very funny according to us,"

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:44.540
because an Indian hen as soon as she sees any vulture in the sky, immediately she'll say coo, coo, coo, coo get to all of them under her thing

02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:51.920
but they, these do not do anything - they just stand like that. The chicks are taken away they don't no worry.

02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:59.260
And if you have an Australian bull, you see, he doesn't know how to go on a street.

02:01:59.780 --> 02:02:06.620
He just goes towards any vehicle, anything coming around - he has no sense to cross the road.

02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:15.060
So there's a big problem. They don't allow them to go out - even the Australian cows because they're hybrid.

02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:23.140
With sahaja yoga we produce food out of the seeds which are not hybrid. You know, in My field

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:30.420
we, I sowed about 60 kilos of rice - vibrated,

02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:36.680
ordinary, not hybrid, of basmati rice in one acre of land and we got

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:44.520
one thousand four hundred acres - such beautiful thin ones - even the university people were surprised

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:50.760
that how did You get it and the sunflower so big as that - you won't believe, you could not lift it.

02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:59.480
Shree Mother, with Professor Chavan, could we write to him and get some information about the results of some of these

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:07.740
- experiments that you've been doing?
- Haan, you can. There is one Dr. Hamid who has done experiments with pigs,

02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:15.240
there's Dr - from Austria. Then, then there's Dr. - what's his name is, Sanghwi who has done with wheat

02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:23.300
and Chavan has done with animals, so we can get all that; At least here people will see to it - Indians don't want to see that.

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:33.580
We have contacted Dr. Hamid about these [UNCLEAR] programs and he's given us a lot of information.

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:42.020
But you know, he had, he had no way to vibrate the water because the water was passing through the

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:50.340
uh.. tap, you see - it could only go through a, what you call the, pipes

02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:57.500
so what he did is, one of the junctions he opened out and put the ring that you wear

02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:03.560
[LAUGHTER] and managed the whole show

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.160
and non-hybrid seed growed better than hybrid.

02:04:12.660 --> 02:04:20.080
He's shown it he's wonderful! He could be invited here by some University and he could give lectures -

02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:26.600
will be good for you, I tell you, from every angle and with vibrations all these things disappear all disease [UNCLEAR] everything.

02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:38.380
We have no problems in Pratishthan at all, of anything; We don't use insecticide - nothing.

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:45.860
Little bit they did put something, very ordinary. I think, they put the

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:55.640
uh.. tobacco water - soaking tobacco in the water and put that little bit - that's all I know.

02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:05.220
Vibrated water solves the problem, you know. What they were telling that, that they wanted to sprout some seeds and

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.780
when it was to be, they said it will sprout after six days - it sprouted and the lid also came out

02:05:13.340 --> 02:05:19.940
in two days. [LAUGHTER] They can believe into it, they can see it for themselves.

02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:31.680
I'm going to see somebody - the principal, the vice-chancellor of Rahuri University, who wants to do experiments with it.

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:41.940
Our garden was nothing one year back and this time you come and see the whole thing is so good.

02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:49.660
Oh, I thought you had all kinds of angles. [LAUGHTER]

02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:55.740
Your father really is a remarkable man, I must say, such a remarkable person!

02:05:56.420 --> 02:06:01.420
He first went there, took all the measurements

02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:07.300
then he did this, he brought it with him, fixed them up

02:06:07.680 --> 02:06:11.380
and nobody knew how he was living in Pratishthan.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:16.040
I don't know he was comfortable because I was coming, going, I was not there.

02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:20.060
He never complained - nothing. So sweetly he did everything.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:26.040
I said, "I must pay for it after all, it's such a thing you have done." He wouldn't accept anything.

02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:35.080
Amazing! and worked like a young man, I tell you - everybody was surprised.

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:39.620
- He's sick Mother. He has hepatitis. He's coming...
- No, no, I'll put it right, call him here.

02:06:39.860 --> 02:06:43.960
- Must be - in India did he get this?
- Yes, [UNCLEAR]
- Must have been. Very simple.

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:48.740
Uh.. you ask him to boil some radish leaves

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:55.100
and just drink that water with some sugar. I'll give you the vibrated sugar. Only drink that water, it will go away.

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:02.160
Cause they get it in India. You see, I told them not to drink water here and there but they do drink.

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:06.540
He'll be alright but you just tell him - radish leaves.

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:18.320
Simple thing like radish leaves and vibrated sugar, after all, to be mixed with it.

02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:29.420
What about the China town here?

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:36.940
[LAUGHTER]
- There're people, Shree Mother
- People and everything

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:47.540
- Like Chinese always seek, Mother.
- Better go there and see, have a look.
- Yes, Shree Mother.

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:53.080
- Maybe they might get vibrations. Do they have some ivory here?

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:59.420
- Yes, I think, they still do.
- But they are expensive compared to Hong Kong, could be?

02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:03.400
- Should be.
- Should be - but we can have a look.

02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:09.800
- Yes, Mother.
- You see, because now I told them not to give Me any silver, nothing, I will not take and just I put down My foot

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:16.960
- nothing doing - so now, they want to have some ivory [LAUGHTER] then I'll bring them down to stone

02:08:17.220 --> 02:08:23.840
[LAUGHTER]

02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:34.400
I have stopped for silver because is now very expensive in India so Vido went down with Me to

02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:40.900
Turkey and the silver there is so cheap, so cheap.

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:48.220
I don't know how he planned it, he bought all that silver this time - you must have seen it - it's his whole doing.

02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:52.700
Without My knowledge he bought all that. He said, "This is the last time Mother,"

02:08:53.380 --> 02:09:00.960
but it is cheaper, cheaper than brass [UNCLEAR] I don't know what to [UNCLEAR]. I said, "You always get somethings like that."

02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:08.820
Such beautiful birds you have, annh? Very beautiful!

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:17.660
- [UNCLEAR - THEY'RE NAMED LAILA AND MAJNU?]
- Annh? They should be realized. Give them some vibrated water.

02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:24.080
- [MARATHI] Laila, Majnu
- Annh? Laila, Majnu. [MARATHI]

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:30.680
[MARATHI] Why don't you keep the name Laila, Majnu?

02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:39.140
Couple, a romantic couple. But they are of the same kind? Different types they are.

02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:45.020
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
- In America they call them love birds.
- These two?

02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:51.080
- but in Australia we call them bajru guards. The name is from Australia.
- But they have different things.

02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:58.360
- different colours.
- Is it that the female is different and a male is different?
- It is just a variety of colours. You can get green, yellow

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.340
- and there're many hybrid as well.
- Hybrid? Then they cannot reproduce.

02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:13.060
- Yeah. You should bring them to India, I think. Annh, we'll arrange it.

02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:20.300
- [UNCLEAR - MAM?] here all are chirping in the backgarden. The man in the back has one thousand of them, these birds.
- This kind?

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:27.360
- Yeah, they're very sweet birds.
- Very sweet! Because they can stand the heat alright

02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:33.020
- Hmm, yes. If you have one at a time, you can teach them [UNCLEAR - SPEAK?]
-  Eh..

02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:40.760
When you come next time, you better bring them [LAUGHTER] because this place is so expensive, I mean,

02:10:40.960 --> 02:10:45.960
I'm really amazed that the prices you have to pay for something - so nonsensical.

02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:54.520
Silk, cotton so expensive, I don't know! The most expensive place is Australia, do you know that?

02:10:55.980 --> 02:11:01.600
- [UNCLEAR] Shree Mother.
- And [UNCLEAR] is very expensive.
- Everything.

02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:11.600
Even England is cheaper, much cheaper. But it is gone up suddenly

02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:15.940
within these. You has some nice things here before.

02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:24.680
When you come to India, why don't you buy things for yourself, bring them here instead of buying them here?

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.140
Very expensive! How can you save, I mean, in this kind of thing!

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:40.220
- Food is alright. Hello!
- Will You excuse me. I had forgot that
- Alright, May God bless you! Thank you very much.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:48.200
- [UNCLEAR]
- I didn't get your name, I didn't get your name
- Vivian.
- Annh? Vivian. What's the Sir name?

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:52.660
- What's the Sir name?
- Very pleased to meet You. Thank You!
- Vivian, what's the Sir name?
- Morris.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.340
- Morris. 
- Yes.
- Very easy to remember. Otherwise they are very difficult names
- Thank You very much

02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:05.040
- Thank you. Thank you very..  May God bless you! 
- Thanks.
- Now enjoy.
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, please.

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:15.160
[EXCHANGE OF FORMALITIES] Bye and thank you.
