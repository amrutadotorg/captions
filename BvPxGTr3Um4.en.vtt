00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:15.541
Today we have gathered here in this beautiful
place, to work out something very deep.

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:37.208
There are certain things of which we
are not aware, which are in the history,

00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:48.645
and some things in the atmosphere,

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.015
they affect us very much,

00:00:54.351 --> 00:01:01.139
because we are the product of five elements,

00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:15.486
out of which the Mother Earth
is the left side within us.

00:01:20.988 --> 00:01:29.264
The Mother Earth changes its atmosphere

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:35.979
its hills and dales, rivers,
fashions them in such a way

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.291
that it gives a variety
to her temperaments.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:59.319
Now God has created only one world,
He’s not created many worlds,

00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:01.847
He’s created only one
world, this world,

00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:08.977
where alone here only
human beings are created.

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:21.370
So, this is the most
important planet, you can say,

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.760
which has been in the
attention of the Divine.

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:42.435
So, the whole cosmos works out
for the benefit of this planet,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:59.740
and the working of that cosmos has created this earth, and then human beings, and then the Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:18.845
So, the Sahaja Yogis are the
epitome of the creative powers.

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:28.863
They are the epitome of God’s desire,

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:34.271
that’s what He desired.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.804
That’s why He created this cosmos,
this universe and this earth.

00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:51.184
So now His desire is fulfilled

00:03:54.727 --> 00:04:00.493
when He sees His Being
reflected through the Sahaja Yogis

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:14.536
But there is still a few things we
have to clear out within ourselves.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.473
His desire represents the
Mahakali power within us.

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:41.075
Now we have to see how His desire
has worked in creating ourselves.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.185
First is the desire which is absolutely passionate.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:05:02.802
There’s nothing desired, nothing else is
desired, but the creation of Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:22.180
So, the first desire of any Sahaja
Yogi is to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:28.673 --> 00:05:34.891
No other desire should be
dominant or exist, in a way;

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.729
but to fulfill that desire, we
have to fulfill some conditions.

00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:57.138
So, one of the conditions, the
most important, is the sincerity,

00:06:02.176 --> 00:06:09.426
as God doesn’t need that qualification, He
cannot be insincere even if He wants to be.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:25.641
He does not have your type of intellect
which can play devious roles with Him,

00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:41.998
but the human beings have got this devious
intellect, which plays very much around.

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:59.218
But as Sahaja Yogis you can see that
intellect very carefully and clearly.

00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:10.989
God is egoless because He does
everything, so He’s egoless,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:24.624
or we can say He is the Ego only,
if that means doing something.

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:31.712
But human beings have ego

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.510
because they don’t do anything
and think they’re doing something.

00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:51.292
You know this very well.

00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:58.929
So, when you start assuming
that you do something,

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:01.679
you get identified with
such myths very easily,

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:06.289
only human beings can be
identified with Myths, not God.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:20.798
But after Realisation you
can see your ego clearly.

00:08:25.609 --> 00:08:28.109
It acts in various ways.

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:35.239
If we appoint somebody as a leader,

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.429
the leader may start thinking
that he’s really the leader,

00:08:48.286 --> 00:08:52.466
and then it becomes really a problem for him

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:59.016
because he starts losing
everything that is leadership.

00:09:10.242 --> 00:09:14.233
But the worst is, their wives start
thinking they are the leaders,

00:09:21.555 --> 00:09:26.406
and sometimes the children
also think that way;

00:09:38.107 --> 00:09:42.714
and I won’t be surprised even if
their dogs and pets behave that way.

00:09:52.481 --> 00:09:56.250
It can be any stupid thing.

00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:09.692
So, with this kind of an ego a Sahaja Yogi
can see, you see, himself, how he behaves.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:23.560
I watch them and it provides a lot of humour for Me

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.770
I watch them with their ego.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.050
"Them" being the leaders?

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.680
No, no, no!  All!  All of them.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.770
I was worried.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.530
They push forward everywhere,
they’ll sit in the forward line,

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:50.809
they’ll push forward, they’ll be there first to

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:54.939
come in the front line,
sort of thing is there.

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:11.126
But if you are a sincere person,

00:11:11.126 --> 00:11:17.636
if you have the sincerity, then you’ll enjoy
that sincerity wherever you are standing,

00:11:17.648 --> 00:11:20.148
wherever you are sitting.

00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:34.230
So, the ego can try to deceive
you very much all the time,

00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:36.853
so you have to be
careful about this ego

00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:40.453
because he can sit on your
head and can monitor you.

00:11:54.143 --> 00:12:01.858
I have seen people going down very rapidly
with this idea that they’re something special.

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:16.286
So, sincerity, though it is
the quality of the left side,

00:12:16.286 --> 00:12:19.786
can be dominated by the
right side, this way.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:37.500
The second thing about your desire,
that it should be a pure desire

00:12:44.018 --> 00:12:49.850
and the pure desire is very simple for
you because I’m sitting before you.

00:12:58.032 --> 00:13:02.232
The pure desire of a
seeker is to see God,

00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:10.873
to be in the company of God,
to be in association with God.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:35.790
As they call it, Salokya, Samipya and
Sanidya; there are three words describing it.

00:13:41.628 --> 00:13:46.258
But without asking, without thinking of it,

00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:50.688
you have been given the fourth
dimension called as the Tadatmya,

00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:54.623
means becoming one with My body, My being;

00:14:06.812 --> 00:14:09.987
so that you become protected,

00:14:09.997 --> 00:14:11.807
absolutely cleansed

00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:14.307
and nourished in My being.

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:26.036
But when you are not aware of it,

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:27.856
then what happens,

00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:32.174
that I have to suffer in My body to cleanse you.

00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:48.317
So, all other desires can
create problems within you.

00:14:57.101 --> 00:15:05.051
Now as I was telling you that this France
is a creation of the Mother Earth,

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.570
with her special features.

00:15:14.043 --> 00:15:19.172
We have to examine what effects
it can have on a French mind.

00:15:26.866 --> 00:15:34.606
It’s a historical build-up also
which affects this country.

00:15:40.631 --> 00:15:43.323
It’s a very affluent country,

00:15:43.298 --> 00:15:49.211
you have got very rich soil and you produce beautiful agricultural products.

00:15:54.431 --> 00:16:06.053
So, when you are satisfied on the material
level then you start moving left or right,

00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:19.017
because you are very
naïve about one thing,

00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:25.747
that we have to rise higher,
higher into our ascent.

00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:43.443
Also, that we are not aware that
that is the goal for our evolution.

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:57.082
So, we all have to ascend, that’s
all, nothing else is important.

00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:11.035
So as soon as you find that
materially you are all right,

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:17.325
then if you do not have the
idea that you have to ascend,

00:17:17.323 --> 00:17:21.005
you can really move on to
the left and the right.

00:17:34.741 --> 00:17:43.723
France being a very, very affluent country
among most of the European and the English,

00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:51.163
they got into this movement much
earlier than any other country.

00:18:02.772 --> 00:18:10.651
So, the, if you can find the aggressiveness
of the French, based on these lines,

00:18:10.671 --> 00:18:13.171
because they go to the right side.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:28.539
Like the French are never bothered to see or to find out what is the culture of other people.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.520
They’re very self-opinionated
and thought no end of themselves

00:18:42.525 --> 00:18:45.860
and they thought they knew
all what was culture is.

00:18:53.844 --> 00:19:00.919
As a result, they became completely
ignorant of all other cultures

00:19:00.905 --> 00:19:03.798
which were much more
evolved than theirs

00:19:15.413 --> 00:19:25.096
The concept of beauty came up to
a certain level of understanding

00:19:25.102 --> 00:19:29.611
and then again it deviated
into wrong direction.

00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:46.115
Also, I would say, the way the
Christianity was preached in those days,

00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:49.565
no respect for women was there.

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:03.289
So, the women did not understand
that they are the left side

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:06.419
and they have to look
after their chastity.

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:29.093
In the beginning whenever I read about
French, like Emile Zola or other people

00:20:29.093 --> 00:20:36.333
Maupassant, all that, what I found
that women were not at all respected,

00:20:36.339 --> 00:20:38.839
nor they were respectable,

00:20:52.163 --> 00:20:58.093
or if you read, say, for example, Nana,
is a one, he has written, Emile Zola;

00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:03.073
if you read her, you will be surprised that they have given the four sides of a woman in one woman,

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.560
he has described four sides.

00:21:12.307 --> 00:21:18.001
And one part which is really a woman
is never respected in the society

00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:23.105
when she is compassionate and good,
that part she’s not respected:

00:21:23.114 --> 00:21:24.995
on the contrary she’s kicked out.

00:21:24.995 --> 00:21:32.234
So, in other parts, she behaves a cunning
woman, or she behaves like a prostitute,

00:21:32.257 --> 00:21:37.622
or she behaves like an aggressive woman,
because the part that is respectable,

00:21:37.626 --> 00:21:41.742
and that is the one which was for
her ascent and was her innate,

00:21:41.742 --> 00:21:45.056
was not at all understood or respected.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:21.220
So, the instrument of the left side which are the women of this country were first harmed

00:22:30.113 --> 00:22:36.680
and these became the main
source of troubles in France.

00:22:45.185 --> 00:22:48.748
On the other side, they
became extremely aggressive;

00:22:51.518 --> 00:22:57.870
the men became aggressive and because women were not respected, they also became aggressive.

00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:07.390
The other women who could not
do that became extreme left,

00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:11.725
started crying, weeping and melancholy;

00:23:12.979 --> 00:23:17.457
melancholy character they
developed, melancholy.

00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:40.002
Then they started, you see, writing
about all this melancholy nonsense,

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:47.012
which doesn’t exist and indulging into
it, like wine or some sort of a thing.

00:23:50.972 --> 00:23:56.239
The movement on the left-hand side, naturally, because men also got attracted towards it,

00:23:56.218 --> 00:24:00.065
made them take to
left-sided food as well.

00:24:06.554 --> 00:24:13.921
Now, for example, they developed the
cheese which was all full of fungus,

00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:16.807
which was dead matter.

00:24:27.757 --> 00:24:30.257
Fungus kills all that is right side;

00:24:33.979 --> 00:24:36.479
anything living can be
killed with fungus.

00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:43.869
Not only as far as the food is
concerned but temperamentally

00:24:43.859 --> 00:24:47.239
gradually they started
becoming like funguses.

00:24:58.514 --> 00:25:06.283
So, the fungus itself has a quality, is
to, that it thrives on the dead matter.

00:25:13.403 --> 00:25:20.316
So they went down to all places where they
could find the dead matter, like Egypt.

00:25:30.752 --> 00:25:34.405
They were not very much interested
in India, even to rule India,

00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:46.586
but they were very much interested
in Egyptian dead things

00:25:46.597 --> 00:25:52.748
and other places wherever they could
find this dead stuff available to them.

00:26:05.136 --> 00:26:11.007
Also, I would say Christianity,
which started decaying very much,

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:13.539
became a big hold in France.

00:26:28.175 --> 00:26:30.929
Religion also became like a fungus;

00:26:39.897 --> 00:26:49.117
like building, say, big churches
and around them to bury the dead.

00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:04.920
Now, I went to see Chartres; you have a
beautiful, a very, very beautiful church

00:27:04.954 --> 00:27:12.480
and very good work done by the artist, but there are lying all dead bodies all around, it’s horrible.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:31.985
Actually, dead people should be burnt,
only the realised soul can be buried.

00:27:51.421 --> 00:28:00.836
The sense of respect was lacking very much,
even in the history, you can see clearly.

00:28:06.592 --> 00:28:09.092
What was important
throughout was the money.

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:22.259
As I see the French revolution took place when I must say the queen was not a bad woman at all.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.985
She was actually a great protégée.

00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:44.955
She was a protector of all the artists of France

00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:51.660
and she’s the one who gave such a
great momentum to the art of France.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:09.457
If she created something like a furniture piece or any building, today even you show it with pride.

00:29:14.249 --> 00:29:20.595
After all she was not going to take it with
her; it was for France she made everything.

00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:27.501
But the French wanted more
money to be distributed.

00:29:27.501 --> 00:29:31.618
For what? For drinking more wine,

00:29:41.236 --> 00:29:44.288
not to create anything
of eternal interest.

00:29:53.448 --> 00:29:58.203
That’s why I say those who drink have no
right to strike, or to ask for more money

00:29:58.182 --> 00:30:01.984
because they have more money,
that’s why they drink.

00:30:15.929 --> 00:30:22.777
So, I don’t believe in capitalism, but I do believe that those who can create something new,

00:30:22.777 --> 00:30:30.768
who can create something – not new in the sense of nonsense, but a thing of eternal values

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.468
must be given money to create that.

00:30:49.794 --> 00:30:52.294
There are many capitalists
who do wrong things,

00:30:52.294 --> 00:30:57.729
like buying instruments of
war and things like that.

00:31:07.569 --> 00:31:10.690
Now we have England, we have America,

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:15.288
they’re doing this and creating
concrete jungle for the progeny.

00:31:17.423 --> 00:31:20.293
Great Britain and England
and America is doing this.

00:31:20.298 --> 00:31:25.360
is to buy more weapons and otherwise
creating concrete jungles.

00:31:36.718 --> 00:31:44.002
And in Russia they say that they are giving equal distribution, but people drink like fish.

00:32:00.827 --> 00:32:03.142
So, with this French revolution also,

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:10.312
the drinking became a part and
parcel of the lives of the French,

00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:12.812
because they got easy money.

00:32:30.795 --> 00:32:37.735
So, the more money was acquired for
doing all kinds of unrighteous things,

00:32:37.757 --> 00:32:42.781
unholy things and, we can
say, inauspicious things.

00:32:51.091 --> 00:32:55.337
But there were poor people, perhaps
they did not drink so much,

00:32:55.354 --> 00:32:59.347
who created great architecture
here in this country.

00:33:08.644 --> 00:33:14.290
Despite that, great artists were born
in this country who had no money.

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:19.861
They died, becoming mad
or becoming paupers.

00:33:35.971 --> 00:33:43.021
Now we have Napoleon, another person
who tried to conquer other places;

00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:47.058
he’s another ego trip that
he did in the history.

00:33:53.608 --> 00:33:56.328
But still he was not
a very ignoble person

00:33:56.328 --> 00:34:01.387
as we find so many of them are
these days, who are the rulers.

00:34:08.645 --> 00:34:14.177
The only thing I feel about him that
he didn’t have a great character

00:34:14.175 --> 00:34:17.777
to leave any great
impress on people,

00:34:17.777 --> 00:34:22.615
how to enhance their
life in their quality.

00:34:43.052 --> 00:34:49.684
So, the people who could have really
impressed your minds towards the ascent

00:34:49.711 --> 00:34:53.894
were all paupers or became
mad or were wasted.

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:30.008
Ultimately, I think the whole aggressiveness disappeared
with understanding that it is no use aggressing,

00:35:29.984 --> 00:35:34.508
but the left movement still
remained very prevalent.

00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:58.688
So, for the rest of the world, French
are very weird, queer, strange people.

00:36:05.357 --> 00:36:10.255
They developed their own insular
methods of dealing with things.

00:36:17.035 --> 00:36:24.661
This is, I would say, is a curse because that kind of a curse when it works out, then you cannot improve

00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:29.994
as you have nothing else to
see and relate and to advance.

00:36:42.529 --> 00:36:50.897
Because the ego when it is worked with the left problems, you can be very queer, strange and weird.

00:36:57.993 --> 00:37:03.239
I could see that the
first day I came to Paris,

00:37:07.563 --> 00:37:12.953
and they told Me very clearly
that, “Mother, don’t smile at all,

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:23.159
and You have to keep very serious.”

00:37:24.611 --> 00:37:29.728
And I cannot be serious for more than
two minutes, I think, two minutes.

00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:38.367
So, I said, “But why?”

00:37:38.384 --> 00:37:42.200
The reason, they said was that, “They
will think that You are an ignoramus,

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.050
You don’t know what’s
happening in this world:

00:37:44.078 --> 00:37:47.820
serious things are happening
and You are laughing.

00:37:54.866 --> 00:37:58.111
So, they will think that
You are not at all matured.”

00:38:03.491 --> 00:38:10.254
But as soon as I started My lecture, I
looked at those people who were so serious

00:38:18.965 --> 00:38:22.493
and I couldn’t control My laughter!

00:38:30.718 --> 00:38:33.218
I hope it is changing.

00:38:37.235 --> 00:38:40.405
And then I said,

00:38:40.414 --> 00:38:45.985
“Sorry, I’m addressing all the les
Misérables which I have heard about."

00:38:54.199 --> 00:39:00.597
I am so happy to see today, that
veil of gloom, has passed over.

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:15.959
As if lot of dirty mud
had gathered over here

00:39:15.944 --> 00:39:19.814
and the lotuses were
about to bloom out,

00:39:29.989 --> 00:39:33.260
whatever may be the atmosphere,
whatever may be the history,

00:39:33.276 --> 00:39:38.195
whatever may be that has been
created by human beings,

00:39:38.184 --> 00:39:47.549
inside resides beautiful lotus
petals, everything intact.

00:40:00.279 --> 00:40:04.834
With a little push they are
all out now in the atmosphere

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:10.484
spreading their fragrance in this
dirty pool what we call as France.

00:40:25.774 --> 00:40:34.724
And they’re such strong people, very strong Sahaja Yogis in France which really makes Me very happy and proud.

00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:50.369
In the beginning I used to come
every third week to Paris

00:40:50.375 --> 00:40:56.269
and have a meeting and when they asked,
“Mother, why are You so much visiting Paris?”

00:40:56.288 --> 00:40:58.788
I said, “That is the gate of the hell.”

00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:14.819
You must have heard the story I’ve told
you about the advertising department.

00:41:21.063 --> 00:41:24.833
Ok I had better tell them.

00:41:24.827 --> 00:41:30.217
You see, two men who had done lot
of good as Sahaja Yogis maybe,

00:41:30.197 --> 00:41:34.047
when they died, they were
asked to go to Heaven.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:45.509
So they went to Heaven and there they
found everybody was meditating,

00:41:45.509 --> 00:41:50.528
so they said, “What is new about this,
we were meditating in the world?”

00:41:58.056 --> 00:42:03.776
So they said, “Why not we..."
They asked the permission of God,

00:42:03.776 --> 00:42:06.668
that, "Can we see also
Hell, if we have a chance?

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:09.337
Because we... then we
can decide you see,

00:42:09.348 --> 00:42:12.215
whether we want to be here or there."

00:42:22.085 --> 00:42:24.585
You see that is what the ego
is, you must have choice.

00:42:30.554 --> 00:42:33.514
So they went to Hell,

00:42:36.027 --> 00:42:42.194
and when they entered the first big hall, they found all kind of music was going on,

00:42:42.234 --> 00:42:48.504
funny type of music and you know like Halloween you have all kinds of dirty things

00:42:48.534 --> 00:42:51.034
and women were dancing nude,

00:42:51.034 --> 00:42:52.724
and the men were singing nude

00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:56.114
and they were doing all funny, funny
things there, which we call funny.

00:43:16.354 --> 00:43:22.122
So, they said, “This seems to
be better place for a change,”

00:43:28.268 --> 00:43:32.108
because drinking was free,
everything was free there;

00:43:34.322 --> 00:43:36.822
drugs,

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.530
all nice, nice things there!

00:43:48.361 --> 00:43:51.511
So, they said, “It's
very nice place.”

00:43:51.535 --> 00:43:54.625
So, the people who were in charge
said, “What are you doing here?”

00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:06.619
So they said, “We’ve come to visit
the Hell, where is the Hell?”

00:44:13.898 --> 00:44:17.478
So, they said, “You can see from this
hole”, and they took them to a hole

00:44:17.499 --> 00:44:19.999
from where they could
see the picture of Hell.

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:29.566
And there they found people
hanging on top of fire,

00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:36.964
or they were put in the boiling oil
and they were put in the dirty mud;

00:44:36.966 --> 00:44:39.909
all kinds of things, you see,
and they were horrified.

00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:53.898
And some were whipped very
badly, and I don’t know,

00:44:53.898 --> 00:44:56.938
all kinds of punishments
that are possible.

00:45:00.206 --> 00:45:01.736
So, they got a fright and they said,

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:04.805
“Now if that is Hell, what
is this in this hall?”

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:14.328
They said, “This is the
Advertising Department of Hell.”

00:45:38.481 --> 00:45:43.365
And the ideas were coming from
French and English specialists,

00:45:43.383 --> 00:45:47.329
and other specialists from
other European countries also.

00:45:55.802 --> 00:45:58.659
And nowadays the Swiss must be
doing all the banking there.

00:46:07.133 --> 00:46:12.646
So that is the advertising
department about which,

00:46:12.646 --> 00:46:16.616
you see, one should be quite knowledgeable,

00:46:16.615 --> 00:46:19.616
to know what is the advertising
department of Hell is.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:32.950
So, the righteousness and the holiness

00:46:32.984 --> 00:46:41.274
can only be maintained if you are very
careful about this advertising departments,

00:46:41.273 --> 00:46:44.519
especially in France and other countries.

00:46:57.584 --> 00:47:04.481
The left side works in this way
that we want to destroy ourselves,

00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:13.711
because left side stands for
desire as well as for destruction.

00:47:17.353 --> 00:47:23.700
It can destroy all if there
is no desire of God anymore.

00:47:27.632 --> 00:47:34.362
So, when you start getting to
the other side of your desires,

00:47:34.346 --> 00:47:37.682
you have a desire to destroy yourself.

00:47:45.986 --> 00:47:58.829
Yesterday only I read in a newspaper
an English lady who left millions of pounds,
killed herself by malnutrition.

00:48:09.045 --> 00:48:17.312
So, this idea of destroying yourself is now justifying so many things that we do in this world,

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:19.949
which should not be done for our health,

00:48:19.951 --> 00:48:23.949
for our physical, mental and
emotional and spiritual health.

00:48:37.716 --> 00:48:44.192
And this tendency is to be seen by
Sahaja Yogis within themselves also.

00:48:50.697 --> 00:48:53.797
When the Sahaja Yogis start slipping out

00:48:53.807 --> 00:48:56.967
and you tell them, "You are slipping
out, now don't go that way."

00:48:56.984 --> 00:49:01.424
so they say, “No, leave me alone,
it’s all right, I can manage myself,”

00:49:01.434 --> 00:49:03.934
means, “I can destroy myself.”

00:49:16.775 --> 00:49:30.115
And this anti-life behaviour starts to such an extent, that they denied all that was spiritual, all that was healthy.

00:49:41.336 --> 00:49:46.036
Also on the left-hand side you had
some horrible writers and authors,

00:49:46.056 --> 00:49:47.516
who came on this earth

00:49:47.523 --> 00:49:52.137
to give you very, very,
very, very anti-life ideas;

00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:07.438
like a person like Sade, you see,
who started sadism and all that,

00:50:07.458 --> 00:50:09.968
this kind of people only
could prosper in France

00:50:09.998 --> 00:50:12.639
in India such a person
would have been thrown out.

00:50:18.738 --> 00:50:23.963
Some mad fellow might have written “Kama
Sutra” but I’ve never known that book,

00:50:23.964 --> 00:50:26.655
I’ve never read that book, I
don’t know anything about it

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.215
and I don’t know if you ask anyone they’ll
say, “What is that book? We don’t know.”

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:49.688
But if you say “Gita”, if you say “Ramayana”
you’ll find many or most of them.

00:50:56.515 --> 00:51:00.309
Even the Christians in India
won’t read such a book.

00:51:07.575 --> 00:51:11.829
Now, but these books were
very much appreciated.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:18.599
You find, it’s hard to find, anyone in Europe who’s educated and who has not read these books.

00:51:18.613 --> 00:51:21.113
It's like a Bible for them.

00:51:30.468 --> 00:51:36.114
I mean, all these things have made
them immune to sin, the filth of sin.

00:51:48.282 --> 00:51:50.992
To add to problems,
you had so many wars,

00:51:50.992 --> 00:51:55.222
but last war, France was occupied
by these horrible Germans.

00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:05.671
So, they were in complete fear,

00:52:09.915 --> 00:52:13.429
again another left-sided movement.

00:52:18.495 --> 00:52:25.633
All these things have added to the
perpetuation of left sided problems.

00:52:31.836 --> 00:52:35.483
Now how to get rid of them is our problem.

00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:46.293
When I came here, Patrick told Me how they found people possessed by all kinds of variety of bhoots,

00:52:59.461 --> 00:53:04.583
and I’m not surprised because I was
expecting it sometimes to happen.

00:53:09.707 --> 00:53:14.807
There are still many Sahaja Yogis,
especially Yoginis, who are possessed.

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:27.087
I know of one mad one who came to My
house, broke all the house and everything

00:53:27.106 --> 00:53:32.977
and did lot of things,
French, you know, a man.

00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:55.959
So, to get out of it, first of all
we must know the dangers of it.

00:53:58.778 --> 00:54:05.849
If the women go on like this, don’t obey
their leaders and go on with it, saying
that,  “This is my right”

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:11.454
Don’t meditate and do all kinds of
things, they’ll become schizophrenic.

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:35.948
The schizophrenia, according to
Me, according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:35.949 --> 00:54:43.989
is a disease in which you are permanently
possessed by many of these dead spirits,

00:54:56.394 --> 00:55:01.154
and in India they would be
sent to lunatic asylums.

00:55:04.662 --> 00:55:12.296
But I’m told that they have now cancelled
all lunatic asylums everywhere and the
lunatics are moving on the streets.

00:55:21.327 --> 00:55:23.827
It’s a very serious situation.

00:55:26.566 --> 00:55:30.961
The government doesn’t
realise what they’re doing.

00:55:37.596 --> 00:55:46.234
Once I travelled by bus in Paris and I saw one after another, people, one lady, then one gentleman

00:55:46.244 --> 00:55:51.836
then one other gentleman, they walked in, and they were talking to themselves loudly.

00:56:03.334 --> 00:56:07.165
They’re all possessed people
and they’ll possess you.

00:56:15.072 --> 00:56:20.518
They will possess you, they will possess your children, they can possess your pets, anyone.

00:56:25.907 --> 00:56:30.310
Such abnormal people should
be kept away from the public.

00:56:34.926 --> 00:56:41.376
But Marie told Me that, “You see, these French are very sympathetic towards them.”

00:56:46.805 --> 00:56:55.804
Their bhoots are also, I must tell you, the left sided people, they try to do things to incur your sympathies.

00:57:05.696 --> 00:57:12.191
In the right-sided people, as they are
aggressive to attract your attention,

00:57:12.205 --> 00:57:17.821
the left-sided people are aggressive to
themselves to attract your attention.

00:57:33.223 --> 00:57:43.213
So those people who think, “We can wear some scanty clothes in winter time, or we can torture our lives, stand on our heads,”

00:57:43.182 --> 00:57:52.269
all such people are  absolutely now passing
the limits of advertising department.

00:58:04.189 --> 00:58:11.647
So, the first things Sahaja Yogis have to remember that you have come on this earth to enjoy.

00:58:22.247 --> 00:58:22.767
Enjoy.

00:58:22.777 --> 00:58:23.607
In French!

00:58:23.607 --> 00:58:24.967
No, no French!

00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:29.504
Difficult Shri Mataji.

00:58:43.842 --> 00:58:50.972
Imagine, they said there is no word in French for enjoyment as I heard today, but for fun.

00:58:50.992 --> 00:58:51.952
Fun!

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.000
Fun, they've found one, Shri Mataji.

00:58:54.015 --> 00:58:56.970
Found, Thank God!

00:58:56.985 --> 00:59:02.119
So, this is fun, you have
to enjoy the fun of life,

00:59:06.803 --> 00:59:11.029
and you are not here
to suffer any more.

00:59:11.039 --> 00:59:13.329
you’re not to suffer anymore.

00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.089
And to be serious – for what?

00:59:28.819 --> 00:59:37.607
And to be tense is out of, out of absolutely we can say, is out of subject, is useless to be tense.

00:59:37.616 --> 00:59:42.097
How can you be tense in the
atmosphere which is so relaxed?

00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:55.611
If these things are expressing themselves, then you should know you haven’t come to your proper point in Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:02.412 --> 01:00:08.752
If you still worry and go on worrying, you’ll go to the left and you’ll get out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:08.752 --> 01:00:11.252
This is the second serious point.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:28.077
So, the first point is that you’ll
become schizophrenic, mad, lunatics.

01:00:31.467 --> 01:00:32.505
That’s the first thing,

01:00:32.505 --> 01:00:35.005
I’m not a businessman so I’m
telling you the worst first.

01:00:52.555 --> 01:00:58.938
The second thing as just now I’ve told you will be that you’ll go out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:11.328 --> 01:01:17.432
As a result of that, you might
get any disease like cancer

01:01:22.044 --> 01:01:27.904
or any disease that comes from
the left side, there are so many.

01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:40.282
So, this is very important to see that you
try to keep to the central path of ascent,

01:01:49.025 --> 01:01:58.495
through curative methods, through meditative methods, through vibratory methods you must try to keep in the centre and don’t go to the right.

01:02:09.137 --> 01:02:12.447
Because with this destructive power,

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:16.067
with this destructive power,
if you go to the right side,

01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:17.847
you will become extremely inauspicious

01:02:17.857 --> 01:02:20.357
and you’ll start destroying people,

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:31.729
especially for the wives of leaders, I would like to tell them that they must become very humble,

01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:37.759
otherwise they will have this thing, a power by which they’ll destroy themselves and others.

01:02:48.726 --> 01:02:52.204
This is like this the power,
say, which is of a fire

01:02:52.181 --> 01:02:57.334
or of the light, if it is not
used for which it is made,

01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:03.783
supposing you put your hand
in the fire, it will burn,

01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:22.747
So, we must understand the power of
women is compassion, is nourishment,

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:35.172
and they should not try to become like men, because then they’ll burn off people and burn off themselves.

01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:54.949
So, as I’ve told you before that it’s the women who can be very, very helpful in improving the left side.

01:04:01.113 --> 01:04:07.527
By dominating men, you make them left-sided which is not their style. They should not be left sided.

01:04:19.907 --> 01:04:24.756
But if they are truly men, they
will walk in the central path;

01:04:31.461 --> 01:04:36.461
and if women are truly women,
they’ll walk in the central path.

01:04:39.621 --> 01:04:42.221
So to walk in the central path

01:04:42.221 --> 01:04:44.721
one has to get rid of all these
things, of this type are within us.

01:04:58.497 --> 01:05:02.527
The third thing that really,
I would say, warn you people,

01:05:02.507 --> 01:05:06.057
that you get attached to your things

01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:09.893
to your possessions,

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:20.273
to your children,

01:05:21.638 --> 01:05:24.858
to your surroundings:

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:31.028
like many French would say, “Oh,
I hate to go out of France.”

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:39.790
When they go to some other
country they always criticise.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.900
I don’t know who are the best critics,
but all of them criticise each other;

01:05:51.366 --> 01:05:55.410
they never try to see the good points of others;

01:05:57.601 --> 01:06:03.254
and in doing so, what you do is to
perpetuate a kind of an inferiority on others

01:06:03.248 --> 01:06:10.718
using your powers of left side by
which you make others look small.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.260
Like pitying someone for nothing at all;

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.750
like if supposing you start
pitying Me, what will it look like?

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:28.270
It’s absurd as that!

01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.790
Yes Shri Mataji. I don’t even
know how to translate that.

01:06:30.808 --> 01:06:33.308
I know, but that’s what it is.

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:01.166
So there should be no pity,
there should be compassion,

01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:09.364
and that will take you out of this
nonsensical idea of pitying yourself,

01:07:09.364 --> 01:07:15.124
pitying others and feeling all
the time sorry for nothing at all;

01:07:20.082 --> 01:07:24.892
because if you ask for such
pity then you’ll be pitied too.

01:07:24.905 --> 01:07:27.405
I mean, you’ll be in a
pitiable condition yourself.

01:07:37.497 --> 01:07:42.206
But if you have compassion, then
you don’t put down that person,

01:07:42.206 --> 01:07:45.736
you don’t sort of make him feel inferior

01:07:45.766 --> 01:07:49.506
but you encourage him
and he feels powerful.

01:07:57.147 --> 01:07:58.917
Like a finger is hurt within you,

01:07:58.917 --> 01:08:03.567
you just try to soothe it and
be compassionate towards it.

01:08:03.559 --> 01:08:06.139
You don’t try to put him
down that “You’re no good,

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.640
because he's part and
parcel of your being.

01:08:23.713 --> 01:08:28.160
So, the compassion stands in
between condemnation and pity.

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:41.068
In compassion you have to
condemn whatever is wrong.

01:08:45.678 --> 01:08:50.290
You have to condemn the bhoots. You
have to condemn that’s ugliness’s.

01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:54.708
You have to condemn
all that is wrong.

01:08:57.191 --> 01:09:01.711
So, by that, you see,
you make that person see

01:09:01.701 --> 01:09:04.961
that you do not have appreciation

01:09:04.969 --> 01:09:10.504
of what he is at all and it is just
compassion and no pity about it;

01:09:21.639 --> 01:09:27.126
because the left-sided people want to be pitied and if you pity them, they get even worse.

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:46.784
So, to say, “Poor person, poor man”, or
a “Poor old lady - something” is wrong.

01:09:55.107 --> 01:10:01.717
So when the people who are possessed
they start condemning their bhoots,

01:10:01.717 --> 01:10:03.672
they come up.

01:10:14.202 --> 01:10:19.661
When they hate their bhoots, they
can get rid of them in no time.

01:10:31.787 --> 01:10:36.314
But sometimes going worse than
that, they get identified.

01:10:42.788 --> 01:10:45.748
Of course to judge it, best
is to see through vibrations

01:10:45.738 --> 01:10:48.738
but you can also see it logically,

01:10:48.738 --> 01:10:54.128
how we behave towards our
possessions, towards others.

01:11:04.392 --> 01:11:08.652
Lot of work has been done in India
on a very subtle level, I would say,

01:11:08.672 --> 01:11:11.532
how to get out of the left side.

01:11:16.674 --> 01:11:21.204
I would say Mahavira was the one
who really has worked very hard

01:11:21.204 --> 01:11:27.544
to give the whole idea of the hell up
to heaven, what the left side is.

01:11:29.939 --> 01:11:33.729
Another, I would say, his own
incarnation, was William Blake,

01:11:33.729 --> 01:11:36.229
who has also given full idea about it.

01:11:39.074 --> 01:11:41.574
I would say Dante did the same.

01:11:44.349 --> 01:11:47.023
So, this is what they have shown you,

01:11:47.023 --> 01:11:50.563
how the hell is and
how the heavens are.

01:11:54.388 --> 01:11:58.989
Now for Sahaja Yogis, it is important
to see their left-sided problems

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.481
if they are lingering in them.

01:12:05.061 --> 01:12:08.439
Possession means you’re
possessed by something,

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:14.039
some ideas which are not
rational, which are illogical.

01:12:19.742 --> 01:12:24.070
And in the modern times, I’ve seen how
they avoid the topic if you ask them,

01:12:24.082 --> 01:12:26.880
they say, “I don’t know.”

01:12:32.608 --> 01:12:35.108
“I don’t know why I feel like
that,” then give up that feeling,

01:12:35.108 --> 01:12:37.608
it’s wrong; if you don’t
know, it’s no good.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:48.110
In the beginning you asked French, any French, “How are you?” they would say, like this.

01:12:48.123 --> 01:12:53.130
And I would look at their
hands, what does that mean?

01:13:01.963 --> 01:13:04.463
No, like this.

01:13:06.684 --> 01:13:11.172
So, I used to wonder, what’s
wrong with the hand!

01:13:22.195 --> 01:13:26.756
And they were very boastful about
it that’s the best part of it;

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.705
because to say something as certain, cocksure,

01:13:29.713 --> 01:13:32.065
was regarded as ego for them perhaps,

01:13:32.061 --> 01:13:35.702
but Sahaja Yogis have to be cocksure.

01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.963
Now, English, if I ask them, “How are
you?” they would say, “Confused.”

01:13:54.609 --> 01:13:59.329
So, I mean, I didn’t know why,
and boastingly, “I’m confused,”

01:13:59.329 --> 01:14:01.829
as something great, you
know that “I’m confused.”

01:14:06.236 --> 01:14:10.967
So, the explanation was given, was
that, that we are aware of our state,

01:14:10.982 --> 01:14:14.027
we are not saying something
with a cocksure way.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.023
A Sahaja Yogi, if he is confused,
he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:39.027
At this stage you have to be
absolutely sure of yourself,

01:14:42.324 --> 01:14:49.007
sure about Me, sure about Sahaja Yoga and sure about all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

01:14:53.869 --> 01:14:56.369
Otherwise you’re not Sahaja Yogis.

01:14:59.817 --> 01:15:10.730
That means your connection with God
is like a loose plug, like that.

01:15:18.564 --> 01:15:23.494
So, we have to understand that
in the centre when we are,

01:15:23.473 --> 01:15:27.764
we are sure of what we
are, absolutely sure.

01:15:31.932 --> 01:15:34.432
We raise our heads
in pride and glory.

01:15:40.113 --> 01:15:44.253
We don’t have the vanity of the
right and the pity of the left.

01:15:49.579 --> 01:15:54.842
That’s what is we are going
to achieve in France now.

01:15:58.696 --> 01:16:02.822
No more going to the sub-conscious
or to the collective sub-conscious.

01:16:06.868 --> 01:16:09.646
Now don’t think of your
forefathers what they did,

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:16.252
nor think of the future, what
your progeny’s going to do.

01:16:21.345 --> 01:16:24.887
Think for yourself what you’re
going to do for both of them.

01:16:29.158 --> 01:16:36.064
Many cursed families can be completely
redeemed by one good Sahaja Yogi;

01:16:43.552 --> 01:16:48.920
and thousands of years of progeny
can be blessed by one Sahaja Yogi.

01:17:01.113 --> 01:17:05.738
That’s a fact, you can
feel the vibrations now.

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:10.799
So, one should have that personality

01:17:10.799 --> 01:17:16.169
of a very tranquil, peaceful, understanding,

01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:28.892
but this understanding should not be
mental but a sap on your central path,

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:42.972
the vital energy that nourishes all the
chakras, your being and the atmosphere.

01:17:48.586 --> 01:17:52.426
I’m sure all the French
Sahaja Yogis now

01:17:52.426 --> 01:17:56.196
will take to the new ways
of the central path.

01:18:05.395 --> 01:18:10.069
They should wear
dresses which are fresh,

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:18.143
have fresh looks on their faces, should
create a fresh atmosphere around.

01:18:23.377 --> 01:18:27.314
Give up all worn-out things that,
they’re very fond of worn-out things,

01:18:27.314 --> 01:18:31.454
and also worn-out houses they
like, they say it is antique.

01:18:35.486 --> 01:18:39.133
Worn out clothes
and worn out houses!

01:18:50.486 --> 01:18:55.616
No, no give up that idea of antiques also

01:18:55.598 --> 01:18:59.156
because, you see antiques
are not all right

01:18:59.139 --> 01:19:01.639
as long as they are
preserved properly,

01:19:01.639 --> 01:19:07.974
but if you make them look like antiques,
you see, it's no respect given to them.

01:19:22.276 --> 01:19:27.886
I went to Poland and I was surprised
that all their old monuments

01:19:27.886 --> 01:19:30.386
were resurrected after the war

01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:35.281
and everything is painted and
brought back to absolute fresh look.

01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:48.489
They haven’t kept anything broken
or muddy or in any way worn-out.

01:20:03.171 --> 01:20:07.295
So, the idea of this antiques to
be preserved as they are

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.321
is also, I think, very bhootish and left-sided.

01:20:18.722 --> 01:20:22.692
So, your antiques whatever you may
possess also must be cleaned out

01:20:22.679 --> 01:20:24.382
and properly done up

01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:27.835
and should be brought to a fresh look.

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:46.676
Now this necklace I’m wearing
is very antique, very old,

01:20:46.674 --> 01:20:49.174
but doesn’t look old, does it?

01:20:54.582 --> 01:20:58.013
Because it is looked after and it would look funny

01:20:58.013 --> 01:21:05.344
to wear, for a Goddess, to wear a
antique thing which looks so worn out.

01:21:21.946 --> 01:21:28.265
So, one criteria could be that whatever
we wear or do, will Mother like it?

01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:37.806
This is the one question you can ask

01:21:37.809 --> 01:21:43.909
if you don’t want to ask the vibrations,
“Will She like it? We have to please Her.”

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:51.960
And I tell you: very small,
small things please Me.

01:21:55.066 --> 01:22:00.509
You don’t have to do too many things,
just a few things which pleases Me,

01:22:00.509 --> 01:22:03.009
which are very simple and easy and innate

01:22:12.554 --> 01:22:15.054
Like you have to be innocent.

01:22:16.245 --> 01:22:20.189
It’s very easy if you are a child-like person,

01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:23.329
you just don’t allow any
cunning to come into your head,

01:22:23.314 --> 01:22:26.426
any absurd ideas, just be innocent;

01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:30.000
you don’t have to do
anything to be innocent.

01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:39.603
You have to do something
to be non-innocent.

01:22:44.725 --> 01:22:46.955
So, this is what one has to understand

01:22:46.975 --> 01:22:51.515
that the basis of our
left side is innocence.

01:22:56.484 --> 01:22:58.984
So, anything that is not
innocent, we should not do.

01:23:03.113 --> 01:23:05.211
It's so simple.

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:10.770
should be all right with all of us

01:23:10.770 --> 01:23:17.870
if we just believe that we have this quality
of innocence within us absolutely intact,

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:29.041
and you have to just awaken
it and enjoy it, that's all.

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:37.541
So may God bless you all,

01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:41.481
may God give you
strength to be innocent.

01:23:49.821 --> 01:23:53.766
You must pray that
you should be innocent

01:24:00.055 --> 01:24:03.645
and the innocence will
suck in all your problems,

01:24:03.645 --> 01:24:06.145
suck in your the problems of the left side,

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:18.028
and the symbol of innocence is Shri Ganesh,
who just knows His Mother, nobody else

01:24:25.532 --> 01:24:29.106
and His innocence is the
source of all the wisdom.

01:24:31.719 --> 01:24:37.672
So, you have to pray for becoming
absolutely innocent people.

01:24:40.807 --> 01:24:43.307
May God bless you.
