00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.950
If they take to modern writers,  

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.170
then they are really horrible and they just 
very vulgar, extremely vulgar, very superficial.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.600
Sadly they are doing Shakespeare 
like this, [inaudible] be successful.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.520
And you see how he has avoided all the 
pomp and show of the courts and all that,  

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:32.881
just focusing on them, with the light 
and Rembrandt style, too much of…

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.063
Yogi: Mother, how did You cause the miracle?

00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:41.282
Would one of them be a realized soul or what?

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:45.172
Shri Mataji: He was, he was 
getting realized you see,  

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:45.738
evolving.

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:50.982
But miracle is caused because 
it’s a Shiva’s Island, you see.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:52.262
He resides there.

00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:56.962
But the English never realize, that’s the 
point is, I don’t know when will they realize.

00:00:56.962 --> 00:01:05.202
They’re very arrogant, extremely 
arrogant and think no end of themselves.

00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.482
I don’t know how they do it like that.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:12.047
The more they are helped the worse they become.

00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:17.717
Now of course, once Europe becomes 
one, they’ll know what they are.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:24.515
They don’t have any talents, as the 
other people have, none of the talents.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:30.645
Just in their pride and arrogance, they 
remained in some sort of a fools’ paradise.

00:01:31.845 --> 00:01:35.266
Time has come for them to realize where are they.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:38.466
That’s why they are afraid 
to join European community.

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:45.036
In no way(-) They are all mediocres in everything.

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:48.236
Everything they do is mediocre.

00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:54.783
Yogi: Today the Australian Prime Minister said we 
should become a republic in front of the Queen.

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:56.556
The Queen was sitting there,  

00:01:56.556 --> 00:02:00.396
and the Prime Minister said, in front of 
the Queen, we should become a republic.

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:04.716
And in all the English newspapers they’re saying 
that the Prime Minister insulted the Queen.

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:07.255
Shri Mataji: Yes, what did they(-)?

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:12.876
Yogi: Newspapers in England, they are saying 
that the Australian prime minister insulted  

00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:18.445
the Queen because he said that we should 
become a republic in front of the Queen.

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.485
Shri Mataji: You see now everybody 
is now breaking out of Commonwealth.

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.885
India has also broken, there’s no harm.

00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:31.092
Also, the Commonwealth is not such 
a body that really looks after  

00:02:31.362 --> 00:02:34.402
the interests of all the 
countries in the same manner.

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:37.362
It is, you see, this apartheid and 
all that, these things are going on  

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:42.242
and, I don’t know, they are not so clear-cut.

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:49.327
Of course, they had an Indian, from, I 
think he was from East Africa who was the  

00:02:50.562 --> 00:03:01.564
President of that, but he’s now gone and that’s 
the reason they must be asking to be republics.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:04.784
So it’s no insult to her, I mean 
a declaration is not an insult.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:07.628
English are like that.

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:13.968
They can insult anyone, 
but nobody can insult them.

00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:20.058
Yogi: The Prime Minister’s wife didn’t bow to 
her, didn’t curtsey, and that’s a very big insult.

00:03:20.277 --> 00:03:23.768
Shri Mataji: I didn’t curtsey to her also.

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.608
I never did.

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:30.747
Actually she bent, thinking I was 
[INAUDIBLE], so I had to lift her up.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.810
All too much of it, see now, they have these  

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.970
parties, this tea parties, 
means tea party, horrible thing.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.071
Then you are supposed to wear 
those dresses from that Moss Bros.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.991
and tight, sometime loose, they 
all look like Charlie Chaplins.

00:03:56.225 --> 00:04:01.115
And see, then you have to walk in that wet lawn,  

00:04:01.105 --> 00:04:04.625
and some ladies with the heels, 
they just get pressed into it.

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:09.955
It’s a mess of a thing, but you have to be there.

00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:13.465
If you are not there they notice you and 
they’ll tell you: ‘Why didn’t you come?’

00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.038
But there’s certain qualities in 
English which are to be imbibed.

00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:21.381
Is one of them, they always 
respect work and merit.

00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:26.801
Like they have respected My husband, it’s 
very remarkable I mean, that’s what they do.

00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:30.709
And secondly, they have very good justice.

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:34.109
[Their] justice system is 
the best in the whole world.

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.929
They cannot be corrupted.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.439
And thirdly, I would say, as far as the 
Parliament is concerned, and the politicians are  

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.199
concerned, they are very honest, 
[there is] very little of bribery.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.279
So all this things are there, no doubt.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.959
But with this austerity of temperament, 
you see, you also develop that kind of a  

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:55.199
dry nature, arrogance and domination and all that.

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.319
So they are fully on the right 
side, while they should be  

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.940
on the left because they are Shiva’s disciples.

00:05:08.944 --> 00:05:17.184
Their sense of humor, their scholarship, 
everything is fine but the arrogance  

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:21.224
and living in fools’ paradise is too much.

00:05:23.784 --> 00:05:28.344
I mean, as far as Shakespeare is concerned, 
He was a realized soul of a very high order  

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:32.404
so He tried to show the futility 
of human endeavor all the time,  

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:35.674
and also the miracles of God, as in this one.

00:05:36.144 --> 00:05:39.444
But I don’t know if they have understood Him.

00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:43.574
And nowadays there’s not even one play 
running in England, [in] London itself.

00:05:43.574 --> 00:05:47.734
You have to go all the way to 
Stratford-on-Avon to see His plays.

00:05:48.534 --> 00:05:50.435
We saw two of them there.

00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:56.054
And now the plays they are having, it’s so 
horrible, that you can’t see with your children,  

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:59.494
you can’t see with anyone, it’s (-) 
I mean you don’t want see it also.

00:05:59.494 --> 00:06:01.174
It’s very cheapish style.

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:07.698
So they should go back to their own past 
and get out something nice from that.

00:06:07.814 --> 00:06:10.298
That’s why it has come out where.

00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:12.738
They must have learnt a lesson.

00:06:12.828 --> 00:06:18.828
In last year, no, last before that, 
they got [INAUDIBLE] that time.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.468
They [SOUNDS LIKE: booked?]  

00:06:21.468 --> 00:06:26.348
all the films and condemned that as 
the worst, they wouldn’t show it.

00:06:26.348 --> 00:06:33.412
Very very arrogant and insulting, 
very arrogant and insulting people.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:37.422
That’s a sin, to insult another human being.

00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:40.348
Racist.

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:45.551
I think Australia also has this racialism in them.

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:54.348
It’s not so much now in England as (-) Some of 
the families in Australia very racist still.

00:06:55.298 --> 00:06:59.879
The way they troubled this Sandra.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:12.509
I mean in England nobody 
would do that kind of a thing.

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:15.856
But he was a good king, that’s 
why he was helped by God.

00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:17.756
That they don’t understand.

00:07:17.776 --> 00:07:22.976
This queen is a nice lady, very nice, very 
decent person, but she also can’t get out of it,  

00:07:22.976 --> 00:07:28.172
it’s something that is, even her 
dress is decided by the Parliament.

00:07:33.696 --> 00:07:38.416
It’s all right now, I mean, 
I hope they learn a lesson.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:44.496
[ANSWER TO INAUDIBLE QUESTION]  

00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:48.972
The British were very nasty to us, very nasty,  

00:07:49.312 --> 00:07:55.963
and actually, they put Me on ice, they gave 
Me electric shocks, they did everything to Me.

00:07:56.023 --> 00:08:01.703
But still I know that English (-) if it 
goes to the English mind it will circulate.

00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:06.263
The media in English, this Murdoch 
from here has gone, horrible fellow.

00:08:06.983 --> 00:08:15.047
No hope for England, cannot 
see sense at all, on the whole.

00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:22.663
But they take to French 
style sometimes, sometimes to  

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:27.257
Americans, they don’t have their self-confidence.

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:31.010
If they develop their self-confidence, 
they’ll see the sense of Sahaja Yoga also.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:37.277
Brian Bell: Shri Mother, may 
we say Your Three Mantras?

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:38.584
To say good night/

00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:40.574
Shri Mataji: Too many mantras already.

00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:41.864
Just see My Feet.

00:08:41.924 --> 00:08:46.324
Just see My Feet, how much swollen they 
are, it’s with the mantras and things.

00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:51.604
So it’s better that, this puja business 
is too much, you see, continuously,  

00:08:51.604 --> 00:08:57.266
I’m having, I had how many pujas 
you know, this short time five.

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:04.084
Tomorrow we can say that, while 
before the program these boys can say,  

00:09:04.084 --> 00:09:07.032
when there are too many people.

00:09:07.132 --> 00:09:09.812
But with few people they don’t absorb.

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.996
But it’s nice that there was puja so 
everybody could travel, come down, and,  

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:28.716
I agreed to it but you know only fifteen days 
[HINDI], in twenty days [HINDI] less than that.

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:35.002
Twenty days these and then We are going there,  

00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:41.146
five days… Twenty-five days 
really we had five pujas.

00:09:41.256 --> 00:09:44.616
So five days a puja is too much for Me.

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:47.706
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:50.832
So we’ll do it tomorrow before the program.
