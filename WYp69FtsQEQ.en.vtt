00:00.023 --> 00:02.629
They were sitting, had come to attend the programme.

00:02.729 --> 00:05.337
Even then were thinking about some of their problems.

00:05.362 --> 00:09.493
This happened with me, that happened, it happened like this, like that.

00:09.518 --> 00:14.787
And when shall i tell about my problem to Mataji?

00:14.812 --> 00:17.382
Mataji you are also not here. I am in such a problem.

00:17.407 --> 00:20.858
Instead of understanding what is being said

00:20.883 --> 00:27.664
In your thoughts of your inner being, you left in that provocation.

00:27.689 --> 00:30.758
And in that illusion, you got cancer.

00:30.783 --> 00:38.693
You got this disease, you got that disease.

00:38.718 --> 00:43.310
Just mental projection, what are we thinking mentally?

00:43.398 --> 00:46.000
What type of thoughts do we get?

00:46.025 --> 00:49.300
Thoughts such as, we have this grief, we have that grief

00:49.325 --> 00:53.204
this mammoth problem.

00:53.229 --> 00:57.410
Instead what shoild you think? “Count your blessings”.

00:57.435 --> 01:02.029
How many blessings of Mother do we have?

01:02.054 --> 01:05.389
Crores of people live in this city of Delhi.

01:05.414 --> 01:13.004
How many of them have got Sahajyoga?

01:13.029 --> 01:14.432
We are some special people

01:14.457 --> 01:18.113
not some frivolous people who should spoil their attention.

01:18.138 --> 01:19.905
We have got Sahajyoga.

01:19.930 --> 01:22.376
We should have a realization of this from within

01:22.401 --> 01:26.086
and should go deeper into that inner being.

01:26.111 --> 01:43.025
That is how you can get rid of these deceitful limitations.

01:43.050 --> 01:48.596
Whatever you think is your own

01:48.621 --> 01:50.519
If you will say we are from Delhi

01:50.544 --> 01:54.608
One day these people from Delhi will outcast you.

01:54.633 --> 01:56.529
If you will say we are from Noida

01:56.554 --> 02:00.989
one day, people from Noida will run after you with their guns.

02:01.014 --> 02:07.273
Then you will realize why did I say I am from Noida?

02:07.298 --> 02:09.827
Then, when you will run towards Delhi

02:09.852 --> 02:10.683
the people from Delhi will scorn you saying

02:10.708 --> 02:13.407
Saying you are from Noida. why did you come here?

02:13.432 --> 02:16.765
This way, you will belong nowhere and will have nowhere to call your own.

02:16.790 --> 02:19.084
The reason for this is that

02:19.109 --> 02:24.431
your attention also belongs nowhere, neither here, nor there.

02:24.456 --> 02:26.920
Unless you realize and go deeper into this

02:26.945 --> 02:29.863
you might call yourself a Sahaja Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi

02:29.887 --> 02:32.805
I don’t think you are one in the real sense.

02:32.830 --> 02:37.243
Because the first attribute of a Sahaja Yogi is that

02:37.268 --> 02:43.958
he has tranquil attention

02:43.983 --> 02:49.478
and is extremely powerful.

02:49.503 --> 02:54.609
Not scared of anyone, is strong.

02:54.634 --> 02:58.571
And his life is very pure

02:58.596 --> 03:03.478
his body is pure, his heart is pure

03:03.503 --> 03:10.049
and with the light of his Spirit, he spreads love in the whole world.

03:10.074 --> 03:17.505
I think somebody who cannot love, cannot be a Sahaja Yogi at all.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.737
He hasn’t climbed even the first step of the ladder.

03:20.817 --> 03:30.599
Like you see, so many kites flying in the sky

03:30.624 --> 03:34.931
but they are managed by somebody.

03:34.956 --> 03:38.754
If any of the kite’s string breaks, or if the grip is lost

03:38.779 --> 03:41.072
one can never know where the kite will fly off.

03:41.097 --> 03:44.481
The same is the case with Atma.

03:44.506 --> 03:48.699
So, keep your attention towards your Spirit

03:48.723 --> 03:53.913
and making yourself pure in this process is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

03:53.938 --> 03:59.061
For this, you did a hawan today, this is also a penance

03:59.086 --> 04:03.754
because fire engulfs and destroys all the things.

04:03.779 --> 04:12.508
Similarly, by your penance all your bad thoughts

04:12.533 --> 04:20.208
all your wrong limitations within, will be destroyed.

04:20.233 --> 04:26.007
Receiving this bliss is your right and you can achieve this joy

04:26.031 --> 04:28.512
and you have achieved it too.

04:28.537 --> 04:33.753
But, to spread this joy, you must have depth.

04:33.778 --> 04:38.725
If you go to Ganga Ji with a small bowl

04:38.750 --> 04:41.537
you can fill water in it and come back.

04:41.561 --> 04:46.193
But if you take a pitcher along, you can fill the pitcher and be back.

04:46.217 --> 04:50.627
However, if you can make such arrangements

04:50.652 --> 04:53.966
that the water from the Ganges can be redirected towards you

04:53.991 --> 04:58.253
you can have  water flowing from Ganges around you.

04:58.278 --> 05:01.186
So, in which state should should you watch yourself?.

05:01.211 --> 05:04.373
Are you taking water in a bowl from Sahaja Yoga?

05:04.398 --> 05:09.825
Are you limited to the joy of self? Or for everyone’s joy?

05:09.849 --> 05:15.450
Or, are you the source of this bliss?

05:15.475 --> 05:26.442
So, this Agnya Chakra is penance , this is a penance.

05:26.466 --> 05:32.765
To attain depth, it is important to have austerity.

05:32.790 --> 05:37.581
We spread far and wide. Sahaja Yoga spreads rapidly.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.186
You will see in the programmes.

05:39.211 --> 05:42.683
I wonder whether all people can be accommodated in the hall?

05:42.708 --> 05:43.877
How will it be managed?

05:43.901 --> 05:49.220
It will spread rapidly. But how many attain the depth?

05:49.245 --> 05:53.011
So, for attaining this depth, austerity is required.

05:53.036 --> 05:58.321
By penance, I don’t mean you should sit and fast. It is not required.

05:58.346 --> 06:03.845
But, if your attention is on food, then you must abstain from it.

06:03.870 --> 06:08.063
To watch your attention at all times, is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

06:08.088 --> 06:11.256
Because you spoil your agnya because of your attention.

06:11.281 --> 06:15.309
Where is my attention? What am I thinking?

06:15.334 --> 06:19.054
What am I doing at this moment? What am I thinking?

06:19.079 --> 06:26.183
If you watch your attention

06:26.208 --> 06:33.153
always watch your conscience

06:33.178 --> 06:42.718
then your attention will be illuminated in the Agnya.

06:42.743 --> 06:46.859
This is penance.

06:46.883 --> 06:50.753
To control your attention, observe and watch your attention and thoughts.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.760
Watch now, where is your attention?

06:53.943 --> 06:57.853
I am talking and where is your attention?

06:57.877 --> 07:06.710
The moment you start talking about attention, where did it go?

07:06.734 --> 07:14.649
The attention is so distracted. I am talking and where is your attention?

07:14.674 --> 07:17.934
So, you should watch your attention.

07:17.958 --> 07:21.192
Controlling attention doesn’t mean doing it forcefully.

07:21.216 --> 07:26.395
But when you watch your attention in the light of your Spirit

07:26.419 --> 07:33.585
then your attention becomes illuminated.

07:33.610 --> 07:38.572
You should be focused on watching your attention, when you see anything.

07:38.596 --> 07:46.298
For example, this pillar in front of me is adorned with beautiful flowers.

07:46.322 --> 07:49.512
Now in each vision you can observe something.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.768
I can remember everything.

07:51.793 --> 07:55.277
Where, which, wherever and how much is the difference?

07:55.302 --> 07:58.087
The whole image is formed.

07:58.111 --> 08:03.257
The attention’s concentration is what forms these images.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.434
That is what improves your memory.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.669
You can know everything in totality.

08:08.693 --> 08:11.616
You come to know everything through your attention.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.361
But, if your attention is distracted

08:13.386 --> 08:21.070
then you cannot grasp the depth or intensity of anything.

08:21.094 --> 08:22.671
If your attention is moving outside all the time

08:22.695 --> 08:23.482
you cannot remember anything.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.368
So, you see, I see this everywhere

08:25.392 --> 08:25.986
like at the airport

08:26.011 --> 08:28.219
talking to someone here but looking somewhere else.

08:28.243 --> 08:29.544
looking here, then looking there.

08:29.568 --> 08:34.677
But you won’t remember anything, who is it, what is it?

08:34.701 --> 08:38.245
So, pure attention is very focussed.

08:38.269 --> 08:42.139
And such attention will absorb only what is worthy of being absorbed.

08:42.164 --> 08:44.456
Something that isn’t worthy, pure attention will not absorb it.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.623
It won’t look towards such things.

08:46.647 --> 08:50.446
It will be averted from such things on its own.

08:50.652 --> 08:55.431
Because it is so pure, it can’t be corrupted by impure things.

08:55.455 --> 08:57.777
It cannot go there.

08:57.801 --> 09:03.916
Now this is up to you that you watch within and see

09:03.941 --> 09:06.229
'where is my attention going?'

09:06.253 --> 09:07.115
This is the penance.

09:07.185 --> 09:09.154
In Sahaja Yoga this is the only penance.

09:09.178 --> 09:12.313
Watch where my attention is going?

09:12.337 --> 09:18.038
Where am I going? Where is my heart going?

09:18.063 --> 09:22.521
If you can do this penance, you will cross  Agnya.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.792
And there are no doubts about Sahastrāra

09:24.817 --> 09:27.920
because I am already sitting there.
