00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:02.629
They were sitting, had come to attend the programme.

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:05.337
Even then were thinking about some of their problems.

00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:09.493
This happened with me, that happened, it happened like this, like that.

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:14.787
And when shall i tell about my problem to Mataji?

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.382
Mataji you are also not here. I am in such a problem.

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:20.858
Instead of understanding what is being said

00:00:20.883 --> 00:00:27.664
In your thoughts of your inner being, you left in that provocation.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.758
And in that illusion, you got cancer.

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:38.693
You got this disease, you got that disease.

00:00:38.718 --> 00:00:43.310
Just mental projection, what are we thinking mentally?

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:46.000
What type of thoughts do we get?

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.300
Thoughts such as, we have this grief, we have that grief

00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:53.204
this mammoth problem.

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.410
Instead what shoild you think? “Count your blessings”.

00:00:57.435 --> 00:01:02.029
How many blessings of Mother do we have?

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:05.389
Crores of people live in this city of Delhi.

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:13.004
How many of them have got Sahajyoga?

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:14.432
We are some special people

00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:18.113
not some frivolous people who should spoil their attention.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:19.905
We have got Sahajyoga.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.376
We should have a realization of this from within

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:26.086
and should go deeper into that inner being.

00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:43.025
That is how you can get rid of these deceitful limitations.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.596
Whatever you think is your own

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.519
If you will say we are from Delhi

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:54.608
One day these people from Delhi will outcast you.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.529
If you will say we are from Noida

00:01:56.554 --> 00:02:00.989
one day, people from Noida will run after you with their guns.

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:07.273
Then you will realize why did I say I am from Noida?

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.827
Then, when you will run towards Delhi

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:10.683
the people from Delhi will scorn you saying

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:13.407
Saying you are from Noida. why did you come here?

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:16.765
This way, you will belong nowhere and will have nowhere to call your own.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.084
The reason for this is that

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:24.431
your attention also belongs nowhere, neither here, nor there.

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:26.920
Unless you realize and go deeper into this

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:29.863
you might call yourself a Sahaja Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:32.805
I don’t think you are one in the real sense.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.243
Because the first attribute of a Sahaja Yogi is that

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:43.958
he has tranquil attention

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:49.478
and is extremely powerful.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:54.609
Not scared of anyone, is strong.

00:02:54.634 --> 00:02:58.571
And his life is very pure

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:03.478
his body is pure, his heart is pure

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:10.049
and with the light of his Spirit, he spreads love in the whole world.

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:17.505
I think somebody who cannot love, cannot be a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.737
He hasn’t climbed even the first step of the ladder.

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:30.599
Like you see, so many kites flying in the sky

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:34.931
but they are managed by somebody.

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.754
If any of the kite’s string breaks, or if the grip is lost

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.072
one can never know where the kite will fly off.

00:03:41.097 --> 00:03:44.481
The same is the case with Atma.

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:48.699
So, keep your attention towards your Spirit

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:53.913
and making yourself pure in this process is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:53.938 --> 00:03:59.061
For this, you did a hawan today, this is also a penance

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:03.754
because fire engulfs and destroys all the things.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:12.508
Similarly, by your penance all your bad thoughts

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:20.208
all your wrong limitations within, will be destroyed.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:26.007
Receiving this bliss is your right and you can achieve this joy

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:28.512
and you have achieved it too.

00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:33.753
But, to spread this joy, you must have depth.

00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:38.725
If you go to Ganga Ji with a small bowl

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.537
you can fill water in it and come back.

00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:46.193
But if you take a pitcher along, you can fill the pitcher and be back.

00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:50.627
However, if you can make such arrangements

00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:53.966
that the water from the Ganges can be redirected towards you

00:04:53.991 --> 00:04:58.253
you can have  water flowing from Ganges around you.

00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:01.186
So, in which state should should you watch yourself?.

00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.373
Are you taking water in a bowl from Sahaja Yoga?

00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:09.825
Are you limited to the joy of self? Or for everyone’s joy?

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.450
Or, are you the source of this bliss?

00:05:15.475 --> 00:05:26.442
So, this Agnya Chakra is penance , this is a penance.

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:32.765
To attain depth, it is important to have austerity.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.581
We spread far and wide. Sahaja Yoga spreads rapidly.

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:39.186
You will see in the programmes.

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:42.683
I wonder whether all people can be accommodated in the hall?

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:43.877
How will it be managed?

00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:49.220
It will spread rapidly. But how many attain the depth?

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:53.011
So, for attaining this depth, austerity is required.

00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:58.321
By penance, I don’t mean you should sit and fast. It is not required.

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:03.845
But, if your attention is on food, then you must abstain from it.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.063
To watch your attention at all times, is the penance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:08.088 --> 00:06:11.256
Because you spoil your agnya because of your attention.

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:15.309
Where is my attention? What am I thinking?

00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:19.054
What am I doing at this moment? What am I thinking?

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:26.183
If you watch your attention

00:06:26.208 --> 00:06:33.153
always watch your conscience

00:06:33.178 --> 00:06:42.718
then your attention will be illuminated in the Agnya.

00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:46.859
This is penance.

00:06:46.883 --> 00:06:50.753
To control your attention, observe and watch your attention and thoughts.

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:53.760
Watch now, where is your attention?

00:06:53.943 --> 00:06:57.853
I am talking and where is your attention?

00:06:57.877 --> 00:07:06.710
The moment you start talking about attention, where did it go?

00:07:06.734 --> 00:07:14.649
The attention is so distracted. I am talking and where is your attention?

00:07:14.674 --> 00:07:17.934
So, you should watch your attention.

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:21.192
Controlling attention doesn’t mean doing it forcefully.

00:07:21.216 --> 00:07:26.395
But when you watch your attention in the light of your Spirit

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:33.585
then your attention becomes illuminated.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:38.572
You should be focused on watching your attention, when you see anything.

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:46.298
For example, this pillar in front of me is adorned with beautiful flowers.

00:07:46.322 --> 00:07:49.512
Now in each vision you can observe something.

00:07:49.536 --> 00:07:51.768
I can remember everything.

00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:55.277
Where, which, wherever and how much is the difference?

00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:58.087
The whole image is formed.

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:03.257
The attention’s concentration is what forms these images.

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:05.434
That is what improves your memory.

00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:08.669
You can know everything in totality.

00:08:08.693 --> 00:08:11.616
You come to know everything through your attention.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.361
But, if your attention is distracted

00:08:13.386 --> 00:08:21.070
then you cannot grasp the depth or intensity of anything.

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:22.671
If your attention is moving outside all the time

00:08:22.695 --> 00:08:23.482
you cannot remember anything.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.368
So, you see, I see this everywhere

00:08:25.392 --> 00:08:25.986
like at the airport

00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:28.219
talking to someone here but looking somewhere else.

00:08:28.243 --> 00:08:29.544
looking here, then looking there.

00:08:29.568 --> 00:08:34.677
But you won’t remember anything, who is it, what is it?

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:38.245
So, pure attention is very focussed.

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:42.139
And such attention will absorb only what is worthy of being absorbed.

00:08:42.164 --> 00:08:44.456
Something that isn’t worthy, pure attention will not absorb it.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.623
It won’t look towards such things.

00:08:46.647 --> 00:08:50.446
It will be averted from such things on its own.

00:08:50.652 --> 00:08:55.431
Because it is so pure, it can’t be corrupted by impure things.

00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:57.777
It cannot go there.

00:08:57.801 --> 00:09:03.916
Now this is up to you that you watch within and see

00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:06.229
'where is my attention going?'

00:09:06.253 --> 00:09:07.115
This is the penance.

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:09.154
In Sahaja Yoga this is the only penance.

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.313
Watch where my attention is going?

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:18.038
Where am I going? Where is my heart going?

00:09:18.063 --> 00:09:22.521
If you can do this penance, you will cross  Agnya.

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:24.792
And there are no doubts about Sahastrāra

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.920
because I am already sitting there.
