00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:03,670
Welcome to a wonderful Spiritual journey

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,710
through Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:09,230
Today we are going to talk about the energy

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,106
that exists within all of us

5
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,430
and which is called as Kundalini.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,230
At the end of this program

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,675
we will have an opportunity to activate this energy

8
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:22,904
and feel this unique experience.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,150
Here is a beautiful story

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,630
coming from the depths of the ages.

11
00:00:27,754 --> 00:00:30,877
One day God asked the angels :

12
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,674
« Where should I hide the secret of life ? »

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:36,830
They said : « In the depths of the earth ? »

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,990
« No ! » He answered to them.

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,590
« This is the first place they would look. »

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,799
« Deep inside the ocean ? »

17
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,950
« It will take them a little more time,

18
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,976
but they will get there too. »

19
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,412
« At the top of the highest mountain ? »

20
00:00:50,532 --> 00:00:53,435
« They will always try to climb up there

21
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:56,484
and reach the top at the end »

22
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:58,310
« In the faraway stars ? »

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,630
« They will always long to reach the stars

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,630
and at the end they will reach there too. »

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,150
The angels became silent without knowing what to say.

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,561
« I know where.... » God said.

27
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,257
« I'll hide it somewhere that they will never think to search.

28
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:18,228
I will hide it inside them! »

29
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,545
And so it happened this way.

30
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:25,750
So far human beings have been seeking so hard

31
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,219
to know the secret of life in different ways,

32
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,359
but they never looked inside them.

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,779
Where is the secret of life hidden ?

34
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,710
Can it be hidden inside us ?

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,268
Above the coccyx at the base of the spine

36
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:44,830
there is a triangular bone which is called as 'Sacrum',

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,790
meaning sacred bone.

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,270
The five vertebrate that make up the Sacrum

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,430
are separate when we are born.

40
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,328
Gradually they unite and by the age of 20

41
00:01:56,448 --> 00:01:58,756
they become a compact bone.

42
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,556
Why is this part of the body called sacred ?

43
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:04,870
This has been a mystery for ages.

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,538
The ancient Greeks knew about it.

45
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:11,944
Around 440 BC there exists a written account

46
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:16,555
where Hippocrates refers to this bone as « iero ostoun »

47
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,842
or sacred bone.

48
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,731
In Egypt, the sacrum is dedicated to Osiris,

49
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:29,044
the God which grants eternal life and allows sprouting of vegetation.

50
00:02:29,164 --> 00:02:31,968
Later on, the Romans adopted this term

51
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,230
and called it as « Os Sacrum »

52
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,711
which is the medical term which is used even today.

53
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:41,656
In Hebrew it is called as « Halaya »

54
00:02:41,776 --> 00:02:45,229
which means the connecting link of the spinal cord.

55
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,787
It is derived from the word « Yehov » Which means God Yehova.

56
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,948
According to the Jewish tradition,

57
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:55,715
after death even though the rest of the body decomposes

58
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:58,228
this bone will remains intact

59
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:02,350
and will become the starting point for the revival.

60
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,879
 In the Bible this bone is mentioned as the last bone of the body

61
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:11,706
that decomposes, thus useful for the resurrection of Human beings.

62
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:15,016
We can find the following in the book of psalms :

63
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:20,060
« It watches all the bones, one of them will not break. »

64
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,308
The Arabs believed that this is the first bone

65
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:27,310
that is formed in the body and the last bone to be destroyed.

66
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,550
It is called as « El Ajb »

67
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,705
and is the seed from which the entire body can revive.

68
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,190
The Prophet says :

69
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,830
« Everything will be perished from this human body

70
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,270
except the coccyx

71
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,266
and from this bone Allah will recreate the body ! »

72
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:48,804
We see that the idea of resurrection exists in different traditions

73
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,463
and civilizations all over the world.

74
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,746
Now the time has come to solve this mystery.

75
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,548
What makes this part of the body sacred

76
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:01,399
it is the existance of this energy within it

77
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,306
which is called as Kundalini.

78
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,870
You can see the position of this Kundalini

79
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,424
in this chart of the subtle system.

80
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:13,030
The word Kundalini is named after its shape.

81
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,870
Kundal in Sanskrit means spiral.

82
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,777
Kundalini is coiled three and a half times in the sacrum bone.

83
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,762
This Kundalini can never be destroyed.

84
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:26,676
It resides within us patiently in a dormant state

85
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:29,477
until we reach a level of spiritual maturity

86
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:34,310
and deep longing which allows her to be awakened.

87
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,710
This Kundalini is the reflection of the primordial energy within us.

88
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,470
She is our spiritual Mother

89
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,810
and as a Mother she can never harm her children.

90
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,030
The Kundalini is the purest form of energy.

91
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,884
She resides in the triangular bone at the base of our spine.

92
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:54,190
Anything contrary to this fact is false.

93
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,572
Another mystery is the existence of the spiral

94
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,891
in different forms in the nature.

95
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,625
The spiral is quite common in nature

96
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,689
because the Kundalini is spiral in shape

97
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:09,500
and it is always identified with the process of evolution

98
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,070
wherever it takes place.

99
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,826
We can find single, double or multiple spirals

100
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,212
 in every dimension of the universe.

101
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:22,656
To name a few, the spiral shape can be found in the microcosm,

102
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:26,190
small nautilus, ammonities, and sea shells,

103
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,338
in the growth of the plants, in the shape of the flowers.

104
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:33,964
The proportions of the Human Body are structured on this base

105
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,452
and the double spirals of the DNA.

106
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:41,954
In a bigger scale we can find spiral formations in Cyclones

107
00:05:42,074 --> 00:05:45,279
and in huge Geological phenomena.

108
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,512
In the Macrocosm, we see the formation of the spiral galaxies

109
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:52,683
from billions of stars as we can see them

110
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:54,390
from modern telescopes.

111
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,986
The planets have a spiral orbit around their axis

112
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,457
and around the sun.

113
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,150
Jung says that the spiral images

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,839
are the archetypical structures of the universe

115
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:10,838
as they have been registered in the human collective unconscious.

116
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,669
The Kundalini energy, when awakened,

117
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,950
unites the matter with the spirit.

118
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,670
It is the flow of eternity in our perishable body.

119
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,910
It is the hope of renaissance and that is why

120
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,190
we find the spiral forms everywhere as they are her symbol.

121
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,480
The spiral motif is widespread in every corner of our planet

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,389
since the beginning of time.

123
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,349
We can also find the spiral motives in Africa,

124
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,664
China,

125
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,476
Japan

126
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,266
and Asia.

127
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,790
The spiral symbolizes the eternal cycle of life and death.

128
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,987
It extends at the infinite,

129
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:04,317
the infinite rebirth that can be conquered

130
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,287
only through the Mother.

131
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:08,030
Where Mother is worshipped

132
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,134
we always find a symbol of hope for an eternal life.

133
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:17,390
That is why they have carved this symbol on graves like this,

134
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,511
which we can see at Newgrange in Ireland.

135
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:25,350
In America, we can find spiral carvings on rocks,

136
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,710
in sacred and important places.

137
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,892
In Latin America and the Pre-Columbian Art,

138
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:36,307
we can find a lot of jewelry pieces with this motive.

139
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:40,734
In Greece the spiral motif   appears at Neolithic years.

140
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:45,070
The ceramic was from Dimini dates back to 5000 B.C.

141
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,764
It shows clearly the spiral placed in the center of a triangle

142
00:07:49,884 --> 00:07:52,735
like the Kundalini in the triangular bone.

143
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:55,950
One of the most famous and mysterious findings

144
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,030
is the disc of Phiastos around 1700 B.C.

145
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,855
that shows the spirals coiled three and a half times.

146
00:08:03,975 --> 00:08:06,802
The spiral form reaches its perfection

147
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:09,074
during the Greek classic Antiquity

148
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:12,327
with the elegant Ionic capital.

149
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:15,230
This unique energy that exists within us

150
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,276
is waiting for her awakening.

151
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:21,070
When she awakens,

152
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,870
she rises in the central channel of our subtle system.

153
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,790
Our subtle system has three channels

154
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,270
and seven energy centers, or chakras.

155
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,588
When the Kundalini gets awakened,

156
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,030
she rises through our central channel,

157
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,110
which runs along our spine,

158
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,839
and finds her way out from the top of the head.

159
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,333
When this happens, she gives us “Yoga”

160
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:52,030
which means union, the union of the man with the spirit,

161
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,697
the union of the matter with the spirit.

162
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,510
All the religious traditions

163
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,711
have mentioned about the union with the divine

164
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,467
through the awakening of this sacred energy.

165
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,510
Once we achieve this union with the divine,

166
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,988
it can be felt as a cool breeze on our palms,

167
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:13,614
which is also called as “vibrations”,

168
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:16,983
but nobody knew how to awaken this energy,

169
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,756
that is why this knowledge was kept secret

170
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,470
and was depicted in a symbolic way.

171
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,750
When the Kundalini is awakened,

172
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,697
we can feel a cool breeze on our hands

173
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,449
and on top of the head,

174
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,673
which is also called as “cool vibrations”.

175
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:37,418
This is the proof that the Kundalini has been awakened.

176
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:39,990
The myth of the birth of Goddess Athena

177
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,750
is a good example of a symbolic myth

178
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,938
that hides the truth of the Primordial energy.

179
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,110
According to Greek mythology,

180
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,121
Athena came out of from the head of her father,

181
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,980
fully armed and gifted with wisdom, innocence and justice.

182
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,950
She gives to people all the good qualities and virtues.

183
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,102
She guides and protects them.

184
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:05,670
She has all the attributes of the Kundalini

185
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,510
and she rises exactly in the same way

186
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,390
in the central channel of her Father Zeus

187
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,870
and pierces the top of his head with her spear.

188
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,319
The name “Athena” is derived from the Sanskrit word Atha,

189
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,431
which means Primordial.

190
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:25,522
She is known in India as “Adi Shakti”,

191
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:29,170
who is the source and the form of the primordial energy.

192
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,588
The Kundalini, which exists in every Human being,

193
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,390
is the reflection of this primordial energy within us.

194
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,340
On the helmet of Godess Athena, there are three horses

195
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,310
that symbolize the three energy channels of our subtle system

196
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,500
and on her chest there are snakes which symbolize Kundalini.

197
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,263
The rising of Kundalini has been a well-guarded secret.

198
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,659
Very few masters knew how to awaken her

199
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,630
and they would accept only a few disciples

200
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,497
who had to pass through very rigorous training.

201
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:06,910
In some cases this training would last life long

202
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,860
and they would still be unable to raise their Kundalini

203
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,270
during their life time.

204
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,154
But today, for the first time in the History of humanity,

205
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:20,947
the awakening of the Kundalini can be done en masse.

206
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:23,225
During the year of 1970,

207
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:27,073
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi who is the founder of Sahaja Yoga,

208
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,396
established this unique method

209
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,996
through which thousands of people have managed

210
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,710
to get the awakening of their Kundalini,

211
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,363
the precious gift of self-realization.

212
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:42,143
Shri Mataji travelled all around the world, tirelessly,

213
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:44,311
for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga

214
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:48,590
for the emancipation and the spiritual evolution of the humanity.

215
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,567
She never accepted any money for her work.

216
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:56,392
Shri Mataji says that spirituality cannot be sold or purchased.

217
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:58,710
It is the right of every human being

218
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,951
and one deserves to have it

219
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:05,346
and the time has arrived for all of us to accept it.

220
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:09,190
We will now do the exercise for the awakening of Kundalini.

221
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,656
The only thing that one should have

222
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:15,552
is the desire for spiritual evolution.
