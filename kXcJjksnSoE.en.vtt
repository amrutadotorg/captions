00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:00.689
AI GENERATED. Oh that's OK.

1
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:09.250
And

2
00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:11.680
All right.

3
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:19.870
Felicity,

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.909
you better sit on some chair.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.709
Be careful.

6
00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:23.639
Are you all right?

7
00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:24.079
Yes,

8
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.629
yes,

9
00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.680
yes,

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.930
right.

11
00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.680
Be careful.

12
00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.979
Expose

13
00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:46.430
All right,

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.189
so should we start now?

15
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.040
It's all right?

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.880
Are we focus this?

17
00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:54.270
Forgive me now and then I'll turn away and look at the time.

18
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.479
I'm,

19
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.540
I'll just be,

20
00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.590
I'm just,

21
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.680
I'll just be checking that.

22
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.770
It's where that's fine.

23
00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.169
Or an extension if you have an extension cord,

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.269
that would work too.

25
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.190
Do you want to just hold a watch?

26
00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:13.239
That'd be perfectly all right too if I could borrow a watch from somebody.

27
00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:20.370
And like it was nice.

28
00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:22.489
It's a digital one I'm afraid not.

29
00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:24.169
1014.

30
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:27.160
I'm not gonna be on camera so I can look at the watch and do all sorts of things.

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.349
You do what you like.

32
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.190
I think you're jingle it around.

33
00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:41.050
It ticks too loudly.

34
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.970
Not wrong yet.

35
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.760
Are you wrong?

36
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.069
Just.

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.259
I'm setting up

38
00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.050
Hm

39
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.270
just resetting.

40
00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.410
The telephone off the hook.

41
00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.860
Yes,

42
00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:29.529
it is.

43
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.529
The little 1 may

44
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.309
start crying.

45
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.309
That'd be nice.

46
00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:42.070
Neck,

47
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.110
you must look after the neck of the baby.

48
00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:45.910
That's the issue they are.

49
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.509
That's little motherhood.

50
00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.289
So about 50 minutes we'll we'll,

51
00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:19.880
uh,

52
00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.539
we'll make you about

53
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.320
50 minutes long.

54
00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.410
I will answer in short,

55
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.410
would be better.

56
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.860
Whatever you feel like.

57
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.850
Because how many questions you ask it depends on

58
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.649
depends on how long your answers are.

59
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.300
I can go on.

60
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.169
Uh,

61
00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:52.419
it's all spontaneous.

62
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.029
So 10:20,

63
00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.339
if we started at 10:20,

64
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.389
what time would be 50 minutes later.

65
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.990
11 100.

66
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.500
You better keep it facing for me.

67
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.889
11 so if we start at 10:20,

68
00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:08.330
then if we finish at 11:10,

69
00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:09.059
that's 50 minutes.

70
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.850
That's right,

71
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.770
50 minutes will do.

72
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:15.059
It's

73
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.660
it could be long then.

74
00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.429
OK,

75
00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.790
you,

76
00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:02.329
you can roll,

77
00:05:02.429 --> 00:05:03.309
you can start rolling it.

78
00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.269
May in order to understand.

79
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.190
The process of

80
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.190
realisation.

81
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.890
Which is

82
00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.369
Very complicated and

83
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.299
almost has a kind of scientific

84
00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:25.339
discipline to it.

85
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.600
But first,

86
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.459
maybe you could say a word about the goal.

87
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.320
In order to in order to anchor our discussion so.

88
00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.470
Uh,

89
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.619
could you say something about the highest realisation,

90
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.820
what,

91
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.799
what the goal of this entire process is?

92
00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:41.209
The goal

93
00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:43.209
of this process is

94
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.200
to begin with,

95
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.290
we should say,

96
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.149
is to become the spirit.

97
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.160
The spirit

98
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.619
is the reflection.

99
00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:53.570
Of our Creator,

100
00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:55.279
the God Almighty in our heart.

101
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.700
Which is the collective being within us.

102
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.500
Now of course this is all a theory for you,

103
00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.899
and you can take in a hypothesis,

104
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.059
but it's a fact

105
00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:06.619
and can be found out.

106
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.179
After you get your self realisation,

107
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.100
you

108
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.540
feel

109
00:06:12.109 --> 00:06:14.500
the manifestation of the spirit

110
00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:16.500
in your nervous system,

111
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.149
in your conscious mind.

112
00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:22.760
This is the goal to begin with.

113
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.709
If you talk of the very higher things,

114
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.149
it could be confusing.

115
00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:30.670
So the first is self-realization.

116
00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:31.899
That is the first goal.

117
00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.510
You said that the spirit,

118
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.100
you defined the spirit as the reflection of

119
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.660
God Almighty in the heart.

120
00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.989
Yes,

121
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:40.209
please.

122
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.230
What is,

123
00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:46.760
what do you mean by God Almighty?

124
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.920
God Almighty is.

125
00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:51.429
Uh,

126
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.070
the

127
00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:53.380
A

128
00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:54.980
who

129
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.730
Is everything.

130
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.079
He's the one who is the creator.

131
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.329
He is the one

132
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.750
who has desire to create.

133
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:05.690
The one

134
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.829
who is can destroy if he has no desires left

135
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.440
and he's the one who gives us sustainance,

136
00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.309
who gives us

137
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.660
this evolution by which we have become human beings.

138
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.839
He's the entire thing.

139
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.079
It is all his play.

140
00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:22.600
I was

141
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.959
under the impression that the Kundalini

142
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.329
was mother Kundalini and that and that.

143
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.500
Uh,

144
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.690
that,

145
00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:29.820
that this energy

146
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.290
uh was was feminine and now you you refer to

147
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.799
the divine as he.

148
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.859
Yes,

149
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.750
he is divine and she is also divine.

150
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.010
What could be divine,

151
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:41.500
but he is

152
00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:45.019
the one who is the witness of the play of his desire,

153
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.619
and his desire is the primordial kundalini is the primordial mother,

154
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:53.260
is the holy ghost as they call it,

155
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.540
and she's

156
00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:56.630
reflected within us as the kundalini.

157
00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:57.130
When

158
00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:58.829
this reflection,

159
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.320
that is the kundalini

160
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.899
meets the reflection that is

161
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.100
the spirit,

162
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.380
then the yoga takes place,

163
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:08.459
then the union takes place.

164
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.200
Uh,

165
00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:13.250
what was,

166
00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.119
what was the divine doing

167
00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:15.959
before it,

168
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.309
it,

169
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.450
it created anything is

170
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.049
is.

171
00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:19.640
It was sleeping.

172
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.690
It was complete silence and then it awoke when it is awakened,

173
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.279
the creation is created

174
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.959
out of his power,

175
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.679
but he is just the witness.

176
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:33.549
Is

177
00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:39.729
Is the goal to participate in the divine play or to return to the complete silence?

178
00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:40.908
Is first is.

179
00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:43.837
Get into that play

180
00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:45.869
to become one with the hole.

181
00:08:46.289 --> 00:08:47.278
That is the first goal,

182
00:08:47.289 --> 00:08:48.039
as I said.

183
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.570
And you,

184
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.239
you,

185
00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:54.130
you don't think it would be helpful to speak about anything beyond that.

186
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.479
Just now it can be dangerous,

187
00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:57.000
you see.

188
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.070
This is difficult for people

189
00:09:01.419 --> 00:09:02.859
in the west who don't understand.

190
00:09:03.659 --> 00:09:04.059
Uh,

191
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.210
the idea of,

192
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.979
of a secret teaching that unfolds as,

193
00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:08.039
as,

194
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.010
as a person develops,

195
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.250
they,

196
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:09.780
they

197
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.919
over here,

198
00:09:11.409 --> 00:09:12.890
we think that we can hear everything

199
00:09:13.179 --> 00:09:13.969
all at once.

200
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.219
You see,

201
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.340
it is a living process

202
00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:20.179
and in the West,

203
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.739
I don't know how many have studied living processes.

204
00:09:23.309 --> 00:09:25.539
Living process is never like that.

205
00:09:25.669 --> 00:09:25.859
First,

206
00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:26.510
the seed,

207
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.969
then the roots,

208
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.219
then the tree,

209
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:30.510
then the leaves,

210
00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:31.500
and then the

211
00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:32.419
flowers,

212
00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:33.320
and then the fruit.

213
00:09:33.869 --> 00:09:34.219
See,

214
00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:36.190
so it is a living process.

215
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.380
Now we are human beings at the stage when we are flowers.

216
00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:41.669
Now we have to become the fruits.

217
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.190
Then the fruit has to grow.

218
00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:48.309
But we understand living process,

219
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.830
we can understand why we have to first get self-realization.

220
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:53.700
That's why Buddha did not talk of God,

221
00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:54.950
because if you talk of God,

222
00:09:54.989 --> 00:09:56.219
it's too far-fetched.

223
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.229
So better to talk of self-realization first,

224
00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:58.859
he thought,

225
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.940
because if you talk of something abstract,

226
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.359
then people get fizzled out.

227
00:10:04.289 --> 00:10:04.719
So

228
00:10:04.849 --> 00:10:05.770
as a spiritual mother,

229
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.840
you,

230
00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:08.000
you teach your children

231
00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:11.489
and show them how to become one with the entire cosmic play.

232
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.690
Yes,

233
00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:12.400
first of all,

234
00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:13.200
to become

235
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.150
your microcosm should become one with a microcosm.

236
00:10:17.289 --> 00:10:18.400
first feel that

237
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.880
first understand that,

238
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.330
and then grow into it.

239
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:23.419
Now how do

240
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.690
your your disciples or your spiritual children

241
00:10:27.219 --> 00:10:27.580
do this?

242
00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:30.500
It's it's obviously not just a matter of philosophy about thinking about it.

243
00:10:30.539 --> 00:10:32.219
How do they proceed along the path?

244
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.599
As I said,

245
00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:34.869
it's a living process,

246
00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:38.059
and for living process you cannot do anything about it.

247
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.119
It's spontaneous,

248
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.380
but as in the living process you have seen

249
00:10:41.609 --> 00:10:42.840
that if you have to sprout a seed,

250
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.520
you have to put it to the mother earth,

251
00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:46.530
and the mother earth has the capacity to sprout.

252
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:47.250
It's spontaneous.

253
00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:50.989
You don't have to do anything about it in the same way if I am the mother earth.

254
00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:53.460
If you put your hands towards me,

255
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.780
you can get your realisation.

256
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.770
It's very simple,

257
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.669
but once you get realisation,

258
00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:00.700
you can also give realisation to others by raising their

259
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.849
kundalini because from your hand that divine power starts flowing.

260
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.070
For the first time after realisation,

261
00:11:07.309 --> 00:11:08.890
you start feeling the divine power.

262
00:11:09.219 --> 00:11:11.309
Many things happen though I said it's slow,

263
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.369
but it's very fast.

264
00:11:12.419 --> 00:11:15.409
It's so fantastic and so dynamic that

265
00:11:15.409 --> 00:11:17.700
even self-realization is difficult to contain.

266
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.380
Many spiritual traditions they'll talk about spiritual cultivation.

267
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:23.700
It's,

268
00:11:23.739 --> 00:11:26.369
it's uh if you just put a seed in the earth and,

269
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.500
and just leave it to chance,

270
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:27.859
many,

271
00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:28.489
many,

272
00:11:28.979 --> 00:11:29.450
many

273
00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:30.919
unfortunate things can happen.

274
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.929
Are there any disciplines or or protections that that your

275
00:11:35.219 --> 00:11:36.179
students engage in?

276
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:36.840
For instance,

277
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:43.849
dietary restrictions or formal meditation or different practises.

278
00:11:44.049 --> 00:11:45.330
I don't think you need it anymore.

279
00:11:45.409 --> 00:11:46.869
You have done it in previous lives.

280
00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:48.159
You've had enough of it.

281
00:11:48.369 --> 00:11:49.409
You don't need any more now.

282
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.369
What you need

283
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.119
is a realisation.

284
00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:57.859
The trouble is we must also understand that the creation of God is the epitome.

285
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.270
is the human race,

286
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.299
and it is on the brink of its destruction.

287
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:08.559
So the divine itself has taken steps to see that forgive everything

288
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.190
now just get them realised it's like emergency,

289
00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:13.900
you can say.

290
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.520
Or

291
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.419
the last judgement has started or the resurrection

292
00:12:19.419 --> 00:12:21.770
time as described by Mohammed Saba started.

293
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.650
He has precisely once said that your hands will speak what Sir Joga is doing.

294
00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:30.570
It is all described also by many saints thousands of years back,

295
00:12:30.799 --> 00:12:35.169
the seers who have described the coming of Sirjoga in those days.

296
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.539
So you feel.

297
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.580
That you,

298
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.429
you have experienced or you have the vision that that

299
00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:42.950
uh the human race is living in the last days in

300
00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:43.989
in

301
00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:45.380
in a in a time of

302
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.210
of.

303
00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:47.849
Unusual

304
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.859
cosmic emergency and flowering.

305
00:12:49.979 --> 00:12:50.330
Of course,

306
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.260
no doubt about it.

307
00:12:51.299 --> 00:12:54.380
Without that they would not take to God also this is something

308
00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.270
with human beings unless they are put to that kind of a

309
00:12:57.859 --> 00:12:59.929
frantic condition they just don't look at

310
00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:00.609
things.

311
00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.859
But haven't human beings almost always felt that way?

312
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.020
I mean,

313
00:13:03.099 --> 00:13:05.369
hasn't hasn't there always been a frantic condition?

314
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.289
haven't

315
00:13:06.469 --> 00:13:07.219
spiritual teachers,

316
00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.409
most of them always

317
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.020
warned people that there's not much time left

318
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.419
and that they're living in the last days.

319
00:13:13.429 --> 00:13:17.130
I don't think they did it that way because most of them said that this will happen.

320
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.530
They always talked of the future.

321
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.330
All the prophets have talked of the future of this time.

322
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.419
Even William Blake,

323
00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.539
who came 100 years back,

324
00:13:23.619 --> 00:13:24.770
has talked about it.

325
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.489
Everybody has talked about this time that this blossom time will come,

326
00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:30.929
and that is the time many flowers

327
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:32.450
will become fruits,

328
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.869
and it is why precarious because at that time it's a very

329
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.200
delicate time.

330
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.049
At the time when you are flowers,

331
00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:41.229
it's easy to destroy.

332
00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.510
It's beautiful that you call it a blossoming time,

333
00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:46.739
I mean,

334
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.799
many many uh.

335
00:13:48.969 --> 00:13:52.450
Many people who predict the doom doom doom doomsday

336
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.200
would call this a time of great destruction,

337
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.719
but you're calling it a time of blossom.

338
00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:55.929
Yes,

339
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.080
first the blossom,

340
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.739
then the doom.

341
00:13:59.729 --> 00:14:02.469
The blossom because you have to become the fruits,

342
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.929
and once you have become the fruits,

343
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:04.840
the rest is useless,

344
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.710
it's thrown away so that you can call as a doomday.

345
00:14:07.919 --> 00:14:09.159
But first God must give us,

346
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:09.299
give,

347
00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:12.080
give you a complete chance to be the flowers,

348
00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:13.219
to be the fruits.

349
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.039
Isn't it in his compassion?

350
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.059
The

351
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.409
Students who gather around you as you call them your spiritual children.

352
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.770
Are they are they have different.

353
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.570
Levels of of of capacity or or or can all of

354
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.570
them receive receive this realisation and transmit it to others?

355
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.400
All of them,

356
00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:42.099
all of them can receive.

357
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.609
As long as you are a human being,

358
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.130
you can get realisation.

359
00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:46.440
But

360
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.770
they are sometimes very complicated people.

361
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.929
They have had attacks.

362
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:50.619
They have had

363
00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:51.770
physical problems,

364
00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:52.609
mental problems,

365
00:14:52.849 --> 00:14:53.450
emotional problems.

366
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.570
They are a special category,

367
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.969
of course.

368
00:14:55.049 --> 00:14:57.469
There are some people who are a special category.

369
00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.599
Maybe you may not find that seeking in some people,

370
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.719
but once you have established

371
00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:05.929
a quite a number of people who are real realises,

372
00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:07.090
the others will follow them.

373
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.669
So you feel that just being human itself,

374
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.659
just having the human,

375
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:16.070
the human soul and the human body is enough for globalisation.

376
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.419
Is that somewhat different than

377
00:15:19.789 --> 00:15:21.109
traditional Indian teaching?

378
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.960
It is not different.

379
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.320
Uh,

380
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.320
but I'm different,

381
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.270
I think.

382
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:26.900
Uh,

383
00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:27.400
perhaps,

384
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.109
uh,

385
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.409
I'm endowed with something special

386
00:15:30.719 --> 00:15:32.479
that I can do it in a better way,

387
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.119
perhaps.

388
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.020
So the karmic process of uh of

389
00:15:37.409 --> 00:15:40.200
reincarnation and gradual preparation is being speeded up

390
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:41.719
very much,

391
00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:44.320
but it was a long time back when Christ came

392
00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.840
actually never told nobody told us that Christ has come in India.

393
00:15:47.929 --> 00:15:49.250
That's the confusion about

394
00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:51.200
the way they presented Christ.

395
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.570
Christ was not like that.

396
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.320
Christ came on this earth.

397
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:54.840
His,

398
00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:58.159
his name is Mahavishnu in the Indian scriptures,

399
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.369
and he was to come

400
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.729
to suck our sins and our karmas and his.

401
00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:05.169
Placed in a centre called Aga,

402
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.599
the last centre here,

403
00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:08.679
6th before entering into the,

404
00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:09.890
we can say the.

405
00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.669
kingdom of God.

406
00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:17.830
This centre was the most important one where Christ Himself established,

407
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.130
and if he is awakened,

408
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.719
he sucks in your karmas.

409
00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:23.239
This is already promised in all the Indian scriptures.

410
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.270
They were waiting for this Mahavishnu to come,

411
00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.000
but the missionaries who went with the guns in the one hand and the

412
00:16:30.109 --> 00:16:31.219
Bible in the other,

413
00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:32.679
they never understood Christ.

414
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.909
You see,

415
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.030
I don't know what they were talking and the way they talked about Christ,

416
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:38.109
nobody could believe that it was Mahavishnu.

417
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.049
But now when I told them it was Mahavishnu,

418
00:16:40.109 --> 00:16:40.710
they are all changed.

419
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.909
Of course that was Christ and he was Mahavishnu.

420
00:16:43.229 --> 00:16:44.030
He's already come,

421
00:16:44.109 --> 00:16:45.140
so you don't have to suffer.

422
00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:46.549
There is nothing like karma

423
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.679
in Serjoga.

424
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.520
If you can raise your Kundalini up to that and if Christ is awaken,

425
00:16:51.549 --> 00:16:52.479
he succeed for it.

426
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.640
He's done it already.

427
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.419
He died for us for this purpose only.

428
00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:00.099
It's a special type

429
00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.099
of a very special incarnation of the divine

430
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:03.669
uh.

431
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.689
Vibrations itself,

432
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:07.260
I mean,

433
00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:12.089
he is an abstract God who came on this earth tremendous personality.

434
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:12.770
It was created.

435
00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:13.729
It's all written down.

436
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.348
Were you

437
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.329
What was your spiritual training as a as a young woman?

438
00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:25.380
What was your family background and and when when did you feel it?

439
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.848
When did you experience that there may have

440
00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:29.079
been something special given to you spiritually?

441
00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:29.569
Oh,

442
00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:30.530
I'm very ancient,

443
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.880
you know,

444
00:17:31.079 --> 00:17:33.040
so I knew all about it since I was,

445
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.810
I knew all these things.

446
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:40.949
Was,

447
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.469
was there a particular time that that it became.

448
00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:47.530
That that it became active in you did was there was there

449
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:49.979
was there an experience of being called to know,

450
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.739
to your mission?

451
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:52.109
You see,

452
00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:54.130
I took birth in a Christian family

453
00:17:54.589 --> 00:17:57.130
and uh my father was a very learned man.

454
00:17:57.189 --> 00:17:58.869
He knew 14 languages in

455
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:00.579
Sanskrit and all that.

456
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.910
He knew my mother was another very learned lady.

457
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:04.569
And uh

458
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.130
They

459
00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:07.800
uh they were very

460
00:18:09.619 --> 00:18:09.630
Uh

461
00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:14.780
Dharic you can call them very religious and good people

462
00:18:15.239 --> 00:18:16.839
and uh when I was born,

463
00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:18.750
my father himself told me

464
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.709
that you have to find out a mass media,

465
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.550
a media by which you can give realisation to

466
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.709
masses,

467
00:18:26.199 --> 00:18:29.510
because if you start talking about God or doing anything like that,

468
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.829
you'll form another Bible or thing like that.

469
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.040
People may crucify you or do something like that.

470
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.400
So if it becomes a mass thing,

471
00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:37.750
which I knew I have to do,

472
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.959
but he also realised it.

473
00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:40.520
Then only

474
00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:41.689
the solution is there,

475
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.760
so you work it out in such a way that you enter

476
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.810
in a subtle way into the human beings and try to find out what are

477
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.650
their problems and permutations and combinations of

478
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.119
the problems and how one can overcome it

479
00:18:54.449 --> 00:18:57.599
and how the Kundalini can work out in a mass way.

480
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:59.199
So I worked it out.

481
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.449
I went to all these fake gurus and all these masters so called

482
00:19:02.449 --> 00:19:04.530
to find out what do they do and how they work it out.

483
00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:05.660
I worked very hard

484
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.699
and then.

485
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.550
They came and I thought,

486
00:19:08.709 --> 00:19:09.699
now this is the time.

487
00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:15.000
So at what point in your life did you actually begin teaching,

488
00:19:15.119 --> 00:19:15.510
taking,

489
00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:21.979
taking students or or or actually transmitting in 1970 on the 5th of May,

490
00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:23.790
this the last,

491
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.949
you can say the opening took place,

492
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.949
and uh after that

493
00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:28.869
I started,

494
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.579
but I had only one disciple for some days

495
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:34.000
like that gradually it moved on.

496
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.209
I could tell that you were speaking about in Christian

497
00:19:38.209 --> 00:19:40.839
terms in a in a in an unusual way for I

498
00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.369
I could sense that you

499
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.849
weren't speaking uh just

500
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.890
just as an ordinary Hindu.

501
00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:46.089
I mean,

502
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.709
I,

503
00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:49.839
it's interesting that you were born in a Christian family of course.

504
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.420
The

505
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.290
the uh.

506
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.969
I'm Hindu,

507
00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:56.420
Christian,

508
00:19:56.569 --> 00:20:00.670
and you refer to Mohammed.

509
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.880
Yes,

510
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.920
I was with him also.

511
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.670
What to do?

512
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.510
I was with all of them.

513
00:20:06.819 --> 00:20:07.290
So in,

514
00:20:07.349 --> 00:20:07.579
in,

515
00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.780
in previous lifetimes you you you you know with all of them,

516
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.459
yes,

517
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:11.729
yes,

518
00:20:11.739 --> 00:20:12.339
with all of them,

519
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.170
you see,

520
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:13.660
I've,

521
00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.010
I've witnessed all that.

522
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.260
That's how I'm such an expert on human beings,

523
00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:17.910
I think.

524
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.819
The

525
00:20:24.979 --> 00:20:26.130
The thing which,

526
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.170
which I find remarkable about uh.

527
00:20:28.939 --> 00:20:31.599
About the the way you're transmitting spiritual energy is

528
00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:34.469
that you are the awakening of spiritual energy is that

529
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.800
your your students tell me that.

530
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:38.760
That they also

531
00:20:38.959 --> 00:20:39.589
uh

532
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:40.800
become able to.

533
00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.839
To awaken the spiritual energy of another person,

534
00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.089
that should be the criteria for everyone,

535
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.770
isn't it?

536
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.660
If you do not get anything out of your guru,

537
00:20:49.739 --> 00:20:52.650
what's the use of having such a guru there who just takes your money,

538
00:20:52.729 --> 00:20:53.719
does no work for you,

539
00:20:53.729 --> 00:20:54.760
and gives you nothing?

540
00:20:54.979 --> 00:20:56.410
So what's the use of giving all the time?

541
00:20:56.449 --> 00:20:57.479
You must get some return.

542
00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.949
But uh

543
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.589
uh.

544
00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:03.359
In the past,

545
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.630
great teachers

546
00:21:05.079 --> 00:21:05.520
have.

547
00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:07.520
Have had

548
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.589
only a few disciples who who were strong enough to

549
00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.609
to also awaken the spiritual energy of other people.

550
00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:16.930
It was it was enough for them just to be able to

551
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.130
to uh

552
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.449
uh transform themselves

553
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:25.310
where it takes great strength not only to transform yourself but to

554
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.300
to become an ocean liner for other people to

555
00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:29.400
to

556
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.079
to the ocean.

557
00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:34.859
But that is always in nature also if you see there's only one flower on a tree.

558
00:21:35.349 --> 00:21:36.819
Then there are sometimes 2,

559
00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:38.219
then there are 10,

560
00:21:38.369 --> 00:21:39.890
then there is a blossom time.

561
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.500
You see,

562
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.229
the time is such that this time have come and maybe

563
00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:47.229
something about me also which one should discover after realisation,

564
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.989
isn't it?

565
00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:51.790
Are your mother and father still living?

566
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:52.910
No,

567
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.520
there are no water.

568
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.719
I myself 60 years of age.

569
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.250
You look so young.

570
00:21:58.579 --> 00:21:59.660
That's a camouflage.

571
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:05.060
Yeah.

572
00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:08.900
My daughter is 34 now elder daughter.

573
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:10.770
And I have grandchildren.

574
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.359
I,

575
00:22:14.689 --> 00:22:15.839
when we were in India recently,

576
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.160
we were fortunate enough to.

577
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.640
Meet with an under my ma

578
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.069
and I just heard that she passed away.

579
00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:23.849
Couple of months ago.

580
00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.150
But what good did she do?

581
00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:29.599
You see what I'm saying you should see to these people.

582
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.920
She actually got hold of all the bureaucrats of India.

583
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.800
I must tell you the facts as they are,

584
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.359
and the bureaucrats,

585
00:22:35.569 --> 00:22:36.930
all those recently I had one.

586
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.199
Her disciple,

587
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.729
who was a patient of angina,

588
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:42.839
high blood pressure,

589
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:44.959
I mean one can't understand

590
00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:46.250
that with

591
00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:49.469
The spiritual life.

592
00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.680
How can you have high blood pressure?

593
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.790
It cannot go hand in hand.

594
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.349
A person who is a realised soul

595
00:22:56.729 --> 00:22:58.680
must have a low blood pressure,

596
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.569
a peaceful personality,

597
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.800
isn't it?

598
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.959
This is how all her disciples come to me with some trouble,

599
00:23:05.069 --> 00:23:06.910
mostly with kidney troubles,

600
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:08.619
with heart troubles.

601
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640
I

602
00:23:08.959 --> 00:23:10.199
I can't understand.

603
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:11.599
She couldn't even look after their health.

604
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.400
What was she doing?

605
00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:15.630
At least the

606
00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:17.540
health of your children should be all right,

607
00:23:17.619 --> 00:23:18.180
isn't it?

608
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.780
You call yourself Ma.

609
00:23:21.339 --> 00:23:22.459
What do you do as Ma?

610
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:22.939
I said,

611
00:23:22.949 --> 00:23:22.959
mother,

612
00:23:23.829 --> 00:23:25.229
at least look after your health.

613
00:23:26.709 --> 00:23:28.910
If a mother can't look after the health of children,

614
00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.339
I think she's good for nothing.

615
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.180
Are there any um

616
00:23:39.369 --> 00:23:40.150
Are there any

617
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.589
Spiritual masters

618
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.709
in India today that that you respect that you feel are.

619
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:46.920
Oh,

620
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.910
there are many,

621
00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:48.900
many of them,

622
00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:49.540
many of them,

623
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.829
they come and see me,

624
00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.040
but they live in

625
00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:53.050
the hidings,

626
00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:54.040
I should call that.

627
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.209
Uh,

628
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.010
there are many.

629
00:23:56.199 --> 00:23:57.520
I asked one of them to come here.

630
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.260
He ran away in 3 days from New York,

631
00:23:59.479 --> 00:24:00.109
believe me,

632
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.030
really,

633
00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:01.770
it was

634
00:24:02.079 --> 00:24:02.640
too much for him.

635
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:02.880
He said,

636
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.040
I don't know how are you there?

637
00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:04.390
He said,

638
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.880
After 12 years you tell me to go there,

639
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.670
not now.

640
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.449
He couldn't come.

641
00:24:07.599 --> 00:24:08.319
He couldn't stay here.

642
00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:09.709
He said they don't understand,

643
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.310
uh,

644
00:24:10.319 --> 00:24:10.880
spirituality.

645
00:24:10.959 --> 00:24:12.250
They only understand dollars.

646
00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:14.719
So it's

647
00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:15.969
impossible for him.

648
00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:17.060
They have no patience.

649
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.819
One thing I've seen,

650
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.260
they have no patience with human beings.

651
00:24:19.339 --> 00:24:19.969
They're cut off,

652
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.650
perhaps

653
00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.770
too much,

654
00:24:22.219 --> 00:24:22.859
but they are true.

655
00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:24.219
That's true.

656
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.010
There's no doubt they're not in the market.

657
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:28.989
They have suffered.

658
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.640
One of them,

659
00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:30.229
uh,

660
00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:31.109
suffered so much.

661
00:24:31.239 --> 00:24:32.680
His legs were paralysed,

662
00:24:32.719 --> 00:24:34.020
his hands were broken,

663
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.319
and he does not know how to go about.

664
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.400
So he has one,

665
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:38.750
tiger.

666
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:40.310
On the tiger he writes

667
00:24:40.849 --> 00:24:42.760
because he says it's better to be on the tiger,

668
00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.800
so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger.

669
00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:49.579
We have many

670
00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:51.750
Since since you

671
00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:54.209
are a master of kundalini.

672
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.170
I,

673
00:24:55.339 --> 00:24:57.780
I would be interested to know what you're feeling about Sri Rama

674
00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.560
Krishna and Sarada Devi is Shri Ramma Krishna was a kind of

675
00:25:02.229 --> 00:25:04.699
A spontaneous master Kundalini

676
00:25:05.229 --> 00:25:06.510
who Ram Krishna Pawans,

677
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.310
not at all.

678
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.079
Where was he?

679
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.630
He gave realisation to no one,

680
00:25:09.709 --> 00:25:10.250
did he?

681
00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:12.569
He never gave any realisation to anyone.

682
00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:14.290
What was he master of Kundalini?

683
00:25:14.349 --> 00:25:15.689
He just played about with everything.

684
00:25:16.229 --> 00:25:18.339
You just listen to him what he says.

685
00:25:18.709 --> 00:25:20.540
I will say Raman Masjid was

686
00:25:20.989 --> 00:25:22.349
because he talked of the self.

687
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.099
But when did he?

688
00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:27.270
Ram Krishna was never he was always in separation.

689
00:25:27.719 --> 00:25:30.380
A person who is in separation is not a real life so.

690
00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:31.780
It's a simple test.

691
00:25:31.989 --> 00:25:33.219
Anybody who thinks,

692
00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:33.939
Oh God,

693
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.500
when will you meet me?

694
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.560
That means he is not a real life so.

695
00:25:38.369 --> 00:25:39.619
Supposing I'm in New York,

696
00:25:39.709 --> 00:25:40.780
I'm not going to say,

697
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:41.430
when are we,

698
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.839
am I reaching New York?

699
00:25:42.869 --> 00:25:43.670
If I'm in New York,

700
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.660
I'm in New York.

701
00:25:44.869 --> 00:25:45.099
You see,

702
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.550
you must use your brains in judging all the gurus.

703
00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:48.699
Ram Krishna,

704
00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:49.459
I would not call him.

705
00:25:49.579 --> 00:25:51.810
He was a devotee of Devi is all right.

706
00:25:51.979 --> 00:25:52.780
That was all right,

707
00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:54.910
but he was not realised so.

708
00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.219
If he was a realised soul,

709
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.900
why was he crying and weeping and shouting and dancing?

710
00:25:59.660 --> 00:25:59.680
I said,

711
00:25:59.739 --> 00:26:00.569
thank you very much.

712
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:00.900
I'm,

713
00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:02.260
I'm very honoured to talk to you,

714
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:02.609
but

715
00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:03.540
I think we should go.

716
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.380
They're enamoured by Ram Krishna now.

717
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.109
What to do?

718
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.250
What has Ram Krishna given to anyone?

719
00:26:10.709 --> 00:26:11.489
Just look at that.

720
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:14.430
No,

721
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.140
my child,

722
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.969
you must understand the people of Ram Krishna are suffering from cancer today.

723
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.979
He suffered from cancer himself.

724
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.079
This is the trouble with these people.

725
00:26:26.349 --> 00:26:27.979
It's better you are on the tip.

726
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.609
Just tell me.

727
00:26:34.819 --> 00:26:35.750
Now what has Krishna,

728
00:26:35.859 --> 00:26:37.290
he himself suffered from cancer.

729
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:41.280
No,

730
00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:42.599
I cannot tell them the truth.

731
00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:45.939
And Ram Krishna,

732
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:46.780
master of Kundalini,

733
00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:48.209
whom did he give realisation?

734
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.130
Why are they so false?

735
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.459
They're not honest people.

736
00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:04.839
Now what am I to tell her?

737
00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.250
Should I tell them the truth or not to tell.

738
00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:10.030
It has to be the truth.

739
00:27:10.489 --> 00:27:11.569
It has to be the truth.

740
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.380
This is it,

741
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:13.650
you see,

742
00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:14.880
they don't want to face the truth.

743
00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:15.869
They're dishonest.

744
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.229
When Ram Krishna has done no good,

745
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.229
their people are suffering from cancer today.

746
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:26.680
That identified

747
00:27:28.329 --> 00:27:29.630
I went to the ashrams.

748
00:27:32.829 --> 00:27:33.640
You tell him,

749
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.400
tell him that I was there and why did you,

750
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.750
you see,

751
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.369
they were all sick people all left sided.

752
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.680
They have got cancers.

753
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.849
What are they doing?

754
00:27:42.969 --> 00:27:44.760
Why don't they understand these people?

755
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.300
That taking part he's all right.

756
00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:47.930
He was a

757
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:48.900
follower of God.

758
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:49.459
It's all right.

759
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.489
I didn't say anything against,

760
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.939
but he was not a real realise Saul definitely was crying.

761
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.500
It's a fact.

762
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.449
I mean you really,

763
00:28:01.619 --> 00:28:02.969
he looks like a sick man himself,

764
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.939
he died of cancer.

765
00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:12.280
Letting me know what to do.

766
00:28:13.349 --> 00:28:16.380
I mean it's impossible that they're dishonest.

767
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.119
They're dishonest people.

768
00:28:19.959 --> 00:28:21.140
But you can publish it.

769
00:28:22.219 --> 00:28:23.979
In this case he may walk out,

770
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.119
but you can publish it.

771
00:28:25.209 --> 00:28:27.880
A magazine will publish everything you said and be very glad

772
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.239
to have the article because people will read what they cannot stand

773
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.040
the minute they get the impact of it,

774
00:28:33.329 --> 00:28:34.280
but they will read it

775
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.599
and it will sink in

776
00:28:35.969 --> 00:28:38.329
and prepare the way by the written word.

777
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.199
This is a fact.

778
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.550
What I told you is a fact.

779
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.670
You can read him.

780
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.069
He's just crying all the time,

781
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.910
where is my mother,

782
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.670
where is my mother?

783
00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:47.910
What is there to follow a man who is not in realisation?

784
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.489
How can I afford a wrong thing?

785
00:28:55.449 --> 00:28:56.060
What is it?

786
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.099
It's nice to say good things about people to get them more into it,

787
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.170
but he cannot say this about Ram Krishna because people are suffering too much.

788
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.699
They are sick.

789
00:29:04.739 --> 00:29:05.890
All of them are sick people.

790
00:29:05.939 --> 00:29:06.660
You want to see that.

791
00:29:08.109 --> 00:29:09.569
Because there are doctors,

792
00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:11.349
they want the doctors to prosper,

793
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:12.630
so they have to create sick people.

794
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.280
If you had waited,

795
00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:16.800
I would have told you we should go and see what's happening to the.

796
00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:20.819
And the first thing they get is cancer of the throat.

797
00:29:26.489 --> 00:29:27.280
He just walked off,

798
00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:27.439
see,

799
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.359
you couldn't bear it.

800
00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:32.339
There are many who want to know the truth.

801
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:32.880
All right,

802
00:29:32.959 --> 00:29:33.439
doesn't matter.

803
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:33.699
So

804
00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:34.839
what is he?

805
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.160
He's,

806
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.300
he was going to give it on the TV or something,

807
00:29:38.829 --> 00:29:38.849
huh?

808
00:29:40.319 --> 00:29:40.609
Oh,

809
00:29:40.719 --> 00:29:42.030
it's all right because he's writing.

810
00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:45.030
He should sit

811
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.930
He will not now he doesn't want to have it.

812
00:29:49.729 --> 00:29:50.589
Um,

813
00:29:50.939 --> 00:29:52.770
there is a very strong,

814
00:29:52.859 --> 00:29:53.250
uh,

815
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.569
attachment and feeling

816
00:29:54.979 --> 00:29:57.579
for the people that were part of that particular lineage,

817
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.689
and he's done,

818
00:29:59.219 --> 00:29:59.780
uh,

819
00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.150
he's invested a great deal of devotion

820
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.859
in the direction of that activity.

821
00:30:04.619 --> 00:30:04.630
In

822
00:30:07.219 --> 00:30:10.119
Sri Krishna and other people that come after him.

823
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.449
That's it.

824
00:30:11.489 --> 00:30:13.369
He must understand he will not realise soul,

825
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.810
you see.

826
00:30:13.969 --> 00:30:14.439
Give him a.

827
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:16.810
Let him realise he will not realise soul,

828
00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:17.160
you see,

829
00:30:17.209 --> 00:30:18.050
because people are sick.

830
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:19.650
Actually,

831
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:20.829
I,

832
00:30:20.869 --> 00:30:21.369
I was,

833
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.140
um,

834
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.819
you should have told me about it.

835
00:30:24.479 --> 00:30:25.050
Uh,

836
00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:26.550
when I first met him,

837
00:30:26.579 --> 00:30:27.739
it was a couple of years ago,

838
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.609
and he looked like a fellow in his

839
00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:30.849
early twenties.

840
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.729
He looked like a fellow in his early twenties when I met him just a couple of years ago,

841
00:30:34.739 --> 00:30:36.050
and I was amazed to see him.

842
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:40.560
He looked at him.

843
00:30:40.569 --> 00:30:40.630
He looks sick.

844
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:42.030
Um

845
00:30:43.619 --> 00:30:44.689
I don't know how old he is,

846
00:30:44.729 --> 00:30:45.550
but he looked,

847
00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:45.569
yeah.

848
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.530
Imagine he said I look so young.

849
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.849
What about Ram Krishna himself?

850
00:30:48.859 --> 00:30:51.329
He used to look a haggard old,

851
00:30:51.689 --> 00:30:51.959
uh,

852
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.920
dying man.

853
00:30:57.969 --> 00:30:59.250
This is the way they are identified.

854
00:30:59.329 --> 00:31:00.130
They're not honest.

855
00:31:00.209 --> 00:31:01.180
They should be honest.

856
00:31:01.329 --> 00:31:02.170
That's the main thing.

857
00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:03.530
They're not honest people.

858
00:31:05.119 --> 00:31:05.430
You see,

859
00:31:05.469 --> 00:31:06.599
the strength is honesty.

860
00:31:06.709 --> 00:31:09.540
If you don't have that strength within you of honesty,

861
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.920
you cannot stand the truth.

862
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:11.609
That's the point.

863
00:31:16.199 --> 00:31:18.280
You may telephone and tell him this,

864
00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:22.199
that you see there's nothing to be so upset about it because what mother says is true.

865
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.510
We have patients from him.

866
00:31:25.079 --> 00:31:26.000
Mother is curing them,

867
00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:26.880
she has to cure.

868
00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:29.069
He's not coming down here to cure people

869
00:31:29.479 --> 00:31:30.239
himself is sick.

870
00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:35.550
I didn't say anything.

871
00:31:35.829 --> 00:31:38.819
When if you can uh again say what what is going on,

872
00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:41.900
just see what did I say exactly about Ram Krishna.

873
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.719
Let's see it.

874
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.380
It's nothing bad.

875
00:31:45.589 --> 00:31:46.920
I didn't say he's a bad man or anything,

876
00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:49.390
but he will not realise all it was a fact.

877
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.160
But they have deified him.

878
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.390
They have deified him in a way.

879
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.189
They must have a low blood pressure,

880
00:32:01.469 --> 00:32:02.670
a peaceful personality.

881
00:32:03.439 --> 00:32:04.069
Isn't

882
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.589
this is how all her disciples come to me with some trouble,

883
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.380
mostly with kidney troubles,

884
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.829
with heart problems.

885
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.219
I I can't understand she couldn't even look after their health.

886
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:14.959
What was she doing?

887
00:32:17.439 --> 00:32:18.270
At least the

888
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.189
health of your children should be all right,

889
00:32:20.229 --> 00:32:20.709
isn't it?

890
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.339
You call yourself ma.

891
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.060
What do you do as ma?

892
00:32:25.069 --> 00:32:25.099
I say ma,

893
00:32:26.439 --> 00:32:27.719
at least look after your hand.

894
00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:31.500
If a mother can't look after the health of children,

895
00:32:31.579 --> 00:32:32.579
I think she's good for nothing.

896
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.819
Are there any uh

897
00:32:42.069 --> 00:32:42.790
Are there any

898
00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:49.319
Spiritual masters of in India today that that you respect that you feel are.

899
00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:49.530
Oh,

900
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.560
there are many,

901
00:32:50.849 --> 00:32:51.520
many of them,

902
00:32:51.689 --> 00:32:52.170
many of them,

903
00:32:52.209 --> 00:32:53.439
they come and see me,

904
00:32:53.729 --> 00:32:54.640
but they live in

905
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.670
the house,

906
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.650
I should call that.

907
00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:57.760
Uh,

908
00:32:58.069 --> 00:32:58.410
they had me.

909
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.130
I asked one of them to come here.

910
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.839
He then I mean 3 days from New York,

911
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:02.050
believe me,

912
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:03.800
he,

913
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:04.319
it was

914
00:33:04.729 --> 00:33:05.199
so much fun.

915
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:05.530
He said,

916
00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:06.670
I don't know whether how are you there?

917
00:33:06.729 --> 00:33:07.000
he said,

918
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.489
after 12 years you told me to go there,

919
00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:09.239
not now.

920
00:33:09.449 --> 00:33:10.099
He couldn't come.

921
00:33:10.239 --> 00:33:10.930
He couldn't stay here,

922
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.319
he said they don't understand,

923
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:12.949
uh,

924
00:33:12.969 --> 00:33:13.530
spirituality.

925
00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:14.849
They only understand dollars.

926
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.420
Impossible for him.

927
00:33:18.969 --> 00:33:19.729
They have no patients.

928
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.449
One thing I've seen,

929
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.890
there are no patients with humans.

930
00:33:21.969 --> 00:33:23.170
They cut offs.

931
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.530
But that's

932
00:33:26.339 --> 00:33:26.979
That's cool,

933
00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:28.489
so they're not in the market.

934
00:33:31.069 --> 00:33:32.270
They have suffered one of them,

935
00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:32.900
uh,

936
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:33.739
suffered so much.

937
00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:35.339
His legs were paralysed,

938
00:33:35.349 --> 00:33:36.619
his hands were broken,

939
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:38.949
and he does not know how to go about,

940
00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:40.030
so he has one,

941
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.410
tiger.

942
00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:42.449
On the tiger he dies

943
00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.430
because he says it's better to be on the tiger,

944
00:33:45.469 --> 00:33:47.510
so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger.

945
00:33:51.339 --> 00:33:52.130
It has many.

946
00:33:53.479 --> 00:33:53.719
Since,

947
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.550
since you

948
00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:56.839
are a master of kundalini,

949
00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.260
I,

950
00:33:57.329 --> 00:33:57.670
I would

951
00:33:59.699 --> 00:34:00.800
be interested to know what you're feeling about Sri Ramal Krishna

952
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.390
and the Devi is Sri Ram Krishna was a kind of

953
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.270
a spontaneous master of Kundalini.

954
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:10.790
Oh,

955
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:10.840
Krishna,

956
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:10.909
not to talk but one.

957
00:34:10.958 --> 00:34:12.290
He gave you a lama,

958
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:12.760
did he?

959
00:34:13.418 --> 00:34:15.339
He never gave any realisation to her,

960
00:34:15.458 --> 00:34:16.908
or was he master of Kundali?

961
00:34:16.947 --> 00:34:18.529
He just played about with everything.

962
00:34:18.888 --> 00:34:21.039
You just listen to him what he said.

963
00:34:21.368 --> 00:34:25.299
I will say Rama Masjid was because he talked up to the self.

964
00:34:25.688 --> 00:34:26.759
But when did he?

965
00:34:26.888 --> 00:34:30.158
Rrishna was never he was always in separation.

966
00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.118
A person who is in separation is not a real realised so.

967
00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:34.438
It's a simple test.

968
00:34:34.648 --> 00:34:35.908
Anybody who sings,

969
00:34:36.009 --> 00:34:36.638
oh God,

970
00:34:36.728 --> 00:34:38.158
when will you meet me?

971
00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:40.259
That means he is not a real life so.

972
00:34:40.958 --> 00:34:42.260
Supposing I'm in New York,

973
00:34:42.379 --> 00:34:44.070
I'm not going to say when are we,

974
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:45.500
am I reaching New York?

975
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.350
If I'm in New York,

976
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:47.300
I'm in New York.

977
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.780
You see,

978
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.379
you must use your brains in judging all the goods.

979
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.179
That which I would not call him.

980
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.228
He was a devotee of the is all right.

981
00:34:54.668 --> 00:34:55.438
That was all right,

982
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:57.620
but he was not realised so

983
00:34:57.909 --> 00:34:58.959
if he was a realised so,

984
00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:01.050
why was he crying and weeping and shouting and now?

985
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.320
I said,

986
00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:03.260
thank you very much.

987
00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:04.949
I'm I'm very honoured to talk to you,

988
00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:05.260
but

989
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.340
I think you should go.

990
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.889
What did you what did you say?

991
00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:12.860
I'm honoured to have but we have to go.

992
00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:14.219
He's afraid.

993
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.030
And he left at

994
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.590
10:47,

995
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.389
10:40 I think.

996
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:21.850
when you have time,

997
00:35:21.979 --> 00:35:22.870
I have an interview.

998
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:29.100
When you have time I put it on a tape and we'll use it in the radio station in Boston.

999
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.939
It's all done and if they can tape it for me,

1000
00:35:31.979 --> 00:35:33.399
then I'll have the answers on the tape.

1001
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.060
You would like to send this one or you would

1002
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.010
like to have another one they can ask me questions,

1003
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:43.810
questions would be better.

1004
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.780
When you don't want to take a tape out of that.

1005
00:35:47.129 --> 00:35:47.370
Well,

1006
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.399
I can do it now if you want to do it now.

1007
00:35:49.409 --> 00:35:50.010
If you want to rest,

1008
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:50.979
I can do it later.

1009
00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:51.290
No,

1010
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.320
why not have a tape?

1011
00:35:52.489 --> 00:35:53.689
If you have to send it to Boston,

1012
00:35:53.729 --> 00:35:56.610
then you'll have a tape ready and get them to come down.

1013
00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:00.560
I said I would call them as soon as you came and we know how much time you had.

1014
00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:01.129
All right,

1015
00:36:01.189 --> 00:36:01.889
we can do it now.

1016
00:36:03.169 --> 00:36:03.800
It's good,

1017
00:36:03.879 --> 00:36:04.909
you have more time to.

1018
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.949
I thought it was a wonderful interview.

1019
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.840
I don't understand.

1020
00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:10.790
No,

1021
00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:10.909
no,

1022
00:36:10.949 --> 00:36:11.030
no,

1023
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:11.189
no,

1024
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.989
you see he was trying to aiming at that,

1025
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.429
you see.

1026
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:14.389
But no,

1027
00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:15.739
he came with that purpose.

1028
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.110
His voice was horrid.

1029
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.719
His stomach was wobbling,

1030
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.939
completely wobbling.

1031
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.050
Poor fellow was nervous.

1032
00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:23.340
He couldn't look at me.

1033
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.989
And and left left uh.

1034
00:36:28.379 --> 00:36:28.709
The shooting left towards.

1035
00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:31.709
It's a fact,

1036
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.709
you know what I'm saying is if the disciples are so very sick,

1037
00:36:34.939 --> 00:36:35.510
he himself is sick,

1038
00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:36.429
that woman is sick.

1039
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:39.629
When you'll get

1040
00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:40.219
troubles,

1041
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:40.860
he'll come to me,

1042
00:36:40.899 --> 00:36:41.250
I know.

1043
00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:44.709
You see,

1044
00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:47.330
the problem of it is that there are

1045
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.370
these people

1046
00:36:48.979 --> 00:36:51.850
that have the ear of the public are targets,

1047
00:36:52.419 --> 00:36:53.300
major targets.

1048
00:36:53.879 --> 00:36:55.699
And uh they're attacked regularly,

1049
00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:56.300
you see,

1050
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.479
and what

1051
00:36:57.909 --> 00:37:01.100
they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them

1052
00:37:03.689 --> 00:37:06.500
which I think is spirituality what they think is real

1053
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.389
is just something that's invading them in order to get the ear

1054
00:37:09.389 --> 00:37:11.629
of the public in order to get the attention of the public.

1055
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:12.780
Uh,

1056
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.399
he has,

1057
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:13.919
uh,

1058
00:37:13.929 --> 00:37:16.199
a very large listening audience

1059
00:37:16.729 --> 00:37:17.330
and so,

1060
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.120
uh,

1061
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:18.959
this,

1062
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.719
which is the mecca for the boots,

1063
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:20.889
you know,

1064
00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:21.639
in this world,

1065
00:37:22.129 --> 00:37:24.439
but this country in particular and perhaps

1066
00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:26.959
his particular programme is one

1067
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:28.360
voice

1068
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:30.030
that I would think the,

1069
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.560
the boots in the area want to have silenced or at least under their control,

1070
00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:34.530
um.

1071
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.120
They are he got upset when I said I was Christian,

1072
00:37:39.429 --> 00:37:39.870
I told you.

1073
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:40.879
Because

1074
00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:42.750
what Ramak Krishna was,

1075
00:37:42.919 --> 00:37:44.010
he was against Christians

1076
00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.560
and especially Vivekan was very much against Christianity

1077
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:48.639
and Christians,

1078
00:37:48.709 --> 00:37:50.360
and you know just to outwit them,

1079
00:37:50.439 --> 00:37:51.909
he started this missionary work.

1080
00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:52.159
See,

1081
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.550
in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work.

1082
00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:57.379
It's called as the worst of all.

1083
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.439
It's the menial work,

1084
00:37:58.479 --> 00:37:58.709
you see,

1085
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.350
it's not a Brahmin,

1086
00:38:00.439 --> 00:38:01.550
you see this missionary work,

1087
00:38:02.479 --> 00:38:04.189
because the first concept is wrong,

1088
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.639
that somebody is the other

1089
00:38:05.959 --> 00:38:07.639
whom to emancipate you are.

1090
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:08.629
You,

1091
00:38:08.729 --> 00:38:09.679
if you are the spirit,

1092
00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:11.570
then you don't have to help anybody.

1093
00:38:11.649 --> 00:38:13.889
It is just your part and parcel that you are helping,

1094
00:38:13.929 --> 00:38:14.199
you see.

1095
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:17.600
So the whole idea is regarded as hura is regarded as low.

1096
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:18.590
This is menial

1097
00:38:19.419 --> 00:38:21.050
according to Indian philosophy,

1098
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:21.520
see,

1099
00:38:21.649 --> 00:38:23.280
and that's exactly started

1100
00:38:23.489 --> 00:38:25.290
just like all the if he had sat here,

1101
00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.800
I would have told him all about it.

1102
00:38:27.379 --> 00:38:29.120
He started this idea or this,

1103
00:38:29.129 --> 00:38:29.209
uh,

1104
00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:30.120
what's his name,

1105
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:31.239
uh,

1106
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:31.919
Ram Krishna.

1107
00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:32.750
Uh,

1108
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.820
of the missionary work,

1109
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:35.629
but the one who's really

1110
00:38:35.949 --> 00:38:38.449
gave it a shape was his disciple.

1111
00:38:39.229 --> 00:38:42.850
He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that,

1112
00:38:42.989 --> 00:38:43.959
all kinds of things

1113
00:38:44.419 --> 00:38:45.179
and horrible.

1114
00:38:46.229 --> 00:38:46.239
That

1115
00:38:46.899 --> 00:38:48.010
extremely money minded,

1116
00:38:48.379 --> 00:38:49.120
extremely,

1117
00:38:49.489 --> 00:38:50.219
uh,

1118
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.389
gregarious.

1119
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.899
All kinds of problems they have.

1120
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.020
There's no transformation,

1121
00:38:57.149 --> 00:38:57.419
nothing.

1122
00:38:57.709 --> 00:38:58.750
Whom did you transform?

1123
00:38:58.909 --> 00:38:59.070
I mean,

1124
00:38:59.110 --> 00:38:59.909
you must face it.

1125
00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:07.040
This is the point.

1126
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:08.129
Now,

1127
00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.040
if this person,

1128
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.610
he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family,

1129
00:39:11.649 --> 00:39:12.250
I can tell you.

1130
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:14.899
They couldn't take

1131
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.090
They are against Christ

1132
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.159
All of them

1133
00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:21.159
are against price.

1134
00:39:21.939 --> 00:39:24.510
They don't believe in Christianity as Christ this thing,

1135
00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:25.290
take it from me.

1136
00:39:25.889 --> 00:39:26.689
This is the reason.

1137
00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.520
Is it a government radio he is operating?

1138
00:39:30.919 --> 00:39:31.090
No,

1139
00:39:31.239 --> 00:39:32.949
it's a listener sponsored

1140
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.070
radio.

1141
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:34.560
Is,

1142
00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:36.110
uh,

1143
00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:37.000
listener sponsored.

1144
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:37.919
He works on the station.

1145
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:39.040
It's called WBAI.

1146
00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:40.899
Who who owns them?

1147
00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:43.959
The it's owned by the people that's that support it.

1148
00:39:44.629 --> 00:39:45.419
By the same people,

1149
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.290
the public,

1150
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.139
the public,

1151
00:39:47.209 --> 00:39:48.439
publicly maintained.

1152
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.810
It's the public.

1153
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:50.040
Yes,

1154
00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:51.929
the public sends money in.

1155
00:39:52.139 --> 00:39:53.169
The government gives a very,

1156
00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:55.949
very small part if the public is doing it now.

1157
00:39:57.949 --> 00:40:00.139
It's a private man must be doing somebody who

1158
00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:02.370
must have put the money must have started.

1159
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:02.750
No,

1160
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.489
actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions,

1161
00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:07.379
but who is,

1162
00:40:07.459 --> 00:40:07.659
I mean,

1163
00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:09.580
there must be somebody we can do it now.

1164
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.629
It's good you have more time to.

1165
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.610
I thought it was a wonderful interview.

1166
00:40:16.689 --> 00:40:17.530
I don't understand.

1167
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:18.449
No,

1168
00:40:18.489 --> 00:40:18.570
no,

1169
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:18.689
no,

1170
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.850
no,

1171
00:40:18.929 --> 00:40:20.649
you see he was trying to aiming at that,

1172
00:40:20.669 --> 00:40:21.090
you see.

1173
00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:22.050
No,

1174
00:40:22.129 --> 00:40:23.389
he came with that purpose.

1175
00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:25.780
His voice was horrid.

1176
00:40:26.169 --> 00:40:27.389
His stomach was wobbling,

1177
00:40:27.969 --> 00:40:28.610
completely wobbling.

1178
00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:29.719
Poor fellow was nervous.

1179
00:40:29.889 --> 00:40:31.010
He couldn't look at me.

1180
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.679
And and left left uh.

1181
00:40:34.959 --> 00:40:35.810
The shoot and

1182
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.939
left all this time.

1183
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.379
It's a fact,

1184
00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:39.620
you know,

1185
00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:42.379
whatever I'm saying is if the disciples are so very sick,

1186
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.179
he himself is sick,

1187
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.060
that woman is sick.

1188
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.320
When you'll get

1189
00:40:47.649 --> 00:40:47.889
troubles,

1190
00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:48.530
he'll come to me,

1191
00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:48.889
I know.

1192
00:40:51.939 --> 00:40:52.360
You see,

1193
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:54.250
the problem of it is that

1194
00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:55.000
there are

1195
00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.040
these people

1196
00:40:56.649 --> 00:41:01.040
that have the ear of the public are targets see major targets,

1197
00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:03.399
and uh they're attacked regularly,

1198
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.000
you see,

1199
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:05.159
and what

1200
00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:08.429
they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading

1201
00:41:08.429 --> 00:41:14.159
them which I think is spirituality what they think is real

1202
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.090
is just something that's invading them in order to get the ear

1203
00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:19.290
of the public in order to get the attention of the public.

1204
00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.449
Uh,

1205
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.070
he has,

1206
00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:21.590
uh,

1207
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.870
a very large listening audience

1208
00:41:24.399 --> 00:41:25.000
and so,

1209
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.750
uh,

1210
00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:26.629
this,

1211
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.389
which is the mecca for the boots,

1212
00:41:28.439 --> 00:41:28.560
you know,

1213
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.310
in this world,

1214
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.110
but this country in particular and perhaps,

1215
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:32.649
uh,

1216
00:41:32.879 --> 00:41:34.550
his particular programme is one

1217
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.030
voice

1218
00:41:36.489 --> 00:41:39.000
that I would think the the boots in the area

1219
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.270
want to have silenced or at least under their control,

1220
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.199
um.

1221
00:41:44.729 --> 00:41:46.530
He got upset when I said I was Christian.

1222
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.689
I tell you

1223
00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:50.409
because what Ramak Krishna was,

1224
00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.689
he was against Christians

1225
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.679
and especially Vive was very much against Christianity and

1226
00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:58.040
Christians and you know just to outwit them,

1227
00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.550
he started this missionary work.

1228
00:41:59.760 --> 00:41:59.840
See,

1229
00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:03.229
in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work.

1230
00:42:03.399 --> 00:42:05.070
It's called as the worst of all.

1231
00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:06.080
It's the menial work,

1232
00:42:06.159 --> 00:42:06.389
you see,

1233
00:42:06.439 --> 00:42:08.070
it's not a Brahmins,

1234
00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.209
you see this missionary work,

1235
00:42:10.159 --> 00:42:11.830
because the first concept is wrong,

1236
00:42:11.959 --> 00:42:13.290
that somebody is the other

1237
00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.350
whom to emancipate you are.

1238
00:42:15.969 --> 00:42:16.300
You,

1239
00:42:16.399 --> 00:42:17.350
if you are the spirit,

1240
00:42:17.439 --> 00:42:19.270
then you don't have to help anybody.

1241
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.560
It is just your part and parcel that you are helping,

1242
00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:21.870
you see.

1243
00:42:21.919 --> 00:42:25.270
So the whole idea is regarded as hora is regarded as low.

1244
00:42:25.439 --> 00:42:26.270
This is menial

1245
00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.800
according to Indian philosophy,

1246
00:42:28.919 --> 00:42:29.189
see,

1247
00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.949
and that's exactly started

1248
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:32.959
just like all the if he had sat here,

1249
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.669
I would have told him all about it.

1250
00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.790
He started this idea or this,

1251
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:36.879
uh,

1252
00:42:36.959 --> 00:42:37.830
what's his name,

1253
00:42:38.729 --> 00:42:38.929
uh,

1254
00:42:38.959 --> 00:42:39.600
Ram Krishna.

1255
00:42:40.139 --> 00:42:40.419
Uh,

1256
00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:41.489
of the missionary work,

1257
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.300
but the one who's really

1258
00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.120
gave it a shape was his disciple.

1259
00:42:46.899 --> 00:42:50.530
He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that,

1260
00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:51.629
all kinds of things

1261
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:52.840
and horrible.

1262
00:42:53.969 --> 00:42:55.679
That extremely money minded,

1263
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.790
extremely,

1264
00:42:57.159 --> 00:42:57.899
uh,

1265
00:42:58.050 --> 00:42:59.080
gregarious.

1266
00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:01.560
All kinds of problems they have.

1267
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.689
There's no transformation,

1268
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.070
nothing.

1269
00:43:05.379 --> 00:43:06.419
Whom did you transform?

1270
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:06.739
I mean,

1271
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.620
you must face it.

1272
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:14.719
This is the point.

1273
00:43:15.639 --> 00:43:15.800
Now,

1274
00:43:15.919 --> 00:43:16.679
if this person,

1275
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.280
he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family,

1276
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.879
I can tell you.

1277
00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:22.469
They couldn't take it.

1278
00:43:23.459 --> 00:43:24.760
They are against Christ

1279
00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:27.830
All of them

1280
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.820
are against us.

1281
00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.169
They don't believe in Christianity as Christ this thing,

1282
00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:32.939
take it from me.

1283
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.330
This is the reason.

1284
00:43:35.629 --> 00:43:38.199
Is it a government radio he's operating?

1285
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:38.800
No,

1286
00:43:38.919 --> 00:43:40.560
it's a listener sponsored

1287
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:41.770
radio.

1288
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.310
It's all,

1289
00:43:43.399 --> 00:43:43.790
uh,

1290
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.679
listener sponsored.

1291
00:43:44.719 --> 00:43:45.600
He works on the station.

1292
00:43:45.629 --> 00:43:46.919
It's called WBAI.

1293
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.469
Who who owns them?

1294
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:51.639
The it's owned by the people that's that support it.

1295
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.090
By the same people,

1296
00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:53.959
the public,

1297
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.100
the public's publicly maintained.

1298
00:43:56.689 --> 00:43:57.399
It's the public.

1299
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:57.709
Yes,

1300
00:43:57.879 --> 00:43:59.600
the public sends money in.

1301
00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:00.840
The government gives a very,

1302
00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:03.620
very small part if the public is doing it now.

1303
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.810
It's a private man must be doing somebody who

1304
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.040
must have put the money must have started.

1305
00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:10.439
No,

1306
00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:14.159
actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions.

1307
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:15.040
But who is,

1308
00:44:15.129 --> 00:44:15.330
I mean,

1309
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:16.939
there must be somebody who is in charge.

1310
00:44:17.729 --> 00:44:18.919
They have different managers.

1311
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:19.909
You see,

1312
00:44:19.969 --> 00:44:21.070
then you can write to them

1313
00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:24.469
that this man is a follower of Ram Krishna

1314
00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:25.959
who was against Christianity,

1315
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.149
was against Christ,

1316
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.600
and that's why when Mother said it,

1317
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:29.199
she was upset.

1318
00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.219
Why not write to them?

1319
00:44:30.679 --> 00:44:30.879
You see,

1320
00:44:30.949 --> 00:44:32.350
he must be having bosses also.

1321
00:44:33.919 --> 00:44:34.389
Uh,

1322
00:44:34.479 --> 00:44:36.530
he has a free hand in what kind of programme,

1323
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.080
whatever it is,

1324
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.429
but you can point it out that he's biassed.

1325
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.639
He's not open minded.

1326
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.379
If he's doing work in that sense.

1327
00:44:47.169 --> 00:44:48.479
Has a strong

1328
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.689
support for Christianity and in mainland Christianity as far as that's concerned.

1329
00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:53.669
Uh,

1330
00:44:53.679 --> 00:44:54.350
he's had

1331
00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:55.189
several

1332
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.750
purely Christian figures,

1333
00:44:56.879 --> 00:44:57.350
uh,

1334
00:44:57.399 --> 00:44:58.389
Catholic figures,

1335
00:44:58.719 --> 00:44:59.350
as well as,

1336
00:44:59.379 --> 00:44:59.840
uh,

1337
00:45:00.159 --> 00:45:00.770
general,

1338
00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:01.100
uh,

1339
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:01.850
Christians.

1340
00:45:02.239 --> 00:45:05.330
Then why was he only because of Ram Krishna being criticised,

1341
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.949
so that means he cannot be a biassed person.

1342
00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:08.639
You see,

1343
00:45:08.649 --> 00:45:09.679
in a democratic country,

1344
00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.159
you should give a chance to everyone.

1345
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.909
He should have discussed instead of leaving.

1346
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.229
In his mind,

1347
00:45:15.439 --> 00:45:19.429
Ramakrishna is synonymous with uh a perfect incarnation of God.

1348
00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:20.199
All right,

1349
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:20.840
whatever it is,

1350
00:45:20.919 --> 00:45:22.879
but you can't use your mind for a public work.

1351
00:45:23.729 --> 00:45:24.070
You see,

1352
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.100
you must give chance to everyone under a democratic country.

1353
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.750
It must be pointed out to the public somehow.

1354
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.500
You cannot,

1355
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:32.739
I mean,

1356
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.560
he cannot propagate Ram Krishna.

1357
00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:36.669
He cannot put his ideas into my head.

1358
00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:41.399
And he's a public servant.

1359
00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.389
You both have equal rights in that situation.

1360
00:45:44.479 --> 00:45:45.760
You both have equal rights,

1361
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.389
equal rights.

1362
00:45:46.439 --> 00:45:47.280
He's a public man.

1363
00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:48.800
If he's a public servant,

1364
00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840
he has no business.

1365
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.909
I think it should be pointed out to someone there up there

1366
00:45:54.459 --> 00:45:55.270
it's above you

1367
00:45:55.879 --> 00:45:56.830
who brought him here?

1368
00:45:58.510 --> 00:45:58.919
You know,

1369
00:46:00.159 --> 00:46:00.629
I'm sorry,

1370
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.830
I didn't realise.

1371
00:46:02.479 --> 00:46:03.510
Where did he meet you?

1372
00:46:03.729 --> 00:46:04.550
I never did.

1373
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:05.110
I,

1374
00:46:05.439 --> 00:46:07.000
I just knew that he ran a uh.

1375
00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.260
Radio programme for seekers,

1376
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.530
so I called him up and asked him if he wanted to come and he said yes.

1377
00:46:13.659 --> 00:46:15.590
So you should go and see his

1378
00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:16.580
his superiors,

1379
00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.219
and you should say he's he's having a thing for seekers.

1380
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.899
He is a person who doesn't take any money,

1381
00:46:20.939 --> 00:46:22.010
has done so much good,

1382
00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.290
and she's saying something,

1383
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:23.709
saying,

1384
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.439
and this fellow just left his the man he was doing good too.

1385
00:46:26.659 --> 00:46:28.139
Why not go see his superiors.

1386
00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.889
He's acting as a censor,

1387
00:46:30.899 --> 00:46:33.379
censoring censoring it?

1388
00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.610
He's censoring you.

1389
00:46:35.469 --> 00:46:37.580
Cutting people off from part of the truth.

1390
00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:37.939
Yes,

1391
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:39.550
he's censoring.

1392
00:46:39.629 --> 00:46:39.709
Yes,

1393
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.270
that's the point.

1394
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.030
He's censoring.

1395
00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.169
He can't just do it,

1396
00:46:42.179 --> 00:46:42.409
you see,

1397
00:46:42.459 --> 00:46:42.790
you should,

1398
00:46:42.949 --> 00:46:43.979
you should all write.

1399
00:46:44.709 --> 00:46:46.340
We are all citizens of this country.

1400
00:46:47.189 --> 00:46:50.439
We have a big group of them in Boston and they are all sick.

1401
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:51.830
They have kidney troubles.

1402
00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:53.860
They have hyperglycemia.

1403
00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:56.229
They have almost every disease.

1404
00:46:57.129 --> 00:46:58.949
You should write why not why not write that I

1405
00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:01.100
was present at the thank God you were all here.

1406
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:04.120
And mother was never said anything against him,

1407
00:47:04.179 --> 00:47:04.919
but she said she,

1408
00:47:04.929 --> 00:47:06.000
he was not a realised soul,

1409
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.669
and mother has a right to say that,

1410
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:08.840
and he just walked out.

1411
00:47:08.929 --> 00:47:09.679
How can you do it?

1412
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.979
It's better

1413
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:13.409
to pursue the matter.

1414
00:47:14.629 --> 00:47:15.590
To bring him down,

1415
00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:16.979
he may believe into anything.

1416
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.280
You may believe into ghosts,

1417
00:47:18.409 --> 00:47:18.959
so what?

1418
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.780
Everybody has a right to say what they want.

1419
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.709
This is a free country or it's a

1420
00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:25.939
What sort of a country is this?

1421
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.000
If we had someone to introduce,

1422
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:30.419
Mother,

1423
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:39.120
it would is the I'll have some water,

1424
00:47:39.129 --> 00:47:39.169
but for the other,

1425
00:47:39.179 --> 00:47:40.610
but someone to introduce.

1426
00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:45.709
And then I could come after the introduction so that they know the mother is.

1427
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.530
7.

1428
00:47:59.669 --> 00:47:59.699
What you say,

1429
00:47:59.709 --> 00:47:59.719
right?

1430
00:48:03.889 --> 00:48:03.909
Anyone,

1431
00:48:03.919 --> 00:48:05.739
anyone Brian is all right because he's not from the guys.

1432
00:48:07.639 --> 00:48:08.179
Right,

1433
00:48:08.399 --> 00:48:09.080
but uh,

1434
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:09.570
he,

1435
00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.070
he would be sitting here.

1436
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.459
All right.

1437
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:14.620
OK,

1438
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:15.169
OK.

1439
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.879
No,

1440
00:48:16.919 --> 00:48:17.790
you sit here

1441
00:48:18.159 --> 00:48:19.360
because he will have to go away.

1442
00:48:20.919 --> 00:48:21.600
After introducing,

1443
00:48:21.919 --> 00:48:24.790
but you can sit there what did you like by way of introduction.

1444
00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.219
About he's looking rather worried now.

1445
00:48:31.939 --> 00:48:31.949
Yeah.

1446
00:48:34.959 --> 00:48:35.899
He gets very angry with

1447
00:48:37.439 --> 00:48:39.270
you because he's a journalist.

1448
00:48:39.439 --> 00:48:43.320
That's why you see why he's angry because his clan has misbehaved.

1449
00:48:44.449 --> 00:48:45.429
But they're all like that,

1450
00:48:45.469 --> 00:48:46.330
I must tell you,

1451
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.459
horrible people.

1452
00:48:48.409 --> 00:48:49.409
I mean he's a journalist,

1453
00:48:49.449 --> 00:48:50.209
he's a public man.

1454
00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:52.959
He has no business to have his own opinion,

1455
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.000
you see very bad journalism.

1456
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:57.159
You better get a letter from him.

1457
00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.629
Very bad journalism.

1458
00:48:59.959 --> 00:49:01.000
You cannot be biassed,

1459
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.199
you have to be a witness.

1460
00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:08.760
That means he's trying to attract every one of them to his class.

1461
00:49:16.459 --> 00:49:17.100
If you're upset,

1462
00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:18.090
let's do some,

1463
00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:18.659
say something.

1464
00:49:18.739 --> 00:49:19.050
Mustav,

1465
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.100
you better introduce.

1466
00:49:20.139 --> 00:49:21.570
He's looking so upset on his face.

1467
00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:25.010
This journalist,

1468
00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:25.570
huh.

1469
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:29.750
I thought it was good to see they're so afraid.

1470
00:49:30.159 --> 00:49:31.629
They're so afraid when they hear the truth,

1471
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.909
because that's the reaction we've gotten in Boston.

1472
00:49:34.199 --> 00:49:35.580
They're afraid when they hear

1473
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.199
the truth,

1474
00:49:36.399 --> 00:49:37.199
especially about the false

1475
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.760
gods.

1476
00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.469
That's

1477
00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:40.409
My pano

1478
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:45.350
yes,

1479
00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.270
on the floor on the right hand side

1480
00:49:47.679 --> 00:49:48.199
by the door.

1481
00:49:49.719 --> 00:49:52.870
I'll give you the introduction and you can just you want to.

1482
00:49:53.239 --> 00:49:55.679
It seems that this is not this is.

1483
00:49:56.459 --> 00:49:58.129
Typical in the sense that

1484
00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:58.699
uh.

1485
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.790
The usual outlets,

1486
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.500
the usual newspapers and so on,

1487
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.370
are

1488
00:50:05.929 --> 00:50:09.770
really primarily interested in those areas of power and money.

1489
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.179
That is really what

1490
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.469
I can understand that I can understand that is the

1491
00:50:14.469 --> 00:50:15.979
area that I think we've got to move into that

1492
00:50:16.629 --> 00:50:17.810
that I can understand,

1493
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.060
but I can't understand this.

1494
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:21.830
You see,

1495
00:50:21.919 --> 00:50:22.899
you cannot,

1496
00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:25.389
you cannot have your own ideas.

1497
00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:29.060
And your own identifications.

1498
00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.610
So

1499
00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.659
much that you cannot bear

1500
00:50:33.129 --> 00:50:33.770
anything else.

1501
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.040
Seems that people are

1502
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.370
are placed these sort of people who have an interest,

1503
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:42.989
they are biassed.

1504
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:44.199
They are placed and then of course what you call them

1505
00:50:48.899 --> 00:50:50.570
vested interests,

1506
00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:52.070
vested interests,

1507
00:50:52.179 --> 00:50:53.929
you see vested interest in the world.

1508
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:55.100
Huh,

1509
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:00.750
he left it.

1510
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:01.919
He took your watch.

1511
00:51:06.149 --> 00:51:07.419
I hope he'll return it.

1512
00:51:08.629 --> 00:51:09.149
He'll return,

1513
00:51:09.229 --> 00:51:09.510
no doubt,

1514
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.399
but good your watch has gone with him.

1515
00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:12.989
It will do some good to him.

1516
00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.510
He didn't even have a watch with himself.

1517
00:51:18.629 --> 00:51:20.219
What sort of an interviewer he is.

1518
00:51:25.439 --> 00:51:25.510
No,

1519
00:51:25.669 --> 00:51:26.739
so would you introduce?

1520
00:51:26.949 --> 00:51:26.959
No,

1521
00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:27.909
no,

1522
00:51:27.989 --> 00:51:30.550
I would say that is he going to come in the film or not

1523
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:37.110
just now he's very upset and angry is because if they like this,

1524
00:51:37.139 --> 00:51:39.909
then they can come down tomorrow and do

1525
00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:46.580
it themselves with their own television sound there.

1526
00:51:46.949 --> 00:51:47.750
I'll have some water,

1527
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:48.219
please.

1528
00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:49.260
Little's.

1529
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.110
Is there water here?

1530
00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:56.610
Thank you,

1531
00:51:56.649 --> 00:51:57.280
thank you very much.

1532
00:51:57.370 --> 00:51:58.120
Thank you.

1533
00:51:58.649 --> 00:51:59.290
Thank you.
