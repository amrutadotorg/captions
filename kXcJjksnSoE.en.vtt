00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.560
All right?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.680
Felicity, you better sit on some chair, be careful. Are you all right? Yes, yes, it's all right, be careful.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.280
It's expels, eh? All right. So, should we start now? Is it all right? Are we focused, just?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.480
Yes, it's okay. Forgive Me now and then I'll turn away and look at the time. I'll just be checking.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.480
I'll do that for some reason. It's all right.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.680
That's enough.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
Or an extension, if you have an extension cord, that would work too.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880
Do you want to just hold a watch?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.080
That would be perfectly all right too, if I could borrow a watch from somebody.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
It's a digital one, I'm afraid.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
I'm not going to be on camera so I can look at the watch and do all sorts of things.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.280
You can do what you like.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.280
I'm going to jingle it around.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.080
It takes too long.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080
Not rolling yet. Are you rolling?

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
Just the legs. Legs, okay.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.280
I'm setting up. Just resetting it.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
Is the telephone off the hook?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Yes, it is.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.480
When the little one may start crying.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.680
That would be nice. That would be a nice sound.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.480
Neck. You must look after the neck of the baby.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680
That's the Vishuddhi.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080
That's the little motherhood.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280
So about fifty minutes.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280
We'll make it about fifty minutes long.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480
Alright.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.850
I will answer in short, would be better.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.890
Whatever you feel like.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.930
Because how many questions you'll ask, it depends on.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.990
I don't know. Depends on how long your answers are.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.660
I can go on. It's all spontaneous.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.160
So ten twenty. If we started at ten twenty, what time?

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.220
Fifty minutes later, please.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.620
So if we start at ten twenty, then if we finish at eleven ten, that's fifty minutes?

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.620
Fifty minutes will do.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.242
It could be long then.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280
Okay. You can roll.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.480
Mataji, in order to understand the process of realization,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:25.880
which is very complicated and almost has a kind of scientific discipline to it,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
but first maybe you could say a word about the goal

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.280
in order to anchor our discussion.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480
So could you say something about the highest realization,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.680
what the goal of this entire process is?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.280
The goal of this process is, to begin with, we should say,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480
is to become the Spirit.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.080
The Spirit is the reflection of our Creator, the God Almighty in our heart,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.880
which is the collective being within us.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.680
Now of course this is all a theory for you,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.680
and you can take as a hypothesis, but it's a fact and can be found out.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.280
After you get your Self-realization,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.480
you feel the manifestation of the Spirit in your nervous system,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480
in your conscious mind.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.480
This is the goal, to begin with.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.080
You see, if you talk of the very higher things, it could be confusing.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.280
So the first is Self-realization. That is the first goal.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.280
You said that the Spirit, you define the Spirit

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.480
as the reflection of God Almighty in the heart.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.680
Yes, please.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.888
What is, what do you mean by God Almighty?

00:06:48.068 --> 00:06:56.768
God Almighty is the one who is everything.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.200
He is the one who is the Creator.

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:04.772
He is the one who has desire to create,

00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:09.592
the one who is, can destroy if he has no desires left,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.562
And He is the one who gives us sustenance,

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:16.422
who gives us this evolution by which we have become human beings.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.480
He is the entire thing. It is all His play.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.880
I was under the impression that the Kundalini

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.880
was Mother Kundalini and that, that this energy was feminine,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.880
and now you refer to the Divine as He.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.080
Yes, He is Divine and She is also Divine, both could be Divine.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.880
But He is the one who is the witness of the play of His desire,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
and His desire is the Primordial Kundalini,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.080
is the Primordial Mother, is the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.880
And She is reflected within us as the Kundalini.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.480
When this reflection that is the Kundalini

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.080
meets the reflection that is the Spirit,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.480
then the yoga takes place, then the union takes place.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.280
What was, what was the Divine doing before it created anything?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.880
It was sleeping.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.080
It was complete silence and then it awoke.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.880
When it is awakened, a creation is created out of His power.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.880
But He is just the witness.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.480
Is, is the goal to participate in the Divine play

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.880
or to return to the complete silence?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.880
First is to get into that play, to become one with the whole.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.680
That is the first goal, as I said.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.080
And you, you don't think it would be helpful

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.080
to speak about anything beyond that?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.080
Just now it can be dangerous, you see.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.680
This is difficult for people in the West

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.280
who don't understand the idea of,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.680
of a secret teaching that unfolds as, as a person develops.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.080
They, they overhear,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.280
we think that we can hear everything all at once.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.280
You see, it is a living process.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.880
And in the West I don't know how many have studied living processes.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.280
Living process is never like that.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.080
First the seed, then the roots, then the tree,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.480
then the leaves and then the flowers and then the fruit.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.880
See, so the, it is a living process.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.480
Now we are human beings at the stage when we are flowers.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480
Now we have to become the fruits.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.680
Then the fruit has to grow.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.880
Once we understand living process, we can understand why.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.680
We have to first get Self-realization.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.560
That's why Buddha did not talk of God.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.120
Because if you talk of God, it's too far-fetched.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.720
So better to talk of Self-realization first he thought.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760
Because if you talk of something abstract,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.960
then people get fizzled out.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.960
So as a spiritual mother you, you teach your children

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.280
and show them how to become one with the entire cosmic play?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.000
Yes, first of all to become the, your microcosm

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.960
should become one with the macrocosm.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.240
First feel that, first understand that and then grow into it.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.440
Now how do your, your disciples or your spiritual children do this?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.400
It's obviously not just a matter of philosophy,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.720
but thinking about it, how do they proceed along the path?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.720
As I said it's a living process

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.760
and for living process you cannot do anything about it.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.040
It's spontaneous.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.280
But as in the living process you have seen

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.280
that if you have to sprout a seed, you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.160
And the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it spontaneously.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.640
You don't have to do anything about it.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.840
In the same way if I am the Mother Earth,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.640
if you put your hands towards Me you can get your realization.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.640
It's very simple.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.680
But once you get realization, you can also give realization to others

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.680
by raising their Kundalini because from your hand

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.760
that Divine power starts flowing.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.840
For the first time after realization you start feeling the Divine power.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.200
Many things happen though I said it's slow, but it's very fast.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.840
It's so, so fantastic and so dynamic

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.160
that even Self-realization is difficult to contain.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.240
Many spiritual traditions they'll talk about spiritual cultivation.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.240
It's a, if you just put a seed in the Earth and just leave it to chance,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.680
many, many, many unfortunate things can happen.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.040
Are there any disciplines or protections that your students engage in?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.240
For instance, dietary restrictions or formal meditation or different practices?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.640
I don't think you need it anymore. You have done it in previous lives now.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.160
You have had enough of it. You don't need anymore now.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.960
What you need is your realization.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:58.280
The trouble is we must also understand that the creation of God is the epitome,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.720
is the human race and it is on the brink of its destruction.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.000
So the Divine itself has taken steps to see that forgive everything.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.400
Now just get them realized, you see.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:17.560
It's like emergency, you can say, or the last judgment has started

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.520
or the resurrection time as described by Mohammed Sahib has started.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.560
He has precisely once said that your hands will speak what Sahaja Yoga is doing.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.360
He's all described also by many saints thousands of years back,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.280
the seers who have described the coming of Sahaja Yoga in those days.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.400
So you feel that you have experienced or you have the vision

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.720
that the human race is living in the last days

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:49.440
in a time of unusual cosmic emergency and flowering?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.280
Of course, no doubt about it. Without that they would not take to God also.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.880
This is something with human beings.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.400
Unless and until they are put to that kind of a frantic condition,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.400
they just don't look at things.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.640
But haven't human beings almost always felt that way?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.080
I mean, hasn't there always been a frantic condition?

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.440
Haven't spiritual teachers, most of them always warned people

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.120
that there is not much time left and that they're living in the last days?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't think they did that way because most of them said

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.320
that this will happen. They always talked of future.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.200
All the prophets have talked of the future of this time.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.600
Even William Blake who came hundred years back has talked about it.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.320
Everybody has talked about this time that this blossom time will come

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.160
and that is the time many flowers will become fruits.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.480
And if these, why precarious?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.040
Because at that time it's a very delicate time.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.480
At the time when you are flowers it's easy to destroy.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.240
It's beautiful that you call it a blossoming time.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.880
I mean, many, many people who predict the doom, doom,

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.840
doomsday would call this time of great destruction

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.360
but you're calling it a time of blossom.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.360
Yes, first the blossom, then the doom.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.280
The blossom because you have to become the fruits.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.480
And once you have become the fruits, the rest is useless,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.440
is thrown away so that you can call as a doom day.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.800
But first God must give us, give you complete chance

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to be the flowers, to be the fruits.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.280
Isn't it? In His compassion.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.680
The students who gather around you,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.880
as you call them, your spiritual children,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.280
are they of different levels of capacity

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.840
or can all of them receive this realization

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.360
and transmit it to others?

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.960
All of them. All of them can receive.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.520
As long as you are a human being you can get realization.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.600
But there are sometimes very complicated people.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.600
They have had attacks, they have had physical problems,

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.280
mental problems, emotional problems.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.800
There are special category, of course.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.280
There are some people who are a special category.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.440
Maybe you may not find that seeking in some people.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.400
But once you have established a quite a number of people

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.080
who are realized souls, the others will follow them.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.440
So you feel that just being human itself,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.240
just having the human soul and the human body

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.680
is enough for realization?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.440
Enough, enough for realization.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.480
Is that somewhat different than traditional Indian teaching?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.600
It is not different.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.320
But I am different, I think.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.280
Perhaps I am endowed with something special

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.800
that I can do it in a better way, perhaps.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.760
So the karmic process of reincarnation

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.440
and gradual preparation is being speeded up?

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.680
Very much.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.280
But it was long time back when Christ came in.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.640
Actually nobody told us that Christ has come in India.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.280
That's the confusion about.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.520
The way they represented Christ, Christ was not like that.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.280
Christ came on this earth.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.920
His name is Mahavishnu in the Indian scriptures

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.920
and He was to come to suck our sins and our karmas.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.320
And He's placed in a center called Agnya Chakra,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.640
the last center here, sixth, before entering into the,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:13.520
we can say, the Kingdom of God.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.720
This center was the most important one

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.680
where Christ Himself established.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.480
And if He is awakened, He sucks in your karmas.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.000
This is already promised in all the Indian scriptures.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.120
They were waiting for this Mahavishnu to come.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.200
But the missionaries who went with the guns in the one hand

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.400
and the Bible in the other, they never understood Christ.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.160
You see, I don't know what they were talking.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.840
And the way they talked about Christ,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.920
nobody could believe that it was Mahavishnu.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.720
But now when I told them it was Mahavishnu, they are all changed.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.960
Of course, that was Christ and He was Mahavishnu.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.280
He's already come, so you don't have to suffer.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.800
There is nothing like karmas.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.480
In Sahaja Yoga, if you can raise your Kundalini up to that

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.560
and if Christ is awakened, He'll suck it for you.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.520
He's done it already.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.680
He's died for us, for this purpose only.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.080
It's a special type of a very special incarnation

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.640
of the Divine vibrations itself.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.680
I mean, He is an abstract God who came on this earth.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.760
Tremendous personality it was created. He's all written down.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.120
Were you, what was your spiritual training as a young woman?

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.280
What was your family background and when did you feel it?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.520
When did you experience that there may have been something special

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.120
given to you spiritually?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.200
Oh, I am very ancient, you know, so I knew all about it since My birth.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.160
Since babyhood you had a feeling.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.440
Yes, I was quite, I mean, I knew all these things very well.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.800
Was there a particular time that it became active in you?

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.560
Was there an experience of being called to your mission?

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.240
You see, I took birth in a Christian family

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.920
and My father was a very learned man.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.680
He knew 14 languages in Sanskrit and all that he knew.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.360
My mother was another very learned lady.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.520
And they were very

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.880
dharmic, you can call them, very religious and good people.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.600
And when I was born My father himself told Me

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.680
that you have to find out an en masse media,

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.720
a media by which you can give realization to masses.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.320
Because if you start talking about God or doing anything like that,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.600
you'll form another Bible or thing like that,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.000
people may crucify you or do something like that.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.480
So if it becomes a mass thing, which I knew I was to do,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.400
but he also realized it, then only the solution is there.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.680
So you work it out in such a way that you enter in a subtle way

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.200
into the human beings and try to find out what are their problems

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.160
and permutations and combinations of their problems

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.080
and how one can overcome it

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.520
and how the Kundalini can work out in a mass way.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.080
So I worked it out.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.240
I went to all these fake gurus and all these masters, so called,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.360
to find out what do they do and how they work it out.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.720
I worked very hard.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.840
And then they came when I thought, now this is the time.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.840
So at what point in your life did you actually begin teaching,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.520
taking students or actually transmitting spiritual energy?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.960
Actually in 1970, on the 5th of May,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.040
this Sahasrara, the last, you can say, the opening took place.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.640
And after that I started.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.480
But I had only one disciple for some days.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.000
Like that, gradually it moved on.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.280
I could tell that You were speaking in Christian terms,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.640
in an unusual way.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.680
I could sense that You weren't speaking just as an ordinary Hindu.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.840
I mean, it's interesting that You were born in a Christian family.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.440
Of course.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.600
The, the, the, the...

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.080
I am Hindu, Christian, everything.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.360
And You, You, You, You referred to Mohammed Sahib, I think, too.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.600
Yes, I was with him also, what to do.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.920
I was with all of them.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.440
So in, in, in previous lifetimes You, You, You...

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.920
You know, with all of them.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.000
Yes, yes, with all of them, you see.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.840
I've, I've witnessed all that.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.360
That's how I'm such an expert on human beings, I think.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.800
The, the thing which, which I find remarkable about,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.440
about the way You're transmitting spiritual energy is that You,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.960
or the awakening of spiritual energy is that

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.640
Your, Your students tell Me that, that they also

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.160
become able to, to awaken the spiritual energy of another person.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.960
That should be the criteria for everyone, isn't it?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.960
If you do not get anything out of your, your guru,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.920
what's the use of having such a guru there,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.120
who just takes your money, does no work for you and gives you nothing?

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.320
So what's the use of giving all the time? You must get some return.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.520
But,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.240
in the past great teachers have,

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.280
have had only a few disciples

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.480
who were strong enough to,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.080
to also awaken the spiritual energy of other people.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.600
It was enough, it was enough for them just to be able to, to

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.600
transform themselves,

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.960
where it takes great strength not only to transform yourself,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.040
but to, to be, become a, an ocean liner for other people to,

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.400
to, to cross over the ocean.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.320
But that is always in nature also.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.720
If you see there's only one flower on a tree,

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.760
then there are sometimes two, then there are ten,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.600
then there is a blossom time.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.160
You see the time is such, at this time I've come,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.560
and maybe something about Me also,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.960
which one should discover after Realization, isn't it?

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.920
Are Your Mother and Father still living?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.800
No, they are no more now.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.240
I myself sixty years of age.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.240
You look so young, I'm really...

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.440
That's a camouflage.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.520
My daughter is thirty-four now, elder daughter,

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.840
and I have grandchildren.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.680
I, when we were in India recently,

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.880
we were fortunate enough to meet with Anandamayi Ma,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.600
and I just heard that she passed away a couple of months ago.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.480
Hmm.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.960
What good did she do?

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.440
You see, what I'm saying you should see to these people.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.680
She actually got hold of all the bureaucrats of India.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.840
I must tell you the facts as they are.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.440
And the bureaucrats, all those, recently I had one,

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.720
her disciple who was a patient of angina, high blood pressure.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.680
I mean, one can't understand that with

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.480
the spiritual life, how can you have high blood pressure?

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.720
It cannot go hand in hand.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.400
A person who is a realized soul

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.720
must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality, isn't it?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.800
This is how all her disciples come to Me, with some trouble,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.640
mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.440
I can't understand, she couldn't even look after their health.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.560
What was she doing?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:19.160
At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it?

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.960
You call yourself Ma.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.480
What do you do as Ma is a Mother.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.360
At least look after your health.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.720
If a Mother can't look after the health of children,

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.760
I think she's good for nothing.

00:23:37.782 --> 00:23:43.532
Are there any spiritual masters

00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:46.542
in India today that you respect, that you feel are?

00:23:46.592 --> 00:23:47.720
Oh, there are many, many of them.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.680
Many of them they come and see Me,

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.860
but they live in the hideings, I should call that.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.980
There are many.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.700
I asked one of them to come here.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.770
He ran away in three days from New York, believe Me.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.750
Really, it was too much for him.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.150
He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there?

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.740
He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.386
He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.076
He said, they don't understand spirituality,

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:13.990
they only understand dollars.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.110
So it's impossible for him.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.216
They have no patience.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.060
One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.700
They are cut off perhaps, too much.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.700
But they are true, they are true, it's no doubt.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.030
They are not in the market.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.080
They have suffered, one of them suffered so much.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.660
His legs were paralysed, his hands were broken.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.422
And he does not know how to go about, so he has one tiger.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.032
On the tiger he writes, because he says,

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.942
it's better to be on the tiger,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.212
so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.832
We have many.

00:24:50.862 --> 00:24:55.320
Since you are a master of Kundalini,

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.920
I would be interested to know what you are feeling

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.080
about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.960
He was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.080
Who Ramakrishna Parvansi? Not at all. Where was he?

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.600
He gave Realization to no one, did he?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.600
He never gave any Realization to anyone.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.120
How was he master of Kundalini?

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.000
He just played about with everything.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.480
You just listen to him, what he says.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.760
I will say Ramana Maharshi was, because he talked of the Self.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.320
But when did he? Ramakrishna was never.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.560
He was always in separation.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.360
A person who is in separation is not a Realized soul.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.600
It's a simple test.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.040
Anybody who thinks,

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.320
Oh God, when will you meet Me?

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.040
That means he is not a Realized soul.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.440
Supposing I'm in New York, I'm not going to say,

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.600
when are we, am I reaching New York?

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.520
If I'm in New York, I'm in New York.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.760
You see, you must use your brains in judging all the gurus.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.320
Ramakrishna, I would not call him,

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.640
he was a devotee of Devi, is all right.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.880
That was all right. But he was not Realized soul.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.320
If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.000
and shouting and dancing?

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.480
Mataji, thank you very much.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.960
I'm very honored to talk to you, but I think we should go.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.040
They are enamored by Ramakrishna now. What to do?

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.320
What has Ramakrishna given to anyone?

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.640
Just look at that.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.880
In all respect and love, this is the God.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.920
No, my child, you must understand,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.120
the people of Ramakrishna are suffering from cancer today.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.320
He suffered from cancer himself.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.040
This is the trouble with these people.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.640
It's better you are on the tape.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.030
Just tell me.

00:26:35.045 --> 00:26:39.265
Now what has Ramakrishna, he himself suffered from cancer.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.510
Now I cannot tell them the truth.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.615
And Ramakrishna, master of Kundalini,

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.505
whom did he give Realization?

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.760
Why are they so false? They are not honest people.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.680
Now what have I to tell them?

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.020
Should I tell them the truth or not? You tell them.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.580
It has to be the truth.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.560
This is it! You see they don't want to face the truth.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.500
They are dishonest.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:23.500
I mean Ramakrishna has done no good, their people are suffering from cancer today.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.500
They are identified.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.500
You tell him, you tell him that I was there and why did you, you see they were all sick people.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:44.500
All left sided they have got cancers. What are they doing, why don't they understand these people?

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:57.593
They are taking part, he's all right, he was a follower of God, he's all right. I didn't say anything against but he was not a realized soul, definitely he was crying.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:04.477
It's a fact, I mean you read it, he looks like a sick man himself, he died of cancer.

00:28:09.357 --> 00:28:19.823
Let it be now what to do. I mean it's impossible with these people, they are dishonest, they are dishonest people.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:29.923
But you can publish it Mother. In this case he may walk out but you can publish it, a magazine will publish everything you said and be very glad to have the article

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.784
because people will read what they cannot stand the minute they get the impact of it but they will read it.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.934
And it will sink in and prepare the way by the written word.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.738
This is a fact, what I told you is a fact. You can read him, he's just trying all the time, where is my Mother, where is my Mother.

00:28:45.798 --> 00:28:51.370
What is there to follow a man who is not in realization?

00:28:51.500 --> 00:29:01.919
How can I support a wrong thing? What does it, it's nice to say good things about people to get them more into it but he cannot say this about Ram Krishna

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:08.209
because people are suffering too much. They are sick, all of them are sick people, you go and see them

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.260
because there are doctors, they want the doctors to prosper so they have to create sick people.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.500
If he had waited I would have told him, he should go and see what's happening to the Ram Krishna people.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.500
And first thing they get is cancer of the throat.

00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:29.467
He just walked off, see, he couldn't bear it.

00:29:31.022 --> 00:29:33.142
There are many who want to know the truth.

00:29:33.192 --> 00:29:36.852
All right, doesn't matter. So what is he, he was going to give it on the TV or something?

00:29:36.932 --> 00:29:39.412
Radio.

00:29:40.382 --> 00:29:43.462
Oh, it's all right because he's frightening.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:49.286
He should see. He will not now, he doesn't want to have it.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:57.396
There is a very strong attachment and feeling for the people that were a part of that particular lineage

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.500
and he's done, he's invested a great deal of devotion in the direction of that activity.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.500
In where?

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.500
Shri Ram Krishna and other people have come after him.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.500
That's it, he must understand he was not a realized soul, you see. Give him a bad man, let him realize it.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.448
He was not a realized soul, you see, because people are sick.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.500
Actually Mother, I was…

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
You should have told Me about it.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:31.541
When I first met him, it was a couple of years ago, he looked like a fellow in his early twenties.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.401
He looked like a fellow in his early twenties when I met him just a couple of years ago and I was amazed to see him.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.374
He's looked at him? He looks sick?

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.420
I couldn't believe that he changed so.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:45.450
I don't know how old he is but he looked…

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:52.500
Imagine he said, I look so young. What about Ram Krishna himself? He used to look an haggard old dying man.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:03.500
This is the way they are identified. They are not honest, they should be honest. That's the main thing. They are not honest people.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:11.500
You see, the strength is honesty. If you don't have that strength within you, of honesty, you cannot stand the truth. That's the point is.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:22.466
You may telephone and tell him this, that you see there's nothing to be so upset about it because what Mother says is true.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:31.281
We have patience from him. Mother is curing them, she has to cure. He's not coming down here to cure people. Himself is sick.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:41.500
I didn't say anything. I mean if you can again say what is going on, just say. What did I say exactly about Ram Krishna?

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:50.648
Let's re-see it. It's nothing bad. I didn't say he's a bad man or anything but he was not a realized soul, it was a fact.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.500
They have deified him. They have deified him in a way. They follow him.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:03.500
A person who is a realized soul must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality. Isn't it?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:10.500
This is how all her disciples come to Me with some trouble, mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.500
I can't understand. She couldn't even look after their health. What does she do?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:23.500
At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it? You call yourself Ma.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.500
What you do as Ma is a Mother. At least look after your health.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:34.500
If your Mother can't look after the health of children, I think it's good for nothing. Is it? Is it?

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:48.500
Are there any, are there any spiritual masters in India today that you respect, that you feel are?

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:56.500
Oh, there are many, many of them. Many of them they come and see Me but they live in the high books, I should call that.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.500
They have many. I asked one of them to come here, he ran away.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.500
He, it was so much fun. He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there? He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:14.500
He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here. He said, they don't understand. The spirituality they only understand dollars.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:22.500
It's impossible for him. They have no patience. One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings. They have got all their hands.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.500
But they are true, they are true, they are not in the market.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:36.464
They have suffered, one of them suffered so much. His legs were paralyzed, his hands were broken

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:42.500
and he does not know how to go about so he has one tiger. On the tiger he likes.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.500
Because he says, it's better to be on the tiger so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500
There are many.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:34:01.500
Since you are a master of Kundalini, I would be interested to know if you were feeling about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.500
Shri Ramakrishna was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.366
Who Ramakrishna Paramahansa? Not at all, very much. He gave Realization to [?], did he?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:18.500
He never gave any Realization to anyone. How was he master of Kundalini? He just played about with everything.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.500
You just listen to him, what he says. I will say Ramana Maharshi was because he talked of the Self.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:32.500
But when did he? Ramakrishna was never. He was always in separation. A person who is in separation is not Realized.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:39.500
So it's a simple test. Anybody who thinks, oh God, when will you meet Me? That means he is not a Realized soul.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.500
Supposing I am in New York, I am not going to say, when are we, am I reaching New York? If I am in New York, I am in New York.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.500
You see you must use your brains in judging all the gurus. Ramakrishna, I would not call him, he was a devotee of Devi, he is alright.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:00.500
That was alright. But he was not Realized soul. If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping and shouting and all that?

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:06.500
I said thank you very much. I am very honored to talk to you with you.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:13.500
What did he say? I am honored to have spoke to you but we have to go. He is afraid.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.500
And he left at 10.47. 10.40 I think.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.500
Mother, when you have time, I have an interview all written. When you have time, I have an interview all written.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:33.910
We put it on a tape and we use it in the radio station in Boston. Is it? It's all done and if they can tape it for Me, then I have the answers on the tape.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:40.500
Alright, you would like to send this one or you would like to have another one? Perhaps both. Can they can the radio? You ask Me other questions, I think.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:46.500
Yes, I have My own questions. Yes, questions would be better. When should we do? You don't want to take a tape out of that.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:55.444
I can do it now, if you want to do it now, if you want to rest, I can do it later. No, why not have a tape? If you have to send it to Boston, then you have a tape ready.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.500
And they get them to come down and I said I would call them as soon as you came and we know how much time you had.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.500
Alright, we can do it now. It's good, you have more time to.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:14.403
I thought it was a wonderful interview. I don't understand if it is so fair. No, no, no, no, you see, he was trying to aiming at that, you see.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:22.500
But no, he came with that purpose. His void was horrid, his stomach was wobbling, completely wobbling, poor fellow was nervous, he couldn't look at Me.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:29.444
And left, left the machine and left to understand.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:36.500
It's a fact, you know, whatever I am saying, you see, if the disciples are so very sick, he himself is sick, that woman is sick,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.500
when he'll get troubles he'll come to Me, I know.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:50.500
You see, the problem of it is that there are these people that have the ear of the public are targets.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:37:01.434
You see, major targets and they are attacked regularly, you see, and what they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them.

00:37:01.504 --> 00:37:08.500
Is what? It's allities? What they think is spirituality, what they think is real, is just something that's invading them in order to get the ear of the public,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:20.453
in order to get the attention of the public. He has a very large listening audience and so this, which is the mecca for the bhoots,

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:27.500
you know, in this world but this country in particular, perhaps, his particular program is one voice

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:36.500
that I would think the bhoots in the area would want to have silenced or at least under their control. There are

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:43.500
He got upset when I said I was Christian, I tell you, because what Ramakrishna was, he was against Christians

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:51.500
and specially Vivekananda was very much against Christianity and Christians and you know, just to outwit them he started this missionary work.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:59.500
You see, in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work, is called as the worst of all, is the menial work. You see, he is not certain

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:07.500
Brahmins, you see, this missionary work because the first concept is wrong that somebody is the other who to emancipate you are,

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:15.500
you, if you are the Spirit then you don't have to help anybody, it is just you are part and parcel that you are helping, you see, so the whole idea is regarded as Shubra,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:23.500
is regarded as low, this is menial according to Indian philosophy, you see, and that's exactly started just like all the,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:31.500
if he had said here I would have told him all about it. He started this idea, this, what's his name, Ramakrishna

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:38.500
of the missionary work but the one who really gave it a shape was his disciple Vivekananda.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:45.500
He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that, all kinds of things, you know, horrible people.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:53.500
They are extremely money minded, extremely gregarious, all kinds of problems they have.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:02.740
There's no transformation, nothing. Whom did he transform? I mean you must face it.

00:39:05.655 --> 00:39:12.500
This is the point. Now if this person, he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family, I can tell you.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:21.500
They couldn't take it. They are against Christ. All of them are against Christ.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:27.500
They don't believe in Christianity as Christ, this thing, take it from Me. This is the reason.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.500
Is it a government radio he is operating?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.500
No, it's a listener sponsored radio.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500
Is owned?

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.500
A listener sponsored, he works on the station, it's called WBAI.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500
Who owns them?

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.500
The, it's owned by the people that's, that's supported.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.500
By the same people?

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.500
By the public.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500
By the public?

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.500
It's publicly maintained.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.500
Is the public?

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.500
Yes, the public sends money in. The government gives a very, very small part if anything now.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.500
Oh, sorry, the public is doing it?

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500
The public, yes.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.500
Now the, means a private man must be doing somebody who must have put in the money, must have started?

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.500
No, actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:12.500
But who is, I mean there must be somebody, we can do it now. It's good, you have more time to.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.500
I thought it was a wonderful interview, I don't understand, it could be so fair.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.500
No, no, no, no, you see he was trying to aiming at that, you see.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.500
But now he came with that purpose.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:30.500
His void was horrid, his stomach was wobbling, completely wobbling, poor fellow was nervous, couldn't look at Me.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:37.500
And left, left, left, left, left, what is the time?

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:44.500
It's a fact, you know, whatever I'm saying, you see, if the disciples are so very sick, he himself is sick, that woman is sick,

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.500
when he'll get troubles he'll come to Me, I know.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:59.500
You see, the problem of it is that there are these people that have the ear of the public are targets,

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:08.500
you see, major targets and they are attacked regularly, you see, and what they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500
Is what?

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:19.500
What they think is spirituality, what they think is real, is just something that is invading them in order to get the ear of the public, in order to get the attention of the public.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:29.500
He has a very large listening audience, which is the mecca for the boots in this world,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:39.500
but this country in particular, perhaps his particular program is one voice that I would think the boots in the area want to have silenced,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.500
or at least under their control. There are

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:51.500
He got upset when I said I was Christian, I tell you, because what Ramakrishna was, he was against Christians

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:59.500
and specially Vivekananda, he was very much against Christianity and Christians and you know, just to outwit them he started this missionary work.

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:05.500
You see, in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work, is called as the worst of all, is the menial work.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:12.500
You see, he is not some done bramblings, you see, this missionary work, because the first concept is wrong, that somebody is the other

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:21.500
whom to emancipate, you are, if you are the Spirit then you don't have to help anybody, it is just you are part and parcel that you are helping, you see,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:28.500
so the whole idea is regarded as Shubra, is regarded as low, this is a menial, according to Indian philosophy, you see,

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:35.500
and that's exactly started just like all the, if he had said here I would have told him all about it. He started this idea,

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:46.500
this, what's his name, Ramakrishna, of the missionary work, but the one who really gave it a shape was his disciple Vivekananda.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:52.500
He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that, all kinds of things, you know, horrible people.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:43:01.500
They are extremely money minded, extremely gregarious, all kinds of problems they have.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.500
There's no transformation, nothing. Whom did he transform? I mean you must face it.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:19.500
This is the point. Now if this person, he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family, I can tell you.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:28.500
They couldn't take it. They are against Christ. All of them are against Christ.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:34.500
They don't believe in Christianity as Christ this thing, take it from them. This is the reason.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.500
Is it a government radio he is operating?

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:41.500
No, it's a listener sponsored radio.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.500
Is old?

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.500
A listener sponsored, he works on the station, it's called WBAI.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.500
Who owns them?

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.500
The, it's owned by the people that support it.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.500
By the same people?

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.500
By the public.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.500
By the public?

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.500
It's publicly maintained.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.500
Is the public?

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:01.500
Yes, the public sends money in. The government gives a very, very small part if anything now.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.500
Oh, sir, the public is doing it?

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.500
The public, yes.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:09.500
Now the, this is a private man must be doing somebody who must have put in the money, must have started?

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.500
No, actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.500
But who is, I mean there must be somebody who is in charge and this and that.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.500
But they have different managers.

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:24.500
You see, then you can write to them that this man is a follower of Ram Krishna

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.500
who was against Christianity, who was against Christ and that's why when Mother said it, he was upset. Why not write to them?

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.500
You see, he must be having bosses also.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.500
He has free hand in what kind of program?

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:41.500
Whatever it is but you can point it out that he's biased, he's not open minded.

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.500
If he's doing public work.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.500
Not in that sense, not in that sense.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:52.500
He has a strong support for Christianity and mainline Christianity as far as that's concerned.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:45:01.500
He's had several purely Christian figures, Catholic figures as well as general Christians.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.500
Then why was he only because of Ram Krishna being criticized?

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.500
Yes.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:07.500
So that means he cannot be a biased person.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:11.500
You see, in a democratic country you should give chance to everyone.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.500
He should have discussed instead of giving.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.500
In his mind Ram Krishna is synonymous with a perfect incarnation of God.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:22.500
All right, whatever it is but you can't use your mind for a public work.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.500
You see, you must give chance to everyone under a democratic country.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.500
It must be pointed out to the public somehow.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.500
You cannot, I mean he cannot propagate Ram Krishna.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:38.500
He cannot put his ideas into my head.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.500
I mean he is a public servant.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.500
You both have equal rights.

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.500
In that situation you both have equal rights.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.500
Equal rights, he's a public man.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.500
If he's a public servant, he has no business.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.500
I think it should be pointed out to someone there, up there.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.500
He's above you.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.500
Who brought him here?

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.500
You.

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.500
I did not, I'm sorry.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500
I didn't realize.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.500
When did he meet you?

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.500
I never did.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:10.500
I just knew that he ran a radio program for seekers so I called him up and asked him

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.500
if he wanted to come interview you and he said yes.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:18.500
So you should go and see his, his superiors and you should see he's got, he's having a thing for seekers.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:23.500
He is a person who doesn't take any money, has done so much good and she's saying something same

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.500
and this fellow just left.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.500
Is this the man who's doing good to, why not go see his superiors?

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.500
He's acting as a censor.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:30.500
Huh?

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.500
He's censoring you.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.500
He's censoring a public.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.500
Was he?

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.500
He's censoring you.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.500
He's acting as a censor.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.500
Cutting people off from part of the truth.

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.500
Yes.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.500
His own president.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.500
He's not censoring.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.500
Yes, that's the point.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:42.500
He's censoring.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.500
He can't just do it.

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.500
You see, you should, you should all write.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.500
Yes.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.500
You are all citizens of this country.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500
You can all write.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.500
We have a big group of them in Boston and they are all sick.

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:55.500
They have kidney troubles, they have hypoglycemia, they have almost every disease.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.500
You should write.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.500
You see, why not say, why not write that I was present at the, thank God you were all

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.500
here and Mother was, never said anything against him but she said she, he was not a realized

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.500
soul and Mother has a right to say that and he just walked off.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.500
How can he do it?

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.500
It's better.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.500
To pursue the matter.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.500
To bring him down.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.500
You see, he may believe into anything.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.500
You may believe into ghosts.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.500
So what?

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500
Everybody has a right to say what they want.

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.500
This is a free country or it's a, what sort of a country is this?

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.500
If we had someone to introduce Mother, it would, it's the table.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.500
All right.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.500
Which?

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.500
I'll have some water.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.500
But.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500
Well, that's for the other end of the year.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500
Yes, because it's a free country.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.500
But someone to introduce Mother.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.500
But he would be sitting here?

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.500
All right?

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:20.500
No, you sit here, because he will have to go away, won't he?

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.500
After introducing.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.500
But he can sit there, just.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:27.500
What did you like about the way the introduction?

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:34.500
He's looking rather worried now.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.500
He gets very angry, isn't he?

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.500
You, because he's a journalist, that's why.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.500
You see why he's angry?

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.500
Because his clan has mis-piailed.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.500
But they are all like that.

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.500
I must tell you, horrible people.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.500
I mean he's a journalist, he's a public man.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.500
He has no business to have his own opinion.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.500
You see, very bad journalism.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.500
You better get a letter from him.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.500
Very bad journalism.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:05.500
You cannot be biased, you have to be a witness.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:15.500
That means he's trying to attract every one of them to his clan.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.500
If you are upset, let us some say something.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.500
You better introduce.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:23.500
He's looking so upset of this place.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:24.500
This journalist.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:29.500
I thought it was good to see, they're so afraid.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:33.500
They're so afraid when they hear the truth, because that's the reaction we've gotten in Boston.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.500
They're afraid when they hear the truth, especially about the false gurus.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.500
That's it.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.500
My,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:48.500
On the floor, on the right hand side, at the door.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.500
I'll give you the introduction and you can just add anything you like to it.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:59.500
It seems Mother this is not, this is typical in the sense that

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:04.500
the usual outlets, the usual newspapers and so on,

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.500
are really primarily interested in those areas of power and money.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.500
That is really what

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.500
So that I can understand. That I can understand.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.500
That is the area that I think we've got to move into.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.500
No, no, that I can understand, but I can't understand this.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:21.500
That's what I can say. This is the other, where

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.500
You see, you cannot, you cannot have your own ideas

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.500
and your own identifications

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:34.500
so much that you cannot bear anything else.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.500
It seems that people are

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.500
are placed, these sort of people who have an interest

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.500
They are, they are biased. They are a placed and

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.500
They are placed and then of course the bias

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.500
What you call them? A vested interest.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.500
Yes, yes.

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:54.500
Wested interest, you see. Wested interest is the word.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.500
Mother, I don't want that. He left it by watch.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.500
I think he left it by watch.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.500
He left it, he took your watch.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.500
He was holding a hand.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.500
I hope he'll return it.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.500
He'll return, no doubt, but good, your watch has gone with him.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.500
It will do some good to him.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.500
He didn't even have a watch with himself.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.500
What sort of an interviewer he is?

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:26.500
Now so, would you introduce?

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.500
No, no, I would say that is he going to come in the film or not?

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.500
Just now he is very upset and angry.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.500
No, no, I don't think it's just sound.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.500
It's sound, is it?

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:38.500
Because if they like this then they can come down tomorrow

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.500
and do it themselves with their own television.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:42.500
No, no, no.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.500
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now,

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.500
please, please, please avoid sound.

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.500
I'll have some water please.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.500
Unless you are…

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.500
Little warm.

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.500
…it is fine.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.500
It's all right, it's all right.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.500
It's the water here, thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you.
