00:09.920 --> 00:25.900
The organizers and the members of the Medical
Association in Sholapur, its such a pleasure

00:25.900 --> 00:37.680
to talk to (* inaudible text) because you
have also heard that I did some medicine.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.880
Just to talk to doctors about it.

00:42.880 --> 00:48.980
Because in the realm of the divine, there
are no names given to any plexuses.

00:48.980 --> 00:55.270
It’s difficult to talk to doctors unless
and until you know their language.

00:55.270 --> 01:08.369
Now the main thing we have to understand about
Sahaja yogi is this that when we are trying

01:08.369 --> 01:18.080
to analyze or find out through scientific
methods anything, we can only do it when that

01:18.080 --> 01:25.390
part is available to us, apparent to us, that
we can see it, we can feel it, we can analyze

01:25.390 --> 01:26.390
it.

01:26.390 --> 01:30.520
Like a tree, we see the tree on top of the
Mother Earth.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.200
For us it is easy to see the tree.

01:34.200 --> 01:41.119
But supposing we have to go deep down into
the roots.

01:41.119 --> 01:45.200
So Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots
and not of the tree.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.259
Of Course, the tree is very important because
root has no meaning if there is no tree.

01:50.259 --> 01:59.880
But tree is more important when it can tell
you that there are roots to it.

01:59.880 --> 02:06.780
So all our knowledge of science whatever it
is, whatever discoveries we have made, how

02:06.780 --> 02:07.780
far we have gone?

02:07.780 --> 02:10.470
I mean we can go very deep into it, I know
that.

02:10.470 --> 02:13.740
But still, you can not reach the absolute.

02:13.740 --> 02:19.870
Because “absolute” is that point where
you have to dissolve.

02:19.870 --> 02:27.330
We have one scholar here, who is doing his
P.H.D from Brighton and he has a subject how

02:27.330 --> 02:31.840
to establish an absolute zero point in temperature.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.590
You can not.

02:33.590 --> 02:34.840
Nobody can.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.720
Its a fact.

02:36.720 --> 02:41.510
You can go up to a point but you can not become
the absolute.

02:41.510 --> 02:47.040
Through your mental projection because the
mind is a limited thing.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.569
We must understand the mind is limited.

02:48.569 --> 02:53.330
Like I came by car, I had to leave my car
behind to come inside.

02:53.330 --> 02:58.890
In the same way this limited mind can not
take you to something that is unlimited.

02:58.890 --> 03:01.209
Because absolute has to be unlimited.

03:01.209 --> 03:06.140
So to reach the absolute point what should
be done.

03:06.140 --> 03:09.640
That’s the main problem with all of us.

03:09.640 --> 03:16.239
All those who are seekers, whether they are
scientists or psychologists or anyway.

03:16.239 --> 03:20.629
They have one point if they see correctly
that we have not reached the absolute.

03:20.629 --> 03:27.440
That is why we do not understand “why are
we made human beings from amoeba state?”

03:27.440 --> 03:31.670
We should ask ourselves a simple question,”why
are we human beings?

03:31.670 --> 03:37.760
What was the purpose of this evolution that
we were made human beings?

03:37.760 --> 03:43.599
So, as we can’t answer this question it
is not answerable.

03:43.599 --> 03:51.769
We have to know that we are in a transition
state and this human awareness has to achieve

03:51.769 --> 03:59.019
another awareness which is dynamic, which
is collective in nature and many people I

03:59.019 --> 04:03.200
would say like you, who has talked of collectivity.

04:03.200 --> 04:13.810
Who has talked of collective awareness that
a man, if he evolves, will become a collectively

04:13.810 --> 04:14.810
conscious.

04:14.810 --> 04:18.750
He could see that but he did not know how.

04:18.750 --> 04:23.660
Even if you have to say that if you have to
go to Sholapur you better take this road or

04:23.660 --> 04:29.460
that road but if you can not reach Sholapur
then you are not there in Sholapur.

04:29.460 --> 04:35.430
So even if you say this is the way it has
to be, unless and until somebody does it in

04:35.430 --> 04:40.139
a practical way, in actualization you have
to achieve it.

04:40.139 --> 04:41.319
This is the problem.

04:41.319 --> 04:46.970
Actual this is the problem, that exist between
all the people who are seeking, between all

04:46.970 --> 04:52.220
the enterprises, between all the moment we
have.

04:52.220 --> 04:56.130
There is no quarrel between God and Science.

04:56.130 --> 05:00.670
One thing one should remember that Science
has come from God to you.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.590
It has not come from you.

05:02.590 --> 05:04.870
For example, if you say there is gravity.

05:04.870 --> 05:08.930
Now, you have not put gravity in the Mother
Earth, did you?

05:08.930 --> 05:14.020
We can not even transform one flower into
a fruit.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.830
Not one flower into fruit.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.190
Can you imagine?

05:17.190 --> 05:21.259
So there is some living power which is doing
this living job.

05:21.259 --> 05:27.849
Now think an Indian has a child he is an Indian,
this sorting out is done.

05:27.849 --> 05:33.560
You know that any foreign matter that goes
into the body is thrown away.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.669
Has to be thrown away.

05:34.669 --> 05:40.300
But when the fetus is conceived, then it is
kept, nourished, properly looked after and

05:40.300 --> 05:44.580
is thrown out at the right time.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.240
Who does that job?

05:46.240 --> 05:48.490
We must think.

05:48.490 --> 05:56.310
There are so many things for example acidic
(* unclear text- some medical name) of course

05:56.310 --> 06:00.240
doctors, I must say or scientists are honest.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.650
So they say, their mode of action in human
body they can not explain.

06:03.650 --> 06:07.340
They just openly say if they can not.

06:07.340 --> 06:11.020
Because it may augment or it may not.

06:11.020 --> 06:14.699
But Sahaja yoga can explain, why it happens.

06:14.699 --> 06:19.330
Why it has to happen like that.

06:19.330 --> 06:27.139
Now the jumping from this knowledge from the
mind into the knowledge of the eternal is

06:27.139 --> 06:28.360
a difficult task.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
To accept it.

06:29.360 --> 06:35.659
Because as doctor (*unclear text) has told
you that when we get education we think we

06:35.659 --> 06:38.090
know quite a lot.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.919
Not that you do not know.

06:39.919 --> 06:41.551
Not that, this knowledge is not needed.

06:41.551 --> 06:42.551
Its very important.

06:42.551 --> 06:45.009
If you are a doctor, you will be a great sahaja
yogi.

06:45.009 --> 06:46.009
No doubt.

06:46.009 --> 06:52.349
But something is not known to you which is
much greater than what is known to you.

06:52.349 --> 07:00.849
So this human awareness, this “chetna”
that is within you today has to rise to that

07:00.849 --> 07:07.379
level or you have to become that subtle that
you can enter into your roots.

07:07.379 --> 07:08.379
Alright?

07:08.379 --> 07:14.780
So on this point we start moving further that
you are paying attention to me but if I say

07:14.780 --> 07:16.900
pay attention to yourself.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.610
You can not.

07:18.610 --> 07:21.449
How will you do it.

07:21.449 --> 07:22.449
You can not do it.

07:22.449 --> 07:24.960
You can not see your self, you can not see
your organs, you can not see your body, you

07:24.960 --> 07:29.439
can not see anything, you can not see your
mind.

07:29.439 --> 07:33.050
You can not feel it.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.090
So what should happen?

07:36.090 --> 07:40.599
Say something falls down, immediately our
attention goes there.

07:40.599 --> 07:47.139
Some happening has to take place within ourselves
and that happening is nothing but kundalini

07:47.139 --> 07:49.909
awakening.

07:49.909 --> 07:56.530
Now this kundalini is a force which is lying
in the triangular bone which is called as

07:56.530 --> 07:57.530
sacrum.

07:57.530 --> 08:04.530
(Shri Mataji asks for some water in hindi/marathi)
I have been speaking and speaking and hours

08:04.530 --> 08:13.460
and hours together.

08:13.460 --> 08:17.210
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum.

08:17.210 --> 08:19.110
Sacrum means sacred.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.050
In greek language, sacrum means sacred.

08:21.050 --> 08:26.509
When I went to Greece, I asked them why do
you call it sacrum?

08:26.509 --> 08:34.640
So they told me that they had a rapport with
Indians much much before, Alexander came here

08:34.640 --> 08:40.780
and the Indians told them that there is a
power in this triangular bone.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.130
Can you imagine?

08:42.130 --> 08:49.730
We have forgotten it, we have lost it because
we have studied only the british or whatever

08:49.730 --> 08:53.820
is english or you can call it a western medical
science.

08:53.820 --> 08:59.630
But in our science, you will be surprised,
fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has

08:59.630 --> 09:01.520
talked about it.

09:01.520 --> 09:09.010
We Indians are best suited to understand this.

09:09.010 --> 09:14.790
Now many people say that Mahasrashtra has
got three and a half “pithas”.

09:14.790 --> 09:20.480
Many people must have heard there are three
and a half “pithas” one of them is “Mahalaxmi”,

09:20.480 --> 09:29.650
then another is “Tulzapur Bhavani” then
third one is “Mahur” and half one is “Chaturshringi”.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.560
Now (*unclear text) something so funny and
stupid.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.910
I mean, I can undertand as doctors.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.770
But its not.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.010
Believe me.

09:40.010 --> 09:44.160
These are the three and a half coils of the
kundalini of the whole universe placed in

09:44.160 --> 09:45.720
your Maharashtra.

09:45.720 --> 10:00.150
They are the source of that power within your
own country this great Maharashtra.

10:00.150 --> 10:04.130
Now people may not believe it.

10:04.130 --> 10:08.790
But how will you know?

10:08.790 --> 10:15.370
Now, somebody says “this is a “jagrut
sthana” (means awakened place) I mean doctors

10:15.370 --> 10:16.370
do namaskar to Ganesha and they go to temple
and all.

10:16.370 --> 10:25.530
But they do not know that Ganesha is placed
within us and he controls our prostate and

10:25.530 --> 10:27.810
he controls all our pelvic plexuses.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.910
We do not know this.

10:30.910 --> 10:35.660
But he resides there.

10:35.660 --> 10:46.200
So to jump from that to this is rather difficult
for a medical man, I understand that.

10:46.200 --> 10:51.630
(unclear/inaudible text) who were studying
with me I never talk to them about Kundalini

10:51.630 --> 10:52.630
or anything.

10:52.630 --> 10:55.380
I just wanted to be like them to understand
how their brains have worked.

10:55.380 --> 10:59.530
For them, this is knowledge, this is everything,
nothing beyond.

10:59.530 --> 11:05.070
And anybody who talks about it they turn faces
like that.

11:05.070 --> 11:11.320
Now I do not want you to come to any conclusion
by saying of course Gyaneshwara has talked

11:11.320 --> 11:16.350
about it so he can not be wrong and this and
that.

11:16.350 --> 11:18.570
Not at all.

11:18.570 --> 11:28.580
But scientifically, we have to understand
that we have not got answers to many questions.

11:28.580 --> 11:33.560
That means there is no sufficient light, in
our knowledge.

11:33.560 --> 11:38.500
If you are coming in this room in darkness
you might find a mic, you might find a table,

11:38.500 --> 11:40.010
you might find something.

11:40.010 --> 11:41.800
This becomes the truth.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.170
Because the eyes are not yet opened or the
light is not there.

11:45.170 --> 11:50.250
But supposing by any chance, somebody can
open the light, you can see all the things.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.250
Isn’t it?

11:51.250 --> 11:56.720
That what doctor Berjodi ji is talking about
the integration part.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.650
Now this light is nothing but your auto.

11:58.650 --> 12:02.380
Which you talk of as “Autonomous Nervous
System”.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.800
You just give the name, Auto.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.410
Now, who is auto?

12:06.410 --> 12:07.620
We accept it.

12:07.620 --> 12:13.400
When we get the names, we just accept the
name, we never ask why it is called auto.

12:13.400 --> 12:20.240
Because it is “swayamchalit” (which runs
by itself) who is the swayam?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.790
Who is the “sw” is the spirit.

12:22.790 --> 12:28.380
In a way, we have accepted because we have
to fix somebody as auto otherwise we don’t

12:28.380 --> 12:29.380
know what to do.

12:29.380 --> 12:34.830
I mean, we see parasympathetic working, sympathetic
working so we have to fix up somebody as a

12:34.830 --> 12:38.590
person behind the two.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.910
But that auto is the spirit, is the “atma”,
we do not want to accept.

12:41.910 --> 12:42.910
Alright.

12:42.910 --> 12:43.910
We will call it auto if you don’t like it.

12:43.910 --> 12:47.730
For the scientist, if they don’t like it
we will call it auto only.

12:47.730 --> 12:52.160
So this Mr. auto, is the atma according to
Sahaja Yoga.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.650
We call it atma, you call it auto.

12:54.650 --> 12:58.680
That’s the only difference of names.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.560
Now this auto exists within us.

13:01.560 --> 13:06.020
But this auto is not in our central nervous
system.

13:06.020 --> 13:07.020
That is true.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.220
Because we can not control our parasympathetic.

13:10.220 --> 13:18.010
We may be able to excite our sympathetic but
not the parasympathetic, that’s the fact.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.290
Sympathetic, if we excite, it, we can work
out.

13:21.290 --> 13:23.790
But parasympathetic we can not work out.

13:23.790 --> 13:26.170
It works automatically.

13:26.170 --> 13:31.820
So somehow or other, if you can bring that
auto in your attention or in your central

13:31.820 --> 13:37.090
nervous system then you can manage the show
better.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.870
Scientifically.

13:38.870 --> 13:41.090
I am just going scientifically.

13:41.090 --> 13:42.090
Alright.

13:42.090 --> 13:45.810
Now, how to bring this auto in your attention?

13:45.810 --> 13:47.040
How to control this auto?

13:47.040 --> 13:49.630
Is the problem.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.270
You can not do through science.

13:51.270 --> 13:53.150
You can not do through medical science.

13:53.150 --> 13:55.340
Through any science you can not do.

13:55.340 --> 13:59.560
Because this will only happen when you will
evolve to another stage.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.730
And science can not bring in evolution.

14:01.730 --> 14:02.730
Can it?

14:02.730 --> 14:07.160
It can not give you wisdom and it can not
give you evolution.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.300
Evolution it can not give.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.330
Why?

14:12.330 --> 14:22.660
It can not even create life, I would say.

14:22.660 --> 14:30.220
So this auto, to be in your central nervous
system we should look inside ourselves.

14:30.220 --> 14:39.320
There could be some arrangement and for that
the knowledge is in your great country.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.240
Already there.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.090
You are the one who have inherited that (unclear
text).

14:45.090 --> 14:48.810
This is what you have inherited.

14:48.810 --> 14:53.150
It is your inheritance which is lost.

14:53.150 --> 14:59.190
But one must know that when the tree grows
too high it must have roots.

14:59.190 --> 15:03.670
And that is how, whatever they are saying
about me..I am the tap root, I must say.

15:03.670 --> 15:08.870
Who has done the seeking inside perhaps or
I have reached at source and that’s how

15:08.870 --> 15:11.850
I know what is the root.

15:11.850 --> 15:19.200
In our country, many saints have tried to
go through that path and have found out.

15:19.200 --> 15:23.820
They have tried to express it in many ways
but they kept it a secret till the sixth century

15:23.820 --> 15:27.570
when Adi Shankaracharya came and he talked
about it very clearly.

15:27.570 --> 15:33.220
He talked about kundalini, he talked about
all the chakras, he talked about everything.

15:33.220 --> 15:35.830
But who reads Adi Shankaracharya.

15:35.830 --> 15:39.600
Atleast the medical man does not.

15:39.600 --> 15:47.880
I mean, I don’t blame them because they
are so busy.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.940
And after that it was all exposed.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.890
Then Kabira clearly, clearly, clearly absolutely
clearly talked about it.

15:52.890 --> 15:56.330
So Sahaja yoga is not a new system.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.390
It is “Anadi”, it is old.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.830
Only thing, what has happened to Sahaja Yoga
today that it has become a “Mahayoga”.

16:02.830 --> 16:07.140
That there are many many thousands can get
realization.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.600
That was not possible and feasible.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.890
This is the only thing that has happened that
today the blossom time has come and many flowers

16:14.890 --> 16:17.760
can become fruits.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.080
And that’s how even an ordinary person gets
self realization.

16:21.080 --> 16:25.750
A poor man can get realization, a doctor can
get realization.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.480
Anybody can get realization.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.450
And sooner you get the better it is.

16:31.450 --> 16:35.290
So now the first thing what will happen to
you.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.850
Supposing you get the light within yourself
and you can see within yourself.

16:37.850 --> 16:41.440
Say you have an X-ray to see yourself within
yourself.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
So first thing that should happen to you is
that you should know about yourself, what’s

16:45.440 --> 16:47.970
the problem with you.

16:47.970 --> 16:54.340
You’ll be amazed people end up in lunatic
asylums and till they are absolutely gone

16:54.340 --> 16:57.870
cases people do not know that they are mad.

16:57.870 --> 16:58.870
Same about cancer.

16:58.870 --> 17:04.030
I would say, cancer can be detected much earlier
than doctors can detect it.

17:04.030 --> 17:07.589
Very simple it is.

17:07.589 --> 17:10.750
Any disease connected with liver is another
thing.

17:10.750 --> 17:16.429
I would say even liver problems are not detected
till a patient gets a cirrhosis or some sort

17:16.429 --> 17:24.529
of a disease which is absolutely fatal and
you declare alright, now you go into coma.

17:24.529 --> 17:25.529
Finished!

17:25.529 --> 17:30.470
These can be detected through Sahaja Yoga
very well because once you are enlightened,

17:30.470 --> 17:31.600
your fingers.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.669
These five fingers, six and seven (ShriMataji
describes the chakras on her palm) They start

17:35.669 --> 17:36.669
denoting the centers.

17:36.669 --> 17:38.049
And on these fingers you can know.

17:38.049 --> 17:44.919
Now according to Sahaja Yoga left side deals,
left side sympathetic deals with your emotional

17:44.919 --> 17:48.750
side and right side deals with physical and
mental side.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.750
Clearcut.

17:49.750 --> 17:54.919
So now you see a person who is very busy.

17:54.919 --> 17:58.259
Who is a doctor, say for example.

17:58.259 --> 18:05.090
He is a very busy man and he has no time at
all.

18:05.090 --> 18:08.039
He is always looking at his watch, naturally.

18:08.039 --> 18:09.080
So what happens to him?

18:09.080 --> 18:12.590
He becomes a right sided person.

18:12.590 --> 18:16.510
Because he is using his physical being and
also he is mental being.

18:16.510 --> 18:19.889
But the emotional becomes little dried out.

18:19.889 --> 18:22.789
So emotionally he is not so good.

18:22.789 --> 18:24.360
Emotionally, he goes off.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.190
As a result, you won’t believe.

18:27.190 --> 18:32.020
As a result of this imbalance what disease
one can get to being with.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.679
According to Sahaja Yoga, this is another
principle.

18:35.679 --> 18:39.409
According to Sahaja Yoga because I will not
say that medical people will agree to it or

18:39.409 --> 18:40.419
they have found out.

18:40.419 --> 18:44.289
They might find out later on but just now
they have not found, so far.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.340
Because I did medicine, because you are all
younger to me in age.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.799
So when i did my medicine you might have been
just young boys.

18:50.799 --> 18:53.720
So may be my terminology may be little different.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.750
But does not matter.

18:55.750 --> 19:00.570
So according to Sahaja Yoga the brain is made
of fat cells.

19:00.570 --> 19:03.120
That is according to medical science also.

19:03.120 --> 19:10.659
Now these fat cells, when they are used too
much they are replaced, they are replaced

19:10.659 --> 19:14.600
by the fat of the stomach.

19:14.600 --> 19:20.990
And the conversion for the use of the brain
of the special cells is created by a center

19:20.990 --> 19:25.789
we call at “Swadhisthana Chakra” which
actually on the physical level you can say

19:25.789 --> 19:27.570
is aortic plexus.

19:27.570 --> 19:28.570
On the physical.

19:28.570 --> 19:31.710
In the “Sukshama” (subtle) is swadhisthana
Chakra.

19:31.710 --> 19:39.140
So one of the jobs of the swadhisthana chakra
is to convert these cells for the use of the

19:39.140 --> 19:40.140
brain.

19:40.140 --> 19:47.899
And the other job is to look after your liver,
look after your pancreas, look after your

19:47.899 --> 19:52.409
spleen and your kidneys and in ladies, uterus.

19:52.409 --> 19:54.149
Part of it.

19:54.149 --> 19:59.610
So when you think too much or plan too much
and you are futuristic.

19:59.610 --> 20:05.490
Most of the time this poor one, swadhistahana
chakra is busy coping with that thinking process

20:05.490 --> 20:07.539
and replacing the brain cells.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.539
Alright.

20:08.539 --> 20:13.500
So it neglects all these organs which are
very vital and important to us.

20:13.500 --> 20:22.830
So the first trouble one many get by thinking
too much is diabetes.

20:22.830 --> 20:27.330
Now, if you ask a doctor, he will say don’t
eat sugar.

20:27.330 --> 20:30.649
But this is no cure of the disease.

20:30.649 --> 20:35.080
But you see villagers eat at least five spoons
in one cup of tea.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.100
At least five spoons.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.120
They never get diabetes.

20:39.120 --> 20:45.279
It’s only the people who think and plan
too much for the future get it.

20:45.279 --> 20:48.659
First is diabetes.

20:48.659 --> 20:53.710
The another is very dangerous is leukemia.

20:53.710 --> 21:00.330
Leukemia also one gets from the same type
of life style.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.999
Believe me.

21:01.999 --> 21:08.760
Because you know at emergencies, this spleen
has to produce new RBCs(red blood corpuscles)

21:08.760 --> 21:10.809
that is accepted.

21:10.809 --> 21:11.809
Alright.

21:11.809 --> 21:19.700
Now, a person who is getting up in the morning,
see rushing up, just, its very interesting

21:19.700 --> 21:20.700
how it is.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.350
Just think of it.

21:22.350 --> 21:26.230
Everybody does that but we never see ourselves
how we behave.

21:26.230 --> 21:30.920
And he goes to the bathroom and comes out
with his pants just being tied up and the

21:30.920 --> 21:34.509
wife is there to give him breakfast and one
side he is eating the breakfast.

21:34.509 --> 21:39.029
Then is reading the newspaper getting another
shocks after shocks from the newspaper then

21:39.029 --> 21:43.250
he gets into the car and there is jam and
he does not know how to drive and all that.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.870
He is a sure patient for leukemia.

21:46.870 --> 21:55.299
Because poor this spleen has to produce new
blood corpuscles all the time and it becomes

21:55.299 --> 21:56.299
hectic.

21:56.299 --> 21:57.299
Now you may question me, why the children
get it?

21:57.299 --> 21:58.299
Because the parents must be like that.

21:58.299 --> 22:00.620
This is the parents also who can make the
children hectic.

22:00.620 --> 22:06.200
Get up in the morning, go to the school, what
are you doing, this, that..all the time if

22:06.200 --> 22:12.789
you are after your child with a stick in your
hand, the child is due for it.

22:12.789 --> 22:18.110
A mother, who is you see too clever, at home
and very particular about her kitchen and

22:18.110 --> 22:24.460
cleanliness of the whole thing and she can
get after her child.

22:24.460 --> 22:30.379
And such a thing completely upsets that poor
spleen.

22:30.379 --> 22:33.950
And the production of RBCs use their cells
of proportion.

22:33.950 --> 22:36.400
Of Course there is a trigery.

22:36.400 --> 22:42.580
And the trigering takes place as the doctors
call it, I mean recently i saw it that they

22:42.580 --> 22:45.289
call it by Proteins 52 and Proteins 58.

22:45.289 --> 22:48.049
That they call it, these are attacks.

22:48.049 --> 22:53.340
This recently I saw it in England, the research,
the cancer research people had given this

22:53.340 --> 22:55.789
(unclear text) explanation.

22:55.789 --> 23:01.899
And they said it comes from the areas built
within us from of our creation.

23:01.899 --> 23:04.759
And we call it collective subconsious.

23:04.759 --> 23:08.590
In Sahaja Yoga we call it collective subconsious.

23:08.590 --> 23:14.409
Beyond our conscious mind there is subconscious
mind and beyond the subconsious mind there

23:14.409 --> 23:20.100
is collective subconscious mind on the left
hand side.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.149
Now, according to them these are Proteins
52 and 58 whatever you may call it.

23:24.149 --> 23:30.400
Whatever you may call it but we call it a
“bhoot badha”(posession), a simple word.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.450
Or you may call it a “kali-vidya” (black
magic or false knowledge) or whatever it is.

23:33.450 --> 23:40.820
But it is nothing but it is an attack of a
dead soul on a person.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.549
Absolutely, it exists.

23:42.549 --> 23:45.620
And that is how it triggers.

23:45.620 --> 23:57.080
Now virus infection is also the attack of
the vegetables, we can or the vegetations

23:57.080 --> 24:01.690
which have gone out the circulation of your
evolution.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.080
That’s virus infection.

24:03.080 --> 24:07.799
I mean, if you know the source from where
it is coming, you can stop it, isn’t it?

24:07.799 --> 24:11.090
Now, doctors can’t believe a bhoot but once
they are caught up with a bhoot, they know

24:11.090 --> 24:12.780
it is a bhoot.

24:12.780 --> 24:17.470
Like a met a doctor, was a in in charge of
the hospital and his son was possessed.

24:17.470 --> 24:20.970
So he came to me and said, “Mother, please
somehow or the other, save my son.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.710
I don’t know what to do.” and I cured
him.

24:23.710 --> 24:25.029
He said, “how did you cure?”.

24:25.029 --> 24:27.730
I said its simple, he is possessed.

24:27.730 --> 24:30.549
And he was possessed by something and is removed.

24:30.549 --> 24:31.549
Its simple.

24:31.549 --> 24:34.880
But to tell a doctor, I mean you are in for
trouble.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.440
But its a fact.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.380
Believe me, it’s a fact.

24:38.380 --> 24:43.960
The triggering they have said about 52 and
58, I mean call it anything like auto to call

24:43.960 --> 24:45.570
to “Atma” you call it auto.

24:45.570 --> 24:46.570
Alright.

24:46.570 --> 24:47.570
So what can we do about it?

24:47.570 --> 24:53.600
Or if you call it to a “bhoot-badha” as
protein 52 and 58, what should we do?

24:53.600 --> 25:00.269
I mean you have more sophisticated names perhaps
but its simple like that.

25:00.269 --> 25:07.770
So once a person has that kind of wobbly spleen,
he is a good case.

25:07.770 --> 25:11.559
He is a good case for getting leukemia.

25:11.559 --> 25:18.720
Now let’s come to the best part of it, what
one can get ultimately.

25:18.720 --> 25:25.020
That, when your attention is so much outside
then your spirit in the heart gets upset and

25:25.020 --> 25:29.860
you get a heart attack.

25:29.860 --> 25:32.270
All heart attacks are due to this kind of
thing.

25:32.270 --> 25:38.529
There are two types of hearts; Heart diseases
according to Sahaja Yoga.

25:38.529 --> 25:39.570
It’s very simple.

25:39.570 --> 25:42.750
One is a lethargic heart and one is over active
heart.

25:42.750 --> 25:51.519
The over active heart gets a heart attack
when, whether you are thin or fat makes no

25:51.519 --> 25:52.519
difference.

25:52.519 --> 25:58.630
The lethargic heart may be from the fat but
the active heart, the one who is extremely

25:58.630 --> 25:59.630
active.

25:59.630 --> 26:04.179
All the time thinking of the future and all
that is in for a heart attack.

26:04.179 --> 26:07.610
It’s so simple as that.

26:07.610 --> 26:10.659
So now, you have to just give a balance to
a person.

26:10.659 --> 26:13.529
Who is a right sided, you give him a balance.

26:13.529 --> 26:17.820
Make left and right, he is cured.

26:17.820 --> 26:24.600
When you know the “tatwa”, the principle-how
you get diseases then can you not cure it,

26:24.600 --> 26:26.369
if you know how to cure the “tatwa”?

26:26.369 --> 26:29.340
Sahaja yoga is like that.

26:29.340 --> 26:34.480
Sahaja yoga knows the principle and principles
are a few.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.450
Like colors are very few.

26:36.450 --> 26:37.450
Isn’t it?

26:37.450 --> 26:38.450
The mixtures are there.

26:38.450 --> 26:39.980
Permutations and combinations are there.

26:39.980 --> 26:46.070
But if you know the principle, you just put
the principle right and the person is alright.

26:46.070 --> 26:53.679
Like the person (unclear text) was going to
Houston for a By-pass(surgery) and I was speaking

26:53.679 --> 26:57.230
in a Rotary Club, in Delhi.

26:57.230 --> 26:59.749
There were about two thousand people.

26:59.749 --> 27:03.649
Suddenly he (text1-shot up/text2- stood up)
came to me and said, “Mother I have to go

27:03.649 --> 27:04.649
to Houston”.

27:04.649 --> 27:07.160
I said but I am flying out today to Bombay
to go to Pune.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.190
I have to go to Pune.

27:08.190 --> 27:09.480
He said, “I live in Pune”.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.059
I said, Alright, I’ll meet you there.

27:11.059 --> 27:16.330
He came to see me twice, I think and I gave
him vibrations then he went back to Bombay

27:16.330 --> 27:17.840
and all the doctors said, “Oh!

27:17.840 --> 27:18.840
What happened?

27:18.840 --> 27:22.470
These were not your, perhaps these were not
your X-rays or what?

27:22.470 --> 27:23.470
Its completely cured.

27:23.470 --> 27:27.210
100% and all that By-pass and all that is
over.

27:27.210 --> 27:31.619
And for this, what are you going to pay?

27:31.619 --> 27:33.590
This is just flowing.

27:33.590 --> 27:35.419
I mean you are also not obliging anyone.

27:35.419 --> 27:39.400
That’s the worst part of it that people
think I am obliging.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.400
No.

27:40.400 --> 27:45.710
See, if you are part and parcel of me, say
for example My finger is something wrong and

27:45.710 --> 27:50.049
I just rub it then I am obliging my finger?

27:50.049 --> 27:52.340
I mean if you are part and parcel of me how
can I oblige you?

27:52.340 --> 28:01.649
That’s what they were saying that you have
to become the part and parcel of the whole.

28:01.649 --> 28:03.710
You just become part and parcel of the whole.

28:03.710 --> 28:07.029
The arbitrary behaviour becomes malignant.

28:07.029 --> 28:14.190
Arbitrary behaviour of a cell becomes malignancy.

28:14.190 --> 28:18.139
Because the centers, now I will tell you about
cancer also on the same simple way.

28:18.139 --> 28:21.580
See, its a simple way of explaining cancer.

28:21.580 --> 28:22.580
Any cancer.

28:22.580 --> 28:28.950
Now, we can say that, with my hands I might
be able to show you that left hand and right

28:28.950 --> 28:32.582
hand are two sympathetic nervous systems and
these are the centers in between.

28:32.582 --> 28:33.582
You can see that.

28:33.582 --> 28:34.582
(Shri Mataji makes a pyramid with her fingers
and joins the thumbs and index fingers of

28:34.582 --> 28:35.582
both the hands to show the position.)

28:35.582 --> 28:36.582
Alright.

28:36.582 --> 28:37.582
These are the centers.

28:37.582 --> 28:41.740
Now, what happens..a person starts a doing
something extraordinary.

28:41.740 --> 28:44.429
Something emergency he creates within himself.

28:44.429 --> 28:46.409
It can be with anything.

28:46.409 --> 28:51.730
Now he creates an emergency uses too much
of his sympathetic supposing he uses the right

28:51.730 --> 28:52.730
side too much.

28:52.730 --> 28:56.250
Then what happens is this starts wobbling
like that.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.620
(Shri MAtaji shows this with her hands) this
center.

28:57.620 --> 29:05.539
And the center starts wobbling and the, there
is a deity inside this which keeps the relationship

29:05.539 --> 29:06.539
with the whole.

29:06.539 --> 29:10.639
The deity just sleeps off and the relationship
is broken.

29:10.639 --> 29:16.630
The relationship with the whole is broken
because the medulla oblongata has got you

29:16.630 --> 29:22.399
see, inside though to the physical mind it
has not broken but to the subtle thing, is

29:22.399 --> 29:23.399
finished.

29:23.399 --> 29:24.399
There is no relationship with the whole.

29:24.399 --> 29:27.480
So what happens, the cells here have no messages.

29:27.480 --> 29:29.940
So they become on their own.

29:29.940 --> 29:32.190
And they start becoming bigger and bigger.

29:32.190 --> 29:33.190
They become on their own.

29:33.190 --> 29:37.700
You see, they become very ambitious.They start
growing bigger and bigger.

29:37.700 --> 29:39.100
That’s how you get malignancy.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.100
Simple thing as that.

29:40.100 --> 29:42.591
Now what do we do for Sahaja Yoga. it is very
simple.

29:42.591 --> 29:47.429
If you are a realized soul what you have to
do is very simple is to just put your hand

29:47.429 --> 29:48.749
to the center at the back.

29:48.749 --> 29:52.450
So by giving vibrations you awaken the deity
and its again sucked back.

29:52.450 --> 29:57.789
You have put together in relationship with
the whole.

29:57.789 --> 30:03.289
I mean, I must tell you I cured Mr. Sanjeev
Reddy, you may write to him and ask him.

30:03.289 --> 30:09.190
Now he had come from America he had gone for
an operation and the operation was a failure.

30:09.190 --> 30:10.470
And he was in a horrible mess.

30:10.470 --> 30:14.500
He could not sleep and he was in a big pain
and they tried all kinds of injections and

30:14.500 --> 30:19.820
I mean you can imagine Sanjeev Reddy (unclear
text) I went with my husband to see him because

30:19.820 --> 30:20.820
he knew my husband.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.029
He knew me also.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.690
But our high commissioner was * Nehru and
I don’t know why he said to his wife, “you

30:26.690 --> 30:31.259
know, this is Mataji Nirmala Devi” She had
heard my name in Delhi.

30:31.259 --> 30:36.119
She said, “Mataji please cure my husband”
otherwise my husband is not going to say anything.

30:36.119 --> 30:38.630
So I just put my hand on his back, for ten
minutes.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.440
You won’t believe, in ten minutes.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.440
Oh God!

30:41.440 --> 30:44.299
I am feeling so relaxed, let me sleep now.

30:44.299 --> 30:48.230
He slept off and they were thinking...I mean
it was all last thing.

30:48.230 --> 30:53.970
See, so they had prepared everything that
they didn’t expect him to come alive.

30:53.970 --> 30:56.230
And when walked out they got a shock of their
lives.

30:56.230 --> 30:59.379
You see, they had brought ambulances, he said
“I don’t need any ambulance, nothing.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.710
And just walked off,you see.

31:01.710 --> 31:03.590
And then he went on for a tour.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.999
And then when i went to see him, he showed
me his back.

31:05.999 --> 31:13.590
He said, “even the scratches, which one
should see atleast a scratch of the operation.

31:13.590 --> 31:17.019
Even there is not even a scratch, you can’t
see.

31:17.019 --> 31:18.019
Imagine.

31:18.019 --> 31:20.639
The kundalini has done it.

31:20.639 --> 31:24.429
The kundalini is your mother.

31:24.429 --> 31:26.710
She is the one, sitting down there.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.879
Just waiting this thing to happen.

31:28.879 --> 31:31.299
Because she is your “Shudha icha” (pure
desire).

31:31.299 --> 31:33.460
She is the pure desire.

31:33.460 --> 31:35.399
The rest are “Vikrutas”.

31:35.399 --> 31:36.850
They are perverted.

31:36.850 --> 31:41.529
The real desire one has is to become one with
God.

31:41.529 --> 31:45.679
unless and until that desire is fulfilled
you are not going to be happy.

31:45.679 --> 31:48.250
So that desire is sitting down there.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.639
She is your mother.

31:49.639 --> 31:51.919
Everybody has individual mother.

31:51.919 --> 31:56.460
And when this pure desire rises, she integrates
all these centers.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.769
That’s how you get integrated.

31:59.769 --> 32:04.090
And then she comes upto here (Shri Mataji
touches her Sahastrara) and you can even feel.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.460
In many people the “lup-dup” you see.

32:06.460 --> 32:09.960
“Anahat”, anahat means without percussion.

32:09.960 --> 32:14.869
The sound you hear on the head.

32:14.869 --> 32:18.539
You can even see in many people the kundalini
pulsating.

32:18.539 --> 32:21.059
Actually with naked eyes you can see.

32:21.059 --> 32:28.269
Today only, we had somebody who had a kundalini
which was just pulsating at the base.

32:28.269 --> 32:31.419
If there is no way of getting out, pulsates.

32:31.419 --> 32:36.879
Poor thing, you know it just...some people
have just kundalini that just goes on tossing

32:36.879 --> 32:42.169
that “oh God, when I am going to give birth
to my child.”

32:42.169 --> 32:43.390
and then.

32:43.390 --> 32:45.620
If you can smooth it out, bring it out.

32:45.620 --> 32:46.620
It just comes up.

32:46.620 --> 32:50.139
And then you feel a cool breeze coming out
of your head.

32:50.139 --> 32:52.080
Which is not possible medically.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.009
Is it possible?

32:54.009 --> 33:00.370
You feel a cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel cool breeze blowing into your

33:00.370 --> 33:01.370
hands.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.370
Then, this is the power.

33:02.370 --> 33:03.370
Which is the all-pervading power.

33:03.370 --> 33:06.610
The “Brahma-tatwa” which you can use.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.850
Which is all integrated.

33:08.850 --> 33:14.450
In Sahaja Yoga language we call it Mahakali,
Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati.

33:14.450 --> 33:19.679
Then you understand, what was Mohammed Saa’b,
what was Zoraster, what was Christ, who they

33:19.679 --> 33:20.679
are.

33:20.679 --> 33:21.679
Everything we understand.

33:21.679 --> 33:26.940
They are all integrated, we are only people
fighting among ourselves.

33:26.940 --> 33:29.779
And it works out so beautifully you can’t
imagine.

33:29.779 --> 33:34.090
I wish, all of you get your realization and
work it out.

33:34.090 --> 33:37.580
I would like to answer your questions, if
you have any please ask me.

33:37.580 --> 33:41.679
And then let’s have it.

33:41.679 --> 34:11.830
(Shri Mataji finishes her lecture and sits
down at the chair)

34:11.830 --> 34:12.830
Someone from the audience:- Inaudible text.

34:12.830 --> 34:13.830
Shri Mataji in hindi:- What are they saying?

34:13.830 --> 34:14.830
Yogi:- Can any accidents can occur in Kundalini?

34:14.830 --> 34:16.070
Shri Mataji:- No, no not in this.

34:16.070 --> 34:20.780
You see, now there are people who have written
books and books about kundalini.

34:20.780 --> 34:23.710
I was myself shocked you know when I read
them.

34:23.710 --> 34:24.710
It’s all absurd.

34:24.710 --> 34:28.940
You see a person who does not know how to
handle even a scalper and tries to operate

34:28.940 --> 34:31.080
someone, what will happen?

34:31.080 --> 34:33.210
That’s what it is.

34:33.210 --> 34:34.270
Audience:- Inaudible.

34:34.270 --> 34:38.420
Shri MAtaji:- No, kundalini process there
are no accidents, nothing.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.169
Nothing happens like that.

34:40.169 --> 34:50.510
I am just telling that these are Naive people
who do not know how to handle it.

34:50.510 --> 34:52.280
Alright!

34:52.280 --> 35:04.270
Audience:- They are saying now that guru is
needed for all this yoga and (* unclear text.)

35:04.270 --> 35:10.140
Shri MAtaji:- They are saying because they
don’t know how to do it.

35:10.140 --> 35:16.300
Supposing somebody says, “oh you see, Medical
Science is horrible, don’t go near it.”

35:16.300 --> 35:20.140
Because they don’t about it what can you
do?

35:20.140 --> 35:24.790
It’s like putting your fingers in the plug
and saying that electricity is shocking.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.160
You must know the thing.

35:26.160 --> 35:36.540
First of all and secondly such a person has
to be a person of character.

35:36.540 --> 35:46.530
You see a man who is taking money from you,
God does not give blessings to such a man.

35:46.530 --> 35:47.530
Isn’t it?

35:47.530 --> 36:05.760
Or he is trying to make money out of you or
he is trying to be...he is a bad character

36:05.760 --> 36:22.610
man, is a horrible man and he has….you know
“paapi man” (sinner) you can call it.

36:22.610 --> 36:28.190
Such a person can not do it.

36:28.190 --> 36:29.710
He doesn’t do it.

36:29.710 --> 36:32.220
These are all money making propositions.

36:32.220 --> 36:36.500
And it is only Shri Ganesha who gets angry.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.580
Not kundalini.

36:37.580 --> 36:53.130
Poor thing she does not do anything but it
is the anger of Shri Ganesha which works on

36:53.130 --> 36:54.130
the sympathetic.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.130
That also you will know, what happens.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.130
Audience:- (Unclear text) bhakti in Sahaja
Yoga?

36:56.130 --> 36:57.130
Shri Mataji:- Bhakti?

36:57.130 --> 36:58.130
Bhakti is very important.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.130
I mean if you believe in God, then God looks
after you.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.130
But Bhakti can be an extreme step also.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.130
Like you are calling, “God, God” when
the God stands before you still you are calling

37:01.130 --> 37:02.130
God.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.130
You see that is too much.

37:03.130 --> 37:04.130
Isn’t it?

37:04.130 --> 37:05.130
Like, Tulsidasa he wrote so much about Ramayana
and all that.

37:05.130 --> 37:10.140
But when Shri Rama came to him and he also
gave him a (unclear) still he could not recognize

37:10.140 --> 37:11.140
him.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.140
So what’s the use of such a blind bhakti.

37:12.140 --> 37:13.140
It should not be blind.

37:13.140 --> 37:14.140
It should be from heart.

37:14.140 --> 37:15.140
Very important.

37:15.140 --> 37:16.140
If somebody is a man who has done bhakti from
his heart he gets Sahaja Yoga very fast.

37:16.140 --> 37:17.140
But actually, now I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
has become so powerful that everyone gets

37:17.140 --> 37:18.140
realization.

37:18.140 --> 37:19.140
Not difficult.

37:19.140 --> 37:20.140
Everyone gets it, not difficult.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.140
In the villages if you see six thousand people
sitting, all will raise hands.

37:21.140 --> 37:22.140
But the complicated and rather difficult (unclear
text) or if you have some disease.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.140
That also you can make out on the kundalini
but and also there kundalini stops.

37:23.140 --> 37:24.140
You’ll be amazed if there is somebody.

37:24.140 --> 37:25.140
Say comes to me and he has a liver problem
then the kundalini goes and she goes on hitting

37:25.140 --> 37:26.140
the liver you see.

37:26.140 --> 37:29.400
And even a person who does not understands
that liver is there, he puts his hand and

37:29.400 --> 37:31.970
there because he sees the kundalini hitting
there.

37:31.970 --> 37:35.040
So it just shows where the problem is.

37:35.040 --> 37:39.580
Even if you don’t understand any medicine
you will know where the problem is because

37:39.580 --> 37:41.900
you know the kundalini will go and start hitting
that point.

37:41.900 --> 37:48.490
And you will see with your naked eyes.

37:48.490 --> 37:55.550
Audience: How would you explain the pulsation
of the head in kundalini, please?

37:55.550 --> 37:58.650
Shri MAtaji:- Sahastrara you mean?

37:58.650 --> 38:03.620
Audience:- According to A* (unclear text)
because as we know in case of an adult…

38:03.620 --> 38:05.610
Shri Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you.

38:05.610 --> 38:10.760
In the brain you see, where the pituitary
and pineal body, in the center of that you

38:10.760 --> 38:12.910
can say the optic chaisma.

38:12.910 --> 38:15.080
There is a very subtle center called Agya
Chakra.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.910
Which is very important.

38:16.910 --> 38:20.320
Which goes on working when you think too much.

38:20.320 --> 38:28.380
And the backside is the one which is surrounded
by, you see..I would say that the limbic area

38:28.380 --> 38:29.380
has got all the seven chakras.

38:29.380 --> 38:30.720
All the seven chakras within it.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.250
All the seven chakras limbic area has.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.730
But they are called as the “Pithas”.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.240
Pitahs means the seats of the chakras.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.250
So all these chakras are represented in our
brain.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.250
Alright.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.400
In the limbic area.

38:41.400 --> 38:48.720
Now out of that this agya chakra is genuinely
here and the pitha is also here.

38:48.720 --> 38:54.320
The outside, this is the window of that agya
chakra which is in the center of pitutary

38:54.320 --> 38:57.810
and pineal and it controls pituitary and pineal.

38:57.810 --> 38:58.810
Alright.

38:58.810 --> 39:06.910
Now, at the back side of it, it has only two
windows so it is here and here at the back.

39:06.910 --> 39:11.280
And surrounding that, surrounding is Swadhisthana
Chakra.

39:11.280 --> 39:15.380
The same one i told you about working poor
thing which has to work very hard.

39:15.380 --> 39:21.360
Now this one, when you get diabetes what happens
that the swadhisthana goes out of order and

39:21.360 --> 39:24.190
that’s how you get blind.

39:24.190 --> 39:27.010
Because swadisthana is surrounding this.

39:27.010 --> 39:28.010
Here.

39:28.010 --> 39:30.360
so all the seven chakras are in the limbic
area.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.360
Is very interesting.

39:31.360 --> 39:35.090
Yogi:- He said that how do you get the pulsation
here? (he points his hand to sahastrara)

39:35.090 --> 39:36.090
Shri Mataji:- Pulsation here?

39:36.090 --> 39:37.090
Pulsation you said?

39:37.090 --> 39:38.090
Yogi:- Yes.

39:38.090 --> 39:40.720
Shri Mataji:- because the kundalini rises,
she crosses through this (Shri MAtaji points

39:40.720 --> 39:43.030
to the Agya Chara) and then you start feeling
the pulsation.

39:43.030 --> 39:44.660
Because it is trying to break through.

39:44.660 --> 39:49.164
When it breaks, then you get the, that’s
how you get the pulsation.

39:49.164 --> 39:52.940
You can even with the stethoscope hear the
pulsation on the different chakras to begin

39:52.940 --> 39:55.330
with then ultimately here you get the pulsation.

39:55.330 --> 39:56.330
Then it breaks, you see.

39:56.330 --> 40:00.820
The thing it becomes, you know fontanelle
bone area becomes soft.

40:00.820 --> 40:02.730
Just like a child’s fontanelle bone.

40:02.730 --> 40:07.990
In a person who is bald headed, sometimes
you see the whole thing opening out like that

40:07.990 --> 40:13.600
and then you feel the cool breeze coming out.

40:13.600 --> 40:21.990
Pause
Shri MAtaji:- So should we have realization?

40:21.990 --> 40:24.090
Let’s try.

40:24.090 --> 40:27.240
(unclear text) Alright.

40:27.240 --> 40:33.530
Take out your shoes, that’s it.

40:33.530 --> 40:35.880
Because the Mother Earth helps us.

40:35.880 --> 40:36.880
You see these are all the five elements which
have gone upside down.

40:36.880 --> 40:37.880
That’s all.

40:37.880 --> 40:38.880
Just take out your shoes.

40:38.880 --> 40:39.880
That’s all.

40:39.880 --> 40:40.880
Is very simple.

40:40.880 --> 40:41.880
Anybody can get no problem.

40:41.880 --> 40:42.880
According to these western people, Indians
are very easy.

40:42.880 --> 40:54.600
They are a very quality of people.

40:54.600 --> 41:00.520
They are dharmic and they are very great,
according to them.

41:00.520 --> 41:06.630
And I must also confess that I really break
my hands in the west.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.110
In India, I must say, they know it very well.

41:08.110 --> 41:09.760
They have to break also.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.210
Not only me.

41:11.210 --> 41:12.210
They have to do the same.

41:12.210 --> 41:16.170
So they are very happy here because giving
realization to Indians is very easy.

41:16.170 --> 41:18.720
But giving realization to western people is
very difficult.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.260
So they also have suffered all of them.

41:20.260 --> 41:22.960
So they will stand by me.

41:22.960 --> 41:24.811
(unclear text) they all have, they all know
that this is the (bhoot?/Unclear) because

41:24.811 --> 41:26.800
they are very complicated.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.890
Extremely complicated.

41:29.890 --> 41:33.880
So many attacks have come to them that they
are complicated, thinking is too much.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.375
Like this fellow “Freud” has to (Unclear)wrong
ideas into their heads.

41:37.375 --> 41:44.300
And there is “Bawa” and all this nonsense
and who was that...what was the unholdy trinity

41:44.300 --> 41:46.050
you were talking about?

41:46.050 --> 41:47.370
Where is he?

41:47.370 --> 41:48.370
Bryan?

41:48.370 --> 41:49.560
“Freud nature of (God/gardener)..

41:49.560 --> 41:53.990
{Laughter, Shri MAtaji laughs then says a
sentence in Marathi}

41:53.990 --> 41:56.740
Shri Mataji:- Ah, that’s it.

41:56.740 --> 42:00.632
You see, that’s it, that’s how they have
been attacked.

42:00.632 --> 42:01.720
And they accepted all this.

42:01.720 --> 42:07.330
You see, we may be educated in western education
but we don’t forget about God.

42:07.330 --> 42:13.110
I mean think about God as a part of us and
dharma is within us.

42:13.110 --> 42:19.640
(Shri Mataji says something in Marathi) and
even Indians if they take to adharmic life

42:19.640 --> 42:22.820
they still remember that this is adharmic.

42:22.820 --> 42:27.100
But for them it has become so difficult to
remember that this is dharmic, adharmic.

42:27.100 --> 42:30.110
That’s an another world.

42:30.110 --> 42:31.170
Another world, you (unclear) with them nothing
is dharma.

42:31.170 --> 42:32.170
Is poor thing you know.

42:32.170 --> 42:37.130
They have been attacked so much and they are
all saints born.

42:37.130 --> 42:39.891
Surprising part is that they have been saints
they were born in such countries where there

42:39.891 --> 42:46.010
was affluence and they are attacked.

42:46.010 --> 42:50.090
These are saints, definitely.

42:50.090 --> 42:53.330
And those who are seekers there are tremendous
seekers.

42:53.330 --> 42:59.190
I mean you will be amazed these people, they
have been druggists and alcoholics and all

42:59.190 --> 43:00.190
sorts of people.

43:00.190 --> 43:01.190
But the day they get realization next day
they give up.

43:01.190 --> 43:02.190
Indians don’t.

43:02.190 --> 43:03.190
(Everyone laughs.)

43:03.190 --> 43:04.190
Indians are chickens.

43:04.190 --> 43:05.190
They don’t.

43:05.190 --> 43:06.190
(Laughter, everyone laughs with Mother) I
must say.

43:06.190 --> 43:07.190
Na, Indians don’t you know so easily.

43:07.190 --> 43:08.220
They do it, they are saints.

43:08.220 --> 43:15.410
(pointing towards western yogies) this is
the quality that way is very good.

43:15.410 --> 43:18.410
But on the whole, you see totality.

43:18.410 --> 43:22.340
I am saying, in general, it’s horrible.

43:22.340 --> 43:23.340
But they are saints.

43:23.340 --> 43:27.000
Because the way they give up their things
is amazing.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.120
Here, you give realization.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.840
(Marathi sentence something about the habit
of having tobacco) it’s like that.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.100
You see, they stick on to something.

43:33.100 --> 43:36.380
I don’t know why, these people just give
up.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
Overnight!

43:37.380 --> 43:38.380
They are very determined.

43:38.380 --> 43:40.750
That’s how thing is there.

43:40.750 --> 43:45.570
I mean that goes in their favour and this
goes in your favour.

43:45.570 --> 43:49.860
My condition is that some people don’t have
teeth, and some people don’t have “chanas”

43:49.860 --> 43:53.050
(roasted chickpeas) and some people don’t
have chanas and they have teeth.

43:53.050 --> 43:54.250
It’s like that.

43:54.250 --> 43:56.260
So it’s a funny situation.

43:56.260 --> 43:57.260
Alright.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.260
So let’s have it.

43:58.260 --> 44:03.160
Now you don’t have to be serious about it,
nothing but it is a very serene thing.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.370
It’s not serious but serene.

44:05.370 --> 44:06.370
Just put your hands like this.

44:06.370 --> 44:10.420
(Shri Mataji opens her palms to show) that’s
all and close your eyes that’s all.

44:10.420 --> 44:11.960
That’s all.

44:11.960 --> 44:17.370
Just put your hands straight like this.

44:17.370 --> 44:18.370
Straight!

44:18.370 --> 44:20.080
I think better to take out your spectacles
put them.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.080
This also helps your eyes very much.

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
Spectacles you may remove later on.

44:22.080 --> 44:27.440
Just, it’s so fantastic to (continue/unclear
text) It’s another world I am talking about.

44:27.440 --> 44:28.440
Hmm…

44:28.440 --> 44:32.280
Just close your eyes please.
