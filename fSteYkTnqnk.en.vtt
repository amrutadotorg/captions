00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:25.900
The organizers and the members of the Medical
Association in Sholapur, its such a pleasure

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:37.680
to talk to (* inaudible text) because you
have also heard that I did some medicine.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.880
Just to talk to doctors about it.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.980
Because in the realm of the divine, there
are no names given to any plexuses.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.270
It’s difficult to talk to doctors unless
and until you know their language.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:08.369
Now the main thing we have to understand about
Sahaja yogi is this that when we are trying

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:18.080
to analyze or find out through scientific
methods anything, we can only do it when that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.390
part is available to us, apparent to us, that
we can see it, we can feel it, we can analyze

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.390
it.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.520
Like a tree, we see the tree on top of the
Mother Earth.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.200
For us it is easy to see the tree.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.119
But supposing we have to go deep down into
the roots.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.200
So Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots
and not of the tree.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.259
Of Course, the tree is very important because
root has no meaning if there is no tree.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:59.880
But tree is more important when it can tell
you that there are roots to it.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.780
So all our knowledge of science whatever it
is, whatever discoveries we have made, how

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.780
far we have gone?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.470
I mean we can go very deep into it, I know
that.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.740
But still, you can not reach the absolute.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.870
Because “absolute” is that point where
you have to dissolve.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.330
We have one scholar here, who is doing his
P.H.D from Brighton and he has a subject how

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.840
to establish an absolute zero point in temperature.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.590
You can not.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.840
Nobody can.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720
Its a fact.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.510
You can go up to a point but you can not become
the absolute.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.040
Through your mental projection because the
mind is a limited thing.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.569
We must understand the mind is limited.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.330
Like I came by car, I had to leave my car
behind to come inside.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.890
In the same way this limited mind can not
take you to something that is unlimited.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.209
Because absolute has to be unlimited.

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.140
So to reach the absolute point what should
be done.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.640
That’s the main problem with all of us.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.239
All those who are seekers, whether they are
scientists or psychologists or anyway.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.629
They have one point if they see correctly
that we have not reached the absolute.

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:27.440
That is why we do not understand “why are
we made human beings from amoeba state?”

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.670
We should ask ourselves a simple question,”why
are we human beings?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.760
What was the purpose of this evolution that
we were made human beings?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.599
So, as we can’t answer this question it
is not answerable.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:51.769
We have to know that we are in a transition
state and this human awareness has to achieve

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.019
another awareness which is dynamic, which
is collective in nature and many people I

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.200
would say like you, who has talked of collectivity.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:13.810
Who has talked of collective awareness that
a man, if he evolves, will become a collectively

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.810
conscious.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.750
He could see that but he did not know how.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.660
Even if you have to say that if you have to
go to Sholapur you better take this road or

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.460
that road but if you can not reach Sholapur
then you are not there in Sholapur.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.430
So even if you say this is the way it has
to be, unless and until somebody does it in

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.139
a practical way, in actualization you have
to achieve it.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.319
This is the problem.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.970
Actual this is the problem, that exist between
all the people who are seeking, between all

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.220
the enterprises, between all the moment we
have.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.130
There is no quarrel between God and Science.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.670
One thing one should remember that Science
has come from God to you.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.590
It has not come from you.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.870
For example, if you say there is gravity.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.930
Now, you have not put gravity in the Mother
Earth, did you?

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.020
We can not even transform one flower into
a fruit.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.830
Not one flower into fruit.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.190
Can you imagine?

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.259
So there is some living power which is doing
this living job.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:27.849
Now think an Indian has a child he is an Indian,
this sorting out is done.

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.560
You know that any foreign matter that goes
into the body is thrown away.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.669
Has to be thrown away.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.300
But when the fetus is conceived, then it is
kept, nourished, properly looked after and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.580
is thrown out at the right time.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.240
Who does that job?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.490
We must think.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.310
There are so many things for example acidic
(* unclear text- some medical name) of course

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.240
doctors, I must say or scientists are honest.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.650
So they say, their mode of action in human
body they can not explain.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.340
They just openly say if they can not.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.020
Because it may augment or it may not.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.699
But Sahaja yoga can explain, why it happens.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.330
Why it has to happen like that.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:27.139
Now the jumping from this knowledge from the
mind into the knowledge of the eternal is

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:28.360
a difficult task.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.360
To accept it.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.659
Because as doctor (*unclear text) has told
you that when we get education we think we

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:38.090
know quite a lot.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.919
Not that you do not know.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:41.551
Not that, this knowledge is not needed.

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:42.551
Its very important.

00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:45.009
If you are a doctor, you will be a great sahaja
yogi.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.009
No doubt.

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:52.349
But something is not known to you which is
much greater than what is known to you.

00:06:52.349 --> 00:07:00.849
So this human awareness, this “chetna”
that is within you today has to rise to that

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:07.379
level or you have to become that subtle that
you can enter into your roots.

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:08.379
Alright?

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.780
So on this point we start moving further that
you are paying attention to me but if I say

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.900
pay attention to yourself.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.610
You can not.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.449
How will you do it.

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:22.449
You can not do it.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.960
You can not see your self, you can not see
your organs, you can not see your body, you

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.439
can not see anything, you can not see your
mind.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:33.050
You can not feel it.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.090
So what should happen?

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.599
Say something falls down, immediately our
attention goes there.

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:47.139
Some happening has to take place within ourselves
and that happening is nothing but kundalini

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:49.909
awakening.

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:56.530
Now this kundalini is a force which is lying
in the triangular bone which is called as

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.530
sacrum.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:04.530
(Shri Mataji asks for some water in hindi/marathi)
I have been speaking and speaking and hours

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:13.460
and hours together.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.210
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.110
Sacrum means sacred.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.050
In greek language, sacrum means sacred.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:26.509
When I went to Greece, I asked them why do
you call it sacrum?

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:34.640
So they told me that they had a rapport with
Indians much much before, Alexander came here

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.780
and the Indians told them that there is a
power in this triangular bone.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.130
Can you imagine?

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:49.730
We have forgotten it, we have lost it because
we have studied only the british or whatever

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.820
is english or you can call it a western medical
science.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:59.630
But in our science, you will be surprised,
fourteen thousand years back Markandeya has

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.520
talked about it.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:09.010
We Indians are best suited to understand this.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:14.790
Now many people say that Mahasrashtra has
got three and a half “pithas”.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:20.480
Many people must have heard there are three
and a half “pithas” one of them is “Mahalaxmi”,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:29.650
then another is “Tulzapur Bhavani” then
third one is “Mahur” and half one is “Chaturshringi”.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.560
Now (*unclear text) something so funny and
stupid.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.910
I mean, I can undertand as doctors.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.770
But its not.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.010
Believe me.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.160
These are the three and a half coils of the
kundalini of the whole universe placed in

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.720
your Maharashtra.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:10:00.150
They are the source of that power within your
own country this great Maharashtra.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.130
Now people may not believe it.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.790
But how will you know?

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:15.370
Now, somebody says “this is a “jagrut
sthana” (means awakened place) I mean doctors

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.370
do namaskar to Ganesha and they go to temple
and all.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:25.530
But they do not know that Ganesha is placed
within us and he controls our prostate and

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.810
he controls all our pelvic plexuses.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.910
We do not know this.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:35.660
But he resides there.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:46.200
So to jump from that to this is rather difficult
for a medical man, I understand that.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.630
(unclear/inaudible text) who were studying
with me I never talk to them about Kundalini

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.630
or anything.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.380
I just wanted to be like them to understand
how their brains have worked.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.530
For them, this is knowledge, this is everything,
nothing beyond.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:05.070
And anybody who talks about it they turn faces
like that.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:11.320
Now I do not want you to come to any conclusion
by saying of course Gyaneshwara has talked

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.350
about it so he can not be wrong and this and
that.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.570
Not at all.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:28.580
But scientifically, we have to understand
that we have not got answers to many questions.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.560
That means there is no sufficient light, in
our knowledge.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:38.500
If you are coming in this room in darkness
you might find a mic, you might find a table,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.010
you might find something.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.800
This becomes the truth.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.170
Because the eyes are not yet opened or the
light is not there.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.250
But supposing by any chance, somebody can
open the light, you can see all the things.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.250
Isn’t it?

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:56.720
That what doctor Berjodi ji is talking about
the integration part.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.650
Now this light is nothing but your auto.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.380
Which you talk of as “Autonomous Nervous
System”.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.800
You just give the name, Auto.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.410
Now, who is auto?

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.620
We accept it.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:13.400
When we get the names, we just accept the
name, we never ask why it is called auto.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:20.240
Because it is “swayamchalit” (which runs
by itself) who is the swayam?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.790
Who is the “sw” is the spirit.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:28.380
In a way, we have accepted because we have
to fix somebody as auto otherwise we don’t

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.380
know what to do.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.830
I mean, we see parasympathetic working, sympathetic
working so we have to fix up somebody as a

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:38.590
person behind the two.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.910
But that auto is the spirit, is the “atma”,
we do not want to accept.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:42.910
Alright.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.910
We will call it auto if you don’t like it.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.730
For the scientist, if they don’t like it
we will call it auto only.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.160
So this Mr. auto, is the atma according to
Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.650
We call it atma, you call it auto.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.680
That’s the only difference of names.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.560
Now this auto exists within us.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.020
But this auto is not in our central nervous
system.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.020
That is true.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.220
Because we can not control our parasympathetic.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:18.010
We may be able to excite our sympathetic but
not the parasympathetic, that’s the fact.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.290
Sympathetic, if we excite, it, we can work
out.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.790
But parasympathetic we can not work out.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.170
It works automatically.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.820
So somehow or other, if you can bring that
auto in your attention or in your central

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:37.090
nervous system then you can manage the show
better.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.870
Scientifically.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.090
I am just going scientifically.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.090
Alright.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.810
Now, how to bring this auto in your attention?

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.040
How to control this auto?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.630
Is the problem.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.270
You can not do through science.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.150
You can not do through medical science.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.340
Through any science you can not do.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.560
Because this will only happen when you will
evolve to another stage.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.730
And science can not bring in evolution.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.730
Can it?

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:07.160
It can not give you wisdom and it can not
give you evolution.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.300
Evolution it can not give.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.330
Why?

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:22.660
It can not even create life, I would say.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:30.220
So this auto, to be in your central nervous
system we should look inside ourselves.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:39.320
There could be some arrangement and for that
the knowledge is in your great country.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.240
Already there.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.090
You are the one who have inherited that (unclear
text).

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.810
This is what you have inherited.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:53.150
It is your inheritance which is lost.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:59.190
But one must know that when the tree grows
too high it must have roots.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:03.670
And that is how, whatever they are saying
about me..I am the tap root, I must say.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:08.870
Who has done the seeking inside perhaps or
I have reached at source and that’s how

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.850
I know what is the root.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:19.200
In our country, many saints have tried to
go through that path and have found out.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.820
They have tried to express it in many ways
but they kept it a secret till the sixth century

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.570
when Adi Shankaracharya came and he talked
about it very clearly.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.220
He talked about kundalini, he talked about
all the chakras, he talked about everything.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.830
But who reads Adi Shankaracharya.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.600
Atleast the medical man does not.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:47.880
I mean, I don’t blame them because they
are so busy.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.940
And after that it was all exposed.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.890
Then Kabira clearly, clearly, clearly absolutely
clearly talked about it.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.330
So Sahaja yoga is not a new system.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.390
It is “Anadi”, it is old.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.830
Only thing, what has happened to Sahaja Yoga
today that it has become a “Mahayoga”.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.140
That there are many many thousands can get
realization.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.600
That was not possible and feasible.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:14.890
This is the only thing that has happened that
today the blossom time has come and many flowers

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.760
can become fruits.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.080
And that’s how even an ordinary person gets
self realization.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.750
A poor man can get realization, a doctor can
get realization.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.480
Anybody can get realization.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.450
And sooner you get the better it is.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.290
So now the first thing what will happen to
you.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.850
Supposing you get the light within yourself
and you can see within yourself.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.440
Say you have an X-ray to see yourself within
yourself.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.440
So first thing that should happen to you is
that you should know about yourself, what’s

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.970
the problem with you.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:54.340
You’ll be amazed people end up in lunatic
asylums and till they are absolutely gone

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.870
cases people do not know that they are mad.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.870
Same about cancer.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:04.030
I would say, cancer can be detected much earlier
than doctors can detect it.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.589
Very simple it is.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.750
Any disease connected with liver is another
thing.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:16.429
I would say even liver problems are not detected
till a patient gets a cirrhosis or some sort

00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:24.529
of a disease which is absolutely fatal and
you declare alright, now you go into coma.

00:17:24.529 --> 00:17:25.529
Finished!

00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:30.470
These can be detected through Sahaja Yoga
very well because once you are enlightened,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.600
your fingers.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.669
These five fingers, six and seven (ShriMataji
describes the chakras on her palm) They start

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:36.669
denoting the centers.

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:38.049
And on these fingers you can know.

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:44.919
Now according to Sahaja Yoga left side deals,
left side sympathetic deals with your emotional

00:17:44.919 --> 00:17:48.750
side and right side deals with physical and
mental side.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:49.750
Clearcut.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.919
So now you see a person who is very busy.

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:58.259
Who is a doctor, say for example.

00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:05.090
He is a very busy man and he has no time at
all.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.039
He is always looking at his watch, naturally.

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.080
So what happens to him?

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.590
He becomes a right sided person.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.510
Because he is using his physical being and
also he is mental being.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:19.889
But the emotional becomes little dried out.

00:18:19.889 --> 00:18:22.789
So emotionally he is not so good.

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:24.360
Emotionally, he goes off.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.190
As a result, you won’t believe.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:32.020
As a result of this imbalance what disease
one can get to being with.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.679
According to Sahaja Yoga, this is another
principle.

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:39.409
According to Sahaja Yoga because I will not
say that medical people will agree to it or

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:40.419
they have found out.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:44.289
They might find out later on but just now
they have not found, so far.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.340
Because I did medicine, because you are all
younger to me in age.

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.799
So when i did my medicine you might have been
just young boys.

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:53.720
So may be my terminology may be little different.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.750
But does not matter.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.570
So according to Sahaja Yoga the brain is made
of fat cells.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.120
That is according to medical science also.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:10.659
Now these fat cells, when they are used too
much they are replaced, they are replaced

00:19:10.659 --> 00:19:14.600
by the fat of the stomach.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.990
And the conversion for the use of the brain
of the special cells is created by a center

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.789
we call at “Swadhisthana Chakra” which
actually on the physical level you can say

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:27.570
is aortic plexus.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.570
On the physical.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.710
In the “Sukshama” (subtle) is swadhisthana
Chakra.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:39.140
So one of the jobs of the swadhisthana chakra
is to convert these cells for the use of the

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.140
brain.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:47.899
And the other job is to look after your liver,
look after your pancreas, look after your

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:52.409
spleen and your kidneys and in ladies, uterus.

00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:54.149
Part of it.

00:19:54.149 --> 00:19:59.610
So when you think too much or plan too much
and you are futuristic.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:05.490
Most of the time this poor one, swadhistahana
chakra is busy coping with that thinking process

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.539
and replacing the brain cells.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:08.539
Alright.

00:20:08.539 --> 00:20:13.500
So it neglects all these organs which are
very vital and important to us.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:22.830
So the first trouble one many get by thinking
too much is diabetes.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.330
Now, if you ask a doctor, he will say don’t
eat sugar.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.649
But this is no cure of the disease.

00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:35.080
But you see villagers eat at least five spoons
in one cup of tea.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.100
At least five spoons.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.120
They never get diabetes.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:45.279
It’s only the people who think and plan
too much for the future get it.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:48.659
First is diabetes.

00:20:48.659 --> 00:20:53.710
The another is very dangerous is leukemia.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:21:00.330
Leukemia also one gets from the same type
of life style.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.999
Believe me.

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:08.760
Because you know at emergencies, this spleen
has to produce new RBCs(red blood corpuscles)

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.809
that is accepted.

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:11.809
Alright.

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:19.700
Now, a person who is getting up in the morning,
see rushing up, just, its very interesting

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.700
how it is.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.350
Just think of it.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:26.230
Everybody does that but we never see ourselves
how we behave.

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.920
And he goes to the bathroom and comes out
with his pants just being tied up and the

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:34.509
wife is there to give him breakfast and one
side he is eating the breakfast.

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:39.029
Then is reading the newspaper getting another
shocks after shocks from the newspaper then

00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:43.250
he gets into the car and there is jam and
he does not know how to drive and all that.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.870
He is a sure patient for leukemia.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:55.299
Because poor this spleen has to produce new
blood corpuscles all the time and it becomes

00:21:55.299 --> 00:21:56.299
hectic.

00:21:56.299 --> 00:21:57.299
Now you may question me, why the children
get it?

00:21:57.299 --> 00:21:58.299
Because the parents must be like that.

00:21:58.299 --> 00:22:00.620
This is the parents also who can make the
children hectic.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.200
Get up in the morning, go to the school, what
are you doing, this, that..all the time if

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:12.789
you are after your child with a stick in your
hand, the child is due for it.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:18.110
A mother, who is you see too clever, at home
and very particular about her kitchen and

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:24.460
cleanliness of the whole thing and she can
get after her child.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:30.379
And such a thing completely upsets that poor
spleen.

00:22:30.379 --> 00:22:33.950
And the production of RBCs use their cells
of proportion.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.400
Of Course there is a trigery.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.580
And the trigering takes place as the doctors
call it, I mean recently i saw it that they

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.289
call it by Proteins 52 and Proteins 58.

00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:48.049
That they call it, these are attacks.

00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:53.340
This recently I saw it in England, the research,
the cancer research people had given this

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.789
(unclear text) explanation.

00:22:55.789 --> 00:23:01.899
And they said it comes from the areas built
within us from of our creation.

00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:04.759
And we call it collective subconsious.

00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:08.590
In Sahaja Yoga we call it collective subconsious.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:14.409
Beyond our conscious mind there is subconscious
mind and beyond the subconsious mind there

00:23:14.409 --> 00:23:20.100
is collective subconscious mind on the left
hand side.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.149
Now, according to them these are Proteins
52 and 58 whatever you may call it.

00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:30.400
Whatever you may call it but we call it a
“bhoot badha”(posession), a simple word.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.450
Or you may call it a “kali-vidya” (black
magic or false knowledge) or whatever it is.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:40.820
But it is nothing but it is an attack of a
dead soul on a person.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.549
Absolutely, it exists.

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:45.620
And that is how it triggers.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:57.080
Now virus infection is also the attack of
the vegetables, we can or the vegetations

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.690
which have gone out the circulation of your
evolution.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.080
That’s virus infection.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.799
I mean, if you know the source from where
it is coming, you can stop it, isn’t it?

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:11.090
Now, doctors can’t believe a bhoot but once
they are caught up with a bhoot, they know

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.780
it is a bhoot.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.470
Like a met a doctor, was a in in charge of
the hospital and his son was possessed.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:20.970
So he came to me and said, “Mother, please
somehow or the other, save my son.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.710
I don’t know what to do.” and I cured
him.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.029
He said, “how did you cure?”.

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:27.730
I said its simple, he is possessed.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.549
And he was possessed by something and is removed.

00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:31.549
Its simple.

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:34.880
But to tell a doctor, I mean you are in for
trouble.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.440
But its a fact.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.380
Believe me, it’s a fact.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.960
The triggering they have said about 52 and
58, I mean call it anything like auto to call

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.570
to “Atma” you call it auto.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.570
Alright.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:47.570
So what can we do about it?

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:53.600
Or if you call it to a “bhoot-badha” as
protein 52 and 58, what should we do?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:25:00.269
I mean you have more sophisticated names perhaps
but its simple like that.

00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:07.770
So once a person has that kind of wobbly spleen,
he is a good case.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.559
He is a good case for getting leukemia.

00:25:11.559 --> 00:25:18.720
Now let’s come to the best part of it, what
one can get ultimately.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:25.020
That, when your attention is so much outside
then your spirit in the heart gets upset and

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.860
you get a heart attack.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.270
All heart attacks are due to this kind of
thing.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:38.529
There are two types of hearts; Heart diseases
according to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:38.529 --> 00:25:39.570
It’s very simple.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.750
One is a lethargic heart and one is over active
heart.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:51.519
The over active heart gets a heart attack
when, whether you are thin or fat makes no

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:52.519
difference.

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:58.630
The lethargic heart may be from the fat but
the active heart, the one who is extremely

00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:59.630
active.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:04.179
All the time thinking of the future and all
that is in for a heart attack.

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:07.610
It’s so simple as that.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.659
So now, you have to just give a balance to
a person.

00:26:10.659 --> 00:26:13.529
Who is a right sided, you give him a balance.

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:17.820
Make left and right, he is cured.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:24.600
When you know the “tatwa”, the principle-how
you get diseases then can you not cure it,

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.369
if you know how to cure the “tatwa”?

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:29.340
Sahaja yoga is like that.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.480
Sahaja yoga knows the principle and principles
are a few.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.450
Like colors are very few.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.450
Isn’t it?

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:38.450
The mixtures are there.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.980
Permutations and combinations are there.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.070
But if you know the principle, you just put
the principle right and the person is alright.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:53.679
Like the person (unclear text) was going to
Houston for a By-pass(surgery) and I was speaking

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:57.230
in a Rotary Club, in Delhi.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.749
There were about two thousand people.

00:26:59.749 --> 00:27:03.649
Suddenly he (text1-shot up/text2- stood up)
came to me and said, “Mother I have to go

00:27:03.649 --> 00:27:04.649
to Houston”.

00:27:04.649 --> 00:27:07.160
I said but I am flying out today to Bombay
to go to Pune.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.190
I have to go to Pune.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.480
He said, “I live in Pune”.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.059
I said, Alright, I’ll meet you there.

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:16.330
He came to see me twice, I think and I gave
him vibrations then he went back to Bombay

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.840
and all the doctors said, “Oh!

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840
What happened?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.470
These were not your, perhaps these were not
your X-rays or what?

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.470
Its completely cured.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.210
100% and all that By-pass and all that is
over.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:31.619
And for this, what are you going to pay?

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:33.590
This is just flowing.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.419
I mean you are also not obliging anyone.

00:27:35.419 --> 00:27:39.400
That’s the worst part of it that people
think I am obliging.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.400
No.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.710
See, if you are part and parcel of me, say
for example My finger is something wrong and

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:50.049
I just rub it then I am obliging my finger?

00:27:50.049 --> 00:27:52.340
I mean if you are part and parcel of me how
can I oblige you?

00:27:52.340 --> 00:28:01.649
That’s what they were saying that you have
to become the part and parcel of the whole.

00:28:01.649 --> 00:28:03.710
You just become part and parcel of the whole.

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.029
The arbitrary behaviour becomes malignant.

00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:14.190
Arbitrary behaviour of a cell becomes malignancy.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.139
Because the centers, now I will tell you about
cancer also on the same simple way.

00:28:18.139 --> 00:28:21.580
See, its a simple way of explaining cancer.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:22.580
Any cancer.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:28.950
Now, we can say that, with my hands I might
be able to show you that left hand and right

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.582
hand are two sympathetic nervous systems and
these are the centers in between.

00:28:32.582 --> 00:28:33.582
You can see that.

00:28:33.582 --> 00:28:34.582
(Shri Mataji makes a pyramid with her fingers
and joins the thumbs and index fingers of

00:28:34.582 --> 00:28:35.582
both the hands to show the position.)

00:28:35.582 --> 00:28:36.582
Alright.

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:37.582
These are the centers.

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:41.740
Now, what happens..a person starts a doing
something extraordinary.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.429
Something emergency he creates within himself.

00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:46.409
It can be with anything.

00:28:46.409 --> 00:28:51.730
Now he creates an emergency uses too much
of his sympathetic supposing he uses the right

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.730
side too much.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.250
Then what happens is this starts wobbling
like that.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.620
(Shri MAtaji shows this with her hands) this
center.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:05.539
And the center starts wobbling and the, there
is a deity inside this which keeps the relationship

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:06.539
with the whole.

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:10.639
The deity just sleeps off and the relationship
is broken.

00:29:10.639 --> 00:29:16.630
The relationship with the whole is broken
because the medulla oblongata has got you

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:22.399
see, inside though to the physical mind it
has not broken but to the subtle thing, is

00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:23.399
finished.

00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:24.399
There is no relationship with the whole.

00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:27.480
So what happens, the cells here have no messages.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.940
So they become on their own.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.190
And they start becoming bigger and bigger.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.190
They become on their own.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:37.700
You see, they become very ambitious.They start
growing bigger and bigger.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.100
That’s how you get malignancy.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.100
Simple thing as that.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.591
Now what do we do for Sahaja Yoga. it is very
simple.

00:29:42.591 --> 00:29:47.429
If you are a realized soul what you have to
do is very simple is to just put your hand

00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:48.749
to the center at the back.

00:29:48.749 --> 00:29:52.450
So by giving vibrations you awaken the deity
and its again sucked back.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.789
You have put together in relationship with
the whole.

00:29:57.789 --> 00:30:03.289
I mean, I must tell you I cured Mr. Sanjeev
Reddy, you may write to him and ask him.

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:09.190
Now he had come from America he had gone for
an operation and the operation was a failure.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.470
And he was in a horrible mess.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:14.500
He could not sleep and he was in a big pain
and they tried all kinds of injections and

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.820
I mean you can imagine Sanjeev Reddy (unclear
text) I went with my husband to see him because

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820
he knew my husband.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.029
He knew me also.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:26.690
But our high commissioner was * Nehru and
I don’t know why he said to his wife, “you

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:31.259
know, this is Mataji Nirmala Devi” She had
heard my name in Delhi.

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:36.119
She said, “Mataji please cure my husband”
otherwise my husband is not going to say anything.

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:38.630
So I just put my hand on his back, for ten
minutes.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.440
You won’t believe, in ten minutes.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.440
Oh God!

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.299
I am feeling so relaxed, let me sleep now.

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:48.230
He slept off and they were thinking...I mean
it was all last thing.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:53.970
See, so they had prepared everything that
they didn’t expect him to come alive.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.230
And when walked out they got a shock of their
lives.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.379
You see, they had brought ambulances, he said
“I don’t need any ambulance, nothing.

00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:01.710
And just walked off,you see.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.590
And then he went on for a tour.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.999
And then when i went to see him, he showed
me his back.

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:13.590
He said, “even the scratches, which one
should see atleast a scratch of the operation.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:17.019
Even there is not even a scratch, you can’t
see.

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:18.019
Imagine.

00:31:18.019 --> 00:31:20.639
The kundalini has done it.

00:31:20.639 --> 00:31:24.429
The kundalini is your mother.

00:31:24.429 --> 00:31:26.710
She is the one, sitting down there.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.879
Just waiting this thing to happen.

00:31:28.879 --> 00:31:31.299
Because she is your “Shudha icha” (pure
desire).

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:33.460
She is the pure desire.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.399
The rest are “Vikrutas”.

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:36.850
They are perverted.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.529
The real desire one has is to become one with
God.

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:45.679
unless and until that desire is fulfilled
you are not going to be happy.

00:31:45.679 --> 00:31:48.250
So that desire is sitting down there.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.639
She is your mother.

00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:51.919
Everybody has individual mother.

00:31:51.919 --> 00:31:56.460
And when this pure desire rises, she integrates
all these centers.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.769
That’s how you get integrated.

00:31:59.769 --> 00:32:04.090
And then she comes upto here (Shri Mataji
touches her Sahastrara) and you can even feel.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.460
In many people the “lup-dup” you see.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.960
“Anahat”, anahat means without percussion.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.869
The sound you hear on the head.

00:32:14.869 --> 00:32:18.539
You can even see in many people the kundalini
pulsating.

00:32:18.539 --> 00:32:21.059
Actually with naked eyes you can see.

00:32:21.059 --> 00:32:28.269
Today only, we had somebody who had a kundalini
which was just pulsating at the base.

00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:31.419
If there is no way of getting out, pulsates.

00:32:31.419 --> 00:32:36.879
Poor thing, you know it just...some people
have just kundalini that just goes on tossing

00:32:36.879 --> 00:32:42.169
that “oh God, when I am going to give birth
to my child.”

00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:43.390
and then.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.620
If you can smooth it out, bring it out.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.620
It just comes up.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.139
And then you feel a cool breeze coming out
of your head.

00:32:50.139 --> 00:32:52.080
Which is not possible medically.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.009
Is it possible?

00:32:54.009 --> 00:33:00.370
You feel a cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel cool breeze blowing into your

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.370
hands.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.370
Then, this is the power.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:03.370
Which is the all-pervading power.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:06.610
The “Brahma-tatwa” which you can use.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.850
Which is all integrated.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:14.450
In Sahaja Yoga language we call it Mahakali,
Mahalaxmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:19.679
Then you understand, what was Mohammed Saa’b,
what was Zoraster, what was Christ, who they

00:33:19.679 --> 00:33:20.679
are.

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:21.679
Everything we understand.

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:26.940
They are all integrated, we are only people
fighting among ourselves.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.779
And it works out so beautifully you can’t
imagine.

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:34.090
I wish, all of you get your realization and
work it out.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.580
I would like to answer your questions, if
you have any please ask me.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.679
And then let’s have it.

00:33:41.679 --> 00:34:11.830
(Shri Mataji finishes her lecture and sits
down at the chair)

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:12.830
Someone from the audience:- Inaudible text.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.830
Shri Mataji in hindi:- What are they saying?

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:14.830
Yogi:- Can any accidents can occur in Kundalini?

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:16.070
Shri Mataji:- No, no not in this.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.780
You see, now there are people who have written
books and books about kundalini.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.710
I was myself shocked you know when I read
them.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:24.710
It’s all absurd.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.940
You see a person who does not know how to
handle even a scalper and tries to operate

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.080
someone, what will happen?

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.210
That’s what it is.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:34.270
Audience:- Inaudible.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:38.420
Shri MAtaji:- No, kundalini process there
are no accidents, nothing.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.169
Nothing happens like that.

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:50.510
I am just telling that these are Naive people
who do not know how to handle it.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.280
Alright!

00:34:52.280 --> 00:35:04.270
Audience:- They are saying now that guru is
needed for all this yoga and (* unclear text.)

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:10.140
Shri MAtaji:- They are saying because they
don’t know how to do it.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:16.300
Supposing somebody says, “oh you see, Medical
Science is horrible, don’t go near it.”

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.140
Because they don’t about it what can you
do?

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:24.790
It’s like putting your fingers in the plug
and saying that electricity is shocking.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.160
You must know the thing.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:36.540
First of all and secondly such a person has
to be a person of character.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:46.530
You see a man who is taking money from you,
God does not give blessings to such a man.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.530
Isn’t it?

00:35:47.530 --> 00:36:05.760
Or he is trying to make money out of you or
he is trying to be...he is a bad character

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:22.610
man, is a horrible man and he has….you know
“paapi man” (sinner) you can call it.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:28.190
Such a person can not do it.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.710
He doesn’t do it.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.220
These are all money making propositions.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.500
And it is only Shri Ganesha who gets angry.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.580
Not kundalini.

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:53.130
Poor thing she does not do anything but it
is the anger of Shri Ganesha which works on

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.130
the sympathetic.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.130
That also you will know, what happens.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.130
Audience:- (Unclear text) bhakti in Sahaja
Yoga?

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.130
Shri Mataji:- Bhakti?

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.130
Bhakti is very important.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.130
I mean if you believe in God, then God looks
after you.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.130
But Bhakti can be an extreme step also.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.130
Like you are calling, “God, God” when
the God stands before you still you are calling

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.130
God.

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.130
You see that is too much.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:04.130
Isn’t it?

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.130
Like, Tulsidasa he wrote so much about Ramayana
and all that.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:10.140
But when Shri Rama came to him and he also
gave him a (unclear) still he could not recognize

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.140
him.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.140
So what’s the use of such a blind bhakti.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.140
It should not be blind.

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.140
It should be from heart.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.140
Very important.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.140
If somebody is a man who has done bhakti from
his heart he gets Sahaja Yoga very fast.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.140
But actually, now I have seen in Sahaja Yoga
has become so powerful that everyone gets

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.140
realization.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.140
Not difficult.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.140
Everyone gets it, not difficult.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.140
In the villages if you see six thousand people
sitting, all will raise hands.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.140
But the complicated and rather difficult (unclear
text) or if you have some disease.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.140
That also you can make out on the kundalini
but and also there kundalini stops.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.140
You’ll be amazed if there is somebody.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.140
Say comes to me and he has a liver problem
then the kundalini goes and she goes on hitting

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:26.140
the liver you see.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:29.400
And even a person who does not understands
that liver is there, he puts his hand and

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.970
there because he sees the kundalini hitting
there.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.040
So it just shows where the problem is.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.580
Even if you don’t understand any medicine
you will know where the problem is because

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.900
you know the kundalini will go and start hitting
that point.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:48.490
And you will see with your naked eyes.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:55.550
Audience: How would you explain the pulsation
of the head in kundalini, please?

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.650
Shri MAtaji:- Sahastrara you mean?

00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:03.620
Audience:- According to A* (unclear text)
because as we know in case of an adult…

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.610
Shri Mataji:- See, I’ll tell you.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.760
In the brain you see, where the pituitary
and pineal body, in the center of that you

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.910
can say the optic chaisma.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.080
There is a very subtle center called Agya
Chakra.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.910
Which is very important.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.320
Which goes on working when you think too much.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:28.380
And the backside is the one which is surrounded
by, you see..I would say that the limbic area

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.380
has got all the seven chakras.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.720
All the seven chakras within it.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.250
All the seven chakras limbic area has.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.730
But they are called as the “Pithas”.

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.240
Pitahs means the seats of the chakras.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.250
So all these chakras are represented in our
brain.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.250
Alright.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.400
In the limbic area.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:48.720
Now out of that this agya chakra is genuinely
here and the pitha is also here.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.320
The outside, this is the window of that agya
chakra which is in the center of pitutary

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.810
and pineal and it controls pituitary and pineal.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:38:58.810
Alright.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:06.910
Now, at the back side of it, it has only two
windows so it is here and here at the back.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.280
And surrounding that, surrounding is Swadhisthana
Chakra.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.380
The same one i told you about working poor
thing which has to work very hard.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:21.360
Now this one, when you get diabetes what happens
that the swadhisthana goes out of order and

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.190
that’s how you get blind.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.010
Because swadisthana is surrounding this.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.010
Here.

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:30.360
so all the seven chakras are in the limbic
area.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360
Is very interesting.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.090
Yogi:- He said that how do you get the pulsation
here? (he points his hand to sahastrara)

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.090
Shri Mataji:- Pulsation here?

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:37.090
Pulsation you said?

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.090
Yogi:- Yes.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:40.720
Shri Mataji:- because the kundalini rises,
she crosses through this (Shri MAtaji points

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.030
to the Agya Chara) and then you start feeling
the pulsation.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.660
Because it is trying to break through.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.164
When it breaks, then you get the, that’s
how you get the pulsation.

00:39:49.164 --> 00:39:52.940
You can even with the stethoscope hear the
pulsation on the different chakras to begin

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.330
with then ultimately here you get the pulsation.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.330
Then it breaks, you see.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:00.820
The thing it becomes, you know fontanelle
bone area becomes soft.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.730
Just like a child’s fontanelle bone.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:07.990
In a person who is bald headed, sometimes
you see the whole thing opening out like that

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:13.600
and then you feel the cool breeze coming out.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:21.990
Pause
Shri MAtaji:- So should we have realization?

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.090
Let’s try.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.240
(unclear text) Alright.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:33.530
Take out your shoes, that’s it.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.880
Because the Mother Earth helps us.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880
You see these are all the five elements which
have gone upside down.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:37.880
That’s all.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.880
Just take out your shoes.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.880
That’s all.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:40.880
Is very simple.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880
Anybody can get no problem.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880
According to these western people, Indians
are very easy.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:54.600
They are a very quality of people.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:00.520
They are dharmic and they are very great,
according to them.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:06.630
And I must also confess that I really break
my hands in the west.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.110
In India, I must say, they know it very well.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.760
They have to break also.

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.210
Not only me.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.210
They have to do the same.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:16.170
So they are very happy here because giving
realization to Indians is very easy.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.720
But giving realization to western people is
very difficult.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.260
So they also have suffered all of them.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.960
So they will stand by me.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.811
(unclear text) they all have, they all know
that this is the (bhoot?/Unclear) because

00:41:24.811 --> 00:41:26.800
they are very complicated.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.890
Extremely complicated.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:33.880
So many attacks have come to them that they
are complicated, thinking is too much.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.375
Like this fellow “Freud” has to (Unclear)wrong
ideas into their heads.

00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:44.300
And there is “Bawa” and all this nonsense
and who was that...what was the unholdy trinity

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.050
you were talking about?

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.370
Where is he?

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.370
Bryan?

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.560
“Freud nature of (God/gardener)..

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.990
{Laughter, Shri MAtaji laughs then says a
sentence in Marathi}

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.740
Shri Mataji:- Ah, that’s it.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.632
You see, that’s it, that’s how they have
been attacked.

00:42:00.632 --> 00:42:01.720
And they accepted all this.

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:07.330
You see, we may be educated in western education
but we don’t forget about God.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:13.110
I mean think about God as a part of us and
dharma is within us.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:19.640
(Shri Mataji says something in Marathi) and
even Indians if they take to adharmic life

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.820
they still remember that this is adharmic.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.100
But for them it has become so difficult to
remember that this is dharmic, adharmic.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.110
That’s an another world.

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:31.170
Another world, you (unclear) with them nothing
is dharma.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.170
Is poor thing you know.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:37.130
They have been attacked so much and they are
all saints born.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.891
Surprising part is that they have been saints
they were born in such countries where there

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:46.010
was affluence and they are attacked.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:50.090
These are saints, definitely.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.330
And those who are seekers there are tremendous
seekers.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:59.190
I mean you will be amazed these people, they
have been druggists and alcoholics and all

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.190
sorts of people.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.190
But the day they get realization next day
they give up.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.190
Indians don’t.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.190
(Everyone laughs.)

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:04.190
Indians are chickens.

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:05.190
They don’t.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.190
(Laughter, everyone laughs with Mother) I
must say.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.190
Na, Indians don’t you know so easily.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:08.220
They do it, they are saints.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:15.410
(pointing towards western yogies) this is
the quality that way is very good.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:18.410
But on the whole, you see totality.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:22.340
I am saying, in general, it’s horrible.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.340
But they are saints.

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:27.000
Because the way they give up their things
is amazing.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.120
Here, you give realization.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.840
(Marathi sentence something about the habit
of having tobacco) it’s like that.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.100
You see, they stick on to something.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.380
I don’t know why, these people just give
up.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.380
Overnight!

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:38.380
They are very determined.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.750
That’s how thing is there.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.570
I mean that goes in their favour and this
goes in your favour.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:49.860
My condition is that some people don’t have
teeth, and some people don’t have “chanas”

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.050
(roasted chickpeas) and some people don’t
have chanas and they have teeth.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.250
It’s like that.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:56.260
So it’s a funny situation.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.260
Alright.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.260
So let’s have it.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:03.160
Now you don’t have to be serious about it,
nothing but it is a very serene thing.

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.370
It’s not serious but serene.

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:06.370
Just put your hands like this.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:10.420
(Shri Mataji opens her palms to show) that’s
all and close your eyes that’s all.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.960
That’s all.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:17.370
Just put your hands straight like this.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.370
Straight!

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.080
I think better to take out your spectacles
put them.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.080
This also helps your eyes very much.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080
Spectacles you may remove later on.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:27.440
Just, it’s so fantastic to (continue/unclear
text) It’s another world I am talking about.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.440
Hmm…

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.280
Just close your eyes please.
