00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:08.950
I knew English were the most intelligent people,
but I must say they have also very sharp and

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:16.270
pure intelligence to get to the right point.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:29.029
It is said that at Sahasrara the Goddess incarnates
as Mahamaya.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:37.090
Because the job She has to do is of a very
different nature.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:52.440
At the heart chakra, Anahata, She has to just
defend, just defend the seekers from the clutches

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:03.100
of the evil forces which are also not so subtle.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.210
They are very gross like forms, human forms.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:23.540
And it’s easy to fight and have a war with
them, kill them.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.980
But at the point of Sahasrara, the work is
very complicated.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:40.720
First of all, the Sahasrara of the human beings
is itself a very complicated thing.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:54.610
First of all, it’s not that the time is
very precarious, but also every country has

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.770
its own complication to add to Sahasrara.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:10.640
Apart from that, you know, in Sahasrara we
have got the seats of all the centres, not

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.560
only the seven centres we are dealing with.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:24.130
And so many nadis are worked out through Sahasrara.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:39.090
So, the chakras, where the Deities have to
work, have to deal with much less complications

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:51.540
than the Deity at the Sahasrara where there
are so many centres and so many nadis, and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:03.900
it has to act on the Sahasraras of the seekers.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:16.130
Say, for the Deity at the heart or at the
Vishuddhi, the people are not so complicated,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.770
they have not to be given Realization.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.000
Nothing has to happen to their brains as such.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:44.560
Only, you have to just see that they are protected
through, that they achieve a sense of security

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.890
– nothing more than that.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.480
They have to feel that they are secured with
God.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:06.740
While the complication is so little that they’re
extremely sensitive and they are absolutely

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.740
dedicated.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.310
They are not to be told that, “You have
to sacrifice."

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:21.629
They are not to be told that, “You should
become righteous or virtuous,” they are

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:24.120
already righteous, virtuous, and also sacrificing.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.590
No one has to tell them.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:37.960
But in modern times, as you see, things are
much more complicated.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.409
Human beings have complicated their brains
so much.

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.719
It’s complications after complications.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:56.840
When I see that, I just feel that Mahamaya
is the only One who can save them.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:11.169
Shri Krishna was also using a wee bit of it,
but not in the way it is used today.

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:25.250
One part of it is that He could appear before
people, very few, only Arjuna, as the Virata.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:32.099
He could kill people with his Sudarshan.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:47.490
At the time of Christ also, Mahamaya Power
acted for his own life, that He was crucified

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.250
and He was resurrected through Mahamaya power
only.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:04.030
Because it is miraculous; Mahamaya Power is
the miraculous Power of God.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:13.400
And the miracles are created through his Power.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:24.150
Before, [it] was through the Deities themselves,
like it worked on the Deities.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:39.569
As Shri Rama, Himself, turned a stone into
a woman called “Ahilya."

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:57.639
He flushed an arrow into the “Sitanani”
[Sita’s bath], where he got the water out

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.410
[Vinolli tirtham].

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:07.619
Mohammed Sahib hit a stone and got water out
of it, same with Moses, the way He created

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:12.409
way for the people to cross over.

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.319
All these miracles are done through Mahamaya
Power.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:24.619
But this Power acts through these forces,
through these Deities.

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:40.939
But today, it being incarnated in its full
force, is acting through you, is acting towards

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:43.339
you.

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:50.030
It is helping you in a very big way which
I don’t know if the complicated brains are

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.759
aware of.

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:05.030
So many dimensions it is working, because
first of all, we have this horrible thing

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.370
called ego.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:15.949
That we think we know everything, as I told
yesterday, the theologians I described.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:24.990
Many people, in Sahaja Yoga also, think like
that, start thinking that they are something

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.990
great.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:33.279
All that was first a gross attraction becomes
very subtle attraction.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:38.820
They start using it.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.919
In both ways it acts.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:51.339
With some people it may act in a way that
you want to enjoy

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:57.580
the game of power, those who have missed it
or those who know how to use it.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:05.389
There could be another type who are the ones
who think they have always suffered and they

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:10.589
are suffering now also.

00:09:10.589 --> 00:09:20.300
There can be another type of a group of people,
who, when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they have

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.639
complications of emotions.

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:33.370
I know of some people, I’ve heard, that
they felt attraction for a man or a woman

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:43.019
and they started behaving in that fashion
– after coming to Sahaja Yoga!

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:49.649
Sometimes, the attraction to money, attraction
to greed and lust becomes subtler.

00:09:49.649 --> 00:09:58.200
So, the Mahamaya being the subtler force,
it’s the subtlest of all, which you cannot

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:07.829
understand and can’t explain through your
brains at all, acts and just stupefies.

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:09.060
It stupefies.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:15.480
Unless and until that is done, they cannot
stop it, they cannot cut themselves away.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:26.269
They, in a subtler way, they remain the same,
but not aware of it.

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:33.870
People who are miserly become miserly, in
a very subtle way, in a very sophisticated

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.209
way, but they are miserly.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:43.949
Those who are dominating become dominating
in a subtler way.

00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:52.550
Those who are murmuring are doing it in a
subtler way; complaining are doing in a subtler

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.550
way.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.730
And that’s why the Mahamaya acts.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.069
First of all, it stupefies you, completely.

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:10.660
So, you realize that whatever you think or
react to something, to certain situations,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:17.889
it’s a Maya, is just a hallucination created.

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:25.420
Now for example we’ll take the second chapter
of Gita, which is written about a “sthita

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.420
prajna”.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.879
The one who is a yogi, who is a Sahaja Yogi,
to him, everything should be same: whether

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:38.670
somebody insults you or whether somebody loves
you; whether somebody discards you, whether

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:44.550
somebody accepts you; whether somebody is
generous to you or whether somebody is not

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.649
generous to you.

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:48.980
You are a sthita prajna, it makes no difference.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.850
He’s above everything, he is floating in
the boat of joy.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.360
Nothing can disturb such a person.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.980
That’s the sign.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:08.759
If your joy can be disturbed by anything else
that means you are not yet a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:20.470
Now, when I see people getting involved into
their backgrounds, we’ll take an example

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.279
of Indians, for example.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:23.664
It’s better to talk about others.

00:12:23.664 --> 00:12:24.664
[Laughter.]

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:28.459
We can see the defects of others much more
easily than our own.

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:29.459
[Laughter.]

00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:34.040
That’s a human nature I understand that.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.329
[Laughter.]

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:46.790
Now the Indians are very clever, as far as
the spiritual side is concerned, I must say.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:54.120
Now, they would say that “We must have at
least ten pujas somehow, when Mother comes

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.120
here."

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.449
So, they’ll manage, “This is also there,”
then “This is also there,” then, “What

00:13:01.449 --> 00:13:04.250
about Mohammed Sahibs’ birthday?” then
“What about Moses’ birthday?” – which

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.379
they don’t know, but they’ll find out
somehow.

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:09.379
[Laughter.]

00:13:09.379 --> 00:13:16.709
And then “What about also Lao-Tse’s birthday,
why not find it out?

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:24.690
So, when Mother is here, invariably every
third day let us have a puja."

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.420
So, I understand them very well.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:35.259
Because what happens in puja they know, because
traditionally they know.

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:43.350
Since the time of Vedas, they know what happens:
that in the puja, your Deities which are weak,

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:53.129
are being also weakened by your own efforts,
get suddenly strengthened, they get power.

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:58.699
And that’s what you feel the power, but
that’s again, I would say, a temporary sensation,

00:13:58.699 --> 00:14:06.279
because if you cannot maintain that vitality
in them, then again, they become weak.

00:14:06.279 --> 00:14:15.560
So, they know at the time of the puja we get
that strength, so why not use Mother nicely?

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.940
Fix Her up.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.470
As soon as I go there, I’m fixed for pujas.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:28.990
First puja as soon as You arrive, second puja
as soon as third day and fourth day, something

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.990
like that.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.949
I said, “What is that?”

00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:33.930
– “That’s Abrahams’ birthday."

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:39.879
[Laughter] – “Then you better do Abrahams’
Puja – why Mine?”

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:44.810
Everybody is anxious to pay for the puja,
very anxious.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.189
And they are quite surprised, you see.

00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:52.279
I think last year it happened that some of
the Europeans – because they are stupid

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:57.209
on this point – they objected, “Why should
we pay for the puja eleven rupees?” or something.

00:14:57.209 --> 00:15:02.939
And they were quite surprised, “They are
so stupid, you see, we are cleverer than them."

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:13.149
And what is eleven rupees, after all?

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:15.950
So, I have to stupefy.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.910
And then, once they are stupefied, you need
puja time.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.269
Somehow invariably it happens that they can’t
do the puja.

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:31.329
There would be an “amavasya” [New Moon]
that day, would be a day when there is no

00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:39.610
moon or maybe there is no Venus, Venus has
to be there; something wrong in the dates

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:46.730
or something in the Panchanga which they consult;
something wrong with the hall, you just don’t

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.029
get it, suddenly dissolved.

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:57.620
Or, there’s something happens to the main
priest, who cannot come.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.730
They’re surprised, “Mother, why didn’t
we have the puja?”

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.430
I said, “Why don’t you do it yourself?

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.149
Work it out!

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:10.360
You have to deserve so many pujas, the way
you are fixing Me up.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.069
Do you deserve that?

00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:17.589
Do you have the pitchers to fill in all the
Grace that I want to flow?”

00:16:17.589 --> 00:16:23.050
Normally, any fake Guru would love to have
pujas after pujas, because he doesn’t have

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:29.220
to do anything: you sit down, take all the
money that comes in.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:39.389
Then they realize why everything has failed,
despite it’s a puja-day.

00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:40.999
Why?

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:52.339
Because Mahamaya’s job is somehow to manage
your ascent.

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:57.220
First to cleanse you.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.589
Even cleansing is so difficult!

00:17:00.589 --> 00:17:12.150
Because, in a country like England or America
or all these places where ego is so strong,

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:20.180
if you tell anybody, “That’s wrong with
you,” they are willing to leave Sahaj Yoga.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.970
If not Sahaja Yoga, they will say, “No,
no, Mother, how can that be?

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.990
I’m perfectly all right others are wrong.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.010
I’m the best."

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:35.500
So, one has to cleanse the person.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.572
And how do you do it?

00:17:38.572 --> 00:17:44.080
You have to stupefy that person.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.390
And that person himself has to realize, because
in these modern times you cannot tell anything

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.400
to anyone directly.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.320
They think they’re obliging Me by being
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.880
They don’t know what they have achieved.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:14.390
There was a fellow who was very bad, I must
say, in a way.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:21.140
He got a very big job somewhere, he told Me
he’s got a big job.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.520
And then he started misbehaving with some
person.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.260
And he lost the job.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.360
“What happened?”

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:36.440
“I don’t know, they wrote to me that we
are not wanted you anymore."

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:43.110
Then I had to tell, “There must be something
negative about you."

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.110
And then he confessed the thing to Me.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:55.200
But why go this circuitous way?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:09.050
Mahamaya also creates a big camouflage; I
look like you, exactly like you.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:22.660
Not in the camera of course, camera is the
one that exposes Me many a times.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.670
[laughter.]

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:46.710
And, your eyes can sometimes discern something.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:51.810
You see some things, but you forget what you
have seen, you forget all that.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:55.460
That’s also Mahamaya: “Bhranti Rupena
Samsthita”.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.550
That also gives you illusions, you forget
all that.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:06.500
You forget how you got your Realization, how
you have been helped by Sahaja Yoga, how things

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.100
worked out so well for you – everything
you forget.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.000
That is also part of Mahamaya.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Why?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.590
The reason is you are to be tested, how much
you are aware.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.820
You must be tested.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.750
How far have you gone?

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:33.200
If you can judge others, that doesn’t mean
that you are very high.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:38.050
It is your Mother who has to judge you.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.770
You have to judge yourself.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:49.830
But if you have ideas that you can deceive
Mahamaya, you cannot.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:54.960
But Mahamaya can deceive you, that’s the
power of Mahamaya.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.100
It deceives you.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:06.440
Actually, there is no sin in deceiving somebody
who is trying to be stupid.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:16.840
It deceives you, it makes you run towards
the left when you have to go to the right;

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:30.120
it makes you get hit; it makes you suffer
a little bit – little bit, not much – so

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.850
that you yourself in your own wisdom rise.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:42.710
Not to be satisfied with yourself, but rise
into your ascent.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:55.160
So, that you develop your own maturity to
rise; that you don’t justify yourself, don’t

00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:02.350
appreciate yourself, don’t watch yourself,
but you see that you ascend.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:11.640
I’ve known people in Sahaja Yoga who have
been here for years together of no use.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.930
And at the right time they are hit back.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:19.600
But there are people who have shot up like
anything in a very short time.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.610
And I hope they keep their ascent on.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:33.990
So, on one side, it deceives you, it camouflages,
you just don’t understand.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:39.040
Like I went to America and I deliberately
asked people that you must get me some Coca-Cola

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.800
when I’m sitting there, not water.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:50.790
When I started drinking the Coca-Cola you
see, all the people who were there were surprised:

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:59.050
“This lady’s taking Coca-Cola, how can
She be Adi Shakti?

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:04.830
[Laughter]
How can Adi Shakti drink Coca-Cola?

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.380
[Laughter]
She should only drink amrut, the ambrose,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.920
how can She drink Coca-Cola?”

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:19.530
But Mahamaya can convert Coca-Cola into amrut.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:30.530
Whatever She touches gets transformed.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:45.720
Like, in the pujas, I wouldn’t say I do
it so deliberately or with action about it,

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:58.990
but sometimes it works out through the Deities
also, because now They understand what is

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.990
their job.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:05.740
They understand that this is the Advent of
the Mahamaya.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:19.940
And They have to see to it that whatever They
do should create that charisma, as they call

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:26.950
it – is a kind of a illusion, a kind of
a illusion that shows like a miracle.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:28.960
They work it out also the same way.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:38.070
When normally – if Shri Krishna has to work
out, He could just go and immediately take

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:45.630
out the head of the person and finished with
it, – bulletin, as they call it.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:50.580
But He does not do, I have seen that, He’s
very clever now, He does not do it.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:25:00.400
He has other ways of grabbing people, who
are against Sahaja Yoga: they just can’t

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:09.940
talk; they lose their voices; they look stupid.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:24.300
Because in this Mahamaya-state all this is
done just to prove that God is there.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:29.020
In all other incarnations nobody challenged
God.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.520
He did not have to prove it.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:38.120
Now we have to prove that there is God.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.910
That’s why the Mahamaya acts in that fashion.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:49.480
That it takes you round and round till you
see it through.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:58.230
It must be approved by your brain that you
have understood what Mahamaya is.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:04.630
Otherwise anybody can say, “I am God, I’m
this, I’m that."

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:11.780
It has to be proved, means your brain must
accept, mentally you must accept that, “Yes,

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:12.890
it’s true."

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:19.420
And that’s why all this drama is played
by Mahamaya.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:29.490
The miracle of Kundalini awakening also stupefies
Me, sometimes, really, it stupefies Me.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:36.590
How it works in thousands of people: When
I went to Dharamshala, when these villagers

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.980
had come, I was really surprised.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:47.930
When I went there they were just waiting for
the Goddess to come in from… as if She’s

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:58.650
going to come from heaven or something, least
bothered as to where they were sitting, who

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.640
were the people there, nothing – all waiting,
anxiously.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:10.540
And when I reached there, I talked to them
– no question, nothing.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:15.030
And while talking to them the Kundalini rose,
they got their Realisation.

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.210
And what is it?

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:24.800
They said, “We have come here for the Devi
Jagran – Awakening of the Goddess.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.680
And we know you are the Mahamaya.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:35.650
So we are not going to be worried about what
you are going to say.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:43.150
Whether you abuse us or do what you like,
we know you are a Mahamaya, we know.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.210
Whatever you may do to us is for our good,
we know that.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.260
Whatever you may say to us we accept it.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.810
Give us awakening.

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.850
That’s all.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.830
We’ll not challenge you , we’ll not say
anything whatever you say is alright."

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.760
I mean, sometimes I talk about cement, about
building, about this.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.520
Normally I talk about this things you see,
normally.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:13.870
But abnormally sometimes, about the Spirit,
because people don’t like it, I think.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:21.480
But even when I am talking about cement, I’m
melting the cement within you.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:30.430
And they said: “We don’t care, Mother,
even if you take a big hunter in your hand

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:32.150
and beat us, it’s alright.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.930
We know you are testing us, but we know you
are the Mahamaya.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.940
It’s all said, you are!”

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:44.850
They were not bothered as to what Sari I was
wearing, what ornaments I was wearing – nothing.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.450
To them it was that, “She’s come now.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:50.940
She’s going to give us Realisation."

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:55.790
They had no image or mental projection about
it – nothing.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:03.840
They knew that I was going to come and that
they are going to get the reward of age-old

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.660
seeking of theirs, that’s all.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:17.630
For such people it’s a pleasure to work,
it’s a pleasure to meet.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:26.390
That’s real joy-giving thing for your Mother.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:39.400
And that’s what they know, that only one
thing is going to give joy to our Mother is

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.640
our ascent – nothing else.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:56.100
And to them they are insignificant, except
that they have to have their Realisation otherwise

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.270
nothing matters.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:03.750
Nobody told me the problems of their families
– nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:15.040
Such pure-hearted people there are, who know
what is a Mahamaya.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:24.430
“Maha” means the great, because it has
all the powers of all the Deities, it controls

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.690
all the Deities; it surmounts over all the
Deities.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:34.530
And “Maya” also means love and compassion.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:36.400
All this effort for what?

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.100
People don’t understand.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.940
In the west people don’t understand why
am I doing it?

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.040
There must be some reason.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.640
It’s compassion.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.530
But the play of the compassion comes through
the Mahamaya power.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:31:02.100
The play of the compassion – it doesn’t
come directly, like, as somebody would say,

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.130
“Alright, now, come along, I’ll give you
100 pounds, have it."

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.600
That’s crude way of doing things.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.930
Mahamaya won’t work like that.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:20.200
You are in trouble and you ask for money,
“What am I to do, Mother?”

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:26.810
Suddenly you find on the post somebody sends
you money, saying, “Oh, I had borrowed money

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:32.600
from you long time back and I felt an urge
that I must return.

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.000
This is your money."

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:45.530
And you have forgotten that you had lent that
money to that person, whether really you have

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.950
lent him or not.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.790
You start wondering and you get the money.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.920
That’s Mahamaya, it’s the gracious way.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:32:02.210
When you are in trouble; accidents… or any
physical harm being done to you, then the

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:12.580
Mahamaya acts in such a way that you are stupefied
and the whole being is filled with gratitude.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:23.330
I told you the experience of one airlines
man who was travelling by a plane which was

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:29.520
hijacked, and the people who hijacked tried
to open the door of the [cock]pit where he

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.910
was sitting as an engineer.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:38.950
But he wouldn’t open, so they put a bullet
through and the bullet did not hit him, it

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.320
went on the sides.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.680
So, they pushed the door and came in and they
put two bullets at him and both of them went

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.680
on the sides.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.870
Just imagine, with this little distance.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:59.640
In the [cock]pit there isn’t much space,
but somehow the bullets went on the sides.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:06.840
And he was just saying, “Mother, please
look after me,” that’s all, you see.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:16.810
Then they got so angry that they took out
their daggers and started hitting him on the

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:21.200
head and the daggers bent.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.220
[Laughter]
And they started looking at the dagger and

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.220
his face.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.220
They said, “What are you saying?”

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.310
He said, “No, nothing, I’m just asking
Mother to look after me.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.030
That’s all."

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:38.620
They looked at him and then they became very
friendly, very friendly.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:44.160
[Laughter]
His wife had gone to America.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:54.690
And just see, I must have given saris to most
of you, so many things I must have given,

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:56.550
I don’t even remember.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.940
I had given her one sari.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.800
So when she heard about it, she said: “Nothing
can happen to me, Mother has given Me the

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800
sari."

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.960
She just took the sari to her heart.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.879
And she said, “I know, this sari is the
protection for me.

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:11.620
And nothing can happen to my husband."

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.360
She didn’t go back to India.

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:18.300
She was sure he will be alright.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:27.290
Because it quite circuitous to go to Pakistan
and all that.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.560
And he was alright.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.909
That is how the Mahamaya works – in a gracious
way.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:43.340
In a way that doesn’t make you feel that
it’s so gross and direct way of doing things.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.899
It doesn’t talk about it, say about it.

00:34:44.899 --> 00:34:57.900
I mean, I never want to say how much money
I would have to spend or I have spent, but

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:04.830
the Mahamaya plays on me, and somehow or the
other exposes me too.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:09.580
Even if I try to hide it, it just gets exposed.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:15.881
It’s a good play, sometimes on me of Mahamaya;
how it plays on me because the Deities, you

00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:20.370
see, they also sometimes try to play tricks
with me.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:27.340
As I told them that they had bought a shawl
for Me, for the Guru puja, and I said, “Now,

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:34.000
if you have bought the shawl I’m not going
to take a sari at any cost, whatever you may

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
do."

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
They said, “Mother, but we’ve bought the
sari.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
We’ve done the petticoat."

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.320
I said, “Whatever it is, I’m not going
to take it now at any cost, whatever may happen,

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.340
I’m not taking it."

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.950
They were very sorry, you know.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.110
Because I must have maryadas.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:49.490
“I must teach them maryadas,” I thought.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.610
The Deities are very cunning.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:59.920
So, before the puja I went to the bathroom,
just to wash my feet – you see that’s

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.350
our Indian style, we wash our feet.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:07.611
So just went there to wash my feet and the
taps in India are at any level, you see they

00:36:07.611 --> 00:36:11.340
can be here or they can be there, [Laughter]
can be there.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.850
There’s no restriction on that, you see?

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.370
[Laughter]
So this tap was quite high.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:23.230
So I tried to open it, you see, and the whole
thing opened out and the whole thing came

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.230
out…

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.560
[Laughter]
And I got completely drenched, completely

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.710
from top to bottom.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:36.370
And I came out, and I said: “Now I’ll
have your sari."

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:37.370
[Laughter]

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:44.940
Like this [Shri Mataji also chuckles] and
they were all very mischievously smiling,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:53.580
you know, such a beautiful feeling of love.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:58.470
See that – I should have thought, after
all, “What is a sari?”

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:04.310
If they want to give me, I should have taken
it.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.300
And their love was so great.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.890
What is in a price of a sari, nothing.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:18.310
You see the love of these people played upon
me.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:24.120
And the surprising thing was the sari had
the colour that a Guru should wear… and

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.780
it was so remarkable.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:33.580
All the time, throughout the puja my eyes
were filled with tears, such tremendous joy.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:41.240
How the Deities, how my children are one with
each other, how they are enjoying the rapport

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.240
of each other.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:51.090
That’s the first sign of a Sahaja Yogi:
is he getting related to the Deities, is he

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:54.140
behaving in the way the Deities behave?

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.140
They do not question, they just love Me, that’s
all, just love.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:01.420
And in that love they play tricks on Me, I
know.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.460
I don’t mind.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:10.340
All such little, little tricks played on Me,
are perfectly alright.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.340
Because they love Me.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.970
There are so many instances I can give you,
where they have expressed their sweet love

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:17.970
for Me.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:24.330
In the same way when I find the Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:33.900
Like this time, I’m told that people had
grudges that they were asked for money in

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.900
India.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:41.520
Now I’m rather surprised at that, very much
surprised and shocked.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.040
Because in India, every year, established
Sahaja Yogis try to donate money for all the

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.320
projects they are going to have, for you people.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.770
They don’t need… any projects.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:39:02.230
About 10 lakhs of Rupees [a Million] Bombay
Sahaj Yogis have donated and about 6 or 7

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.370
lakhs of Rupees Delhi Sahaj Yogis have donated.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.480
Even places like Rahuri and all that have
donated money for the projects they want to

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:16.910
have for you, your children, for your retirements.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:23.380
And the first time… first time in all your
life in Sahaj Yoga, the money was asked for

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:29.650
– that too not much, 750 Rupees is nothing.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:37.010
And people felt funny about it, I’m rather
surprised, that… why people felt that way

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:41.930
when, the first time.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:49.320
That also [was] for your projects, for your
children, for your places.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.650
And they collected the money, brought it to
me.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:40:00.920
Out of which I bought the land for you, and
the remaining money I was left with, so I

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.870
said, “You better put it into the Life Eternal
Trust, which is now going to be completely

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:05.870
exhausted."

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.070
They said, “No, Mother, you have no car.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:15.080
You travel by all these old cars and things
and you don’t want to take a new taxi, because

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:17.540
you don’t want us to pay for that.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:29.880
So why don’t you buy this car, for you rself
out of this money?”

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.310
I said, “So sweet of them, to think of my
comfort."

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.640
I mean I can buy a car of my own, no problem
on that.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.640
By God’s grace, C.P.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.440
has that much money to pay for a car for me,
he would love to do that.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.750
But this gesture, this gesture was so beautiful!

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:53.700
And when I refused, the situation developed
in such a manner that I could not refuse that

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.920
money as there was no – that money was collected
out of the Sahaj Yogis and we have to have

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:06.760
certificates that you have… sort of gone
through the right exchange and this and that,

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.100
but I could put it as my own money, I had
to.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.860
That’s all worked out by Deities I think,
again.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:21.290
So when there’s a complete concord between
you and the Deities, then you can use the

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:26.740
Mahamaya power very well on other people.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.900
Before that you cannot – you are using other
powers.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:36.020
These are just, what we call the siddhis,
not the shudra siddhis, not the bad things,

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.710
but the good siddhis that you get.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:43.620
Like you can cure people – is nothing great.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:45.900
You collectively you feel another person.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:51.030
Nothing great, but you don’t feel yourself,
you don’t see your own chakras.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:56.970
You not bothered about yourself.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:13.670
You can be saved, you are protected, you are
helped, you are getting material help, you

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.950
also enjoy spiritual life.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:26.140
But still you have to go much further to get
to Mahamaya powers.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:31.280
You have to go much further to be identified
with the Deities.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:38.550
They are at the beck and call of your Mother,
beck and call.

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:42.430
Even if I do not call Them, They work it out.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:47.610
Like yesterday I did not know there was somebody
from the Archbishop, Bishop of Canterbury,

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:51.940
I did not know at all.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.520
And somebody had come there, as an observer.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:43:00.440
I had no idea, only Gavin told me he saw him
getting up, he didn’t know that he was in

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.810
the audience.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:08.880
And I really [Shri Mataji burts into laughter]
blasted him completely I’m sure.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.880
[Laughter]

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:18.440
That’s all the work of the Deities, They
just turn my mind towards that, They always

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:28.840
give me the full idea as to what sort of an
audience sitting before me.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.410
Complete information, a perfect information.

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:39.180
Now a person comes and tells me about someone
– that’s also very common, very common

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.990
with Sahaja Yogis, in the west specially.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.990
They’ll always tell about someone.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:44.030
I’ve not seen anyone, so far, coming and
saying, “Mother, I’ve got an ego, please

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:45.030
correct it.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.180
Mother, I’ve got a superego, please correct
it.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.370
Mother, I’ve got this problem, please correct
it."

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.480
Always “That person has this problem, that
person has that problem,” they see others,

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.369
very clearly, because we are extroverts.

00:43:55.369 --> 00:44:02.500
And when they tell me, just paying attention
to what they are telling me, not only that

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:08.250
I find out about that person, what’s wrong
with that person, but also I find out what’s

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:15.750
wrong about the person about whom they are
telling, how far to believe these people who

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:17.940
are coming to tell me something.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:21.940
Like in India, there’s one fellow who is
always a murmuring soul, you see, he thinks

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.510
he does a lot of things to Sahaja Yoga, this
and that.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.560
And he formed about five-six people – cliques,
you see, – and they came to see me.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:33.430
Very seriously sitting down, “We have come
for a very serious job!”

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.040
I said, “What is that?”

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:45.470
So, they said, “Certain person who is a
big politician, and he’s just trying to

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:48.980
mislead you , we have come to warn you about
this man.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:56.660
You be very careful!”

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.660
I said: “Really?”

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:03.800
So, just for a second, split of a second,
I went through my computer, you see.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.430
[Laughter] to find out what this fellow is
like.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.420
I said: “Have you told everything about
him?”

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.420
They said: “Yes!”

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.700
“Nothing more to be told?

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:13.700
Sure?”

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:14.700
They said, “Nothing more!”

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.700
“Alright!

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:21.390
I’ll tell you: This man has a wife who is
not his wife, has an illegitimate child.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:27.240
He’s like this, his caste is this, his father
is like this, mother like this, brother like

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.590
this, and this, and this, and this.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.840
[Laughter]
Go back with your non serious jobs of looking

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:38.920
after your Spirit."

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:45.770
There is no need to advise me.

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:56.110
I give you time, I talk to you because I love
you very much.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:19.490
But I love you because you are seekers, because
you have to ascend, because you are a quality.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:24.450
But you are not aware of your quality.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:28.920
Then I have no try some tricks on you.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:36.500
And then you realise, that, “Whatever we
were thinking was all wrong."

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:49.060
Best way is
to surrender.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:47:01.440
Anything comes into your head like that, best
way is to surrender.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:11.820
Because you must know [end of the tape] that
the deity of Mahamaya is extremely….

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.800
[Break in recording]

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.700
…For this understanding you must ascend.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:23.390
There should be spiritual ascent.

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:27.940
Otherwise you cannot understand.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:32.840
If you are living with your ego and superegos,
you cannot understand.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.460
As it is this is Mahamaya, no one can understand
Her.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.540
Even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha could not understand,
it’s so tremendous.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:44.780
It has played tricks on Them also.

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:51.970
But at least you’ll enjoy the play.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.030
You’ll be a vehicle.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:58.310
You ’ll be an instrument of that great power
and you yourself will see how you play Mahamaya

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.320
tricks on others.

00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:07.150
This is again a promise of Mahamaya, so be
careful.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:15.150
(laughter) It’s already been said, you have
already noticed, you have already seen it,

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:21.250
it will not reveal to you everything, because
you cannot bear it, the revelation.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:27.010
But slowly you will see it.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.260
But you must have power to bear it.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:37.119
If you have that power, then there cannot
be anything in between you and me.

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:42.030
We all can become one with that.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:50.750
This Mahamaya power is the one which has given
you Realisation, is the one which is guiding

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.380
you, which is helping you.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.270
So many of you are still keeping to one deity.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:06.160
Like some people who were worshipping Shiva
are still with Shiva, some with Vishnu, some

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.840
with Christ; They’re all with me, all integrated.

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.840
They still go back to the same, I have seen.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.720
That’s a dangerous thing because They won’t
stand with you in that.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.790
Still the attachments are there.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.480
There are also very subtler attachments.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:29.960
Get out of it!

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:34.990
You should have only one attachment and that
is to Mahamaya, and nothing else.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.060
And that’s how it is going to work out further.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:46.940
It’s not difficult for you to understand
because you have sharp intelligence.

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:52.650
But it doesn’t go in the heart, more in
the brain, while those who have lesser intelligence

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:57.810
have a larger heart, it goes into their brain
very easily.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:00.240
Supposing I go to India.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.700
You know all the villagers of India.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:12.810
What will give them the greatest pleasure,
if I ask for something?

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:22.440
Supposing I tell a poor man: “Can I have
half a gram of gold?”

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.300
He will never question.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:35.500
He said, “There must be something, She is
Mahamaya, if She has said it there must be

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:36.500
something."

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.190
He’ll beg, borrow, steal, do something and
get it for me.

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:57.380
Because he sees the complete dimension of
that saying that, “You have to get me this."

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:06.260
He sees it, he knows it, and he’ll work
it out in every way possible.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.260
What is to be done?

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.780
He’ll not think he has to borrow, he has
to do this.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.820
He’s not bothered about this.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:22.060
There’s story of Shivaji which I must have
told you before also, that his Guruji wanted

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:23.560
to take his test.

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:29.619
Because Mahamaya is a testing… testing power.

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:37.150
And he said… to his disciples he said: “I’ve
got a terrible boil on my foot which is about

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:41.240
to burst out,” a huge thing he had here,
tied up.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.660
“And it’s leaking now with the pus is
coming out.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:50.210
And I cannot get it cured unless and until
one of you can suck it."

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.210
– Imagine!

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:52.310
How many of you would agree?

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.150
Won’t even think of it, isn’t it?

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:56.369
What a test!

00:51:56.369 --> 00:51:59.880
And especially Indians who are so worried
about their personal cleanliness.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.930
They wash their hands fifty times.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:02.930
So everybody looked at it, quite worried.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.020
[Laughter]
Shivaji had come that time.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:15.060
And Shivaji said: “Alright, I will do it."

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:25.470
And it was a mango he had put in there.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:37.960
And he sucked it and he said: “It’s very
nice and sweet…!”[Laughter]

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:50.830
One day again he asked that: “I want the
milk of a tigress."

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:54.460
Everybody was quite frightened.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.010
Who is going to milk the tigress?

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:57.710
Shivaji said: “Alright, I’ll go!”

00:52:57.710 --> 00:53:11.680
He went in the forest, and he was looking
out for a tigress who has given her cubs a

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.140
– they, they are even worse.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.770
And he saw some cubs there.

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.150
So he went near them and he started saying:
“See, my guru wants your mother’s milk.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:22.750
Can I have it?

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:23.750
I want to have your mother’s milk!”

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:26.090
The tigress was looking at him.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.530
And he bowed to her.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.950
He said: “You see, my guru wants your milk.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:33.859
What am I to do?”

00:53:33.859 --> 00:53:35.100
And she could see that.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.560
She came and stood before him.

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.670
He had taken a pot with him.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:45.020
He milked her.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:55.240
And he took that for his guru because even
a tiger, even a serpent respects the dedication

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.820
to Reality.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.891
And that’s what is lacking.

00:54:00.891 --> 00:54:07.650
And once that is lacking, you cannot be respected.

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:11.790
And you have to respect yourself.

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:16.350
Whether others respect you or not, makes no
difference at all whatsoever.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:27.640
But if you have respect for you, you won’t
bother about what others have to say.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:36.610
I can make out people who are intensely seeking,
who are just seeking, who are just here because

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:41.980
of certain relations are here, or something
like that.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:48.220
Now those who are intensely seeking will get
what they have asked me for, and that has

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220
everything in it, everything.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:59.700
And those who are casual will also get casual
results, that’s all.

00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:05.869
So the intensity will be fulfilled with much
greater intensity!

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:11.960
No use looking at others; look at yourself.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:16.710
If you are losing your joy, you are no more
a Sahaja Yogi!

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:24.060
You have to be in joy, then only you are a
Sahaj Yogi.

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.619
Mahamaya is a very big subject.

00:55:25.619 --> 00:55:34.190
I can write a complete book on it.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:44.609
I think in this short time, whatever is possible
I have tried to tell you.

00:55:44.609 --> 00:55:49.350
But I would like you to ask me questions today
because Sahaj Yogis never ask questions.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:50.350
In a seminar they should.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:51.350
You are not in thoughtless awareness just
now.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.350
Mahamaya can work it out.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:53.350
Please, ask me questions.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.350
And don’t murmur at the back.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:59.460
If you have any questions, please ask me.

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:09.410
Another point about Mahamaya is: you being
the Mahamaya, you are not afraid.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:17.940
Supposing, Chandi has to stand here with Her
sword in Her hand, nobody would dare go near

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.940
Her.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:24.010
But despite that you people shake sometimes,
I don’t know why!

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.530
Ask some questions – important.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:36.440
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I have a question.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:44.710
When the energy is coming out like this – to
the head, and it’s going to the back and

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:50.130
to the front and – I don’t really know
– I don’t have the clear feeling yet if

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.820
it’s coming up and down here, or if it’s
coming here and here.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.520
And when it goes to here, I’m told it’s
the four stages above the head, the Ardha

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.520
Bindu and up there – it’s going up there.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.710
I’m not quite sure how it’s going through
the head, because on your diagram which you

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:05.840
drew in “Nirmala Yoga,” there’s only
the beginning part, And I’d like you to

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.600
tell us how it’s flowing through the head,
if it’s coming up and down or going like

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600
that?

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.150
Shri Mataji: In your case it is going from
which side?

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:13.540
you feel it’s going this way and that way?

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.900
Sahaja Yogi: This way.

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.160
Shri Mataji: you feel that way…

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:17.160
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:18.960
Shri Mataji: …not from the centre.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:24.440
Sahaja Yogi: I’m confused.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:35.660
Feels sometimes like it comes like a chrysanthemum,
like that somehow.

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.380
Shri Mataji: That means it is going to your
ego and superego, both sides.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.190
So that what has to be done is to pray to
the deity of Christ, so that He sucks in your

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.820
egos and superegos.

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:48.260
When it is sucked, then only you can go in
the centre.

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.260
It is trying to cleanse your ego and superego.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:52.580
You see wherever you have a problem the Kundalini
goes there.

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:53.660
Supposing you have a liver problem.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.080
You can see it.

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:59.310
On my feet when you come, supposing you have
a liver problem, you will see the Kundalini

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:01.230
pulsating at the liver.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:06.010
Supposing you have a problem of ego-superego,
then it goes and works there, tries to clarify

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.050
it and cleanse it.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:18.070
But if you can work out the deity of forgiveness
– that’s Christ – it can suck in.

00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:25.590
So we have to use both the things; we have
to use the Kundalini as well as the deities.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:27.390
All right?

00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:28.890
You must pray.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:31.180
You must pray to Me.

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.940
Meditation doesn’t mean that you don’t
pray.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.160
You r prayers are like mantras.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.180
You must pray.

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:43.900
That’s a good question.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.760
…Now better.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:53.900
It’s rising in the centre.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:58.190
Sahaja Yogi: Mother…

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:03.900
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:14.401
Sahaja Yogi: It’s one prayer, Mother, for
the whole tour of England and Cardiff also

00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:15.401
of course.

00:59:15.401 --> 00:59:19.690
Shri Mataji: Cardiff … (Mother chuckles.)

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:20.690
Yaa.

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.690
Cardiff.

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.010
Should work out in Cardiff.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.280
How do you find?

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.110
Sahaja Yogi: Many false gurus.

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.780
They are more active than us, in fact.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.790
Shri Mataji: False gurus are there…

00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:35.800
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, very much, yes.

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:37.140
Shri Mataji: In Cardiff?

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.150
No-more in London.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.830
[Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: We have newer problems here.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:45.750
Shri Mataji: I was telling Gavin that you
must arrange your tours in England.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.840
I can’t do it now any more.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.369
I shouldn’t do it, because I’ve done – I
mean, every country says that, that: “Mother,

00:59:51.369 --> 00:59:55.280
you have gone through England so many times,
up and down.

00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:59.890
You have really done all the crossroads of
England.

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:02.869
But you couldn’t do that to our country!”

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:07.840
While, now you are so many people, you have
to.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:17.960
That you have to do it now, you have to go
on touring now; Cardiff is a good invitation.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.420
You people should go and work it out.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:30.800
Now there will be holidays, you should go
to different places where I’ve been and

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.440
work it out.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:40.730
It can be arranged very easily as you have
got your friends there, you’ve got your

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:41.730
centres there.

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:51.190
You all should go, advertise, work it out,
put posters, things like that.

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:54.410
You all can work it out – as if I’m going
there.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:55.410
You can use my tapes.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:58.310
Yesterday’s was a tremendous tape.

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:03.750
[That] could be used.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:09.456
Whatever tape you want, you can ask then,
we can do it.

01:01:09.456 --> 01:01:14.630
We can also show them our video tapes.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:20.860
I think you all should arrange it and organise
it.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:29.720
Little money is to be shelled out, doesn’t
matter.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.060
It’s like a holiday.

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:39.500
I mean, those who want to come to India should
come, if they have money, otherwise they shouldn’t

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.500
come.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.950
For the first four years, I paid for their
stay, everything I paid.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.040
Gavin will tell you that.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.820
But now I can’t do it, I’m sorry, for
so many people.

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:56.530
You have to pay for your food and for your
travelling.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:02:02.780
But you must now take it up as a real job
for you to go round England, talk to people,

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:10.280
take groups there, advertise, and work it
out – that’s what you have to do.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:11.820
It’s not such a big country.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.170
You are quite a lot of people.

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.970
Twelve Disciples of Christ spread Christianity
to this extent.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:24.770
And most surprising, all the gurus are well
known everywhere; I’m not so known.

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:29.960
The reason is the Sahaja Yogis enjoy their
Spirit – finished.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.099
That’s one part.

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:36.800
You have to do it.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:44.089
This is what you have to give: is to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:49.270
Maybe, some people may not like you and may
reject you, they may say horrible things to

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.270
you.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.570
You might find certain Sahaja Yogis fighting
with you there – also Sahaja Yogis when

01:02:53.570 --> 01:03:00.280
they are going for the work, they do not work
as a team, they fight.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.480
Indians can’t understand.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.450
See they’ve been listening to you they can’t
understand: “Why these people have arguments?”

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:11.320
I said: “They enjoy arguments for argument’s
sake!

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.080
They don’t mean anything serious."

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.400
They don’t talk, they don’t argue.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.060
They’re just enjoying.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.710
So many of them told me that: “They argue
too much, they talk too much.

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:25.130
They argue all the time among themselves."

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.800
“They like to argue,” that’s what I
told them.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.300
But this is what it is.

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.910
You have to go and that will really help you
for your ascent.

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:42.230
Because why should God give you light if you
cannot give it to others?

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:49.640
But it should not be a thing that it is a
play of your power.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:55.550
It is your dedication it is your service,
for that you should not expect a reward in

01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.839
any way.

01:03:56.839 --> 01:04:01.369
Nor you should try to dominate others.

01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:03.960
Both things are wrong.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.900
If we decide that we have to do something,
there are holidays now.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.970
Three months holidays, I’ll be going to
Europe.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:14.070
You please work it out, it’s a very good
chance.

01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:18.170
my absence can provide a very good chance
for you.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:21.890
That’s what my idea was, that you will take
it over.

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:27.390
Now you don’t wait for my signalling, please
do it.

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:31.610
Those who want to do this work raise your
hands, let’s see.

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:32.690
That’s it.

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.310
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:35.310
Really?

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:36.310
Thank you.

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.380
I believe you.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.839
Thank you.

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:46.099
Why should I worry now for England?

01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:54.710
England is ours, with so many hands and swords
coming out.

01:04:54.710 --> 01:05:05.800
So I leave it to you now to decide, form a
committee, who will go where.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.619
Do not do simultaneously.

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:12.640
Put a force on one place, say Cardiff, you…
so many should go.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.280
Arrange for your food and all that, pay for
it, manage it, somehow.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.210
There are some cheap places where you can
go and stay.

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:22.670
Work it out.

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:28.349
You can have some vans and some lorries or
something, or trucks if you want.

01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:35.150
[Laughter]
We are truck loads, with banners, go round

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:42.460
and do the job.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:47.210
Talk to people, talk to people in the market
places, everywhere.

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:48.210
You all can do it.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:49.950
Enjoy these three months like that.

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:59.900
Then you need not go to India if you don’t
want to.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.160
If you want to go, you can go.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.730
This is not compulsory, or on the contrary
I find it difficult if it’s a big number

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:06.730
sometimes.

01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:15.310
But it’s for your good, you will go there
for enjoying, for your own Self.

01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:21.020
We say that in Sahaja Yoga we don’t take
money, that’s me, I don’t take money,

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.510
it’s the point.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:26.680
I don’t take money, but doesn’t mean that:
“We don’t pay,” I mean that, “We don’t

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:32.080
pay for our food,” or as if the Sahaja Yogis
are on dole, from Mother.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.310
Is it that way?

01:06:34.310 --> 01:06:35.380
Does that mean that?

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:43.750
We have to pay for our food; we have to pay
for our stay; everything we have to pay, as

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.750
respectable people.

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.660
I had said once that we should not be without
jobs.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.870
That’s not very good for us.

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:56.570
But now this country has so much of joblessness,
it’s better to take to that also.

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.140
Some people who cannot afford should not starve
themselves for that.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.320
I don’t want that.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.710
If you are not getting a job, it’s alright.

01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:06.600
You can take a dole till you get your jobs.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600
Don’t starve yourself.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.080
That’s not my point also.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:16.410
If you don’t get a job, then you can take
a dole or whatever is the way is in this country.

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:22.440
But don’t starve yourself and don’t keep
yourself inadequate.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.970
You can take a dole.

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:30.190
But that doesn’t mean those who have jobs
should give up jobs.

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:38.950
[Laughter]
But you are employed by God, know that.

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:42.580
You are employed by God.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.000
Any other question?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:08:00.180
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, what is the relation
between Mahakali and Mooladhara chakra and

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:08.200
how could we strengthen that energy within
the left side?

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200
Shri Mataji: What he say?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.930
Warren: He’s asking what is the relation
of Mahakali with the Mooladhara chakra and

01:08:13.930 --> 01:08:17.739
how we can strengthen that energy of left
side.

01:08:17.739 --> 01:08:20.989
Shri Mataji: Mahakali’s the Mother of Shri
Ganesha.

01:08:20.989 --> 01:08:21.989
She’s the Mother.

01:08:21.989 --> 01:08:22.989
She’s the power of Shri Ganesha.

01:08:22.989 --> 01:08:23.989
He exists because to Him He doesn’t know
anybody else but His Mother.

01:08:23.989 --> 01:08:29.900
And He knows that She’s the most powerful;
I have told you the story of Shri Ganesha

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.929
and Kartikeya.

01:08:31.929 --> 01:08:32.929
That when Parvati-Mahakali…

01:08:32.929 --> 01:08:43.769
Shiva asked Them, that “If one of you can
go round the Mother Earth, then I’ll give

01:08:43.769 --> 01:08:45.630
you some prise.

01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:51.589
And whosoever come first, will get the prise."

01:08:51.589 --> 01:09:08.130
So Kartikeya had a peacock, while Ganesha
had just a mouse, little mouse.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.229
So He didn’t know how to do it.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.359
So He took to His wisdom.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:20.929
He just thought: “Who is greater than my
Mother Mahakali?

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:23.920
No one.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.000
Not even my father, because He can’t exist
without Her.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.070
He has no light without Her, He has no power
without Her, so She’s the highest."

01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:34.910
He said “So why go round this Mother Earth?

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.489
This is the highest of highest."

01:09:36.489 --> 01:09:37.489
He went round Her.

01:09:37.489 --> 01:09:38.589
He got the prise.

01:09:38.589 --> 01:09:46.119
[Laughter]
But Mooladhara is the big problem, I must

01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:47.119
say.

01:09:47.119 --> 01:09:49.199
Will I have another chance to talk to you?

01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:50.199
Sahaja Yogi: Later…

01:09:50.199 --> 01:09:51.199
All weekend.

01:09:51.199 --> 01:09:56.800
Shri Mataji: Then I think I’ll do that later
because I want to talk on that very much.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.449
I think we have talked about one point, is
the sin against the Father – to feel insecured

01:10:01.449 --> 01:10:06.159
about money.

01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:07.380
I see Rustom.

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.909
Look at Rustom.

01:10:08.909 --> 01:10:10.449
He’s saving money.

01:10:10.449 --> 01:10:13.530
“Mother, whatever you want, I’m save…”

01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:16.199
I mean, I don’t want it now, no question
I mean.

01:10:16.199 --> 01:10:17.960
But he says “I’m saving money for that."

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.570
He’s got a big job; he’s saving money
for that!

01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:32.999
Those who are insecured about money must know,
“What are we saving out of whatever we have?”

01:10:32.999 --> 01:10:35.320
I don’t have any need just now.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:40.260
But he wrote to me, “Mother, I got this
job because of you .

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:48.309
Otherwise I cannot think of getting this job."

01:10:48.309 --> 01:10:54.170
In that way, we have to think about the sin
against the Father, to feel insecured about

01:10:54.170 --> 01:11:02.090
money, to talk about money, to worry about
money.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:03.289
Alright have it!

01:11:03.289 --> 01:11:05.030
That’s the way one should be.

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:06.030
Though I’ve never asked you for money so
far.

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:09.489
I have never asked.

01:11:09.489 --> 01:11:15.610
This is one side of all this.

01:11:15.610 --> 01:11:19.730
The sin against the Mother I want to talk
to you later when we have the puja.

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:21.219
Will that be better?

01:11:21.219 --> 01:11:22.219
Alright.

01:11:22.219 --> 01:11:23.219
What about your seminar programming?

01:11:23.219 --> 01:11:24.219
(Yogis laugh.)

01:11:24.219 --> 01:11:25.219
Is a Mahamaya?

01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:33.320
[A yogi makes a comment about planning.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.460
Shri Mataji & yogis laugh.]

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:42.320
Any other question?

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:50.780
You must ask Me a question of this kind, nature.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:51.780
What others would ask you a question, which
you won’t be able to answer – that’s

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780
a better way.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:59.469
What others would ask you a question, which
you cannot answer.

01:11:59.469 --> 01:12:00.479
Yes.

01:12:00.479 --> 01:12:13.050
Sahaja Yogini: Lot of people ask now, how
do we know that the vibrations are right,

01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:14.050
are telling what’s right.

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:15.050
Well they have Realisation, but they wanted
to see more (concerning?) it in a way to know

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:16.050
that it’s right.

01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:17.050
How can we explain to them that it’s right?

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:18.050
Shri Mataji: This is right or wrong?

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.050
“Because,” you have to say that, “Relatively
you have to understand.

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:24.389
Now see, we think that this is – these are
flowers, alright?

01:12:24.389 --> 01:12:29.789
Because we can see it clearly that these are
flowers.

01:12:29.789 --> 01:12:33.020
And you ask five-six people ‘What are these?’

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:34.760
They’ll say, ‘These are flowers!’

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:43.179
But if you ask a blind person, he might say,
‘These are snakes,’ because he can feel

01:12:43.179 --> 01:12:45.639
it through his hands and he cannot understand
what it is.

01:12:45.639 --> 01:12:46.639
All right?

01:12:46.639 --> 01:12:59.789
In the same way, supposing you ask a question,
‘Is there God?’ you get vibrations tremendous.

01:12:59.789 --> 01:13:07.639
If you ask a question: ‘Am I the Spirit?’
you get lots of vibrations coming in.

01:13:07.639 --> 01:13:19.820
Then you get a madman, and put your hands
towards the person, you start burning your

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.820
hands.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:26.979
He’s definitely approved, certified mad
person.

01:13:26.979 --> 01:13:33.699
So then it is proved that what the vibrations
are telling, is the truth."

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:45.420
Once in Puna, first time when I went there,
the program was arranged in a hall, Rajwari’s

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.909
Hall, who is a Brahmin.

01:13:46.909 --> 01:13:52.630
You see he was a brahmin a very austere type
of a Brahmin.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:14:01.920
And when they told that I’m not a Brahmin,
he hesitated and the committee, you see, decided

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.910
that we can’t have a program because She’s
not a brahmin.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:09.910
[Laughter.]

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:10.910
Again Mahamaya.

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:15.090
I’m the Creator of Brahmins, isn’t it?

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:21.099
[Laughter]
So, I did not know actually what was happening,

01:14:21.099 --> 01:14:23.150
because nobody told me anything about it.

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:29.409
And they said that: “Alright, if you don’t
want to have Her program, we’ll give it

01:14:29.409 --> 01:14:33.330
in the newspapers that “No program, because
She’s not a Brahmin.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:36.429
Because we have already published in newspaper
that there’s going to be Her program."

01:14:36.429 --> 01:14:40.739
They got a fright, you see, they thought:
“No, no, no, this cannot be.

01:14:40.739 --> 01:14:46.199
Then they will say “We’re very… sort
of… people, fanatics, and things like that."

01:14:46.199 --> 01:14:48.550
Because Brahmins are that way hated in India.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.820
So they said: “No, no, don’t, don’t
do that.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.709
Alright, we’ll have Her program."

01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:58.300
So when I was having the program, you see
there were about six-seven people sitting

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.880
here – they were shaking like this.

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.999
So I thought I better play a trick on them.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.499
But I didn’t know this had happened.

01:15:05.499 --> 01:15:08.639
I didn’t know anything about it, the background.

01:15:08.639 --> 01:15:19.239
So, I said “Those who are Brahmins, please
come forward."

01:15:19.239 --> 01:15:21.580
So five-six of them – because poor Mr.

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:28.670
Rajwari Agnihotri was suffering from… deadening…
arthritis, he was sitting on that gallery

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:34.209
there, – while four, five of them came forward,
as Brahmins you see came forward, sat.

01:15:34.209 --> 01:15:38.710
I looked at them, “So you are brahmins?”

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:39.710
“Yes!”

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:41.530
One more joined them.

01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:48.449
“Very good, more the merrier!” (laughter)
And then I said: “Now put your hands towards

01:15:48.449 --> 01:15:49.670
me, like this."

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.539
They all started shaking.

01:15:51.539 --> 01:15:54.579
(laughter) Worse than the man!

01:15:54.579 --> 01:15:55.579
So…

01:15:55.579 --> 01:15:59.860
I said “Now, why are you shaking?

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.869
If you are brahmins, you should not shake!”

01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:08.380
He said: “Mother, you are the Shakti, that’s
why we are shaking!”

01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:11.400
“And see there’s people also shaking this
side."

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.130
I said: “Ask them ‘from where do they
come?’”

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:16.209
So, they asked them: “From where do you
come?”

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:21.340
They said: “We are coming from lunatic asylum,
(laughter) all of us, from Thana."

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:27.699
I said: “Now you see, relatively….."

01:16:27.699 --> 01:16:31.519
[Laughter and applause.]

01:16:31.519 --> 01:16:39.580
That is how you have to say how the vibrations
are right.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:40.580
Alright?

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.811
Now, what other questions they would ask?

01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:43.811
Yes.

01:16:43.811 --> 01:16:44.811
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, when we go round with
posters, putting them up in the shops, the

01:16:44.811 --> 01:16:55.320
people always ask us, “What is Sahaj, what
do you mean?”

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:03.989
And in a shop, when you putting up a poster,
you don’t have time to go into great detail.

01:17:03.989 --> 01:17:05.949
What is the best way to just tell them what
is Sahaj, before you put the poster up?

01:17:05.949 --> 01:17:07.269
Shri Mataji: Sahaj means spontaneous, is a
spontaneous happening, is a living force of

01:17:07.269 --> 01:17:12.579
God which works out a living thing.

01:17:12.579 --> 01:17:15.449
Something that is living because God is a
living force.

01:17:15.449 --> 01:17:17.249
That is accepted.

01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:24.780
At that, the Holy Ghost itself has to give
you the birth, and the Holy Ghost resides

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:28.099
within us in the triangular bone which gives
us.

01:17:28.099 --> 01:17:33.360
And it’s a living happening within us which
takes place, which has taken place so far

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.580
– the way we have evolved into a human level.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:44.349
And now, to go further, there is this force
within us which we have experienced, we have

01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:46.960
seen and you have to get it.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.269
And that’s how you proceed.

01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:52.119
See, if they are Christians, start it with
Holy Ghost, it’s better.

01:17:52.119 --> 01:17:54.360
If they are Hindus, it’s not difficult.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:18:01.059
If they are Muslims, also you can tell them
that Mohammad Sahib talked about Assas, talked

01:18:01.059 --> 01:18:04.079
about you have to be a Wali – you have to
become a Realised soul.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:07.179
He talked that at the time of resurrection
your hands will speak.

01:18:07.179 --> 01:18:08.559
So He talked of the future.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:12.349
How do you stop it at Mohammad?

01:18:12.349 --> 01:18:16.800
He talked of the future, throughout He talked
of the future.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:24.900
Moreover, I would say one more thing, we must
have study groups in Sahaja Yoga, very important.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:31.459
I find many people are there, quite a big
percentage, who do not know much about Sahaj

01:18:31.459 --> 01:18:32.459
Yoga.

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:35.999
They are enjoying themselves, they have got
vibrations, they have got this – but they

01:18:35.999 --> 01:18:37.510
don’t know much about it.

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:41.360
They haven’t – so many of them are just
worshipping “Advent” like “Bible,”

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.440
you see.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:57.160
I hope they do not make a microscopic copy
of that and put it here, as Sahaj Yogis, you

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.160
see.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.160
[Laughter]
Everything is possible with you.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:00.160
So.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.039
You must understand, Advent is just a wee
bit of it, but try to understand Sahaj Yoga.

01:19:02.039 --> 01:19:06.010
And some people understand it very well.

01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:09.709
Some people – mentally, you must understand
Sahaj Yog first of all.

01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:14.880
Then we have other books on Sahaj Yog which
you must read, which are simpler books.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:23.320
Then you can ask questions to deal – you
must have a study group.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.030
Alexander started a study group on Sahaj Yoga.

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:29.969
And he charges some money.

01:19:29.969 --> 01:19:32.300
He says: “It works better, Mother."

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.929
But I said: “Why do you charge money?”

01:19:33.929 --> 01:19:34.929
He said: “For the hall.

01:19:34.929 --> 01:19:39.139
But I tell them I am charging this money for
learning Sahaj Yog."

01:19:39.139 --> 01:19:41.729
There’s a course in Sahaj Yoga he started.

01:19:41.729 --> 01:19:45.079
You ’ll be surprised I was not for it.

01:19:45.079 --> 01:19:46.270
But it works better!

01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:48.449
People are knowing about Sahaj Yoga.

01:19:48.449 --> 01:19:55.429
They are trying to bring paper and pencil
and understand each and everything, like a

01:19:55.429 --> 01:19:56.429
school.

01:19:56.429 --> 01:20:00.010
I mean if you need that, you better do it.

01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:06.520
I don’t know why you have to pay but, I
think he does that very well and French are

01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:11.659
getting better than English according to him,
as far as the knowledge of Sahaj Yoga is concerned.

01:20:11.659 --> 01:20:15.249
So it’s better you all work it out that
way I think.

01:20:15.249 --> 01:20:17.110
Whichever way is useful for you.

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:19.210
This is “samayaachaar”[conventional or
established practice], you see.

01:20:19.210 --> 01:20:25.469
We are so money oriented, is better we start
with the money and end up with the Spirit.

01:20:25.469 --> 01:20:26.469
Babaa!

01:20:26.469 --> 01:20:30.900
I don’t know what to say because I don’t
want anything out of it.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.429
But if that can screw up your heads, better
have it!

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.336
I mean I don’t know whatever way it suits
you.

01:20:36.336 --> 01:20:42.119
I never liked publication or advertising through
handbills, but I had to agree to it and I

01:20:42.119 --> 01:20:43.360
have agreed now.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.650
Because it’s some different world we are
facing.

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:47.939
So do whatever way you like – that’s not
important.

01:20:47.939 --> 01:20:49.280
But you must know about Sahaj Yoga.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:59.929
Because when you are talking about Sahaj Yoga,
you should be knowledgeable, isn’t it?

01:20:59.929 --> 01:21:03.290
Otherwise, they’ll say something which I’ve
never said: “Mother says so."

01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:06.489
And I’m shocked: “When – how could I
say such a thing!”

01:21:06.489 --> 01:21:16.760
Best way to know about Sahaj Yoga better,
is that you compare it with other sayings,

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.889
with other literature, with other scriptures,
with other saints.

01:21:21.889 --> 01:21:32.409
That’s a very good way, there’s a very
good book in Marathi has come out, where Sahaj

01:21:32.409 --> 01:21:36.760
Yoga is described through many saints.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:41.869
You can find out things like that, write essays
on that, something like that you can have

01:21:41.869 --> 01:21:47.469
a competition on essays, I don’t know how
the mind goes to that, that you must have

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.469
the knowledge.

01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:56.690
Is not enough to be joyous, because then you
cannot be a Guru.

01:21:56.690 --> 01:22:00.610
If you have to be a guru, if you have to spread
Sahaj Yoga, you must know about Sahaj Yog,

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:01.610
isn’t it?

01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:02.610
That’s it!

01:22:02.610 --> 01:22:03.929
Now, any other question?

01:22:03.929 --> 01:22:08.460
Now I’m saying all this – I hope it is
recorded – that firstly you have to have

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:14.469
a committee for people who travel around,
and proper arrangements to be made, and all

01:22:14.469 --> 01:22:21.179
planning to be done: Who is travelling where,
how we are going, when is the holiday time,

01:22:21.179 --> 01:22:24.999
do it in the weekends – whichever suits
you.

01:22:24.999 --> 01:22:28.630
Secondly, how to improve the knowledge of
Sahaj Yoga?

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:34.479
There’s another method they try in India
which you can try also here, is they put on

01:22:34.479 --> 01:22:39.340
my tapes and ask people to take notes whatever
they think important.

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:43.130
Then discuss among themselves, talk about
it; everybody has to talk and understand.

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:46.409
And whatever point they don’t understand,
they write to me, “Mother, this point we

01:22:46.409 --> 01:22:47.409
did not understand.

01:22:47.409 --> 01:22:48.409
Will you explain?”

01:22:48.409 --> 01:22:49.409
That’s also a good way.

01:22:49.409 --> 01:22:50.409
And now what to do with that?

01:22:50.409 --> 01:22:51.409
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, the question is, what is
the importance of spreading the vibrations

01:22:51.409 --> 01:22:52.409
in the environment.

01:22:52.409 --> 01:23:02.510
Like if we speak of scientists, they say that
electromagnetic vibrations are there, the

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.189
electromagnetic vibrations perform a function.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:14.969
So we can say to them that these vibrations
that we have as a result of Sahaja Yoga is

01:23:14.969 --> 01:23:19.909
flowing through us and is doing something
for the environment.

01:23:19.909 --> 01:23:25.530
So if you can please say something about what
it does to the environment.

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:31.690
Shri Mataji: Now electromagnetic vibrations
are the right sided vibrations are, of the

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:33.420
dead, we shall say.

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:37.659
Now our vibrations are what we are calling
this Chaitanya, is the combination of all

01:23:37.659 --> 01:23:41.650
these three plus the “Ardha Matra” [or
“Ardha Bindu” is the semicircle; together

01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:48.679
with the “Bindu” they represent the Adi
Shakti in AUM] is the Adi Shakti on top of

01:23:48.679 --> 01:23:49.679
that.

01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:56.849
So we have four types of vibrations [A, U,
M and the Ardha Matra on top] integrated in

01:23:56.849 --> 01:24:03.050
these vibrations: emotional side, evolutionary
and the one that is electromagnetic.

01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:11.590
So we have all these vibrations within us
integrated, and on top of that is the fourth

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:15.889
one which is the Adi Shakti’s vibrations.

01:24:15.889 --> 01:24:23.199
They organise, they think, they work out,
they direct, they choose, they do everything

01:24:23.199 --> 01:24:28.280
which is the administrative side.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.929
So we have four types of vibrations within
us.

01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:32.939
Now see a camera.

01:24:32.939 --> 01:24:35.320
I’ll tell you an example.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.949
I went to a station for my own photographs.

01:24:41.949 --> 01:24:46.139
So there were four photographs every time
I come in.

01:24:46.139 --> 01:24:53.900
The first one didn’t have so much depth,
second one improved, the third one improved,

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:58.480
and the fourth one was the best.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:04.019
What happened that when the first photograph
came in, it received some vibrations, I think,

01:25:04.019 --> 01:25:09.170
and it changed electromagnetic into the Chaitanya,
little bit.

01:25:09.170 --> 01:25:11.070
And the fourth one was good.

01:25:11.070 --> 01:25:17.329
Like you people, when you take my photograph,
I’m very much different from the photographs

01:25:17.329 --> 01:25:20.619
taken by people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

01:25:20.619 --> 01:25:27.559
Sometimes I look in those photographs, otherwise,
as if I am standing with somebody with a pistol

01:25:27.559 --> 01:25:28.659
at my back.

01:25:28.659 --> 01:25:29.659
[Laughter]

01:25:29.659 --> 01:25:43.590
But the camera, which is not touched by anyone,
which is facing Me all the time, records so

01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:47.530
many things which normally people cannot.

01:25:47.530 --> 01:25:52.889
Now you know that the people who were taking
very good photographs have suddenly lost that

01:25:52.889 --> 01:25:55.519
power, because their ego has come up.

01:25:55.519 --> 01:26:00.949
They have started thinking they were very
great photographers, this, that and thinking

01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:02.380
no end of themselves.

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:05.650
So their photographs are not showing such
results.

01:26:05.650 --> 01:26:15.699
The other day, I saw a photograph of Mine
and I told the person who has taken the photograph

01:26:15.699 --> 01:26:16.699
and he was amazed.

01:26:16.699 --> 01:26:17.699
How did I know?

01:26:17.699 --> 01:26:21.889
I said: “I can see all the chakras represented
in this photograph."

01:26:21.889 --> 01:26:27.659
From the photograph, I can make out who has
taken the photograph.

01:26:27.659 --> 01:26:32.349
So when a person is dealing with these electromagnetic
vibrations say, for example: here are electromagnetic

01:26:32.349 --> 01:26:33.349
vibrations, isn’t it?

01:26:33.349 --> 01:26:36.320
[Shri Mataji touches the microphone.]

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.780
Simple as that, here, on this.

01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:52.610
Now they receive my vibrations, and whatever
I talk becomes a mantra.

01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:58.380
When I blow in this, I blow in your Sahasrara.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:05.340
Electromagnetic is a wee bit of a dimension,
one third of the right side – one third

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:18.670
of the right side electromagnetic – out
of which this Universe is created.

01:27:18.670 --> 01:27:26.249
Then, there are other vibrations which are
beyond electromagnetic.

01:27:26.249 --> 01:27:31.820
Like, we have five elements.

01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:38.409
Electromagnetic are only two elements, two
elements which are combined together; it’s

01:27:38.409 --> 01:27:42.809
very easy to combine two elements: no permutations
and combinations.

01:27:42.809 --> 01:27:50.910
But when there are five elements, these three
combinations can make so many varieties and

01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:52.300
they are all right sided.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:58.400
So you can imagine there are so many vibrations
on the right side.

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:02.619
We are using the ether for example.

01:28:02.619 --> 01:28:05.070
Ether we use for broadcasting.

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:12.229
We think it’s only electromagnetic – is
a wrong idea.

01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:23.510
Now when I speak, say, and broadcasting it
goes in the ether, it’s the Adi Shakti.

01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:26.630
So it governs it.

01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.749
Then it manages things.

01:28:29.749 --> 01:28:32.369
It can work on your Sahasrara.

01:28:32.369 --> 01:28:34.969
It can work on so many Kundalinis.

01:28:34.969 --> 01:28:36.989
It can work on the nature.

01:28:36.989 --> 01:28:47.610
But they are so frightened of Me they never
allow Me to go on the TV, the negative.

01:28:47.610 --> 01:28:52.110
So electromagnetic are just a wee part of
it as I told you, it’s just the combination

01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:57.080
of the Mother Earth and electricity.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:04.389
That is, we can say, comes out of the water
element.

01:29:04.389 --> 01:29:10.210
That’s all.

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:14.469
Electromagnetic things have helped in one
way in creating life.

01:29:14.469 --> 01:29:21.340
Because where there were only gases created
– helium, hydrogen, oxygen – it was the

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:26.699
electrical charge, which changed them into
life.

01:29:26.699 --> 01:29:30.530
Amino-acids where formed like that.

01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:38.119
But the electrical charge also changed them
because there was Adi Shakti’s power working

01:29:38.119 --> 01:29:39.119
on them.

01:29:39.119 --> 01:29:43.360
The administration was done by Adi Shakti’s
power.

01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:48.810
So it’s just a wee bit of it.

01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:55.159
And if you have to achieve anything on the
electromagnetic you can show wonders out of

01:29:55.159 --> 01:29:56.159
it, wonders!

01:29:56.159 --> 01:30:03.420
Vibrations can pass onto it – means that
it administers those vibrations which are

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:10.889
sound vibrations, now for example, take it
as sound vibrations, are carried by electromagnetic

01:30:10.889 --> 01:30:11.889
vibrations.

01:30:11.889 --> 01:30:12.889
In the same way, Chaitanya can be carried
on electromagnetic vibrations.

01:30:12.889 --> 01:30:21.780
They can be carriers, but Chaitanya cannot
carry electromagnetic.

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:24.159
All right?

01:30:24.159 --> 01:30:34.849
You are all stunned by my knowledge or what?

01:30:34.849 --> 01:30:36.039
[Laughter]

01:30:36.039 --> 01:30:39.599
Any other question?

01:30:39.599 --> 01:30:40.789
Yes.

01:30:40.789 --> 01:30:46.099
Little loudly from that distance.

01:30:46.099 --> 01:31:01.219
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can you explain the relationship
between the geographical locations in the

01:31:01.219 --> 01:31:05.389
world and the microcosmic being, of us individuals,
in relationship?

01:31:05.389 --> 01:31:06.570
Shri Mataji: Gavin?

01:31:06.570 --> 01:31:12.459
Gavin: He’s asking about the expression
of the Kundalini in the world as a whole,

01:31:12.459 --> 01:31:21.840
if you can say something about that, how the
geographical locations correspond to parts

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.489
of inner being with the individual.

01:31:23.489 --> 01:31:25.439
Like you say England is the heart.

01:31:25.439 --> 01:31:28.440
Shri Mataji: I see.

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:33.600
You see Kundalini is made out of Mother Earth
itself.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.670
I mean the element used is the Mother Earth,
can you imagine?

01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:44.499
And the magnetic power of Mother Earth is
used in a way that we can say, that it represents

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.389
the Mother Earth, Kundalini within us.

01:31:48.389 --> 01:31:57.729
And that’s how the Earth is made also, is
made of layers.

01:31:57.729 --> 01:32:03.440
The whole earth is made of layers, because
one can understand, that when the part of

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:14.619
the sun, which broke away from the sun, came
down like a sari, you can say, like a thick

01:32:14.619 --> 01:32:16.510
(Someone coughs, muffling the word.

01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:21.560
Sounds like “SPONGE”), – because it
was gas.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:27.340
And then it had to go round itself.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:34.769
So the layers were formed just like the Kundalini
force comes down and coils up, in the same

01:32:34.769 --> 01:32:38.760
way Mother Earth was coiled up.

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:48.739
And the centres that I’ve described to you
that are here and there, like Europe as I

01:32:48.739 --> 01:32:54.619
said is the Void.

01:32:54.619 --> 01:32:58.739
Is not actually based on the axis of the Mother
Earth – should have been normally based

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:06.650
– because there were a lots of give-and-take
took place.

01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:19.889
Like the continent of Australia drifted down
to the Mooladhara, and the line, if you draw

01:33:19.889 --> 01:33:27.429
from there to India, then goes round, goes
round the earth and comes back to Himalayas.

01:33:27.429 --> 01:33:37.090
You might say that’s how it makes a Kundalini,
but it does not.

01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:39.920
If you draw a line, it may not.

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:45.550
But I can tell you how in the body it makes
a sense, still the body’s not – I mean

01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:51.830
still, thank God we are intact in one piece.

01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:56.530
Like our heart is where it should be, our
nose is where it should be.

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.530
Thank God.

01:33:57.530 --> 01:34:00.570
It may be, after sometime you might find a
nose hanging from here.

01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:05.869
(laughter) And the way we are, I don’t know
what will happen.

01:34:05.869 --> 01:34:14.750
Now the Kundalini moves like this say, for
example from the heart it starts, goes up

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.070
like that.

01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:21.340
This is the three and a half coils.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:31.280
Now, if you can make a spiral and cut it half,
three and a half, you get seven points.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:48.219
Three and a half, you take a spiral, from
the heart it moves, one…two…three…and

01:34:48.219 --> 01:34:50.654
the half that ends up at Mooladhara.

01:34:50.654 --> 01:34:57.310
Now you cut it half; you get seven points.

01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:59.019
Do you follow the point?

01:34:59.019 --> 01:35:06.869
And that’s how one after another, these
chakras are there within ourselves.

01:35:06.869 --> 01:35:15.550
So the Kundalini itself, represented on the
Mother Earth and which is readjusted now,

01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:26.269
adjusts itself within ourselves, in such a
manner that it creates this pinda, this body,

01:35:26.269 --> 01:35:28.699
in its own form.

01:35:28.699 --> 01:35:33.739
But it’s still residual because it has not
acted, it has not awakened.

01:35:33.739 --> 01:35:41.761
So it is still residual, but that seven chakras
are such created by the same Kundalini as

01:35:41.761 --> 01:35:44.699
I told you.

01:35:44.699 --> 01:35:53.459
But once upon a time, the Earth was placed
that way and made like that, but then it changed.

01:35:53.459 --> 01:35:59.699
And, you cannot explain it without showing
you a proper mark.

01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:03.729
That, you might say that “Mother, how is
it that the…

01:36:03.729 --> 01:36:07.249
Australia is there and India is here and this
and that?”

01:36:07.249 --> 01:36:17.560
But if you see a spiral going in two, like
that, then it sprouts out, its own personality

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:26.999
comes out at a point which looks odd, but
it is in the spiral way, placed in us.

01:36:26.999 --> 01:36:34.849
Even this world is moving in a spiral, this
universe is moving in a spiral, there’s

01:36:34.849 --> 01:36:35.849
an ascent.

01:36:35.849 --> 01:36:38.909
That’s how it is achieved, through an ascent.

01:36:38.909 --> 01:36:48.480
If it was just moving round and round, this
earth, it would not have evolved.

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.599
To go up, it goes round… but it is ascending.

01:36:52.599 --> 01:37:01.590
And I’m sure science will find it out very
soon, that the whole universe is moving in

01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:02.590
a spiral way.

01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:07.670
I don’t know how far is science gone, to
find out what.

01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:10.980
Is there already findings like that?

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:17.590
Sahaja Yogi: They found eleven dimensions,
Mother.

01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:22.309
They found eleven dimensions, Mother.

01:37:22.309 --> 01:37:25.150
Shri Mataji: Eleven?

01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:31.210
Sahaja Yogi: Dimensions, when you say there
are sixty-four.

01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:33.449
Shri Mataji: It’s unlimited.

01:37:33.449 --> 01:37:34.570
It’s unlimited.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.809
I’m talking of unlimited.

01:37:36.809 --> 01:37:39.599
Now, there’s one question I’ll ask.

01:37:39.599 --> 01:37:52.340
Supposing they say, “What is unlimited and
limited,” how will you explain?

01:37:52.340 --> 01:38:03.039
I mean supposing I’m not a Sahaj Yogi, I’m
quite a clever person and ask you a question.

01:38:03.039 --> 01:38:05.130
[Lengthening silence.]

01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:16.659
There are Ph.D.s, M.A.D.s, let’s have [Shri
Mataji laughs] some answer.

01:38:16.659 --> 01:38:22.489
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, the unlimited is the
Mother.

01:38:22.489 --> 01:38:25.780
The unlimited is the Mother.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:30.999
Shri Mataji: No, but that is your statement.

01:38:30.999 --> 01:38:42.909
French Sahaja Yogi: Mother, (ED Del: “the
unlimited you can only do with your head.")

01:38:42.909 --> 01:38:48.412
The limited you can do with your head, but
the unlimited is with the vibrations?

01:38:48.412 --> 01:38:50.420
No, no, but, how is it in this world, there
is something unlimited or not?

01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:54.949
I mean the concept of unlimited must have
come from somewhere.

01:38:54.949 --> 01:38:57.959
[A baby make word-like noises to which Mother
responds: “Ah, who’s there?]

01:38:57.959 --> 01:38:59.469
You have to say something concrete.

01:38:59.469 --> 01:39:12.389
Another Sahaja Yogi: The unlimited is the
comprehension that God is unlimited beyond

01:39:12.389 --> 01:39:14.539
the (norms?) of men.

01:39:14.539 --> 01:39:16.669
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying?

01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:19.650
Sahaja Yogi: We have subservient to God.

01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:21.780
Shri Mataji: Can’t hear you.

01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.479
What he saying Gavin?

01:39:23.479 --> 01:39:27.090
Gavin: He’s saying that God is the unlimited,
Mother.

01:39:27.090 --> 01:39:30.190
Shri Mataji: No, no, but that’s your statement.

01:39:30.190 --> 01:39:31.790
They don’t believe in God, supposing.

01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:33.350
See, mostly they don’t believe in anything.

01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:34.469
Then what will you say?

01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:37.320
you say that “God is unlimited,” – say
“We don’t believe in God."

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.320
Alright.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:39.320
Then?

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.130
This is your statement I’m not saying – say
something that you have seen unlimited in

01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:47.389
this world – not me, apart from Me!

01:39:47.389 --> 01:39:54.019
Because you are Sahaj Yogis, now let’s see!

01:39:54.019 --> 01:39:57.340
Sahaja Yogi: [softly] Infinity.

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:03.449
Another Sahaja Yogi: Mother, On the gross
level, the energy within the human body is

01:40:03.449 --> 01:40:07.249
a closed–system, which can be exhausted,
as we know through the play of right and left.

01:40:07.249 --> 01:40:08.669
Connection with –
Shri Mataji: No, no, but that’s what you

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:09.669
say… because you have reached your subtle
state.

01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:11.239
But those who are on the gross, can you tell
them any example of unlimited?

01:40:11.239 --> 01:40:12.239
Sahaja Yogi: The Universe, Mother.

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.239
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, the Spirit.

01:40:13.239 --> 01:40:14.789
Shri Mataji: No, you can’t say universes,
they have not seen it.

01:40:14.789 --> 01:40:15.789
Sahaja Yogi: speaking over Shri Mataji: A
life.

01:40:15.789 --> 01:40:18.880
Shri Mataji: Something that you can see with
your eyes.

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.260
Sahaja Yogi: Life, Shri Mataji.

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:25.769
Life is not an entropic system.

01:40:25.769 --> 01:40:27.079
Shri Mataji: That’s another…[Laughter]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:40:27.079 --> 01:40:28.079
It has to be very gross example.

01:40:28.079 --> 01:40:29.860
It has to be for gross people now let’s
see.

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:30.860
Sahaja Yogini: Blue sky, Mother.

01:40:30.860 --> 01:40:31.860
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:32.860
Sahaja Yogi: A fountain.

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:33.860
Shri Mataji: No, no.

01:40:33.860 --> 01:40:34.860
Sahaja Yogini: Usually we say the sand on
the shore…

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:41.239
The grains of sand on the shore.

01:40:41.239 --> 01:40:45.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, it is limited.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.229
It is at a point limited.

01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:48.400
Something that is really unlimited you can
see.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.440
Sahaja Yogi: Infinity.

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.829
Another Sahaja Yogi: How?

01:40:50.829 --> 01:40:51.860
Sahaja Yogi: Infinity.

01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:52.900
Shri Mataji: How?

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:55.329
[Laughter] You talk, now I’ll tell you.

01:40:55.329 --> 01:40:56.329
Absolutely gross.

01:40:56.329 --> 01:40:58.439
Sahaja Yogini: The nourishment of Mother Earth?

01:40:58.439 --> 01:41:00.169
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

01:41:00.169 --> 01:41:03.630
Sahaja Yogini: The nourishment of the Mother
Earth, always giving?

01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:05.040
Shri Mataji: What is she saying?

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.449
Other Sahaja Yogi: The nourishment of Mother
Earth.

01:41:06.449 --> 01:41:07.510
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no.

01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:08.559
Sahaja Yogi: Below the [body?], Mother.

01:41:08.559 --> 01:41:09.559
Sahaja Yogini: Air.

01:41:09.559 --> 01:41:11.340
Shri Mataji: You see something it is conceptual.

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:14.909
Not conceptual actually, I’ll show you.

01:41:14.909 --> 01:41:17.300
You can see unlimited.

01:41:17.300 --> 01:41:18.300
Not me, alright?

01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.570
It’s very simple.

01:41:19.570 --> 01:41:31.400
Put two mirrors in front of each other and
put one thing in between.

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:38.090
You see unlimited images.

01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:43.110
[Laughter and applause.]

01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:46.659
One divided by three is unlimited.

01:41:46.659 --> 01:41:54.659
Adi Shakti divided by three becomes unlimited.

01:41:54.659 --> 01:42:01.449
So many thing absolutely gross you can show
them this is unlimited.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:10.489
So now there are two mirrors, one is God and
His Power.

01:42:10.489 --> 01:42:16.809
And the image in between is the universe.

01:42:16.809 --> 01:42:21.849
So you get unlimited universes.

01:42:21.849 --> 01:42:25.469
Then you have God and His Power, you get any
deity in between, you get unlimited deities

01:42:25.469 --> 01:42:26.469
in you all.

01:42:26.469 --> 01:42:35.590
Is a very simple thing you can show.

01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:46.000
At a very gross level, you can tell them there
is something like unlimited.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.599
Alright?

01:42:47.599 --> 01:42:56.400
Is all right for physics people, am I all
right?

01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:57.540
[Laughter].

01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:02.630
Like that.

01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:06.079
So such questions if they ask, you have to
be prepared.

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:08.280
For that, you must think about it.

01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:09.280
Sometimes you may not answer.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.280
Doesn’t matter.

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.280
Think it about.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:23.369
Find out, “What does that mean?”

01:43:23.369 --> 01:43:28.979
But the thing is that you must use the Mahamaya
power, which you have seen clearly, to them

01:43:28.979 --> 01:43:30.159
by showing my photographs.

01:43:30.159 --> 01:43:32.719
Now how do you explain this?

01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:36.969
By showing them what happened in Bedford,
or telling them what happened in so many cases,

01:43:36.969 --> 01:43:37.969
where suddenly you got this and this happened
and that happened.

01:43:37.969 --> 01:43:38.969
How do you explain?

01:43:38.969 --> 01:43:41.940
That will stupefy their brain much more.

01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:43.270
I think my time is over now.

01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:46.840
You get to take over.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:55.939
Now what time you are having lunch?

01:43:55.939 --> 01:44:00.370
Sahaja Yogi: One o’clock, Mother.

01:44:00.370 --> 01:44:05.079
Shri Mataji: That’s why I said no puja in
the morning.

01:44:05.079 --> 01:44:06.079
[Laughter].

01:44:06.079 --> 01:44:07.079
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

01:44:07.079 --> 01:44:08.079
Shri Mataji: Now you know why.

01:44:08.079 --> 01:44:09.079
But Gavin is a person who listens to me.

01:44:09.079 --> 01:44:13.699
That’s a good thing, I mean those who listen
to me, it’s easier to deal with them.

01:44:13.699 --> 01:44:18.239
But those who don’t listen to you it’s
very difficult, first, you have to convince

01:44:18.239 --> 01:44:23.130
them, on a gross level, every time.

01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:26.880
So, don’t decide for yourself, let me decide.

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.530
Whatever I decide for you is for your good.

01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:38.630
May God bless you!

01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:44.919
So I can go now, you can have your seminar
and discussions and whatever you want to have,

01:44:44.919 --> 01:44:49.289
on these two points specially because, one
thing is you must find out for those who want

01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:50.670
to go, how you will be going.

01:44:50.670 --> 01:44:56.949
All of you should take a very active interest
and tell them what you can do about it.

01:44:56.949 --> 01:45:09.349
Also, I think it would be good idea to tell
them in short what we have decided in the

01:45:09.349 --> 01:45:28.329
trustees meetings, whatever we have decided
about… we should tell them about it.

01:45:28.329 --> 01:45:30.999
How are you doing there, well in this college?

01:45:30.999 --> 01:45:32.199
Sahaja Yogi: I hope so, Mother, with your
blessings.

01:45:32.199 --> 01:45:33.520
Shri Mataji: Working out well?

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.300
Sahaja Yogi: Quite alright with your blessings.

01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:43.070
Shri Mataji: I’ve told C.P. about you.

01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.070
Alright?

01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:49.900
Gavin: Bolo Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala
Devi ki

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:51.949
Sahaja Yogis: Jay!
