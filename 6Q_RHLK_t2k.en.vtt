Diwali Puja Talk. Istanbul (Turkey)
November 5, 1994.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:53.288
Today we are going to celebrate the Diwali,

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:58.641
which means the rows of lights

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.988
or, you can say, group of lights.

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:22.676
Need somebody to translate in Turkish also;

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:24.441
it's all right.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:40.753
This Diwali has been a festival of
very ancient times in India.

00:13:57.091 --> 00:14:03.348
I already told in My previous lectures
what are these five days are.

00:14:26.158 --> 00:14:36.514
After killing Narakasura, Diwali was celebrated

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:43.650
when it was the darkest night of the year.

00:14:55.823 --> 00:15:04.726
So now, it is very symbolic of these modern times,

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:30.160
because the worst time,  as far as morality’s
concerned

00:15:30.781 --> 00:15:34.937
has been in these modern times.

00:15:53.512 --> 00:15:57.945
We call it the Ghor Kali Yuga.

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.372
Ghor Kali Yuga

00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:11.137
Ghor Kali Yuga, the worst modern times

00:16:24.923 --> 00:16:28.158
That means a complete darkness

00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:40.604
and, as you see around, you’ll find out

00:16:40.726 --> 00:16:45.159
that there is complete darkness

00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:02.692
as far as morality is concerned,

00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:07.688
but that’s why there are all kinds of crises.

00:17:31.169 --> 00:17:34.717
Because of that, also,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.647
there are many who are seeking the light, the truth.

00:17:56.124 --> 00:17:59.703
In the darkness of ignorance,

00:18:01.202 --> 00:18:06.227
people have no knowledge as to what

00:18:06.913 --> 00:18:12.018
they should do, why or they are on this Earth.

00:18:29.572 --> 00:18:35.631
As you know very well, that thousands
and thousands of real seekers

00:18:35.727 --> 00:18:39.468
who are born at this time,

00:18:53.137 --> 00:18:57.717
that is why this job was given to Me

00:18:57.746 --> 00:19:05.400
is to create Diwali in this dark ages of ignorance.

00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:32.074
It’s not an easy job because, on one side,

00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:37.945
we have all the dark forces acting against the truth.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:07.658
Also, on the other side, we have to fight the false people

00:20:07.714 --> 00:20:13.393
who are taking advantage of your seeking.

00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:39.428
Firstly, people don’t know what to seek,

00:20:48.307 --> 00:20:52.546
so all these false people have been money-oriented

00:20:52.563 --> 00:20:59.584
and they tried to work out
marketing of their falsehood

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:25.485
and they have the expertise to do it.

00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:44.165
Somebody asked Me [UNCLEAR], television ....

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:48.115
what about the cults that are killing people and doing

00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:53.491
all sorts of things that they did in Switzerland.

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:20.208
So I said it’s true, they are crooks,
they are horrible, they are criminals

00:22:20.312 --> 00:22:22.742
who call themselves as spiritual,

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:29.376
but the mistake lies with the people who follow.

00:22:54.719 --> 00:23:00.314
So a person who is absolutely immoral,

00:23:00.618 --> 00:23:04.292
absolutely dishonest,

00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:08.651
who launders money to Swiss banks,

00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:12.065
cannot be a guru.

00:23:30.192 --> 00:23:36.964
He used to buy these drugs and sell them.

00:23:36.991 --> 00:23:40.620
He used to buy weapons and sell them.

00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:03.446
He was worse than his disciples,
much worse.

00:24:21.921 --> 00:24:27.407
They have used a kind of a suggestion

00:24:27.545 --> 00:24:31.086
from the books of so-called Guru Gita or something

00:24:31.135 --> 00:24:36.115
where it is said you should surrender
everything to your guru.

00:25:02.949 --> 00:25:08.553
That means it was to suggest
that a disciple should be willing

00:25:08.705 --> 00:25:12.510
to surrender everything to the guru.

00:25:28.372 --> 00:25:35.765
So, it was for the disciple,

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.073
but for the guru,
he should not grab anything,

00:25:39.098 --> 00:25:43.041
he shouldn’t ask for anything,
he should not be greedy.

00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:46.387
All these things are already written down.

00:26:11.124 --> 00:26:15.221
But nobody reads what is required of a guru

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:17.501
and only they see that

00:26:17.525 --> 00:26:21.140
you have to surrender everything to the guru.

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:49.960
Why I’m telling you all this,

00:26:49.976 --> 00:27:00.749
because how the darkness is
so deep and so dangerous.

00:27:24.484 --> 00:27:27.991
Moreover, the other day I read an article

00:27:28.003 --> 00:27:30.638
who said that in Milan

00:27:30.673 --> 00:27:35.317
there is a very, very organisation,

00:27:35.342 --> 00:27:39.503
a global organisation of Satanism.

00:28:01.682 --> 00:28:05.715
Many politicians and many people in the government,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:10.797
very highly placed ministers,
prime ministers are involved in it.

00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:45.285
Many people who are bank managers
or bank owners

00:28:45.326 --> 00:28:51.185
and also the people who call
themselves social workers

00:29:12.704 --> 00:29:18.674
and also those who have got peace
award and this award, that award.

00:29:38.096 --> 00:29:47.285
So this is what is the worst times
of Kali Yuga, modern times.

00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:06.335
Now, the second day of Diwali, last day,

00:30:06.513 --> 00:30:14.286
is where a brother and sisters
celebrate together

00:30:15.366 --> 00:30:20.736
for relationship which is
so pure and so protective.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:50.224
That is to show that, after putting the lights,

00:30:50.249 --> 00:30:57.950
morality must be the first
priority for the society.

00:31:23.005 --> 00:31:26.314
I need not tell you today

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.033
immoral side of modern times. It’s horrible.

00:31:52.743 --> 00:31:58.195
Immorality is the greatest darkness of modern times

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.407
where people do not know
how they relate to each other

00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:34.499
for which, as I told you before,
Christ has suggested

00:32:34.524 --> 00:32:37.097
that you take out the eyes of a man

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.940
who looks at a woman twice

00:33:31.689 --> 00:33:35.974
because He found, at that time, people were horrid.

00:33:49.692 --> 00:33:54.138
Who can follow Christ in these modern times?

00:33:54.163 --> 00:33:58.641
Both the eyes, both the hands will be cut off.

00:34:21.336 --> 00:34:24.812
On the whole, if you see,

00:34:24.837 --> 00:34:29.410
I haven’t seen any Christian like that, so far.

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:04.553
Mohammed-sahib was even more strict.

00:35:04.588 --> 00:35:07.843
He thought nothing has been done for the women,

00:35:07.868 --> 00:35:11.274
so he passed through some regulations about women also.

00:35:49.229 --> 00:35:54.676
So he said that any woman who looks
at a man with bad eyes

00:35:54.848 --> 00:36:00.133
should be buried halfway
and should be killed by stoning.

00:36:23.235 --> 00:36:27.139
I don’t know what would have happened
to the American ladies

00:36:27.246 --> 00:36:29.285
if they have follow this.

00:36:45.806 --> 00:36:49.218
So when I came to this Earth

00:36:49.293 --> 00:36:55.921
I discovered that these two are
very difficult, specially in Kali Yuga.

00:37:25.356 --> 00:37:29.355
These laws are actually meant

00:37:29.395 --> 00:37:33.440
for not normal human beings,
but for angels.

00:37:53.568 --> 00:38:00.356
So modern man is even worse
than a normal human being

00:38:16.814 --> 00:38:23.085
because they want something destructive all the time,

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:27.194
like the Spanish ask the bull to hit them.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:40.612
Now the description of modern times

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:50.324
is there to show you in
what times we are living

00:40:10.977 --> 00:40:15.066
and I realised this not an easy thing

00:40:15.175 --> 00:40:19.132
to talk to them about anything

00:40:19.238 --> 00:40:24.089
that is good without giving them realisation.

00:40:46.769 --> 00:40:50.523
Unless and until you give them realisation,

00:40:50.579 --> 00:40:54.898
nothing can penetrate into their minds

00:40:55.156 --> 00:40:59.166
on just mental level.

00:41:24.523 --> 00:41:30.905
And also giving only lectures and sermons,

00:41:30.973 --> 00:41:34.266
the whole thing will be at a mental level only.

00:41:56.318 --> 00:42:00.849
And also the religions which are so-called

00:42:00.874 --> 00:42:07.038
are really very harmful for
the spiritual growth of human beings.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:36.394
I felt that enlightenment is the only way

00:42:36.593 --> 00:42:38.918
one can save this world.

00:42:56.513 --> 00:42:59.734
In this darkness of ignorance,

00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:06.557
the darkest night of the whole history of this world,

00:43:08.245 --> 00:43:15.734
we needed light and lights, many lights.

00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:43.085
Agni,

00:43:43.117 --> 00:43:45.267
You to say sanskrit

00:43:45.513 --> 00:43:49.651
Yes, Agni means fire in Sanskrit language.

00:44:09.762 --> 00:44:10.936
All right.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:18.051
So the world divided into so many countries,

00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:25.092
so many races, so many languages

00:44:25.548 --> 00:44:29.796
and also their own thinking -

00:44:32.023 --> 00:44:38.011
think of a global religion

00:44:38.737 --> 00:44:43.413
was only possible when people got their realisation.

00:45:35.964 --> 00:45:43.070
So, I had to tell you, human beings,

00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:46.874
what are their problems.

00:46:00.864 --> 00:46:05.276
So, in a light, in India,

00:46:05.476 --> 00:46:11.442
we have the pot or the container
which is made of clay,

00:46:12.484 --> 00:46:15.779
then the oil, and then the wick.

00:46:48.357 --> 00:46:52.897
Now, this body, this mind,

00:46:53.449 --> 00:46:58.912
you can call all that is visible

00:46:59.103 --> 00:47:03.901
and is within, is all the pot

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:31.939
and the oil is the compassion, the love

00:47:43.821 --> 00:47:48.789
and the wick is the Kundalini,
the pure desire,

00:48:24.976 --> 00:48:29.960
and the spark is the spirit.

00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:51.760
So, first of all, the container has to be all right.

00:48:53.805 --> 00:48:54.979
It should be all right.

00:49:09.119 --> 00:49:14.270
It should be able to contain the oil properly

00:49:14.627 --> 00:49:19.003
and should not allow it to ooze out.

00:49:38.568 --> 00:49:45.229
Now there are two holes that cause problem.

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:50.502
One is your ego.
Another is your conditionings.

00:50:20.287 --> 00:50:23.072
So, if a Sahaja Yogi

00:50:25.203 --> 00:50:27.838
thinks of his conditionings,

00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:32.366
that “I am a Christian or, you can say,

00:50:32.376 --> 00:50:37.036
that I come from this race,
I’m this community,”

00:50:37.193 --> 00:50:43.146
so all these limitations with
which we have built ourselves

00:50:43.443 --> 00:50:47.872
are so flimsy that they break out

00:51:31.812 --> 00:51:35.200
because there is no reality in them.

00:51:35.245 --> 00:51:40.969
There’s no substance so they fizzle out.

00:52:09.907 --> 00:52:13.438
They all act like possessions

00:52:13.543 --> 00:52:17.172
and a person becomes absolutely blind.

00:52:43.594 --> 00:52:50.010
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,
I’ve seen Christians will adhere to Christ,

00:52:50.053 --> 00:52:55.166
Muslims will adhere to Mohammed-sahib or to Ali

00:52:55.638 --> 00:53:02.483
and others will adhere to the conditionings
from which they have come,

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.041
but they don’t adhere to Me,

00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:53.956
so they cannot see the integration of
all these personalities in one person.

00:54:26.555 --> 00:54:29.594
One has to know, on this point,

00:54:29.721 --> 00:54:33.779
that you have got the light.

00:54:35.228 --> 00:54:38.039
You are enlightened.

00:54:55.534 --> 00:54:59.899
You are not an egg.
You have become a bird.

00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:15.661
So you have to give up all that is falsehood.

00:55:36.697 --> 00:55:43.200
If you are fully enlightened you will give up
automatically, you don’t have to be told.

00:56:05.879 --> 00:56:09.006
When the light is enlightened,

00:56:09.422 --> 00:56:12.977
it automatically feel responsible

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.916
that it has to give light.

00:56:38.182 --> 00:56:44.401
Nobody has to tell that
“You please give light”

00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:46.672
because it is light.

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:11.757
Because it is eternal light,
nothing can kill it.

00:57:34.172 --> 00:57:36.881
I will say a Sanskrit Shloka,

00:57:36.905 --> 00:57:41.341
Nainam chidanti sashtrani
Nainam dahanti pavaka

00:57:41.351 --> 00:57:45.639
Chayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha

00:57:45.894 --> 00:57:51.292
means it cannot be killed by [UNCLEAR],

00:57:54.687 --> 00:57:57.775
not air can blow it away,

00:57:58.056 --> 00:58:01.762
nothing can destroy it.

00:58:03.492 --> 00:58:08.436
Even if you want to suck it, you cannot.

00:58:08.581 --> 00:58:13.041
It’s such a powerful light you have got within yourself.

00:58:57.038 --> 00:59:02.508
You can verify whether it is eternal or not.

00:59:13.858 --> 00:59:17.024
You should introspect and see for yourself.

00:59:17.049 --> 00:59:22.591
You’ve got such a unique light within you.

00:59:47.033 --> 00:59:54.260
Not in the history of this world of spirituality

00:59:54.607 --> 01:00:01.298
so many have got realisation,
such light within them..

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:35.462
So how could these stupid, flimsy,

01:00:35.487 --> 01:00:38.346
useless conditionings

01:00:38.944 --> 01:00:44.329
dominate you now when you are
the carrier of eternal light?

01:01:15.959 --> 01:01:19.676
But if you don’t respect this eternal light,

01:01:19.708 --> 01:01:22.830
then the conditionings will put it out.

01:01:41.735 --> 01:01:43.392
This is the only problem,

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:46.783
that you have the freedom.

01:01:46.796 --> 01:01:49.923
You want to have the eternal light, you’ll have it,

01:01:49.948 --> 01:01:55.593
otherwise this light can be damaged completely.

01:02:24.128 --> 01:02:29.866
So, the another hole is that of ego.

01:02:43.529 --> 01:02:52.175
One side, conditioning can be resolved
by the sense of responsibility.

01:03:11.732 --> 01:03:14.700
The same sense of responsibility,

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:20.078
when asserted through ego,
could be very dangerous.

01:03:39.366 --> 01:03:42.270
This light can become fire

01:03:59.911 --> 01:04:03.799
and it can burn the house of Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:32.956
A normal life, we know
that light is for giving us light,

01:04:33.183 --> 01:04:35.438
not for burning houses,

01:04:56.089 --> 01:05:00.287
but when you get to ego in Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:00.999 --> 01:05:04.951
you can think that you are responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:35.416 --> 01:05:37.646
but this responsibility

01:05:38.244 --> 01:05:42.484
should not give you an idea
that you are in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

01:06:05.153 --> 01:06:09.200
So, gradually then, you become so right-sided

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:12.720
and people are surprised that how

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:18.169
this man who was normal has become
like a bull in the china shop.

01:06:20.573 --> 01:06:22.636
bull in the china shop

01:06:24.659 --> 01:06:27.754
bull in the china shop.

01:06:28.159 --> 01:06:30.579
English phrase.

01:07:10.196 --> 01:07:13.624
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yoga.

01:07:39.178 --> 01:07:40.725
It’s like government servants.

01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:44.948
They are suppose to be servants,
but they are the bosses.

01:08:03.562 --> 01:08:05.735
They become bosses.

01:08:18.736 --> 01:08:24.389
So, the whole understanding

01:08:25.286 --> 01:08:30.322
should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yoga.

01:08:57.302 --> 01:09:01.809
The second part is the oil,

01:09:16.718 --> 01:09:18.685
which is compassion,

01:09:26.735 --> 01:09:32.610
which is natural, innate and joy-giving.

01:09:46.472 --> 01:09:49.423
This oil has to be pure.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:59.078
The compassion has to be pure.

01:10:05.521 --> 01:10:12.846
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis
try to trouble the leaders.

01:10:28.778 --> 01:10:34.596
They oppose the leader and try to hinder
the work of Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:51.817 --> 01:10:55.698
Now, these are suppose to be Sahaja Yogis

01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:02.140
and they don’t understand if their compassion is pure

01:11:02.262 --> 01:11:04.827
they will appreciate their leader

01:11:04.843 --> 01:11:09.075
because the leader is doing such a compassionate work.

01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:51.194
Of course, pure compassion, one must understand,

01:11:51.219 --> 01:11:54.268
has nothing to do with greed,

01:11:54.657 --> 01:11:57.341
with temptations, nothing to do.

01:12:19.782 --> 01:12:23.323
One has to feel such nearness

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:27.802
with the leader and appreciativeness of the work

01:12:27.842 --> 01:12:31.449
he or she is putting in.

01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:52.265
So Compassion cannot be impure.

01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:55.704
There cannot be lust in it.

01:13:16.238 --> 01:13:21.993
More over this compassion should be
express in such a descent

01:13:22.091 --> 01:13:26.433
manner that nobody should doubt your compassion.

01:13:51.092 --> 01:13:54.553
Thank God, this one good thing has happened,

01:13:54.578 --> 01:13:58.110
people don’t kiss you.

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:24.385
First time when I went to western countries,

01:14:24.435 --> 01:14:30.756
I was just bombarded with kisses.
I didn’t know what to say — I mean horrible.

01:14:56.773 --> 01:14:59.137
There may not be anything wrong in the mind,

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:03.695
but it’s so indecent and stupid.

01:15:33.683 --> 01:15:35.706
Long time back

01:15:36.248 --> 01:15:39.202
I was told that it was written on Indian airports,

01:15:39.227 --> 01:15:42.772
“Please don’t kiss the custom officers.”

01:16:15.967 --> 01:16:19.371
In modern times a man can kiss a woman,

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:22.995
but he can’t kiss a man.
I mean, it’s absurd.

01:16:54.221 --> 01:17:01.439
Even if they make a goal in the match of football,

01:17:01.464 --> 01:17:09.076
now they don’t hug, poor things,
they just touch with hands, each other….

01:17:09.427 --> 01:17:11.530
they make a goal

01:17:11.803 --> 01:17:15.557
they don’t even hug each other....

01:17:45.634 --> 01:17:50.452
So, and now I’ve seen many people who make a goal

01:17:50.477 --> 01:17:52.637
and they’re excited, so they run out of the field.

01:17:52.661 --> 01:17:54.232
They don’t know what to do.

01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:46.699
So, for Sahaja Yogis,

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:50.516
you should know men can kiss men
and can hug them

01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:51.541
there’s nothing wrong

01:18:51.567 --> 01:18:53.900
and same with the ladies.

01:19:27.144 --> 01:19:32.471
Otherwise, in excitement, they might
run out of the field of Sahaja Yoga.

01:19:51.766 --> 01:19:56.019
Men need not touch women,
women not touch men. It’s all right.

01:19:56.086 --> 01:20:00.165
What is this nonsense?
You can’t express your love?

01:20:25.594 --> 01:20:34.448
Say for India we have a rule that
a lady can touch the younger man

01:20:34.766 --> 01:20:39.273
and a man can touch a much older women,

01:20:39.396 --> 01:20:43.430
who could be a mother, sister-in-law, anyone,

01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:19.080
which I think is a good rule because it has worked out.

01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:39.976
So, for compassion,

01:21:39.984 --> 01:21:46.853
it has to have decency as fragrance in the oil.

01:22:12.567 --> 01:22:16.712
So how do we express our compassion?

01:22:26.543 --> 01:22:30.138
We have Rakhi sisters, Rakhi brothers,

01:22:41.401 --> 01:22:43.708
but I know of a lady

01:22:43.733 --> 01:22:48.854
who became friendly with
rich boys as Rakhi brothers.

01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:21.906
Or the other way round also, that

01:23:21.965 --> 01:23:26.664
many boys became Rakhi sisters of rich women.

01:23:52.734 --> 01:23:56.952
So one has to understand that
it is not for money that

01:23:56.984 --> 01:24:01.287
you should become Rakhi brothers
and sisters and to exploit,

01:24:01.415 --> 01:24:04.299
but for compassion.

01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:42.149
You have to express your Rakhi relationship

01:24:42.427 --> 01:24:45.454
just for the protection of each other.

01:25:07.734 --> 01:25:10.403
The compassion is so joy-giving

01:25:10.411 --> 01:25:14.627
that you should have not such conditions of money

01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:20.784
or any other stupid conditions which will kill your joy.

01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:56.164
But another thing also is that

01:25:56.204 --> 01:26:03.289
you express your love you use
some things as presents

01:26:03.308 --> 01:26:06.990
that gives you joy.

01:26:37.615 --> 01:26:40.813
That doesn’t mean, by any chance,

01:26:40.903 --> 01:26:44.745
that you just give it to your Rakhi sister

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:47.851
and not even to your wife, some present.

01:27:08.387 --> 01:27:13.093
So, the sap, as I always say, of compassion has to rise

01:27:13.119 --> 01:27:19.402
in the plant, giving love to different parts,

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:22.334
indifferent ways, whatever is required

01:27:22.361 --> 01:27:26.527
and that then evaporates

01:27:26.587 --> 01:27:30.237
or goes back resource.

01:27:58.549 --> 01:28:06.035
Attachment is the killer
of pure love and compassion.

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:27.853
So try to always find out, introspect.

01:28:27.866 --> 01:28:31.024
Are you attached  to your children, to your wife

01:28:31.065 --> 01:28:35.924
or to your Rakhi sister or to anything?
Attached?

01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:40.058
Then there’s a danger that

01:28:40.075 --> 01:28:44.338
you may get into a kind of a stagnation.

01:29:27.936 --> 01:29:32.358
You’ll be amazed, when you are absolutely detached

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:41.671
and nourishing the different relationships
that you have in a proper way,

01:29:42.171 --> 01:29:44.808
your joy is perfect.

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:21.211
Ambition is another killer of joy.

01:30:36.176 --> 01:30:39.564
So, if you have to be ambitious,

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:42.727
you have to be only ambitious only about Sahaja Yoga,

01:30:42.746 --> 01:30:45.277
so that you humble down.

01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:29.156
One promise in Sahaja Yoga is
that your life will be full of joy.

01:31:53.805 --> 01:31:59.140
There is no need to take out your eyes,
cut your hands, no punishments.

01:32:15.671 --> 01:32:20.945
If you have too many holes,
need not come to Sahaj Yoga.

01:32:35.708 --> 01:32:40.620
You have to become real holy person,
not full of holes.

01:32:58.898 --> 01:33:03.255
I must say that you are all “your holinesses.”

01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:23.428
I am not because I’ve not become.
You have become.

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:37.343
Supposing, somebody has to call you
as a man, will they say,

01:33:37.359 --> 01:33:43.037
“Oh, man, such and such”?
No, because you are a man.

01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:18.918
Whatever you achieve is attached to you,
whatever you have achieved.

01:34:41.025 --> 01:34:44.694
Russian seems to be long translation

01:34:48.658 --> 01:34:51.822
and sometimes very small

01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:57.792
and sometimes Romanian sometimes very short,
sometimes very long.

01:35:09.563 --> 01:35:17.823
All right, so now the another thing
that is promised is bliss.

01:35:38.356 --> 01:35:42.585
What is bliss is the experience of joy.

01:35:50.654 --> 01:35:53.455
It can come from anything.

01:36:10.684 --> 01:36:19.193
Maybe you find you were in an accident
and you were suddenly saved, protected.

01:36:19.353 --> 01:36:22.805
You are amazed and everybody feels the bliss.

01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:25.217
You also feel the bliss.

01:37:19.572 --> 01:37:22.365
To be very frank, I cannot translate.

01:37:24.013 --> 01:37:28.695
I know languages, but from one language
to another, I cannot translate.

01:37:28.730 --> 01:37:31.510
There’s something wrong with Me.

01:37:32.307 --> 01:37:37.126
Yogi: “But you understand very well,
Shri Mataji, what we say.”

01:37:52.059 --> 01:37:54.503
That is very easy.

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:58.759
See the thoughts, first is an abstract form.

01:38:14.604 --> 01:38:16.342
That’s an abstract form,

01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:18.947
that’s all I said.

01:39:01.223 --> 01:39:05.691
All right, but thank you very much.

01:39:06.886 --> 01:39:12.142
So, it is — you see, at that point

01:39:12.245 --> 01:39:17.090
anybody can know what is the thought is

01:39:17.115 --> 01:39:22.462
because later on it becomes a language, takes words.

01:39:57.801 --> 01:40:02.904
All right, so if you can jump at that abstract,

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:07.687
then you know that, but you have to
put attention quite a lot.

01:40:43.017 --> 01:40:48.008
So, you have to pay attention
"to that abstract point to continuous"

01:41:04.516 --> 01:41:08.238
All right, so now, to solve this problem,

01:41:08.263 --> 01:41:12.193
I would request you all, to learn,
at least, English language.

01:41:22.532 --> 01:41:26.484
I’m not saying Sanskrit, but English.

01:41:49.633 --> 01:41:52.783
Now, it is the Kundalini,

01:41:52.847 --> 01:41:55.039
which is a pure desire,

01:41:55.048 --> 01:41:59.615
is already existing,
you don’t have to do anything.

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.402
Maybe the cotton is not clean.

01:42:24.407 --> 01:42:27.867
It has some problems

01:42:28.232 --> 01:42:34.555
because it has passed through dirty hands,

01:42:34.621 --> 01:42:38.781
but it can be clean.

01:42:40.434 --> 01:42:43.286
The cotton [UNCLEAR]

01:42:43.326 --> 01:42:45.294
may not be clean

01:42:45.319 --> 01:42:47.898
but it can be clean

01:42:55.119 --> 01:42:57.237
Cotton wool, I mean.

01:43:26.037 --> 01:43:30.080
Kabira has said something very beautiful about it.

01:43:41.549 --> 01:43:47.899
He says that when the intestine

01:43:48.051 --> 01:43:52.795
of a goat are inside the stomach,

01:43:52.887 --> 01:43:58.466
they say, “May, may, may,” means “I, I, I.”

01:44:28.788 --> 01:44:34.201
But when they are pulled out and arevmade into strings

01:45:02.664 --> 01:45:11.343
and put on an instrument for
cleaning the cotton wool —

01:45:12.555 --> 01:45:17.194
put on the instrument that cleans the cotton wool.

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:20.759
You know, in India we call it dhunakt ,dhunki.

01:45:54.862 --> 01:46:00.141
And when it is being strung, it  says, “Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi,”

01:46:00.166 --> 01:46:04.161
means  “You, you are, you are, you are.”

01:47:05.096 --> 01:47:10.424
All right, whatever it is.

01:47:10.552 --> 01:47:20.291
So, it means that when your Kundalini
not working out well

01:47:20.347 --> 01:47:24.960
because there are problems in your chakras,

01:47:24.985 --> 01:47:30.453
what you have to say,
“You are, you are.” You say that.

01:47:30.477 --> 01:47:34.450
“You are Sakshat this.
You are Sakshat that.”

01:48:09.163 --> 01:48:12.529
Sakshat means “in reality.” In reality.

01:48:30.892 --> 01:48:34.083
You don’t say, “You are Her Holiness something.”

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:38.860
You say, “You are Ganesha. You are this.”

01:49:01.614 --> 01:49:06.770
That is how you cleanse all the dirt

01:49:06.858 --> 01:49:13.166
or all the problems of your chakras.

01:49:30.632 --> 01:49:37.196
By this, you also correct
your conditionings and your ego.

01:49:52.924 --> 01:49:57.344
Then you do not take the credit for anything.

01:49:57.444 --> 01:50:00.546
You do not feel you are doing something

01:50:19.717 --> 01:50:25.462
and the whole personality changes

01:50:25.487 --> 01:50:31.947
into a complete instrument like the flute

01:50:31.972 --> 01:50:35.933
in the hands of Shri Krishna.

01:51:01.195 --> 01:51:03.742
Then you see your work,

01:51:03.782 --> 01:51:08.937
everything as the work of the Divine.

01:51:32.567 --> 01:51:35.519
That is how you become enlightened.

01:51:41.982 --> 01:51:46.880
That is how you become the light of joy, of peace.

01:52:04.309 --> 01:52:08.141
What has been  said about what you are.

01:52:12.724 --> 01:52:18.009
That is how, see, is whatever is described about,

01:52:18.129 --> 01:52:20.672
you become that.

01:52:38.933 --> 01:52:41.869
If there is a light you don’t have to say

01:52:41.901 --> 01:52:45.680
that it is a light, it is.

01:53:06.580 --> 01:53:10.468
It is not a stamp that you have to use.

01:53:29.772 --> 01:53:38.053
So, today we are celebrating a Diwali
of the lights of Sahaja Yoga.

01:53:51.461 --> 01:53:58.415
I don’t know what to say,
in what state of bliss I am.

01:54:17.783 --> 01:54:25.913
All the ripples you have created
of joy are overwhelming for it.

01:55:00.168 --> 01:55:02.429
No words can describe.

01:55:02.553 --> 01:55:07.140
I cannot compose poetry.

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:24.461
Keep this light burning beautifully through meditation

01:55:48.641 --> 01:55:54.087
and you can become very strong
because of light.

01:56:07.804 --> 01:56:12.289
May God bless you, Happy Diwali to all of you.

01:56:34.833 --> 01:56:38.301
I must say Diwali Puja is a very short one

01:56:38.333 --> 01:56:44.370
and my lecture have been three times said so

01:56:44.438 --> 01:56:50.535
you can imagine the time is been
more spend than normal.

01:57:15.845 --> 01:57:22.776
Lastly there are many invited in India free.

01:57:23.328 --> 01:57:28.315
Most of them may not also pay,

01:57:28.339 --> 01:57:32.827
those who cannot pay for travel should let us know.

01:58:00.226 --> 01:58:04.051
No no, we have invited many people to India.

01:58:04.107 --> 01:58:12.078
They should give their names and
those who are free for Ganapatipule

01:58:12.103 --> 01:58:15.296
but who have paid for the travelling

01:58:15.314 --> 01:58:19.771
and those who have not paid for travelling also should give their names.

01:59:01.611 --> 01:59:09.235
Also some of the letters who cannot paid are invited.

01:59:27.399 --> 01:59:29.200
May God bless you all.
