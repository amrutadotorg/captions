00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:27.123
Today we have assembled here

00:10:27.123 --> 00:10:34.356
to celebrate the Diwali, the Deepavali.

00:10:42.423 --> 00:10:56.556
Actually, only after Sahaja Yoga started,

00:10:56.556 --> 00:11:02.523
the real Diwali is taking shape.

00:11:13.656 --> 00:11:20.423
We had many beautiful lamps,

00:11:20.423 --> 00:11:29.756
and we had lot of oil to burn,

00:11:36.323 --> 00:11:48.890
but there was no spark, to enlighten the deepas.

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:11.390
And the wick, as you call it is called
as bati in Hindi language

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.489
is like your Kundalini,

00:12:25.756 --> 00:12:31.756
so the Kundalini had to meet the spark.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:49.690
The beautiful lamps were all a waste,
purposeless, pointless.

00:12:59.656 --> 00:13:08.890
And this is the great blessings in modern times,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.990
that so many lights are enlightened

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:18.489
and we are having a Deepavali of human hearts.

00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:42.590
When you become the light,
you don’t worry about the lamp,

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.590
how it looks, how it is to be made,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.023
it’s all done.

00:13:58.489 --> 00:14:06.790
You just have to worry about the flame, about the oil,

00:14:12.323 --> 00:14:16.656
because it’s the oil that burns and gives light.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:27.890
In Sanskrit language,
which is the language of the Gods,

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.623
the oil is called as ‘snigdha’, ‘snigdha’;

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:40.223
is something that is soft but is snigdha.

00:14:48.056 --> 00:14:55.190
And ‘sneha’ means ‘friendship of love.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.923
And the poets in other languages have used this word,

00:15:07.923 --> 00:15:10.690
in different way calling it ‘neha’.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.456
They have sung the praise of this love.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.356
Every poet, every Saint

00:15:29.356 --> 00:15:37.023
has used this word in their beautiful poetry,

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:52.790
whether they were in separation or they were
in the meeting, in the yoga, in the union.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:08.723
This love is the thing that gives the light.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:19.356
If this oil is not clean, contaminated,

00:16:19.356 --> 00:16:21.890
you get the smoke.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.256
but is pure,

00:16:30.256 --> 00:16:34.923
then it gives a brilliant light without any smoke.

00:16:41.823 --> 00:16:45.023
But when this oil is fragrant

00:16:45.023 --> 00:16:49.290
then the light gives the fragrance as well.

00:16:58.556 --> 00:17:03.423
The oil is made from various things.

00:17:08.423 --> 00:17:13.890
The one that comes from the Mother Earth cannot be used

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.290
because it’s very materialistic, it gives carbon.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:29.190
Like petrol, kerosene,
it pollutes the atmosphere.

00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:39.223
Then the one that comes from animals,

00:17:39.223 --> 00:17:45.790
who are – some of them,
are very much worshipped in India,

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:52.356
they have a very particular type of snigdha

00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:55.056
or we can call it ghee or oil

00:17:55.056 --> 00:18:04.123
which is giving a light which is
very soothing and peaceful.

00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:23.190
So when matter evolves into animal state

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.990
also the oil evolves.

00:18:34.456 --> 00:18:41.390
But when this oil is rubbed
onto the feet of a Saint,

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.323
it gets the fragrance.

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:57.256
In the same way if this oil is
brought in contact with flowers

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:59.356
it gives fragrance.

00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:12.023
So the feet of a Saint are
like the flowers on the tree.

00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:24.890
And when the flower falls on the ground,
the Mother Earth,

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:35.556
it’s so delicate, it’s so sensible,
it doesn’t hurt Her.

00:19:35.556 --> 00:19:38.556
It falls with great reverence

00:19:38.556 --> 00:19:43.423
as a great homage to the Mother Earth.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:59.990
In the same way a Saint has to be gentle,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:07.590
gentle in the way the moonlight
falls upon this Earth.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:25.290
It is light without any burning in it,
no scorching.

00:20:29.223 --> 00:20:35.090
That gentleness one has to develop,

00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:46.890
out of the oil that is the love in your heart,

00:20:52.556 --> 00:20:54.856
which lubricates everything,

00:20:54.856 --> 00:20:57.323
which removes the frictions

00:21:04.123 --> 00:21:08.090
and soothes.

00:21:14.923 --> 00:21:20.123
You have seen the way nature works.

00:21:20.123 --> 00:21:24.623
We never see a flower opening out,

00:21:24.623 --> 00:21:31.190
we never see the fruit coming out of the flower.

00:21:41.323 --> 00:21:45.090
It is so gentle and so slow

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.156
that the movement is not seen by these human eyes.

00:21:57.856 --> 00:22:03.890
Because the Nature wants you
should not be disturbed by the movements.

00:22:09.956 --> 00:22:17.990
The Nature cares, so you people
do not feel the growth,

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:24.656
the movement and the explosions of the evolution

00:22:24.656 --> 00:22:32.790
or we can say the movement of Nature’s own behavior.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.056
In the same way a Saint, a Sahaja Yogi,

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:56.323
has to move very smoothly
in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:07.756 --> 00:23:16.390
It is with the Sahaja Yogis, I said;
not with the non-Sahajas.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:31.856
Nature reacts to anything that is foreign.

00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:41.923
It throws out anything that is not Sahaj.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:53.990
In the same way, a Saint should not accept

00:23:53.990 --> 00:24:00.356
anything, anybody who is foreign to Sahaj behavior.

00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:17.723
When it deals with the matter,
with the materialistic people,

00:24:17.723 --> 00:24:26.990
then it acts with the greatest wisdom,
as the tip of a root.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:39.590
It moves with majesty,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.923
embeds itself into the Mother Earth

00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:47.356
going round all hard rocks

00:24:47.356 --> 00:24:49.590
and holding them together;

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.890
it makes the tree to stand up erect.

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.090
The sign of life is that

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:16.156
it goes against the matter,
the one that is "jara".

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:29.223
Like the tree goes against the gravity;

00:25:33.556 --> 00:25:37.990
like the great human beings
have lifted their body

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:42.190
against the gravity in a straight posture.

00:25:48.556 --> 00:25:52.690
In the same way, if you see, the flame

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.690
goes against the gravity.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:06.923
Nobody has heard of fire going from
the top floor to the ground floor.

00:26:12.123 --> 00:26:16.356
It starts from the ground floor
and it goes upward.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:27.423
But the fire also comes from
the matter which is burning.

00:26:32.656 --> 00:26:39.023
So the matter has to be burnt,
if you want to rise.

00:26:43.489 --> 00:26:48.123
If your attention is all the time
towards baser things,

00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:53.856
materialistic things,
towards physical pleasures,

00:26:53.856 --> 00:26:56.523
you cannot rise.

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:10.290
You may do any amount of meditations,
use My Photographs, come to My Pujas,

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.790
but if your attention is imbedded

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:19.256
it’s like you are standing on a crocodile
trying to get into a boat.

00:27:35.023 --> 00:27:38.690
Now, that doesn’t mean when a flame burns,

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.489
it gives up matter,

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:50.756
but it gets detached and it burns it.

00:27:55.123 --> 00:27:56.856
So this body,

00:27:56.856 --> 00:27:58.656
this mind,

00:27:58.656 --> 00:27:59.656
this ego,

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:01.590
this superego,

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:09.190
is all to be burned to keep this flame
burning all the time.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.990
You don’t have to give up anything,

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:27.190
but to use the same thing for a higher life,

00:28:35.256 --> 00:28:41.489
and that is what should be
the aim of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:51.890
Actually after getting Realization,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.723
you just start spontaneously giving

00:28:54.723 --> 00:28:58.156
because you are the light.

00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:14.556
But respect your light and the light of others.

00:29:21.256 --> 00:29:24.056
The darkness is too much

00:29:28.456 --> 00:29:31.223
and we need so many lights

00:29:31.223 --> 00:29:33.690
to remove this darkness.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:44.190
These lights are to be maintained,
to be looked after,

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.956
to be loved.

00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:56.523
As you know very well,

00:29:56.523 --> 00:29:59.223
I cannot do it alone.

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:10.056
For example the source of electricity,
if you use to burn,

00:30:10.056 --> 00:30:13.223
you may have a big explosion.

00:30:13.223 --> 00:30:16.356
It has to go to various bulbs

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:20.923
to give a nice, spread-out light.

00:30:34.056 --> 00:30:37.323
And you are the channels,

00:30:37.323 --> 00:30:45.090
you are the ones who are going
to express Me.

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:57.323
I am just the potential energy,

00:31:00.523 --> 00:31:05.456
as the energy is coming from
somewhere which is stored

00:31:05.456 --> 00:31:06.890
and if I asked you,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:10.990
you would not even know where it is stored.

00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:34.623
It is through your behaviour,

00:31:34.623 --> 00:31:37.690
through your pure lights,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.290
through your fragrance,

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.390
people are going to know God Almighty.

00:31:56.623 --> 00:32:02.256
There are some, which can blacken the Face;

00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:04.690
they are lights no doubt,

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.256
but can blacken the Face

00:32:07.256 --> 00:32:10.356
if there are impurities,

00:32:18.456 --> 00:32:21.090
blacken the Face of the Divine,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:28.590
blacken the Face of your Creator.

00:32:41.323 --> 00:32:46.190
And that is what, one has to be careful,

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:53.156
that we are not blackening the Name
of God by our misbehaviour.

00:33:05.323 --> 00:33:08.156
Now listen to Me very carefully,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.690
If there is no light out of the lamp,

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:21.190
it does not blacken nor enlighten.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:33.823
But if there is a light,

00:33:33.823 --> 00:33:39.656
it can blacken as well as enlighten.

00:33:46.156 --> 00:33:49.156
It’s only the Sahaja Yogis who

00:33:49.156 --> 00:33:54.590
can blacken or enlighten
the Name of God Almighty.

00:34:05.489 --> 00:34:09.523
Say, for example, if you have a fake man,

00:34:09.523 --> 00:34:12.690
he doesn’t blacken the Name of God

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.090
because he is himself black,

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.256
so nobody’s bothered about that.

00:34:28.256 --> 00:34:33.990
If there is a person
who is teaching about God

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.156
or talking about God, about religion

00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:39.790
and making money out of it,

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.890
he blackens his own name.

00:34:57.656 --> 00:35:01.489
He does not blacken the Name of God Almighty.

00:35:05.656 --> 00:35:10.890
The Name of God, cannot be blackened,

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:14.056
It’s ever shining.

00:35:18.856 --> 00:35:21.223
But it’s only a Sahaja Yogi

00:35:21.223 --> 00:35:27.356
which can form that cloud to cover It.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.990
They can only finish the hope of this world.

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:49.923
They can only bring the real
destruction of this world.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.823
They will be held responsible.

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:05.723
And they should be punished in time,

00:36:05.723 --> 00:36:12.190
so that the Name of God should not be ruined.

00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:23.356
For they have been given the right
to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:36:23.356 --> 00:36:25.489
others are outside.

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:36.556
They are the only ones who can abuse the right.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.489
Those who are outside this building,
cannot spoil it.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.823
You have the special privilege

00:36:51.823 --> 00:36:55.023
to enter into this beautiful building.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:11.790
You have got this right because of the
great things you have done in previous lives.

00:37:20.256 --> 00:37:24.990
And if you now want to spoil it,

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:32.290
you’d better understand that
you will be very severely punished.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:46.489
The light which can enlighten can also burn.

00:37:51.623 --> 00:37:59.790
But this light will burn all those
who try to burn the Kingdom of God.

00:38:05.356 --> 00:38:08.090
So on a Diwali day let us know that

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:13.990
we should have the lamps, burnt in such a way that

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:19.556
it has purest of pure love in it.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:41.489
Not a lip service, lip service of love,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:49.390
but from your heart.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.590
It should pour,

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.990
like the Nature pours
all its blessings upon you.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:15.523
Then, wherever the flowers
of your feet will touch,

00:39:15.523 --> 00:39:19.590
the Nature will blossom with joy.

00:39:28.323 --> 00:39:31.056
There will be a Deepavali.

00:39:33.156 --> 00:39:42.190
Like I was told when, before coming to Rome,
Italy had no rain.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.323
The Mother Earth was parched.

00:39:55.056 --> 00:39:59.690
And as soon as you all Sahaja Yogis
came on this Mother Earth,

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.790
it started pouring.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:20.256
So the purity of love is to be understood
with complete discretion,

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.023
because this purity acts;

00:40:34.323 --> 00:40:42.956
it acts in the nature, it acts in the
human beings, it acts into everything.

00:40:51.056 --> 00:40:59.090
The action is the same as the action,
the gentle action of the Mother Earth.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:11.723
Those who come in contact with such a personality

00:41:11.723 --> 00:41:24.290
start suddenly feeling the soothing, the settling,
of the whole being, into a blissful state.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.156
into a blissful state.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:52.823
State of benediction.

00:41:52.823 --> 00:41:59.390
But I don’t know, after this word,
how much has gone wrong,

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:02.323
because our words are corrupt.

00:42:02.323 --> 00:42:04.790
Our words are corrupt,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:10.090
they do not express what they mean.

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:13.323
They are not also pure.

00:42:26.823 --> 00:42:32.356
They do not reflect what is to be reflected.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:46.890
So, it is for us to create
new meanings of the words,

00:42:51.656 --> 00:42:53.890
give a clear vision.

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.356
When you want to see a clear vision,

00:42:55.356 --> 00:43:00.723
you put a powerful light before the mirror.

00:43:10.823 --> 00:43:19.856
Clear vision of the expression in language,
in gestures, in behaviours;

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:31.656
and a clear vision of the Divine.

00:43:34.823 --> 00:43:39.590
Let people see in your light,

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.256
the beautiful dream coming true.

00:43:52.956 --> 00:43:58.990
In My childhood I used to think
My dreams are too fantastic.

00:44:05.956 --> 00:44:08.390
Will they ever materialize?

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:19.890
I used to collect small, little stones.

00:44:26.023 --> 00:44:29.990
And I would say:

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:41.556
“Will there be people, who are
not the stones but who are the hearts?”

00:44:51.423 --> 00:44:55.556
By God’s grace, I have met you.

00:44:59.623 --> 00:45:01.956
I thank you very much

00:45:03.823 --> 00:45:06.656
for accepting Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:16.890
But this invitation that is extended to you

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:22.523
should not be such that,
I will be blamed

00:45:22.523 --> 00:45:26.690
for giving it to people who never deserved it.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.890
Please do not let Me down.

00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:44.690
There’s one small thing,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.623
I come from a country

00:45:46.623 --> 00:45:51.423
which is not so sophisticated
in the modern world,

00:45:57.756 --> 00:46:02.090
but is very much embedded in Truth,

00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:13.523
and I’m happy you respect that country despite

00:46:13.523 --> 00:46:22.823
it’s unmodernised, natural existence,

00:46:31.823 --> 00:46:37.023
and you are proud of a Mother
who comes of such a country.

00:46:42.656 --> 00:46:47.990
This is the Deepavali
which is celebrated in that country

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.523
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:46:58.023 --> 00:47:01.423
And this is the first time in Rome,

00:47:04.456 --> 00:47:08.556
which is the center of Europe.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:18.290
Because here is the seven hills,

00:47:21.456 --> 00:47:28.290
expressing the whole of seven chakras.

00:47:32.156 --> 00:47:44.489
That is why a big torch had to be brought
from England in an aeroplane

00:47:44.489 --> 00:47:50.990
to enlighten these seven chakras of Europe.

00:48:03.356 --> 00:48:12.790
The Kundalini rises from mooladhara
and goes up to the seventh chakra

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.623
and touches the Sadashiva’s place

00:48:15.623 --> 00:48:24.523
but in this case from Sadashiva’s place,
the light has come down,

00:48:24.523 --> 00:48:31.056
to enlighten and respect
all the chakras from their heart.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:57.489
In the beginning of the awakening of the
Kundalini, that’s what exactly I do,

00:48:57.489 --> 00:49:06.290
is through your fingertips, the awahana,
the invitation to the Kundalini, is sent.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.823
Unless and until it passes
through these centers

00:49:09.823 --> 00:49:16.556
it cannot open it out sufficiently
for the Kundalini to rise,

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:43.323
and then the Kundalini rises.

00:49:43.323 --> 00:49:49.523
So the invitation first has to come
from the heart chakra here.

00:49:57.256 --> 00:50:00.623
So the desire has to come down first of all,

00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:05.623
the power of desire has to come down,
from the heart,

00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:09.056
to make the Kundalini rise.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.756
So the Kundalini acts,

00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:21.923
the power of action takes place.

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:31.990
So the responsibility of England

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:40.090
and the responsibility of Europe is very great.

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.656
Unless and until all these chakras are cleared,

00:50:50.656 --> 00:50:54.823
Vishuddhi cannot be pushed aside.

00:51:03.456 --> 00:51:10.856
So we have to consolidate first
in Europe and also in England.

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:21.090
I started it in England then in Europe.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.156
Once we have consolidated it well,

00:51:24.156 --> 00:51:30.823
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will be
very easily established in America.

00:51:42.723 --> 00:51:46.323
India there’s no problem, as you know;

00:51:51.456 --> 00:51:55.090
and that is going to work out very easily

00:51:55.090 --> 00:51:57.956
and once India is awakened

00:51:57.956 --> 00:52:05.390
the Kundalini will start moving very fast,
with great dynamism.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.890
But first these upper chakras must be put right.

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:21.990
Otherwise how can Kundalini come out?

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:36.590
So, you realize your responsibility,

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:40.356
that we have a force in India, no doubt.

00:52:40.356 --> 00:52:45.223
But how will it rise if there are obstructions?

00:52:45.223 --> 00:52:47.923
You are a part and parcel of this universe,

00:52:47.923 --> 00:52:50.923
you are not hanging somewhere else
from India,

00:52:50.923 --> 00:52:55.890
so India has to depend on you.

00:53:10.023 --> 00:53:14.023
For your sahasrara I have already made
all arrangements

00:53:14.023 --> 00:53:17.856
in the sense I am here in person.

00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:30.090
I have come down from Kailasha, on this Earth.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:40.156
So, that’s how I have arranged
the whole drama.

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:52.856
But the middle actors are very important.

00:53:59.056 --> 00:54:03.023
They should not act like clowns

00:54:06.556 --> 00:54:09.123
or stupid idiotic people.

00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:18.590
It is becoming quite idiotic,
the atmosphere, I must say,

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:23.190
you feel as if you are among
idiots or lunatics.

00:54:32.323 --> 00:54:37.290
So, these ridiculous things that are
happening around us should not impress us

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:43.323
but we should really use them
for amusing ourselves.

00:54:52.823 --> 00:54:55.590
And you have reached that ascent

00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:00.623
that you can see these things are
coming there because of the decadence.

00:55:10.823 --> 00:55:17.790
And the decadence is the ruin,
is the destruction of the chakras also.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:26.489
So though it is stupidity, idiocity,

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:30.690
we have to pick up people out of them,

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:33.090
to support the chakras.

00:55:42.923 --> 00:55:50.990
And to be very careful with the people
who are not Sahajas

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:54.690
who are sticking on in Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:02.123 --> 00:56:09.356
And now the time has come to throw them out
permanently and they are not to return back.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:22.690
Only the veeras, the courageous,
can worship the Mother.

00:56:28.023 --> 00:56:31.456
And I hope you are all that,

00:56:35.723 --> 00:56:38.290
and today is the great day

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:47.190
when I am worshipped by
all the veeras and veeranganas.

00:56:53.156 --> 00:56:55.690
May God bless you all.
