Shri Mataji found this place called
Ganapatipule about 18 or 19 years ago

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:29.212
and there is a very Holy temple of Shri 
Ganesha, who is the main deity that's

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:37.267
worshipped in Maharashtra and She said,
"Look, we'll all go over there." We were

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:45.302
not many. I think, we were barely a couple
of hundred people and She told me,

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:53.299
"We'll go over here and, I think, you find that
everybody will go very deep," and that was true.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:59.711
We came over here the very first time and
we had 6 or 7 days of programs, we were

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:07.059
at the nearby village and this is now
grown year after year wherein many more

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:12.452
people come; Now you have six, eight thousand
people and the idea is to bring people

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:18.480
together to meditate but most of all, for
people to have some proximity to Shri Mataji.
