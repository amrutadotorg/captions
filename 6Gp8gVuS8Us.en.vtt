WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:12.133
Today we have assembled here

00:12.133 --> 00:19.366
to celebrate the Diwali, the Deepavali.

00:27.433 --> 00:41.566
Actually, only after Sahaja Yoga started,

00:41.566 --> 00:47.533
the real Diwali is taking shape.

00:58.666 --> 01:05.433
We had many beautiful lamps,

01:05.433 --> 01:14.766
and we had lot of oil to burn,

01:21.333 --> 01:33.900
but there was no spark, to enlighten the deepas.

01:46.433 --> 01:56.400
And the wick, as you call it is called
as bati in Hindi language

01:56.400 --> 01:59.499
is like your Kundalini,

02:10.766 --> 02:16.766
so the Kundalini had to meet the spark.

02:27.100 --> 02:34.700
The beautiful lamps were all a waste,
purposeless, pointless.

02:44.666 --> 02:53.900
And this is the great blessings in modern times,

02:53.900 --> 02:57.000
that so many lights are enlightened

02:57.000 --> 03:03.499
and we are having a Deepavali of human hearts.

03:20.666 --> 03:27.600
When you become the light,
you don’t worry about the lamp,

03:27.600 --> 03:30.600
how it looks, how it is to be made,

03:30.600 --> 03:33.033
it’s all done.

03:43.499 --> 03:51.800
You just have to worry about the flame, about the oil,

03:57.333 --> 04:01.666
because it’s the oil that burns and gives light.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.900
In Sanskrit language,
which is the language of the Gods,

04:16.800 --> 04:19.633
the oil is called as ‘snigdha’, ‘snigdha’;

04:19.633 --> 04:25.233
is something that is soft but is snigdha.

04:33.066 --> 04:40.200
And ‘sneha’ means ‘friendship of love.

04:47.300 --> 04:52.933
And the poets in other languages have used this word,

04:52.933 --> 04:55.700
in different way calling it ‘neha’.

04:55.700 --> 05:00.466
They have sung the praise of this love.

05:09.300 --> 05:14.366
Every poet, every Saint

05:14.366 --> 05:22.033
has used this word in their beautiful poetry,

05:29.433 --> 05:37.800
whether they were in separation or they were
in the meeting, in the yoga, in the union.

05:46.900 --> 05:53.733
This love is the thing that gives the light.

05:58.300 --> 06:04.366
If this oil is not clean, contaminated,

06:04.366 --> 06:06.900
you get the smoke.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.266
but is pure,

06:15.266 --> 06:19.933
then it gives a brilliant light without any smoke.

06:26.833 --> 06:30.033
But when this oil is fragrant

06:30.033 --> 06:34.300
then the light gives the fragrance as well.

06:43.566 --> 06:48.433
The oil is made from various things.

06:53.433 --> 06:58.900
The one that comes from the Mother Earth cannot be used

06:58.900 --> 07:03.300
because it’s very materialistic, it gives carbon.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.200
Like petrol, kerosene,
it pollutes the atmosphere.

07:21.033 --> 07:24.233
Then the one that comes from animals,

07:24.233 --> 07:30.800
who are – some of them,
are very much worshipped in India,

07:30.800 --> 07:37.366
they have a very particular type of snigdha

07:37.366 --> 07:40.066
or we can call it ghee or oil

07:40.066 --> 07:49.133
which is giving a light which is
very soothing and peaceful.

08:04.499 --> 08:08.200
So when matter evolves into animal state

08:08.200 --> 08:12.000
also the oil evolves.

08:19.466 --> 08:26.400
But when this oil is rubbed
onto the feet of a Saint,

08:26.400 --> 08:29.333
it gets the fragrance.

08:37.766 --> 08:42.266
In the same way if this oil is
brought in contact with flowers

08:42.266 --> 08:44.366
it gives fragrance.

08:49.466 --> 08:57.033
So the feet of a Saint are
like the flowers on the tree.

09:02.533 --> 09:09.900
And when the flower falls on the ground,
the Mother Earth,

09:09.900 --> 09:20.566
it’s so delicate, it’s so sensible,
it doesn’t hurt Her.

09:20.566 --> 09:23.566
It falls with great reverence

09:23.566 --> 09:28.433
as a great homage to the Mother Earth.

09:39.300 --> 09:45.000
In the same way a Saint has to be gentle,

09:45.000 --> 09:52.600
gentle in the way the moonlight
falls upon this Earth.

10:03.800 --> 10:10.300
It is light without any burning in it,
no scorching.

10:14.233 --> 10:20.100
That gentleness one has to develop,

10:26.366 --> 10:31.900
out of the oil that is the love in your heart,

10:37.566 --> 10:39.866
which lubricates everything,

10:39.866 --> 10:42.333
which removes the frictions

10:49.133 --> 10:53.100
and soothes.

10:59.933 --> 11:05.133
You have seen the way nature works.

11:05.133 --> 11:09.633
We never see a flower opening out,

11:09.633 --> 11:16.200
we never see the fruit coming out of the flower.

11:26.333 --> 11:30.100
It is so gentle and so slow

11:34.100 --> 11:38.166
that the movement is not seen by these human eyes.

11:42.866 --> 11:48.900
Because the Nature wants you
should not be disturbed by the movements.

11:54.966 --> 12:03.000
The Nature cares, so you people
do not feel the growth,

12:03.000 --> 12:09.666
the movement and the explosions of the evolution

12:09.666 --> 12:17.800
or we can say the movement of Nature’s own behavior.

12:30.800 --> 12:35.066
In the same way a Saint, a Sahaja Yogi,

12:35.066 --> 12:41.333
has to move very smoothly
in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

12:52.766 --> 13:01.400
It is with the Sahaja Yogis, I said;
not with the non-Sahajas.

13:08.600 --> 13:16.866
Nature reacts to anything that is foreign.

13:21.866 --> 13:26.933
It throws out anything that is not Sahaj.

13:32.600 --> 13:39.000
In the same way, a Saint should not accept

13:39.000 --> 13:45.366
anything, anybody who is foreign to Sahaj behavior.

13:54.066 --> 14:02.733
When it deals with the matter,
with the materialistic people,

14:02.733 --> 14:12.000
then it acts with the greatest wisdom,
as the tip of a root.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.600
It moves with majesty,

14:24.600 --> 14:27.933
embeds itself into the Mother Earth

14:27.933 --> 14:32.366
going round all hard rocks

14:32.366 --> 14:34.600
and holding them together;

14:34.600 --> 14:37.900
it makes the tree to stand up erect.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.100
The sign of life is that

14:51.100 --> 15:01.166
it goes against the matter,
the one that is "jara".

15:08.900 --> 15:14.233
Like the tree goes against the gravity;

15:18.566 --> 15:23.000
like the great human beings
have lifted their body

15:23.000 --> 15:27.200
against the gravity in a straight posture.

15:33.566 --> 15:37.700
In the same way, if you see, the flame

15:37.700 --> 15:40.700
goes against the gravity.

15:45.200 --> 15:51.933
Nobody has heard of fire going from
the top floor to the ground floor.

15:57.133 --> 16:01.366
It starts from the ground floor
and it goes upward.

16:04.700 --> 16:12.433
But the fire also comes from
the matter which is burning.

16:17.666 --> 16:24.033
So the matter has to be burnt,
if you want to rise.

16:28.499 --> 16:33.133
If your attention is all the time
towards baser things,

16:33.133 --> 16:38.866
materialistic things,
towards physical pleasures,

16:38.866 --> 16:41.533
you cannot rise.

16:50.266 --> 16:55.300
You may do any amount of meditations,
use My Photographs, come to My Pujas,

16:55.300 --> 16:57.800
but if your attention is imbedded

16:57.800 --> 17:04.266
it’s like you are standing on a crocodile
trying to get into a boat.

17:20.033 --> 17:23.700
Now, that doesn’t mean when a flame burns,

17:23.700 --> 17:26.499
it gives up matter,

17:31.300 --> 17:35.766
but it gets detached and it burns it.

17:40.133 --> 17:41.866
So this body,

17:41.866 --> 17:43.666
this mind,

17:43.666 --> 17:44.666
this ego,

17:44.666 --> 17:46.600
this superego,

17:46.600 --> 17:54.200
is all to be burned to keep this flame
burning all the time.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.000
You don’t have to give up anything,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.200
but to use the same thing for a higher life,

18:20.266 --> 18:26.499
and that is what should be
the aim of every Sahaja Yogi.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.900
Actually after getting Realization,

18:36.900 --> 18:39.733
you just start spontaneously giving

18:39.733 --> 18:43.166
because you are the light.

18:51.933 --> 18:59.566
But respect your light and the light of others.

19:06.266 --> 19:09.066
The darkness is too much

19:13.466 --> 19:16.233
and we need so many lights

19:16.233 --> 19:18.700
to remove this darkness.

19:24.200 --> 19:29.200
These lights are to be maintained,
to be looked after,

19:29.200 --> 19:30.966
to be loved.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.533
As you know very well,

19:41.533 --> 19:44.233
I cannot do it alone.

19:48.266 --> 19:55.066
For example the source of electricity,
if you use to burn,

19:55.066 --> 19:58.233
you may have a big explosion.

19:58.233 --> 20:01.366
It has to go to various bulbs

20:01.366 --> 20:05.933
to give a nice, spread-out light.

20:19.066 --> 20:22.333
And you are the channels,

20:22.333 --> 20:30.100
you are the ones who are going
to express Me.

20:38.466 --> 20:42.333
I am just the potential energy,

20:45.533 --> 20:50.466
as the energy is coming from
somewhere which is stored

20:50.466 --> 20:51.900
and if I asked you,

20:51.900 --> 20:56.000
you would not even know where it is stored.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.633
It is through your behaviour,

21:19.633 --> 21:22.700
through your pure lights,

21:22.700 --> 21:25.300
through your fragrance,

21:25.300 --> 21:29.400
people are going to know God Almighty.

21:41.633 --> 21:47.266
There are some, which can blacken the Face;

21:47.266 --> 21:49.700
they are lights no doubt,

21:49.700 --> 21:52.266
but can blacken the Face

21:52.266 --> 21:55.366
if there are impurities,

22:03.466 --> 22:06.100
blacken the Face of the Divine,

22:06.100 --> 22:13.600
blacken the Face of your Creator.

22:26.333 --> 22:31.200
And that is what, one has to be careful,

22:31.200 --> 22:38.166
that we are not blackening the Name
of God by our misbehaviour.

22:50.333 --> 22:53.166
Now listen to Me very carefully,

22:56.800 --> 23:01.700
If there is no light out of the lamp,

23:01.700 --> 23:06.200
it does not blacken nor enlighten.

23:13.400 --> 23:18.833
But if there is a light,

23:18.833 --> 23:24.666
it can blacken as well as enlighten.

23:31.166 --> 23:34.166
It’s only the Sahaja Yogis who

23:34.166 --> 23:39.600
can blacken or enlighten
the Name of God Almighty.

23:50.499 --> 23:54.533
Say, for example, if you have a fake man,

23:54.533 --> 23:57.700
he doesn’t blacken the Name of God

23:57.700 --> 24:00.100
because he is himself black,

24:00.100 --> 24:03.266
so nobody’s bothered about that.

24:13.266 --> 24:19.000
If there is a person
who is teaching about God

24:19.000 --> 24:22.166
or talking about God, about religion

24:22.166 --> 24:24.800
and making money out of it,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.900
he blackens his own name.

24:42.666 --> 24:46.499
He does not blacken the Name of God Almighty.

24:50.666 --> 24:55.900
The Name of God, cannot be blackened,

24:55.900 --> 24:59.066
It’s ever shining.

25:03.866 --> 25:06.233
But it’s only a Sahaja Yogi

25:06.233 --> 25:12.366
which can form that cloud to cover It.

25:18.600 --> 25:24.000
They can only finish the hope of this world.

25:29.100 --> 25:34.933
They can only bring the real
destruction of this world.

25:40.100 --> 25:43.833
They will be held responsible.

25:47.233 --> 25:50.733
And they should be punished in time,

25:50.733 --> 25:57.200
so that the Name of God should not be ruined.

26:02.766 --> 26:08.366
For they have been given the right
to enter into the Kingdom of God,

26:08.366 --> 26:10.499
others are outside.

26:17.466 --> 26:21.566
They are the only ones who can abuse the right.

26:25.300 --> 26:29.499
Those who are outside this building,
cannot spoil it.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.833
You have the special privilege

26:36.833 --> 26:40.033
to enter into this beautiful building.

26:48.000 --> 26:56.800
You have got this right because of the
great things you have done in previous lives.

27:05.266 --> 27:10.000
And if you now want to spoil it,

27:10.000 --> 27:17.300
you’d better understand that
you will be very severely punished.

27:25.300 --> 27:31.499
The light which can enlighten can also burn.

27:36.633 --> 27:44.800
But this light will burn all those
who try to burn the Kingdom of God.

27:50.366 --> 27:53.100
So on a Diwali day let us know that

27:53.100 --> 27:59.000
we should have the lamps, burnt in such a way that

27:59.000 --> 28:04.566
it has purest of pure love in it.

28:19.800 --> 28:26.499
Not a lip service, lip service of love,

28:31.200 --> 28:34.400
but from your heart.

28:36.300 --> 28:40.600
It should pour,

28:40.600 --> 28:45.000
like the Nature pours
all its blessings upon you.

28:53.600 --> 29:00.533
Then, wherever the flowers
of your feet will touch,

29:00.533 --> 29:04.600
the Nature will blossom with joy.

29:13.333 --> 29:16.066
There will be a Deepavali.

29:18.166 --> 29:27.200
Like I was told when, before coming to Rome,
Italy had no rain.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.333
The Mother Earth was parched.

29:40.066 --> 29:44.700
And as soon as you all Sahaja Yogis
came on this Mother Earth,

29:44.700 --> 29:47.800
it started pouring.

29:58.300 --> 30:05.266
So the purity of love is to be understood
with complete discretion,

30:13.800 --> 30:17.033
because this purity acts;

30:19.333 --> 30:27.966
it acts in the nature, it acts in the
human beings, it acts into everything.

30:36.066 --> 30:44.100
The action is the same as the action,
the gentle action of the Mother Earth.

30:52.100 --> 30:56.733
Those who come in contact with such a personality

30:56.733 --> 31:09.300
start suddenly feeling the soothing, the settling,
of the whole being, into a blissful state.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.166
into a blissful state.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.833
State of benediction.

31:37.833 --> 31:44.400
But I don’t know, after this word,
how much has gone wrong,

31:44.400 --> 31:47.333
because our words are corrupt.

31:47.333 --> 31:49.800
Our words are corrupt,

31:49.800 --> 31:55.100
they do not express what they mean.

31:55.100 --> 31:58.333
They are not also pure.

32:11.833 --> 32:17.366
They do not reflect what is to be reflected.

32:23.200 --> 32:31.900
So, it is for us to create
new meanings of the words,

32:36.666 --> 32:38.900
give a clear vision.

32:38.900 --> 32:40.366
When you want to see a clear vision,

32:40.366 --> 32:45.733
you put a powerful light before the mirror.

32:55.833 --> 33:04.866
Clear vision of the expression in language,
in gestures, in behaviours;

33:11.600 --> 33:16.666
and a clear vision of the Divine.

33:19.833 --> 33:24.600
Let people see in your light,

33:24.600 --> 33:29.266
the beautiful dream coming true.

33:37.966 --> 33:44.000
In My childhood I used to think
My dreams are too fantastic.

33:50.966 --> 33:53.400
Will they ever materialize?

33:57.700 --> 34:04.900
I used to collect small, little stones.

34:11.033 --> 34:15.000
And I would say:

34:15.000 --> 34:26.566
“Will there be people, who are
not the stones but who are the hearts?”

34:36.433 --> 34:40.566
By God’s grace, I have met you.

34:44.633 --> 34:46.966
I thank you very much

34:48.833 --> 34:51.666
for accepting Sahaja Yoga.

34:54.000 --> 35:01.900
But this invitation that is extended to you

35:01.900 --> 35:07.533
should not be such that,
I will be blamed

35:07.533 --> 35:11.700
for giving it to people who never deserved it.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.900
Please do not let Me down.

35:27.066 --> 35:29.700
There’s one small thing,

35:29.700 --> 35:31.633
I come from a country

35:31.633 --> 35:36.433
which is not so sophisticated
in the modern world,

35:42.766 --> 35:47.100
but is very much embedded in Truth,

35:52.566 --> 35:58.533
and I’m happy you respect that country despite

35:58.533 --> 36:07.833
it’s unmodernised, natural existence,

36:16.833 --> 36:22.033
and you are proud of a Mother
who comes of such a country.

36:27.666 --> 36:33.000
This is the Deepavali
which is celebrated in that country

36:33.000 --> 36:36.533
for thousands and thousands of years.

36:43.033 --> 36:46.433
And this is the first time in Rome,

36:49.466 --> 36:53.566
which is the center of Europe.

36:56.300 --> 37:03.300
Because here is the seven hills,

37:06.466 --> 37:13.300
expressing the whole of seven chakras.

37:17.166 --> 37:29.499
That is why a big torch had to be brought
from England in an aeroplane

37:29.499 --> 37:36.000
to enlighten these seven chakras of Europe.

37:48.366 --> 37:57.800
The Kundalini rises from mooladhara
and goes up to the seventh chakra

37:57.800 --> 38:00.633
and touches the Sadashiva’s place

38:00.633 --> 38:09.533
but in this case from Sadashiva’s place,
the light has come down,

38:09.533 --> 38:16.066
to enlighten and respect
all the chakras from their heart.

38:37.100 --> 38:42.499
In the beginning of the awakening of the
Kundalini, that’s what exactly I do,

38:42.499 --> 38:51.300
is through your fingertips, the awahana,
the invitation to the Kundalini, is sent.

38:51.300 --> 38:54.833
Unless and until it passes
through these centers

38:54.833 --> 39:01.566
it cannot open it out sufficiently
for the Kundalini to rise,

39:24.900 --> 39:28.333
and then the Kundalini rises.

39:28.333 --> 39:34.533
So the invitation first has to come
from the heart chakra here.

39:42.266 --> 39:45.633
So the desire has to come down first of all,

39:45.633 --> 39:50.633
the power of desire has to come down,
from the heart,

39:50.633 --> 39:54.066
to make the Kundalini rise.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.766
So the Kundalini acts,

40:03.766 --> 40:06.933
the power of action takes place.

40:11.933 --> 40:17.000
So the responsibility of England

40:17.000 --> 40:25.100
and the responsibility of Europe is very great.

40:32.700 --> 40:35.666
Unless and until all these chakras are cleared,

40:35.666 --> 40:39.833
Vishuddhi cannot be pushed aside.

40:48.466 --> 40:55.866
So we have to consolidate first
in Europe and also in England.

41:02.600 --> 41:06.100
I started it in England then in Europe.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.166
Once we have consolidated it well,

41:09.166 --> 41:15.833
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will be
very easily established in America.

41:27.733 --> 41:31.333
India there’s no problem, as you know;

41:36.466 --> 41:40.100
and that is going to work out very easily

41:40.100 --> 41:42.966
and once India is awakened

41:42.966 --> 41:50.400
the Kundalini will start moving very fast,
with great dynamism.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.900
But first these upper chakras must be put right.

42:03.900 --> 42:07.000
Otherwise how can Kundalini come out?

42:17.000 --> 42:21.600
So, you realize your responsibility,

42:21.600 --> 42:25.366
that we have a force in India, no doubt.

42:25.366 --> 42:30.233
But how will it rise if there are obstructions?

42:30.233 --> 42:32.933
You are a part and parcel of this universe,

42:32.933 --> 42:35.933
you are not hanging somewhere else
from India,

42:35.933 --> 42:40.900
so India has to depend on you.

42:55.033 --> 42:59.033
For your sahasrara I have already made
all arrangements

42:59.033 --> 43:02.866
in the sense I am here in person.

43:09.200 --> 43:15.100
I have come down from Kailasha, on this Earth.

43:19.400 --> 43:25.166
So, that’s how I have arranged
the whole drama.

43:31.066 --> 43:37.866
But the middle actors are very important.

43:44.066 --> 43:48.033
They should not act like clowns

43:51.566 --> 43:54.133
or stupid idiotic people.

43:57.499 --> 44:03.600
It is becoming quite idiotic,
the atmosphere, I must say,

44:03.600 --> 44:08.200
you feel as if you are among
idiots or lunatics.

44:17.333 --> 44:22.300
So, these ridiculous things that are
happening around us should not impress us

44:22.300 --> 44:28.333
but we should really use them
for amusing ourselves.

44:37.833 --> 44:40.600
And you have reached that ascent

44:40.600 --> 44:45.633
that you can see these things are
coming there because of the decadence.

44:55.833 --> 45:02.800
And the decadence is the ruin,
is the destruction of the chakras also.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.499
So though it is stupidity, idiocity,

45:11.499 --> 45:15.700
we have to pick up people out of them,

45:15.700 --> 45:18.100
to support the chakras.

45:27.933 --> 45:36.000
And to be very careful with the people
who are not Sahajas

45:36.000 --> 45:39.700
who are sticking on in Sahaja Yoga.

45:47.133 --> 45:54.366
And now the time has come to throw them out
permanently and they are not to return back.

46:02.100 --> 46:07.700
Only the veeras, the courageous,
can worship the Mother.

46:13.033 --> 46:16.466
And I hope you are all that,

46:20.733 --> 46:23.300
and today is the great day

46:23.300 --> 46:32.200
when I am worshipped by
all the veeras and veeranganas.

46:38.166 --> 46:40.700
May God bless you all.
