00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.133
Today we have assembled here

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:19.366
to celebrate the Diwali, the Deepavali.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:41.566
Actually, only after Sahaja Yoga started,

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:47.533
the real Diwali is taking shape.

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:05.433
We had many beautiful lamps,

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:14.766
and we had lot of oil to burn,

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:33.900
but there was no spark, to enlighten the deepas.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:56.400
And the wick, as you call it is called
as bati in Hindi language

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.499
is like your Kundalini,

00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:16.766
so the Kundalini had to meet the spark.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.700
The beautiful lamps were all a waste,
purposeless, pointless.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:53.900
And this is the great blessings in modern times,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.000
that so many lights are enlightened

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.499
and we are having a Deepavali of human hearts.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:27.600
When you become the light,
you don’t worry about the lamp,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.600
how it looks, how it is to be made,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.033
it’s all done.

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:51.800
You just have to worry about the flame, about the oil,

00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:01.666
because it’s the oil that burns and gives light.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.900
In Sanskrit language,
which is the language of the Gods,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.633
the oil is called as ‘snigdha’, ‘snigdha’;

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:25.233
is something that is soft but is snigdha.

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:40.200
And ‘sneha’ means ‘friendship of love.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.933
And the poets in other languages have used this word,

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:55.700
in different way calling it ‘neha’.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.466
They have sung the praise of this love.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.366
Every poet, every Saint

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:22.033
has used this word in their beautiful poetry,

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:37.800
whether they were in separation or they were
in the meeting, in the yoga, in the union.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.733
This love is the thing that gives the light.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.366
If this oil is not clean, contaminated,

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:06.900
you get the smoke.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.266
but is pure,

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:19.933
then it gives a brilliant light without any smoke.

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:30.033
But when this oil is fragrant

00:06:30.033 --> 00:06:34.300
then the light gives the fragrance as well.

00:06:43.566 --> 00:06:48.433
The oil is made from various things.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:58.900
The one that comes from the Mother Earth cannot be used

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.300
because it’s very materialistic, it gives carbon.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
Like petrol, kerosene,
it pollutes the atmosphere.

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:24.233
Then the one that comes from animals,

00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:30.800
who are – some of them,
are very much worshipped in India,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.366
they have a very particular type of snigdha

00:07:37.366 --> 00:07:40.066
or we can call it ghee or oil

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:49.133
which is giving a light which is
very soothing and peaceful.

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:08.200
So when matter evolves into animal state

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.000
also the oil evolves.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:26.400
But when this oil is rubbed
onto the feet of a Saint,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.333
it gets the fragrance.

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:42.266
In the same way if this oil is
brought in contact with flowers

00:08:42.266 --> 00:08:44.366
it gives fragrance.

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:57.033
So the feet of a Saint are
like the flowers on the tree.

00:09:02.533 --> 00:09:09.900
And when the flower falls on the ground,
the Mother Earth,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:20.566
it’s so delicate, it’s so sensible,
it doesn’t hurt Her.

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:23.566
It falls with great reverence

00:09:23.566 --> 00:09:28.433
as a great homage to the Mother Earth.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:45.000
In the same way a Saint has to be gentle,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.600
gentle in the way the moonlight
falls upon this Earth.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.300
It is light without any burning in it,
no scorching.

00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:20.100
That gentleness one has to develop,

00:10:26.366 --> 00:10:31.900
out of the oil that is the love in your heart,

00:10:37.566 --> 00:10:39.866
which lubricates everything,

00:10:39.866 --> 00:10:42.333
which removes the frictions

00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:53.100
and soothes.

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:05.133
You have seen the way nature works.

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:09.633
We never see a flower opening out,

00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:16.200
we never see the fruit coming out of the flower.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:30.100
It is so gentle and so slow

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.166
that the movement is not seen by these human eyes.

00:11:42.866 --> 00:11:48.900
Because the Nature wants you
should not be disturbed by the movements.

00:11:54.966 --> 00:12:03.000
The Nature cares, so you people
do not feel the growth,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.666
the movement and the explosions of the evolution

00:12:09.666 --> 00:12:17.800
or we can say the movement of Nature’s own behavior.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.066
In the same way a Saint, a Sahaja Yogi,

00:12:35.066 --> 00:12:41.333
has to move very smoothly
in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:52.766 --> 00:13:01.400
It is with the Sahaja Yogis, I said;
not with the non-Sahajas.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:16.866
Nature reacts to anything that is foreign.

00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:26.933
It throws out anything that is not Sahaj.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:39.000
In the same way, a Saint should not accept

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.366
anything, anybody who is foreign to Sahaj behavior.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:14:02.733
When it deals with the matter,
with the materialistic people,

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:12.000
then it acts with the greatest wisdom,
as the tip of a root.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.600
It moves with majesty,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.933
embeds itself into the Mother Earth

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:32.366
going round all hard rocks

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:34.600
and holding them together;

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.900
it makes the tree to stand up erect.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.100
The sign of life is that

00:14:51.100 --> 00:15:01.166
it goes against the matter,
the one that is "jara".

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:14.233
Like the tree goes against the gravity;

00:15:18.566 --> 00:15:23.000
like the great human beings
have lifted their body

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.200
against the gravity in a straight posture.

00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:37.700
In the same way, if you see, the flame

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.700
goes against the gravity.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.933
Nobody has heard of fire going from
the top floor to the ground floor.

00:15:57.133 --> 00:16:01.366
It starts from the ground floor
and it goes upward.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:12.433
But the fire also comes from
the matter which is burning.

00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:24.033
So the matter has to be burnt,
if you want to rise.

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:33.133
If your attention is all the time
towards baser things,

00:16:33.133 --> 00:16:38.866
materialistic things,
towards physical pleasures,

00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:41.533
you cannot rise.

00:16:50.266 --> 00:16:55.300
You may do any amount of meditations,
use My Photographs, come to My Pujas,

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.800
but if your attention is imbedded

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:04.266
it’s like you are standing on a crocodile
trying to get into a boat.

00:17:20.033 --> 00:17:23.700
Now, that doesn’t mean when a flame burns,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.499
it gives up matter,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.766
but it gets detached and it burns it.

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:41.866
So this body,

00:17:41.866 --> 00:17:43.666
this mind,

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:44.666
this ego,

00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:46.600
this superego,

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:54.200
is all to be burned to keep this flame
burning all the time.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.000
You don’t have to give up anything,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.200
but to use the same thing for a higher life,

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:26.499
and that is what should be
the aim of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.900
Actually after getting Realization,

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.733
you just start spontaneously giving

00:18:39.733 --> 00:18:43.166
because you are the light.

00:18:51.933 --> 00:18:59.566
But respect your light and the light of others.

00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:09.066
The darkness is too much

00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:16.233
and we need so many lights

00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:18.700
to remove this darkness.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.200
These lights are to be maintained,
to be looked after,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.966
to be loved.

00:19:39.166 --> 00:19:41.533
As you know very well,

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:44.233
I cannot do it alone.

00:19:48.266 --> 00:19:55.066
For example the source of electricity,
if you use to burn,

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:58.233
you may have a big explosion.

00:19:58.233 --> 00:20:01.366
It has to go to various bulbs

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:05.933
to give a nice, spread-out light.

00:20:19.066 --> 00:20:22.333
And you are the channels,

00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:30.100
you are the ones who are going
to express Me.

00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:42.333
I am just the potential energy,

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:50.466
as the energy is coming from
somewhere which is stored

00:20:50.466 --> 00:20:51.900
and if I asked you,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.000
you would not even know where it is stored.

00:21:16.166 --> 00:21:19.633
It is through your behaviour,

00:21:19.633 --> 00:21:22.700
through your pure lights,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.300
through your fragrance,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.400
people are going to know God Almighty.

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:47.266
There are some, which can blacken the Face;

00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:49.700
they are lights no doubt,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.266
but can blacken the Face

00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:55.366
if there are impurities,

00:22:03.466 --> 00:22:06.100
blacken the Face of the Divine,

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:13.600
blacken the Face of your Creator.

00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:31.200
And that is what, one has to be careful,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:38.166
that we are not blackening the Name
of God by our misbehaviour.

00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:53.166
Now listen to Me very carefully,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.700
If there is no light out of the lamp,

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.200
it does not blacken nor enlighten.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.833
But if there is a light,

00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:24.666
it can blacken as well as enlighten.

00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:34.166
It’s only the Sahaja Yogis who

00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:39.600
can blacken or enlighten
the Name of God Almighty.

00:23:50.499 --> 00:23:54.533
Say, for example, if you have a fake man,

00:23:54.533 --> 00:23:57.700
he doesn’t blacken the Name of God

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.100
because he is himself black,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.266
so nobody’s bothered about that.

00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:19.000
If there is a person
who is teaching about God

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.166
or talking about God, about religion

00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.800
and making money out of it,

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.900
he blackens his own name.

00:24:42.666 --> 00:24:46.499
He does not blacken the Name of God Almighty.

00:24:50.666 --> 00:24:55.900
The Name of God, cannot be blackened,

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.066
It’s ever shining.

00:25:03.866 --> 00:25:06.233
But it’s only a Sahaja Yogi

00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:12.366
which can form that cloud to cover It.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.000
They can only finish the hope of this world.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:34.933
They can only bring the real
destruction of this world.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.833
They will be held responsible.

00:25:47.233 --> 00:25:50.733
And they should be punished in time,

00:25:50.733 --> 00:25:57.200
so that the Name of God should not be ruined.

00:26:02.766 --> 00:26:08.366
For they have been given the right
to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.499
others are outside.

00:26:17.466 --> 00:26:21.566
They are the only ones who can abuse the right.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.499
Those who are outside this building,
cannot spoil it.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.833
You have the special privilege

00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:40.033
to enter into this beautiful building.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.800
You have got this right because of the
great things you have done in previous lives.

00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:10.000
And if you now want to spoil it,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.300
you’d better understand that
you will be very severely punished.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:31.499
The light which can enlighten can also burn.

00:27:36.633 --> 00:27:44.800
But this light will burn all those
who try to burn the Kingdom of God.

00:27:50.366 --> 00:27:53.100
So on a Diwali day let us know that

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:59.000
we should have the lamps, burnt in such a way that

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.566
it has purest of pure love in it.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:26.499
Not a lip service, lip service of love,

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.400
but from your heart.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.600
It should pour,

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.000
like the Nature pours
all its blessings upon you.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:29:00.533
Then, wherever the flowers
of your feet will touch,

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:04.600
the Nature will blossom with joy.

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:16.066
There will be a Deepavali.

00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:27.200
Like I was told when, before coming to Rome,
Italy had no rain.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.333
The Mother Earth was parched.

00:29:40.066 --> 00:29:44.700
And as soon as you all Sahaja Yogis
came on this Mother Earth,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.800
it started pouring.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:05.266
So the purity of love is to be understood
with complete discretion,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.033
because this purity acts;

00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:27.966
it acts in the nature, it acts in the
human beings, it acts into everything.

00:30:36.066 --> 00:30:44.100
The action is the same as the action,
the gentle action of the Mother Earth.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.733
Those who come in contact with such a personality

00:30:56.733 --> 00:31:09.300
start suddenly feeling the soothing, the settling,
of the whole being, into a blissful state.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.166
into a blissful state.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.833
State of benediction.

00:31:37.833 --> 00:31:44.400
But I don’t know, after this word,
how much has gone wrong,

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.333
because our words are corrupt.

00:31:47.333 --> 00:31:49.800
Our words are corrupt,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.100
they do not express what they mean.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.333
They are not also pure.

00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:17.366
They do not reflect what is to be reflected.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:31.900
So, it is for us to create
new meanings of the words,

00:32:36.666 --> 00:32:38.900
give a clear vision.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.366
When you want to see a clear vision,

00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:45.733
you put a powerful light before the mirror.

00:32:55.833 --> 00:33:04.866
Clear vision of the expression in language,
in gestures, in behaviours;

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.666
and a clear vision of the Divine.

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:24.600
Let people see in your light,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.266
the beautiful dream coming true.

00:33:37.966 --> 00:33:44.000
In My childhood I used to think
My dreams are too fantastic.

00:33:50.966 --> 00:33:53.400
Will they ever materialize?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:04.900
I used to collect small, little stones.

00:34:11.033 --> 00:34:15.000
And I would say:

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:26.566
“Will there be people, who are
not the stones but who are the hearts?”

00:34:36.433 --> 00:34:40.566
By God’s grace, I have met you.

00:34:44.633 --> 00:34:46.966
I thank you very much

00:34:48.833 --> 00:34:51.666
for accepting Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.900
But this invitation that is extended to you

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:07.533
should not be such that,
I will be blamed

00:35:07.533 --> 00:35:11.700
for giving it to people who never deserved it.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.900
Please do not let Me down.

00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:29.700
There’s one small thing,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.633
I come from a country

00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:36.433
which is not so sophisticated
in the modern world,

00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:47.100
but is very much embedded in Truth,

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:58.533
and I’m happy you respect that country despite

00:35:58.533 --> 00:36:07.833
it’s unmodernised, natural existence,

00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:22.033
and you are proud of a Mother
who comes of such a country.

00:36:27.666 --> 00:36:33.000
This is the Deepavali
which is celebrated in that country

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.533
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:36:43.033 --> 00:36:46.433
And this is the first time in Rome,

00:36:49.466 --> 00:36:53.566
which is the center of Europe.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.300
Because here is the seven hills,

00:37:06.466 --> 00:37:13.300
expressing the whole of seven chakras.

00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:29.499
That is why a big torch had to be brought
from England in an aeroplane

00:37:29.499 --> 00:37:36.000
to enlighten these seven chakras of Europe.

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:57.800
The Kundalini rises from mooladhara
and goes up to the seventh chakra

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.633
and touches the Sadashiva’s place

00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:09.533
but in this case from Sadashiva’s place,
the light has come down,

00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:16.066
to enlighten and respect
all the chakras from their heart.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.499
In the beginning of the awakening of the
Kundalini, that’s what exactly I do,

00:38:42.499 --> 00:38:51.300
is through your fingertips, the awahana,
the invitation to the Kundalini, is sent.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.833
Unless and until it passes
through these centers

00:38:54.833 --> 00:39:01.566
it cannot open it out sufficiently
for the Kundalini to rise,

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.333
and then the Kundalini rises.

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:34.533
So the invitation first has to come
from the heart chakra here.

00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:45.633
So the desire has to come down first of all,

00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:50.633
the power of desire has to come down,
from the heart,

00:39:50.633 --> 00:39:54.066
to make the Kundalini rise.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.766
So the Kundalini acts,

00:40:03.766 --> 00:40:06.933
the power of action takes place.

00:40:11.933 --> 00:40:17.000
So the responsibility of England

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.100
and the responsibility of Europe is very great.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.666
Unless and until all these chakras are cleared,

00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:39.833
Vishuddhi cannot be pushed aside.

00:40:48.466 --> 00:40:55.866
So we have to consolidate first
in Europe and also in England.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.100
I started it in England then in Europe.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.166
Once we have consolidated it well,

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:15.833
I’m sure Sahaja Yoga will be
very easily established in America.

00:41:27.733 --> 00:41:31.333
India there’s no problem, as you know;

00:41:36.466 --> 00:41:40.100
and that is going to work out very easily

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.966
and once India is awakened

00:41:42.966 --> 00:41:50.400
the Kundalini will start moving very fast,
with great dynamism.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.900
But first these upper chakras must be put right.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.000
Otherwise how can Kundalini come out?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.600
So, you realize your responsibility,

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.366
that we have a force in India, no doubt.

00:42:25.366 --> 00:42:30.233
But how will it rise if there are obstructions?

00:42:30.233 --> 00:42:32.933
You are a part and parcel of this universe,

00:42:32.933 --> 00:42:35.933
you are not hanging somewhere else
from India,

00:42:35.933 --> 00:42:40.900
so India has to depend on you.

00:42:55.033 --> 00:42:59.033
For your sahasrara I have already made
all arrangements

00:42:59.033 --> 00:43:02.866
in the sense I am here in person.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:15.100
I have come down from Kailasha, on this Earth.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:25.166
So, that’s how I have arranged
the whole drama.

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:37.866
But the middle actors are very important.

00:43:44.066 --> 00:43:48.033
They should not act like clowns

00:43:51.566 --> 00:43:54.133
or stupid idiotic people.

00:43:57.499 --> 00:44:03.600
It is becoming quite idiotic,
the atmosphere, I must say,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:08.200
you feel as if you are among
idiots or lunatics.

00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:22.300
So, these ridiculous things that are
happening around us should not impress us

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:28.333
but we should really use them
for amusing ourselves.

00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:40.600
And you have reached that ascent

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.633
that you can see these things are
coming there because of the decadence.

00:44:55.833 --> 00:45:02.800
And the decadence is the ruin,
is the destruction of the chakras also.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.499
So though it is stupidity, idiocity,

00:45:11.499 --> 00:45:15.700
we have to pick up people out of them,

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.100
to support the chakras.

00:45:27.933 --> 00:45:36.000
And to be very careful with the people
who are not Sahajas

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.700
who are sticking on in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:54.366
And now the time has come to throw them out
permanently and they are not to return back.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:07.700
Only the veeras, the courageous,
can worship the Mother.

00:46:13.033 --> 00:46:16.466
And I hope you are all that,

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:23.300
and today is the great day

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:32.200
when I am worshipped by
all the veeras and veeranganas.

00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:40.700
May God bless you all.
