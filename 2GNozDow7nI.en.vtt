00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:11.280
… But not very long, you see. Just one like,&nbsp;
“Your face is shining”, sort of things, you see.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Four, five lines, so that everybody can&nbsp;
sing that. That’s all you have to do.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.760
And also, when these people, new people,&nbsp;
will come and all that, in the beginning,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.584
I don’t think you should bring&nbsp;
them to ashram, to begin with.

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.480
Begin with this one.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.640
First, you should have all the programs there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.017
then those people who are all right,&nbsp;
then allow them to come to the ashram.

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:32.027
Guido: Yes

00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:35.400
Shri Mataji: Like that, and then&nbsp;
teach them also the music that we use.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.160
You should put them -because music is one thing&nbsp;
which binds you much faster than anything else.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.400
And vibration wise also, it’s very good,&nbsp;
because it takes away your thoughts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
and it’s very good for it.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.800
So, that’s how you have to&nbsp;
build up music like that.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.560
Then you have, you see, a very good system here,&nbsp;
which I think, you have a very good system,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.000
that among yourselves, you are very friendly,&nbsp;
helpful, and you do not challenge Guido.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
Because that’s another problem&nbsp;
I always see everywhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.000
that they go on challenging the&nbsp;
person who is connected to Me.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.360
So, then, what happens, that all my&nbsp;
connection starts getting into problems.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.880
So, that is the best thing is to&nbsp;
support him, help him in every way.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
I’m looking after him, and the&nbsp;
things will work out very well.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.840
Now when these people will be coming, you see,&nbsp;
that’s the main thing, how you should handle that.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.840
First of all, when they come, in the first&nbsp;
one or two days, two times and all that,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.160
just you can put my tape for a while.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.080
Let them know about something then talk to&nbsp;
them about it, and they’ll ask their questions,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.000
then ask them to put their&nbsp;
hands, ask them to meditate.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.920
See if the vibrations are coming&nbsp;
or not. You should say that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.480
“It will take one or two times to do that”.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.840
Now about the Kundalini, you should explain&nbsp;
to them everything you should do that.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.601
But you should not tell them that that&nbsp;
I’m Adi Shakti or anything, to begin with.

00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:03.640
Not at all nobody should talk about it.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.800
Not at all, nobody should talk about it.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.680
Gradually, you should see, pick&nbsp;
up people who are like that.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.360
Then you should say, “All&nbsp;
right, ask a question”, you see.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.280
“Is Mother the Adi Shakti?” “Is she&nbsp;
the Holy Ghost?” and all those things.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.800
Then if it happens that way, then they&nbsp;
will start gradually coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.800
You should not, at all, give them ideas,&nbsp;
suddenly. The Mother is Adi Shakti, this is it.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.600
She’s God. Because it’s quite&nbsp;
shocking for them, all right?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.240
So, take it easy. Bring them round.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.040
But if they come to ashram, you see,&nbsp;
you give them some tea, something.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.120
You can arrange some tea there also, can&nbsp;
make some cake here, take it for them.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.240
When they are there, you give them&nbsp;
some tea or something, you see.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.890
Because food is another&nbsp;
thing which also binds you.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.907
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:49.920
Shri Mataji: So, we should have. And&nbsp;
then you can have some music also there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.800
so that the whole thing becomes interesting.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.300
So you can have a little of what you&nbsp;
call, say my speech. Then you can have-

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.627
Guido: Yes, we show the video every Sunday.

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:01.860
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.507
Guido: We show the video,&nbsp;
your tapes, on the video.

00:03:05.507 --> 00:03:05.900
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.067
Guido: Every Sunday we give them tea.

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:09.360
Shri Mataji: Yes, little bit, not much.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.760
You need not show the whole thing.&nbsp;
You give him them half the lecture.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.240
So, they’re curious for the rest of that.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.960
[Laughter]

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.480
Then after that, what you do is to have once the-&nbsp;
that is done, then you can have some meditation.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.740
Then you can have some music&nbsp;
together. And then something to eat.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.640
You see, that’s how it will settle down&nbsp;
better, who are you, and be very kind.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.280
There might be some bhoots there. There&nbsp;
might be some people who are possessed.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.080
Now don’t tell on their faces, “You&nbsp;
are bhoots, this thing, that thing”.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.200
Simple thing is to tell them&nbsp;
that, “You need to be corrected.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.840
For that, you have to put your&nbsp;
left hand towards the photograph,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.720
put a light behind you,&nbsp;
like this, and work it out.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.000
It will work out, you’ll feel better.&nbsp;
Next time, you come along and tell us.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.200
So, start on photograph. We did&nbsp;
the same. We had the same problem”.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.120
Like that, taking upon on&nbsp;
yourself, so they won’t feel bad.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.320
Aways say that, “We were worse than&nbsp;
you are. You are much better than us”.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.280
So, nobody will feel hurt. Gradually,&nbsp;
gradually, you have to bring them along.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.180
And once they are in, they will&nbsp;
not go out as you do not go out.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.040
[Laughter]

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.000
All right? So, but, it has to&nbsp;
be done very wisely because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.960
what I find when I come, there are so many people.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.160
When I don’t come, then they&nbsp;
go out. What is the reason is?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.000
I’m not an Italian I don’t understand&nbsp;
Italian language, I cannot speak it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.280
But there’s something in Me that&nbsp;
they like. That’s why they are there.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.080
The same way, you should have the same&nbsp;
thing: is love, affection, kindness.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.240
Irritability should not be there.&nbsp;
You should not be angry with them.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.600
You should not be unnecessarily upset with them.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.360
And those people who are perfectly all right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.640
who don’t have problems, should&nbsp;
talk, others should keep quiet.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.960
Otherwise, normally those who have problems&nbsp;
should jump first and talk like a ‘bhoot’ to them.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.400
They run away.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.360
So, the leader should decide who can&nbsp;
do the talk. Everybody should not talk.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.520
Then sometimes, I’m seeing because people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.640
have been reporting to Me. They&nbsp;
start arguing among themselves.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.120
Then they have a feeling that they&nbsp;
don’t know what they’re talking.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.480
But you keep one person. If there’s any problem,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.640
you’re going to ask him, “Now,&nbsp;
what is this? What is that?”

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.960
But do not argue among those. They&nbsp;
should know that we are all one people.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.360
Respect each other. We live with respect.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.400
Each other’s respect must be shown.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.640
Like, I’ve seen people, it’s all right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.800
I’m calling him Guido, it’s all&nbsp;
right, because he’s like my son.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.600
But you should not call him, all of you, Guido,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.360
even a little child will come&nbsp;
say ‘Guido’. It’s not proper.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.360
I don’t know how you say,&nbsp;
but in our Indian language,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.120
they will say ‘Guido ji’ or&nbsp;
Guido Uncle or Guiso- like that.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.600
We never take the names like that of our elders.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:14.630
So, one should not just say, or&nbsp;
Guido brother, something like that.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640
All right?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.800
It’s better to talk, “Brother,&nbsp;
hello brother, how are you?”

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.280
Like we talk in the family. And not in a- where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.571
that is, sort of, as if on the&nbsp;
street we are walking, hum?

00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:31.240
We belong to one family, We belong to one family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.880
and we have to address each other&nbsp;
as if we belong to one family.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:43.160
Like in India, anybody may be, we&nbsp;
say, elder brother, younger brother.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.560
My grand-daughters were so much&nbsp;
used to this, that their pot also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.560
you see, they used to call it ‘potty’.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.040
And then we said to ‘ji’ to&nbsp;
everything dishes, so ‘potty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:58.782
ji’. She used to say to&nbsp;
potty also ‘ji’, ‘potti ji’.

00:06:58.782 --> 00:06:58.792
[Laughter]

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:02.680
When we give respect we say&nbsp;
‘ji’, like ‘Guidoji’, ‘Gumarji’,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.480
‘Modiji’. Everybody’s is ‘ji’, ‘Mataji’.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.780
[Laughter]

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:17.080
But respect is one thing we must learn, of each&nbsp;
other. Respect, help, sharing, we must learn.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.560
That is very important.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.680
Then another thing is, I know that Italian is a&nbsp;
very good language and I would like to learn it.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.520
But you know how difficult it is going&nbsp;
to be for me to learn so many languages.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.939
[Laughter]

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:34.360
So, it’s better that you people try&nbsp;
to learn English. It is better for us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:41.860
because at least, and if possible, Marathi.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:41.870
[Laughter]

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.120
Or Hindi, one of the&nbsp;
languages, it’s not difficult.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:55.720
Now I know at least five six languages.&nbsp;
So, you can know one or two. All right?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.120
The whole Sahasrara Day was wonderful.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.760
All this was very beautifully. And everybody was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.160
amazed how you arranged the place&nbsp;
and how it happened, everything.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.680
And because they are not so positive as you are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.720
there is some sort of negativity with them,&nbsp;
that’s why they cannot arrange like that.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.320
But there is a fact. If you are positive like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.960
we could not arrange the hall&nbsp;
in London for so many days.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:36.022
Ultimately, they said, “We cannot do&nbsp;
it”. So, I rang up, Ganapatipule it was.

00:08:36.022 --> 00:08:40.415
I rang up Arnaud. I said, “Arnaud, what&nbsp;
about you?” He said, “Mother, all right”.

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:54.854
It was not Ganapatipule. What was the second one?

00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:54.875
Sahaja Yogini: Purna.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:57.552
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:08:57.552 --> 00:08:57.573
Sahaja Yogini: Purna.

00:08:57.573 --> 00:08:57.596
Shri Mataji: Guru puja?

00:08:57.596 --> 00:08:57.618
Sahaja Yogi: Navaratri

00:08:57.618 --> 00:08:59.440
Guido: Navaratri. No, Diwali, Diwali.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.416
Shri Mataji: Diwali?

00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:01.636
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

00:09:01.636 --> 00:09:03.002
Sahaja Yogini: Ganesha puja.

00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:05.100
Guido: Navaratri, Navaratri. In Switzerland

00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:07.199
Shri Mataji: In Switzerland, what was that?

00:09:07.199 --> 00:09:08.029
Guido: Navaratri.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:09.200
Shri Mataji: Navaratri!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.600
It was Navaratri, Navaratri puja.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.320
So, they said, “We cannot do&nbsp;
anything. There’s no possibility”.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.040
Everybody wanted to come for Navaratri.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.480
I rang up Arnaud. He said, “All right&nbsp;
mother. I’ll tell you tomorrow”.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.320
Next day, he telephones to tell me that, “Mother,&nbsp;
we’ve got a very good place”, this and this.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.280
And you remember, we went up?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.187
Guido: Yes, Mother.

00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:31.760
Shri Mataji: And there we had the&nbsp;
puja! Wonderful place, it was.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.080
That’s how he arranged, in one day! He’s such&nbsp;
a positive man, Arnaud is a very positive man.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.920
So many Swiss don’t like him&nbsp;
because he’s so positive.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:48.600
Big disparity, but doesn’t matter.&nbsp;
You must know that I know everyone.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.240
Like, some Swiss decided&nbsp;
that he should not be there.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.480
They wrote letters to Me saying that, “Mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.220
we don’t want him there. You’d&nbsp;
better talk to us about it”.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.600
Then one of them telephone to&nbsp;
Me. So, I said, “What is it?”

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.800
He said, “Oh, Arnaud is too&nbsp;
strong on us”, this, that.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.840
“So, what should we do?” I said, “See now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.080
I just want Arnaud and all of you&nbsp;
can go away from Sahaja Yoga”.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:22.190
So, she kept quiet. So this is what it is.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200
[Laughter]

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.920
We are doing very well now and I have&nbsp;
great hopes about Italy, great hopes.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.080
I’m sure it will work out very well and that&nbsp;
one day, we’ll have a very great Center here.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.920
As it is, we have seen this place. Now we&nbsp;
are thinking of buying it and all that.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.240
Let us see what happens. If you get that place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.240
then we’ll get some people&nbsp;
from all over, work it out,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.200
we have to build it up do it&nbsp;
properly so that for many seminars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.440
we can have such a big place you see.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.200
We can have some tents or something&nbsp;
there. People can stay in the tent.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.240
We can have seminars or anything,&nbsp;
I mean, whatever it is proper.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.800
You can do there, it’s a very big place.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.280
We had seen one place in London it&nbsp;
had 12 and a half acres of land.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.871
But they said, “We’ll not allow any motor cars to&nbsp;
come in; we’ll not allow any tents to be there”.

00:11:13.871 --> 00:11:16.960
You see, then what’s the use of getting this&nbsp;
big place what are we going to do there?

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.840
Nothing, we can’t do anything!

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.760
So, that’s how it will [unclear].&nbsp;
But you people should see to it,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.120
that you arrange everything properly and you&nbsp;
can have a well there or something maybe.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.000
There must be water there, I’m sure.&nbsp;
You might find some nice stones there.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.280
Anything is possible. So, just&nbsp;
think of God and just do the job&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.840
and you get everything that you need in that way.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:50.200
And it was such a successful,&nbsp;
time such a successful time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:56.800
that everybody must learn from&nbsp;
you how things have worked out.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.600
Now the second part is that the&nbsp;
children will be coming here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.400
small children, and you must look after them.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.720
I was thinking that, from your school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.880
there’s one girl called Jane who is&nbsp;
going through an education in Montessori.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.680
For now, she’ll be finishing now and she&nbsp;
can come here and teach the children.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.720
And you can also learn the&nbsp;
ways and methods out of her.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.939
But some of the girls from&nbsp;
here can learn Montessori.

00:12:25.939 --> 00:12:29.160
[To a Sahaja Yogini] What are what&nbsp;
are you doing? What are you studying?

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.965
Guido: [Unclear].

00:12:29.965 --> 00:12:30.770
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.390
Sahaja Yogini: I am working, Shri Mataji. I work.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.433
Shri Mataji: As what?

00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:39.627
Guido: She is working in a dentist studio.

00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:40.960
Shri Mataji: What studio?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.017
Guido: Dentist.

00:12:45.017 --> 00:12:45.027
[Laughter]

00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:46.580
Shri Mataji: What do you do there?

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.425
Guido: She is just helping, helping.

00:12:49.425 --> 00:12:50.440
Sahaja Yogini: Assistant.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.363
Guido: Assistant.

00:12:54.363 --> 00:12:54.390
Shri Mataji: Assistant, ha.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:54.400
[Laughter]

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:54.840
So-

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.600
Guido: But just half of the day.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.640
Shri Mataji: Half of the day?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.120
Guido: Yes.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.660
Shri Mataji: Then you can join&nbsp;
some, there must be a school.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.107
Guido: She’s very helpful in.

00:13:03.107 --> 00:13:06.066
Shri Mataji: Is there a Montessori&nbsp;
school here? She’s very-

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:08.185
Guido: She is very helpful in this.

00:13:08.185 --> 00:13:12.320
Sahaja Yogini: We have a Montessori school&nbsp;
but it’s very long the course, it’s 3 years.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.915
We have to go to school every morning&nbsp;
for 3 years to learn the Montessori.

00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:20.145
Shri Mataji: Where is it?

00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:21.627
Sahaja Yogini: It’s in Rome in the-

00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:23.585
Shri Mataji: But there must&nbsp;
be some correspondence course.

00:13:23.585 --> 00:13:25.680
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, that’s the only way outside.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.400
Shri Mataji: Better do the correspondence&nbsp;
course, you see, all of you together.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.400
You can all read about it and all&nbsp;
of you discuss among yourselves.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.945
Better do it it’s very good, because&nbsp;
children can be helped all over.

00:13:37.945 --> 00:13:39.707
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:13:39.707 --> 00:13:43.840
Shri Mataji: You can discuss among&nbsp;
yourself and start it. Now how?

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.400
See, if they have an half day to start&nbsp;
a school day, half day, so maybe,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:55.080
if you become quite Montessori expert, we can send&nbsp;
you all the equipment of Montessori from India.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.865
You get it in a set.

00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:57.800
Sahaja Yogini: From India?

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.040
Guido: From England.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.465
Shri Mataji: India

00:14:00.465 --> 00:14:01.067
Sahaja Yogini: India.

00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:06.440
Shri Mataji: Of course. India’s&nbsp;
Montessori is very popular.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:13.545
All wooden things that they use, everything.&nbsp;
You get a complete set there, not in England.

00:14:13.545 --> 00:14:19.004
Sahaja Yogini: Not in England.&nbsp;
We have in Italy. It’s expensive

00:14:19.004 --> 00:14:19.021
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:23.467
Sahaja Yogini: But we yes, in Brescia, in&nbsp;
the north there is a town where they make it.

00:14:23.467 --> 00:14:24.265
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:14:24.265 --> 00:14:26.027
Sahaja Yogini: In the north of Italy.

00:14:26.027 --> 00:14:26.830
Shri Mataji: In the?

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.318
Guido: In the north of Italy,&nbsp;
but it’s very, very expensive.

00:14:29.318 --> 00:14:32.800
Shri Mataji: Oh, I can send you, if you want.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.840
Anything that you want, you&nbsp;
can get it made, no problem.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.636
Just let me know what you&nbsp;
want and we’ll order them.

00:14:43.636 --> 00:14:43.667
Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji.

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:49.988
Shri Mataji: When the Sahaja&nbsp;
Yogis are coming, they can bring.

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:52.110
It’s something they can manage&nbsp;
and they can bring baggage.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:59.040
It can be done, no problem.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:08.800
I’m sure there must be lots&nbsp;
of these things, there.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.280
I think that is the best thing&nbsp;
you can do, in the schools.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.160
And also, I was thinking of&nbsp;
Health farm [Krishi agriculture].

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.523
I’ve been thinking about.

00:15:17.523 --> 00:15:17.547
Sahaja Yogini: The what?

00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:18.200
Shri Mataji: Health farm.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.627
Guido: Health farm, this is very nice project.

00:15:23.627 --> 00:15:29.440
Shri Mataji: So, anybody who wants&nbsp;
to do it, can come to India and learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.800
in some, one of the institutions about it.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.400
You can become a doctor or something.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.920
He’s working also? You are working?

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:45.157
Anybody who wants to do. You are working also?

00:15:45.157 --> 00:15:45.182
Sahaja Yogini: He starts.

00:15:45.182 --> 00:15:45.199
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:45.227
Sahaja Yogi: I’m starting.

00:15:45.227 --> 00:15:46.680
Shri Mataji: What does he do?

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.556
I’m studying in a scientific school, Mother..

00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:53.573
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:15:53.573 --> 00:15:53.627
Sahaja Yogi: A scientific&nbsp;
school. A scientific school.

00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:58.920
Sahaja Yogi: Scientific school,&nbsp;
he’s doing. He’s studying.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.987
Shri Mataji: What does he study? Science?

00:16:01.987 --> 00:16:04.767
Sahaja Yogi: Science.

00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:04.812
Shri Mataji: So, anybody who wants to do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:04.812 --> 00:16:04.883
can come to India, and learn in some,&nbsp;
one of the institutions about it.

00:16:04.883 --> 00:16:04.920
You can become a doctor or something.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.240
So, anybody who wants to become a doctor like&nbsp;
that, can come and do the course in India.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:22.375
You can find out admission. I think it is&nbsp;
one year course or something like that.

00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:22.387
Guido: Only?

00:16:22.387 --> 00:16:28.920
Shri Mataji: Naturopathy.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.480
I wanted Bogdan to do it. Let’s see.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:42.200
Anybody can do, there’s no need&nbsp;
to have a medical background.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:53.000
They just teach you how to fast, and how to put&nbsp;
a seed pod of a- in mud and all those things.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.640
And all the instrument you can get there.&nbsp;
It’s not difficult for naturopathy.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.840
If you want, I can find out for anyone&nbsp;
who wants to become. It’s not difficult.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.200
Anyone of you, all the course and&nbsp;
everything, I’ll find out for you.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:28.840
Oh, you come along, the&nbsp;
musicians. Sangeeta’s father!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:28.905
Guido: Sangeeta’s father!

00:17:28.905 --> 00:17:28.929
[Laughter]

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:31.200
Shri Mataji: I have told him&nbsp;
about the music. Now you sit down.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:40.140
Somebody has to compose, and somebody&nbsp;
has to put it in proper music.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:48.300
And has to be worked out in that way. It&nbsp;
should be a music that can be sung by everyone.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:54.260
Not a difficult music. If you can sing&nbsp;
Marathi song, then you can sing anything.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:58.080
It’s such a fast tempo there,&nbsp;
aren’t they? They are very fast.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.200
Marathi songs are very, very fast. I’m&nbsp;
surprised how you can sing so well!

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.827
So, should we have one song&nbsp;
before we take the leave?

00:18:05.827 --> 00:18:09.823
Sahaja Yogi: Oh! Yes.

00:18:09.823 --> 00:18:09.833
[Laughter]

00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:10.787
Guido: Of course.

00:18:10.787 --> 00:18:18.895
Shri Mataji: That’s it, get some music.&nbsp;
Then we’ll have our food and sleep off.

00:18:18.895 --> 00:18:18.910
Guido: OK. Yes.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.907
Federico: Shri Mataji, what should I&nbsp;
do with this Indian project of Delhi?

00:18:23.907 --> 00:18:24.480
Shri Mataji: Of what?

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:32.240
Guido: The music project with Venu Gopalan.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.540
Oh, he’s a stupid fellow, he’s&nbsp;
never on. What did he tell you?

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.320
Federico: Well, they invited me to&nbsp;
their place, when I was in Ganapatipule.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.800
So, we asked your permission and&nbsp;
I went to Delhi after the Tour.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.720
And I was a guest of them for about 10 days,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.000
and they told me about this&nbsp;
project, about this ballet.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.080
And so they asked me if I wanted&nbsp;
to take care of the Western part.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:08.223
And that’s how I started with this&nbsp;
music and with this ballet with Monia.

00:19:08.223 --> 00:19:11.880
Shri Mataji: You see, this&nbsp;
Venugopalan, tries to please his wife.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.880
He wanted to have this project done. I told that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.340
“Pavari is the one who will be&nbsp;
going around the whole world.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.400
And he’ll be doing. So, why don’t you do this?”

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.720
Now, as it is, what he did was, Venugopalan,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.280
he got hold of some other artist&nbsp;
and he didn’t bother about Pavari.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.560
Because I didn’t want that it was to be for&nbsp;
India, I thought that it is going to be for the-

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.040
just help him there please –

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.560
Not for India, but for all over the world.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.920
Because this fellow will be&nbsp;
travelling and will have this music.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.760
On the contrary, he wanted to do it in Delhi.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.840
How to do it in Delhi? It’s a competition&nbsp;
and all that, not easy to do it.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.040
So, all things fizzled out because&nbsp;
the artist [unclear] or something.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.733
Federico: Actually the singer got sick.

00:20:07.733 --> 00:20:07.750
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:16.840
Federico: The singer got very sick. They got in&nbsp;
a singer who was in charge to compose the music.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.880
Light Indian music singer and he got very sick.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.800
He was smoking a lot this man. He was not a&nbsp;
Sahaja Yogi, of course, and he got very sick.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:32.242
And so I think for that, for that reason. And&nbsp;
the dancer also got another better job to do.

00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:32.270
Shri Mataji: I don’t know.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.507
Federico: Things like that.

00:20:33.507 --> 00:20:38.200
Shri Mataji: But it’s only since because&nbsp;
she because she went on the wrong lines.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:45.950
Now Pavari is still there. We’ll&nbsp;
see now what we can work it out.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.990
Because Venugopalan, I had enough of it.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.000
Federico: Because, actually, while I was&nbsp;
there, I thought that the best way for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.920
to be sure to go to Indian this year, was&nbsp;
to look for some concerts, luth concerts.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.040
So, I went to the Italian Institute and&nbsp;
they sent me to the German Institute.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.880
And actually, I have more than&nbsp;
11 concerts to play in India now

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.920
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.240
Federico: Just by myself with my&nbsp;
luth. Just before the Indian Tour.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.640
So, my concerts will start at the end of November&nbsp;
all over India, Nepal, and other countries there.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.254
And they will finish on the 19th of December.

00:21:17.254 --> 00:21:17.270
Shri Mataji: Oh.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.320
Federico: And I will earn enough money for the&nbsp;
Tour. And I was thinking to use the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:28.600
money to stay three more weeks and arrange&nbsp;
with the Venugopalan this show, you see.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.800
So eventually, if something can be done&nbsp;
after the Tour, I will be well prepared,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.240
because I already tried to work out these things.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.600
Shri Mataji: It goes off their&nbsp;
heads, absolutely off their heads.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:58.520
Now I’m not going to ask him&nbsp;
anymore, I had enough of it.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.821
This is, Venugopalan can’t see&nbsp;
women comparability, comparability.

00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:05.000
Federico: Anyway, Shri Mataji, we will&nbsp;
try to go on with this ballet project,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.267
if you agree on the same lines, and we will see.

00:22:08.267 --> 00:22:09.800
Shri Mataji: Which one?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.840
Federico: With Monia, the same things we did. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.867
will try to develop more this&nbsp;
sort of music with this dance.

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:19.000
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. You see, for this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I’ll have to think it over because I&nbsp;
left it to her and it was a mistake.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.735
I have to do it myself this.

00:22:31.735 --> 00:22:36.880
[Cut in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:59.440
the audio]

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:25.000
That’s what Warren was telling Me. He’s willing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.200
do it in Kathak, Kathak style.&nbsp;
I don’t know what went wrong.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.097
Thank you.

00:23:37.097 --> 00:23:37.110
Guido: Tchao.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.880
Federico: Because also the artists&nbsp;
were supposed to be very good

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.990
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:47.765
Federico: Also, this dancer was supposed to be&nbsp;
very good, you know, the main dancer in the scene.

00:23:47.765 --> 00:23:47.790
Shri Mataji: Venugopalan.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.747
Federico: Yes, the men they were&nbsp;
in touch and they were paying.

00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:58.680
Shri Mataji: But, they are South Indian&nbsp;
dancers. And he was from the north.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:05.640
And he was in a Kathak style. Of course,&nbsp;
he is also a very well-known dancer.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:23.393
The one is white is internationally [unclear].&nbsp;
And she didn’t get any chance at all.

00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:29.871
Let us see now whatever they&nbsp;
decide. They will [unclear].

00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:33.960
Federico: I will, Mother, I will&nbsp;
try to be available after India.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:34.144
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:24:34.144 --> 00:24:34.927
Federico: Three weeks or one month.

00:24:34.927 --> 00:24:34.950
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.443
Federico: And I hope I will have&nbsp;
enough money; if it’s necessary.

00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:37.466
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:24:37.466 --> 00:24:39.587
Federico: And I will be there after the Tour.

00:24:39.587 --> 00:24:58.320
Shri Mataji: All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:58.240
We will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.384 --> 00:28:28.120
sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.840 --> 00:29:58.040
work out.
