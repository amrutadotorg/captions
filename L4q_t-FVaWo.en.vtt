WEBVTT

00:00.571 --> 00:09.852
….On the 14th day, he was killed
by Shadanana, Kartikeya,

00:10.053 --> 00:17.159
was the son of Parvati and Shankar

00:18.495 --> 00:23.468
who was a very powerful expression

00:23.669 --> 00:30.216
of Rudra Shakti, is that He is the killing
power of God.

00:30.641 --> 00:37.999
And He was created specially for this
purpose, to kill Narakasura.

00:40.165 --> 00:49.958
Then the - this one was, this rakshasa,

00:50.890 --> 00:56.808
was such a menace and he had ruined
so many people’s lives.

00:57.009 --> 01:05.746
He has done such a havoc and people didn’t
know how to find protection.

01:08.591 --> 01:14.066
That time, when Narakasura was killed
by the Shakti

01:14.267 --> 01:21.113
in the form of Shadanana, Kartikeya, there
was celebration all over.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.755
People celebrated the next night

01:23.956 --> 01:29.609
and the next night was the darkest night
of the whole year, is tonight.

01:29.810 --> 01:39.589
The 15th day of the waning moon is called
as amavasya [new moon].

01:40.591 --> 01:47.653
So this is the darkest night. There are
always dark nights every month once,

01:47.854 --> 01:50.630
but this is the darkest night of the whole
year

01:50.831 --> 01:55.621
and just before this Narakasura was killed.

01:55.988 --> 02:06.848
And all the lights are put in the house
and lots of these lamps are burnt.

02:10.698 --> 02:17.679
Of course electricity lights are different
from these, as you know,

02:17.880 --> 02:21.291
that they burn badhas all the time.

02:21.492 --> 02:27.428
So, after the death of Narakasura,

02:27.703 --> 02:30.039
he had a big army of his own

02:30.240 --> 02:36.067
when he was very powerful and he had
hypnotized many people,

02:36.268 --> 02:40.377
so to get rid of the residual ones
altogether,

02:40.578 --> 02:49.461
they lighted all these lamps, so that all
those devils

02:49.662 --> 02:56.278
who were still roaming about should all be
burnt off;

02:56.479 --> 03:01.612
and you can understand in Sahaja Yoga how
a lamp burns

03:01.813 --> 03:07.215
and how a badha is taken away by a lamp.

03:07.416 --> 03:11.040
But still all the lights of the house must
be lighted.

03:11.241 --> 03:14.956
[to somebody: Will you go and light
all the lights in the house? ].

03:15.157 --> 03:20.668
Outside and inside, there should be,
everywhere there should be light.

03:20.869 --> 03:26.568
No room should be kept in darkness because
they hide in the darkness.

03:26.769 --> 03:30.627
So no corner should be dark.

03:34.807 --> 03:42.053
Then you know that Rama killed Ravana
on the 10th day

03:45.164 --> 03:52.423
of the rising moon – that was Dussehra –

03:52.624 --> 03:57.526
and he (Ravana) was burnt. And then He
(Rama) returned back

03:57.727 --> 04:06.681
by an aeroplane called as pushpak
to Ayodhya, to His own capital,

04:06.882 --> 04:14.021
where He was crowned as king on this day.

04:15.539 --> 04:20.978
Now we have got astrologically,

04:21.179 --> 04:29.064
there are 3 and a half auspicious days

04:29.265 --> 04:40.882
where you don’t have to consult any books
of astrology, which are called as panchang,

04:41.083 --> 04:45.811
to find out whether it is an auspicious
time or not. For any puja,

04:46.012 --> 04:51.541
for any… good work you have to do, people
consult in India

04:51.742 --> 04:56.643
the panchang, is the book to find out which
date is auspicious, which is not.

04:56.844 --> 05:01.490
One of them is today, is the day you can
do anything good,

05:01.691 --> 05:08.513
you decide anything good. Today is the day
to take an oath,

05:08.714 --> 05:12.262
to think of something great,

05:13.321 --> 05:17.617
to visualise something big, to ask a boon,

05:17.818 --> 05:28.119
to do a big puja, is one of the greatest
day.

05:28.320 --> 05:36.286
One of the - we call them muhurtas – which
where you do not consult these books.

05:36.487 --> 05:40.717
And that’s why Rajyabhishek of, I mean
the crowning ceremony

05:40.918 --> 05:44.953
of Shri Rama took place on this day.

05:45.154 --> 05:55.372
So there are so many aspects for this,

05:55.573 --> 06:04.525
that after Rama had killed Ravana, another
satanic force,

06:04.726 --> 06:07.702
this Diwali was celebrated.

06:07.903 --> 06:14.389
Also this was celebrated much earlier when
Narakasura was killed.

06:15.780 --> 06:21.288
And this is how we express our joy and
happiness,

06:21.489 --> 06:26.500
our gratitude to God that He has protected
us always with His power,

06:26.701 --> 06:31.332
with His Shakti, and has destroyed all
the rakshasas

06:31.533 --> 06:39.632
and all the evil forces of this world.
This is the time of Thanksgiving.

06:40.460 --> 06:45.746
On this day we have to go to our elders

06:45.947 --> 06:50.688
and give thanks to them for whatever they
have done for us.

06:50.889 --> 06:56.282
To all those people whom we have to give
thanks today is the day

06:56.483 --> 07:04.589
when we have to ask God to bless all these
people.

07:16.882 --> 07:24.235
For us also to be very jubilant and very
happy, is the day, because now I feel

07:24.436 --> 07:30.065
from tomorrow Sahaja Yoga is going to take
new strides.

07:30.266 --> 07:34.359
From tomorrow starts the new year.

07:34.826 --> 07:40.391
And the new year of the Shalivahana,
vahana calendar -

07:40.592 --> 07:47.284
there are two calendars, one is Vikram,
another is Shalivahan - of the Shalivahan.

07:47.485 --> 07:51.925
And that is the dynasty, you know that,
that they were My forefathers,

07:52.126 --> 07:55.253
who started this shalivahan.

07:55.454 --> 07:59.435
Now there are two stories about Shalivahan.

07:59.636 --> 08:13.070
One says that this gentleman was breaking
a branch

08:14.181 --> 08:18.616
and was standing on it, and that’s why he
was called as Shalivahan.

08:18.817 --> 08:24.527
But actually it means the shawl.

08:24.728 --> 08:28.315
The shawl is called as Shali in marathi
language

08:28.516 --> 08:33.728
and the one who carried the shawl
of the Mother is called as the Shalivahan.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.154
And when some sahaja yogis went to India,

08:37.355 --> 08:41.259
if you remember in Rahuri, that is
the place Rahuri Nandgaon,

08:41.460 --> 08:46.134
you have also seen where My ancestors
lived and all that place.

08:46.335 --> 08:50.070
They gave you the shawls to wear.

08:50.271 --> 08:53.006
And I asked them, “Why did you give them
shawls? So they said,

08:53.207 --> 08:56.482
"These are the shalivahanas. All of them
are shalivahanas now.

08:56.683 --> 09:02.989
That’s why we have to give them shawls”.
And they were very happy to do that.

09:04.879 --> 09:08.261
So tomorrow is the new year day.

09:08.462 --> 09:14.291
Now, why is it necessary to have a new year
day in our life?

09:15.682 --> 09:25.226
Why - last year those who got realisation
were very lucky people,

09:25.427 --> 09:32.054
but plodding through the path
of Self-realisation

09:32.255 --> 09:43.299
one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism
that one has when you get realisation.

09:43.500 --> 09:48.336
You think of doing so many things about it.
When you get realisation

09:48.537 --> 09:55.402
you are so much engrossed into it, you
enjoy it so much that you think that,

09:55.603 --> 09:59.419
“Now the time has come for me to do this
and that and that.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.222
And I’m going to contact these people,
and I’m going to give

10:02.423 --> 10:04.820
these news to this one, and I’m going to do
this work,

10:05.021 --> 10:11.310
I’ll show to Mother that what She has given
me, I have made it many folds.

10:11.627 --> 10:15.484
Because it was a new experience, great
experience,

10:15.685 --> 10:19.951
the only experience that you have been
waiting for.

10:21.036 --> 10:24.921
And that you also decide that I am going
to now

10:25.122 --> 10:32.366
become the torch bearer of this great light
that has come into me.

10:32.567 --> 10:37.888
And I am going to form one of the lights
of this Deepavali.

10:38.089 --> 10:43.471
Deepavali, deep means these lights, avali
means the row of lights.

10:43.717 --> 10:49.575
So I’m going to be one of them. And we are
going to enlighten the path of the people

10:49.776 --> 10:52.904
who want to have Self-realisation.

10:53.105 --> 10:56.286
All these great ideas come to us when we
touch our depths.

10:56.487 --> 11:04.140
And we feel responsible for all the rest
of the humanity.

11:04.912 --> 11:07.621
But then we gradually realize that there
are lots of problems

11:07.822 --> 11:11.110
with our ascent, own being,

11:11.348 --> 11:16.110
and the Kundalini goes back into it, comes
up again and you realize

11:16.311 --> 11:22.905
that you have to correct yourself quite
a lot. Then this correction portion starts,

11:23.106 --> 11:27.957
you start thinking about yourself more than
about others.

11:29.681 --> 11:34.517
And also other things which were identified
with us

11:34.741 --> 11:40.604
like our own personal problems, our own
personal ideas, ambitions, professions

11:40.805 --> 11:45.565
and all the things that, with which we have
been enamored so far

11:45.766 --> 11:49.246
start peeping into our minds. And we start
forgetting

11:49.447 --> 11:53.852
that moment when we got our realization

11:54.383 --> 11:59.470
and all that we promised within ourselves
to do.

11:59.671 --> 12:06.856
So, the new day comes to remind you,

12:07.057 --> 12:11.875
doesn’t matter whatever has happened has
happened, is finished.

12:12.076 --> 12:17.636
Today a new day has come to you again
for you to promise again.

12:17.837 --> 12:24.020
Again start your journey, know the sun
has come,

12:24.221 --> 12:35.186
and now be refreshed, the newness brings
the freshness of life -

12:35.387 --> 12:41.548
and then you again start with greater
enthusiasm on the new day,

12:41.749 --> 12:50.318
with new ideas, with new promises, with
new vows

12:51.042 --> 12:55.807
and with greater understanding about Sahaja
Yoga.

12:57.127 --> 13:01.023
Those who have got now realization,

13:02.422 --> 13:08.568
they have to know actually what happens
as you mature.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.346
You start changing your attitude.

13:15.134 --> 13:18.949
Today only, somebody asked me a question,

13:19.538 --> 13:23.714
and that’s what should happen to all
of you.

13:23.915 --> 13:28.863
After sometime the attitude is changed,
changed so much

13:29.064 --> 13:32.683
that you know that you are no more seeking,
now you have to give.

13:32.884 --> 13:35.933
You just talk of giving and not of seeking
anymore,

13:36.134 --> 13:41.756
because you have found it full. Till
the pitcher is filled,

13:41.957 --> 13:45.177
the water can be poured into it, when
it has come to the brim,

13:45.378 --> 13:51.138
it says no, add in (unclear) nothing.
Anymore you pour in will go to others.

13:51.820 --> 13:59.074
So this attitude when develops in you,
you should know that you are matured.

13:59.275 --> 14:05.435
This attitude is the only test to see that
it is matured.

14:05.636 --> 14:12.068
No questions, no problems, only thought

14:12.269 --> 14:20.512
that really covers the entire space before
us is how to bring others

14:20.713 --> 14:30.457
to this great heavenly atmosphere of divine
love.

14:32.219 --> 14:37.305
First one has fears, then he develops
protections.

14:37.506 --> 14:41.805
He is worried about giving all the time
bandhans to oneself,

14:42.006 --> 14:48.469
looking after one’s own vibrations.

14:48.670 --> 14:52.194
Then he catches, he is worried, he doesn’t
want to meet some people,

14:52.395 --> 15:01.450
he condemns others and he says that “you
are not alright” and he shuns some people.

15:01.651 --> 15:08.694
All these things happen, gradually you
become absolutely

15:08.895 --> 15:13.097
one with your satisfaction.

15:13.298 --> 15:18.274
And then the question starts: how should
I love this person?

15:18.475 --> 15:21.527
How should I give my love to this person?

15:21.728 --> 15:33.654
How should I express that he also jumps
into the same heavenly bliss?

15:35.955 --> 15:43.420
Then the attention becomes stable.

15:43.621 --> 15:52.044
You don’t pay attention here and there.
All your attention is on this.

15:52.245 --> 15:59.160
You become thus the Gurus of Sahaja Yoga.

16:01.876 --> 16:08.051
This attainment has taken place in many
of you.

16:08.252 --> 16:12.680
You had ups and downs, no doubt, but forget
all that.

16:12.881 --> 16:19.458
And it’s so gratifying, so beautiful to see

16:19.659 --> 16:26.443
that in My own lifetime I’ve seen this
thing happening within you,

16:26.673 --> 16:29.907
that you feel so responsible about it.

16:30.108 --> 16:34.190
You cannot force others about Sahaja Yoga.
That you must know.

16:34.391 --> 16:37.942
There cannot be any coaxing about it,

16:38.118 --> 16:42.341
but only your love should convince another
person.

16:42.542 --> 16:51.350
Your love should make another person feel
that he should also

16:51.551 --> 16:59.996
follow the same path which leads to such
beautiful life of love.

17:00.265 --> 17:05.890
Your example itself would show it.

17:08.161 --> 17:12.102
The whole priorities change.

17:13.985 --> 17:18.105
The whole atmosphere changes.

17:18.306 --> 17:23.486
And you become something very, very
different.

17:23.781 --> 17:29.125
If somebody asks what happens when you
enlighten the light?

17:29.326 --> 17:32.697
Then it gives the light. What happens
to it?

17:32.898 --> 17:37.129
Till it was not giving the light was
the problem. Now, it is enlightened

17:37.330 --> 17:43.353
for giving the light to others. But
the light goes like this in the beginning.

17:43.554 --> 17:51.010
So those who have got realization should
know that it will happen.

17:51.211 --> 17:55.638
First thing that will happen are doubts
that you become into it.

17:55.839 --> 18:01.606
Because you belong to a society which
doubts everything,

18:01.807 --> 18:05.079
especially sanity.

18:09.025 --> 18:17.828
And you start doubting it, but doubting or
thinking about it, you never got it.

18:18.029 --> 18:24.994
You got it just like that. Why did you get?

18:27.315 --> 18:35.743
You got it because somebody has loved you
very much

18:35.944 --> 18:43.546
and has been gracious. Because you have
had this seeking in your previous lives,

18:43.747 --> 18:47.941
and you have done lots of goods which
are been rewarded.

18:48.142 --> 18:53.926
Your checks have been cashed in the bank.

18:54.127 --> 18:56.764
How are you doubting it? And that means
you are doubting yourself,

18:56.965 --> 19:02.766
nobody else but yourself, because you
cannot believe that you have got it.

19:03.269 --> 19:10.894
So don’t go into another trip of doubting.
By doubting you will go very slow.

19:11.095 --> 19:18.919
And sometimes it reaches such a point
that I start doubting also for a change

19:19.120 --> 19:29.387
about your capacity, and your calibre as to
how far you are going to go in Sahaja Yoga.

19:29.588 --> 19:35.745
Because Sahaja Yoga is not the job
of useless people.

19:35.946 --> 19:39.233
They have to be a very, very special type.

19:39.434 --> 19:44.667
If they are ordinary people they can never
take to Sahaja Yoga.

19:44.868 --> 19:50.594
They’ll come up little bit, again go down,
they’ll again come up and go down.

19:55.365 --> 20:00.606
But once you come into it you are not to be
goaded much really -

20:00.807 --> 20:07.784
if you start enjoying it, then you will go
on with it, you cannot give up.

20:07.985 --> 20:12.627
Because that is the source of all
enjoyment.

20:15.209 --> 20:18.370
So today is the day of enjoyment.

20:18.571 --> 20:23.995
Let us be happy that we have killed
the darkness within us

20:24.196 --> 20:29.586
and we have put our lights out for others
to be enlightened,

20:29.787 --> 20:34.587
to give light to others of God’s love.

20:34.788 --> 20:37.769
May God Bless you all.

20:48.294 --> 20:53.889
Now, what would you like to do? You want
to wash My feet or something?

20:54.090 --> 20:56.278
Yogi: We… If You do the puja.
Shri Mataji: Alright.

20:56.479 --> 20:59.696
Yogi: Ganesha... Shri Mataji: Now, when
you say mantras and all that first of all,

20:59.897 --> 21:07.266
then they’ll also take it. Now let their …
now see…

21:08.774 --> 21:10.424
Malcolm has not come, isn’t it?

21:10.625 --> 21:16.540
Malcolm, did you come for any puja before?
No, Malcolm has not come.

21:18.693 --> 21:23.291
Who else here? You haven’t done any puja,
isn’t it?

21:23.492 --> 21:26.452
You haven’t done. I’m asking you.
