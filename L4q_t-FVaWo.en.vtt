00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:09.852
….On the 14th day, he was killed
by Shadanana, Kartikeya,

00:00:10.053 --> 00:00:17.159
was the son of Parvati and Shankar

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:23.468
who was a very powerful expression

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:30.216
of Rudra Shakti, is that He is the killing
power of God.

00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:37.999
And He was created specially for this
purpose, to kill Narakasura.

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:49.958
Then the - this one was, this rakshasa,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.808
was such a menace and he had ruined
so many people’s lives.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:05.746
He has done such a havoc and people didn’t
know how to find protection.

00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:14.066
That time, when Narakasura was killed
by the Shakti

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:21.113
in the form of Shadanana, Kartikeya, there
was celebration all over.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:23.755
People celebrated the next night

00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:29.609
and the next night was the darkest night
of the whole year, is tonight.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:39.589
The 15th day of the waning moon is called
as amavasya [new moon].

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:47.653
So this is the darkest night. There are
always dark nights every month once,

00:01:47.854 --> 00:01:50.630
but this is the darkest night of the whole
year

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:55.621
and just before this Narakasura was killed.

00:01:55.988 --> 00:02:06.848
And all the lights are put in the house
and lots of these lamps are burnt.

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:17.679
Of course electricity lights are different
from these, as you know,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.291
that they burn badhas all the time.

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:27.428
So, after the death of Narakasura,

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:30.039
he had a big army of his own

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.067
when he was very powerful and he had
hypnotized many people,

00:02:36.268 --> 00:02:40.377
so to get rid of the residual ones
altogether,

00:02:40.578 --> 00:02:49.461
they lighted all these lamps, so that all
those devils

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:56.278
who were still roaming about should all be
burnt off;

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.612
and you can understand in Sahaja Yoga how
a lamp burns

00:03:01.813 --> 00:03:07.215
and how a badha is taken away by a lamp.

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:11.040
But still all the lights of the house must
be lighted.

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:14.956
[to somebody: Will you go and light
all the lights in the house? ].

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:20.668
Outside and inside, there should be,
everywhere there should be light.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:26.568
No room should be kept in darkness because
they hide in the darkness.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.627
So no corner should be dark.

00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:42.053
Then you know that Rama killed Ravana
on the 10th day

00:03:45.164 --> 00:03:52.423
of the rising moon – that was Dussehra –

00:03:52.624 --> 00:03:57.526
and he (Ravana) was burnt. And then He
(Rama) returned back

00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:06.681
by an aeroplane called as pushpak
to Ayodhya, to His own capital,

00:04:06.882 --> 00:04:14.021
where He was crowned as king on this day.

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:20.978
Now we have got astrologically,

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:29.064
there are 3 and a half auspicious days

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:40.882
where you don’t have to consult any books
of astrology, which are called as panchang,

00:04:41.083 --> 00:04:45.811
to find out whether it is an auspicious
time or not. For any puja,

00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:51.541
for any… good work you have to do, people
consult in India

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:56.643
the panchang, is the book to find out which
date is auspicious, which is not.

00:04:56.844 --> 00:05:01.490
One of them is today, is the day you can
do anything good,

00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:08.513
you decide anything good. Today is the day
to take an oath,

00:05:08.714 --> 00:05:12.262
to think of something great,

00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:17.617
to visualise something big, to ask a boon,

00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:28.119
to do a big puja, is one of the greatest
day.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.286
One of the - we call them muhurtas – which
where you do not consult these books.

00:05:36.487 --> 00:05:40.717
And that’s why Rajyabhishek of, I mean
the crowning ceremony

00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:44.953
of Shri Rama took place on this day.

00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:55.372
So there are so many aspects for this,

00:05:55.573 --> 00:06:04.525
that after Rama had killed Ravana, another
satanic force,

00:06:04.726 --> 00:06:07.702
this Diwali was celebrated.

00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:14.389
Also this was celebrated much earlier when
Narakasura was killed.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.288
And this is how we express our joy and
happiness,

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:26.500
our gratitude to God that He has protected
us always with His power,

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:31.332
with His Shakti, and has destroyed all
the rakshasas

00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:39.632
and all the evil forces of this world.
This is the time of Thanksgiving.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.746
On this day we have to go to our elders

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:50.688
and give thanks to them for whatever they
have done for us.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.282
To all those people whom we have to give
thanks today is the day

00:06:56.483 --> 00:07:04.589
when we have to ask God to bless all these
people.

00:07:16.882 --> 00:07:24.235
For us also to be very jubilant and very
happy, is the day, because now I feel

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:30.065
from tomorrow Sahaja Yoga is going to take
new strides.

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:34.359
From tomorrow starts the new year.

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:40.391
And the new year of the Shalivahana,
vahana calendar -

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:47.284
there are two calendars, one is Vikram,
another is Shalivahan - of the Shalivahan.

00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:51.925
And that is the dynasty, you know that,
that they were My forefathers,

00:07:52.126 --> 00:07:55.253
who started this shalivahan.

00:07:55.454 --> 00:07:59.435
Now there are two stories about Shalivahan.

00:07:59.636 --> 00:08:13.070
One says that this gentleman was breaking
a branch

00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:18.616
and was standing on it, and that’s why he
was called as Shalivahan.

00:08:18.817 --> 00:08:24.527
But actually it means the shawl.

00:08:24.728 --> 00:08:28.315
The shawl is called as Shali in marathi
language

00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:33.728
and the one who carried the shawl
of the Mother is called as the Shalivahan.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.154
And when some sahaja yogis went to India,

00:08:37.355 --> 00:08:41.259
if you remember in Rahuri, that is
the place Rahuri Nandgaon,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.134
you have also seen where My ancestors
lived and all that place.

00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:50.070
They gave you the shawls to wear.

00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.006
And I asked them, “Why did you give them
shawls? So they said,

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:56.482
"These are the shalivahanas. All of them
are shalivahanas now.

00:08:56.683 --> 00:09:02.989
That’s why we have to give them shawls”.
And they were very happy to do that.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.261
So tomorrow is the new year day.

00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:14.291
Now, why is it necessary to have a new year
day in our life?

00:09:15.682 --> 00:09:25.226
Why - last year those who got realisation
were very lucky people,

00:09:25.427 --> 00:09:32.054
but plodding through the path
of Self-realisation

00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:43.299
one loses all the enthusiasm and idealism
that one has when you get realisation.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.336
You think of doing so many things about it.
When you get realisation

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:55.402
you are so much engrossed into it, you
enjoy it so much that you think that,

00:09:55.603 --> 00:09:59.419
“Now the time has come for me to do this
and that and that.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.222
And I’m going to contact these people,
and I’m going to give

00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:04.820
these news to this one, and I’m going to do
this work,

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:11.310
I’ll show to Mother that what She has given
me, I have made it many folds.

00:10:11.627 --> 00:10:15.484
Because it was a new experience, great
experience,

00:10:15.685 --> 00:10:19.951
the only experience that you have been
waiting for.

00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:24.921
And that you also decide that I am going
to now

00:10:25.122 --> 00:10:32.366
become the torch bearer of this great light
that has come into me.

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:37.888
And I am going to form one of the lights
of this Deepavali.

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:43.471
Deepavali, deep means these lights, avali
means the row of lights.

00:10:43.717 --> 00:10:49.575
So I’m going to be one of them. And we are
going to enlighten the path of the people

00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:52.904
who want to have Self-realisation.

00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:56.286
All these great ideas come to us when we
touch our depths.

00:10:56.487 --> 00:11:04.140
And we feel responsible for all the rest
of the humanity.

00:11:04.912 --> 00:11:07.621
But then we gradually realize that there
are lots of problems

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:11.110
with our ascent, own being,

00:11:11.348 --> 00:11:16.110
and the Kundalini goes back into it, comes
up again and you realize

00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:22.905
that you have to correct yourself quite
a lot. Then this correction portion starts,

00:11:23.106 --> 00:11:27.957
you start thinking about yourself more than
about others.

00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:34.517
And also other things which were identified
with us

00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:40.604
like our own personal problems, our own
personal ideas, ambitions, professions

00:11:40.805 --> 00:11:45.565
and all the things that, with which we have
been enamored so far

00:11:45.766 --> 00:11:49.246
start peeping into our minds. And we start
forgetting

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:53.852
that moment when we got our realization

00:11:54.383 --> 00:11:59.470
and all that we promised within ourselves
to do.

00:11:59.671 --> 00:12:06.856
So, the new day comes to remind you,

00:12:07.057 --> 00:12:11.875
doesn’t matter whatever has happened has
happened, is finished.

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:17.636
Today a new day has come to you again
for you to promise again.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:24.020
Again start your journey, know the sun
has come,

00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:35.186
and now be refreshed, the newness brings
the freshness of life -

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:41.548
and then you again start with greater
enthusiasm on the new day,

00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:50.318
with new ideas, with new promises, with
new vows

00:12:51.042 --> 00:12:55.807
and with greater understanding about Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:57.127 --> 00:13:01.023
Those who have got now realization,

00:13:02.422 --> 00:13:08.568
they have to know actually what happens
as you mature.

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:13.346
You start changing your attitude.

00:13:15.134 --> 00:13:18.949
Today only, somebody asked me a question,

00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:23.714
and that’s what should happen to all
of you.

00:13:23.915 --> 00:13:28.863
After sometime the attitude is changed,
changed so much

00:13:29.064 --> 00:13:32.683
that you know that you are no more seeking,
now you have to give.

00:13:32.884 --> 00:13:35.933
You just talk of giving and not of seeking
anymore,

00:13:36.134 --> 00:13:41.756
because you have found it full. Till
the pitcher is filled,

00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:45.177
the water can be poured into it, when
it has come to the brim,

00:13:45.378 --> 00:13:51.138
it says no, add in (unclear) nothing.
Anymore you pour in will go to others.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:59.074
So this attitude when develops in you,
you should know that you are matured.

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:05.435
This attitude is the only test to see that
it is matured.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:12.068
No questions, no problems, only thought

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:20.512
that really covers the entire space before
us is how to bring others

00:14:20.713 --> 00:14:30.457
to this great heavenly atmosphere of divine
love.

00:14:32.219 --> 00:14:37.305
First one has fears, then he develops
protections.

00:14:37.506 --> 00:14:41.805
He is worried about giving all the time
bandhans to oneself,

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:48.469
looking after one’s own vibrations.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.194
Then he catches, he is worried, he doesn’t
want to meet some people,

00:14:52.395 --> 00:15:01.450
he condemns others and he says that “you
are not alright” and he shuns some people.

00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:08.694
All these things happen, gradually you
become absolutely

00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:13.097
one with your satisfaction.

00:15:13.298 --> 00:15:18.274
And then the question starts: how should
I love this person?

00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:21.527
How should I give my love to this person?

00:15:21.728 --> 00:15:33.654
How should I express that he also jumps
into the same heavenly bliss?

00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:43.420
Then the attention becomes stable.

00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:52.044
You don’t pay attention here and there.
All your attention is on this.

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:59.160
You become thus the Gurus of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:01.876 --> 00:16:08.051
This attainment has taken place in many
of you.

00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:12.680
You had ups and downs, no doubt, but forget
all that.

00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:19.458
And it’s so gratifying, so beautiful to see

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:26.443
that in My own lifetime I’ve seen this
thing happening within you,

00:16:26.673 --> 00:16:29.907
that you feel so responsible about it.

00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:34.190
You cannot force others about Sahaja Yoga.
That you must know.

00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:37.942
There cannot be any coaxing about it,

00:16:38.118 --> 00:16:42.341
but only your love should convince another
person.

00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:51.350
Your love should make another person feel
that he should also

00:16:51.551 --> 00:16:59.996
follow the same path which leads to such
beautiful life of love.

00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:05.890
Your example itself would show it.

00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:12.102
The whole priorities change.

00:17:13.985 --> 00:17:18.105
The whole atmosphere changes.

00:17:18.306 --> 00:17:23.486
And you become something very, very
different.

00:17:23.781 --> 00:17:29.125
If somebody asks what happens when you
enlighten the light?

00:17:29.326 --> 00:17:32.697
Then it gives the light. What happens
to it?

00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:37.129
Till it was not giving the light was
the problem. Now, it is enlightened

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:43.353
for giving the light to others. But
the light goes like this in the beginning.

00:17:43.554 --> 00:17:51.010
So those who have got realization should
know that it will happen.

00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:55.638
First thing that will happen are doubts
that you become into it.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:18:01.606
Because you belong to a society which
doubts everything,

00:18:01.807 --> 00:18:05.079
especially sanity.

00:18:09.025 --> 00:18:17.828
And you start doubting it, but doubting or
thinking about it, you never got it.

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:24.994
You got it just like that. Why did you get?

00:18:27.315 --> 00:18:35.743
You got it because somebody has loved you
very much

00:18:35.944 --> 00:18:43.546
and has been gracious. Because you have
had this seeking in your previous lives,

00:18:43.747 --> 00:18:47.941
and you have done lots of goods which
are been rewarded.

00:18:48.142 --> 00:18:53.926
Your checks have been cashed in the bank.

00:18:54.127 --> 00:18:56.764
How are you doubting it? And that means
you are doubting yourself,

00:18:56.965 --> 00:19:02.766
nobody else but yourself, because you
cannot believe that you have got it.

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:10.894
So don’t go into another trip of doubting.
By doubting you will go very slow.

00:19:11.095 --> 00:19:18.919
And sometimes it reaches such a point
that I start doubting also for a change

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:29.387
about your capacity, and your calibre as to
how far you are going to go in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:35.745
Because Sahaja Yoga is not the job
of useless people.

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:39.233
They have to be a very, very special type.

00:19:39.434 --> 00:19:44.667
If they are ordinary people they can never
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:50.594
They’ll come up little bit, again go down,
they’ll again come up and go down.

00:19:55.365 --> 00:20:00.606
But once you come into it you are not to be
goaded much really -

00:20:00.807 --> 00:20:07.784
if you start enjoying it, then you will go
on with it, you cannot give up.

00:20:07.985 --> 00:20:12.627
Because that is the source of all
enjoyment.

00:20:15.209 --> 00:20:18.370
So today is the day of enjoyment.

00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:23.995
Let us be happy that we have killed
the darkness within us

00:20:24.196 --> 00:20:29.586
and we have put our lights out for others
to be enlightened,

00:20:29.787 --> 00:20:34.587
to give light to others of God’s love.

00:20:34.788 --> 00:20:37.769
May God Bless you all.

00:20:48.294 --> 00:20:53.889
Now, what would you like to do? You want
to wash My feet or something?

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.278
Yogi: We… If You do the puja.
Shri Mataji: Alright.

00:20:56.479 --> 00:20:59.696
Yogi: Ganesha... Shri Mataji: Now, when
you say mantras and all that first of all,

00:20:59.897 --> 00:21:07.266
then they’ll also take it. Now let their …
now see…

00:21:08.774 --> 00:21:10.424
Malcolm has not come, isn’t it?

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:16.540
Malcolm, did you come for any puja before?
No, Malcolm has not come.

00:21:18.693 --> 00:21:23.291
Who else here? You haven’t done any puja,
isn’t it?

00:21:23.492 --> 00:21:26.452
You haven’t done. I’m asking you.
