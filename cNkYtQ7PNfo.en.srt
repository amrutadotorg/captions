1
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:11,120
Shri Mataji (in Hindi: Sorry I am late, my granddaughter is a little sick

2
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:20,150
and I stayed back to make her better.)

3
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:25,730
First I will speak in English and then in Hindi.

4
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:39,628
Today we are going to worship Rajalakshmi,

5
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:50,279
means the Goddess which rules the kings.

6
00:03:55,073 --> 00:04:01,709
It’s a very important thing today to understand

7
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:07,435
that something has basically gone wrong

8
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:16,024
in the working of our political systems

9
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:30,231
and why the people have lost their sense of

10
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:40,989
justice, fair play and the benevolence of the people.

11
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:48,864
Where have we gone wrong that this is being lost?

12
00:04:51,089 --> 00:05:02,027
It’s not only in India, it’s not only in Japan or in England

13
00:05:02,028 --> 00:05:11,091
or any other place where we think there is democracy.

14
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:28,521
First and foremost thing is that all these countries,

15
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:33,621
even those who have got their freedom,

16
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:36,970
started following those countries

17
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:41,990
which were supposed to be highty and mighty and very powerful

18
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:49,427
– like America, like Russia, like China, England –

19
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:59,165
without understanding how far they have reached

20
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:05,684
in delivering the goods that they are supposed to do.

21
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:13,027
In any case, in a country like England,

22
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:18,293
you see the monarchy, the way it has been working,

23
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:23,871
is shocking, absolutely shocking.

24
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:34,160
The way they have acted towards their ministers, like Cromwell,

25
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:43,790
you feel as if some primitive people are trying to manage something.

26
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:48,251
And the kings so cruel, queens so cruel,

27
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,660
so character-less, so irresponsible.

28
00:06:53,675 --> 00:07:02,199
They had no character to be kings and queens.

29
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:14,585
There was no surrendering to the Rajalakshmi principle of one’s being.

30
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:20,269
Then of course, it became independent,

31
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:26,418
and even now I find such stupid things they’re doing.

32
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:34,658
Even in France the president has a keep,

33
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:40,246
they run after money, little money here and there.

34
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:48,088
There are people in every country who are really of very, very low level

35
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:56,938
and who are trying to look after the welfare of the people.

36
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:03,090
Also if you read the history of Samurai

37
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,136
and all those people in Japan you are shocked.

38
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,680
They thought no end of themselves,

39
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:14,081
they had no connection with the public and the way they behaved.

40
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:20,158
Then you go to the communist countries also the same sort of thing.

41
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:25,681
There also those who came in power

42
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:32,598
became really like despotic rulers.

43
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:36,667
Then we have on the other side Mr. Hitler

44
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:40,595
who came, thinking no end of himself.

45
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:46,996
Spain, as you know was ruined by Franco.

46
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:53,808
One cannot understand how these people without any character,

47
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:59,908
without any higher qualities than the rest of the people

48
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,417
can look after their well-being.

49
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,051
It’s impossible!

50
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:19,157
I should say in our own country we had great kings, very great,

51
00:09:19,157 --> 00:09:23,902
because our heritage is great

52
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:29,597
and we had saints who really ruled the kings.

53
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:38,098
Like Shivaji had a guru who was a great saint, everybody.

54
00:09:38,098 --> 00:09:40,958
Janaka had a guru.

55
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,508
Everybody had a guru.

56
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,088
Even Shri Rama had a guru.

57
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:50,598
But they were real gurus!

58
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:55,687
They were the people who really lived the life of saints,

59
00:09:55,687 --> 00:10:02,228
they were real saints, inside, outside.

60
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:16,657
And the people also accepted the kings who had spiritual background.

61
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,078
Those who respected spiritual people.

62
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:28,138
So, the whole trend in this country was very, very different

63
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:31,068
till sometime.

64
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:39,428
I don’t know when the English came what happened to them.

65
00:10:39,428 --> 00:10:41,888
The majority of the people didn’t like

66
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:48,948
the way the English were living, their style, their methods,

67
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:51,557
they didn’t appreciate.

68
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:56,078
But these king and queens of different states

69
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,488
they started feeling that they are very sophisticated people

70
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:04,328
and we should have their culture.

71
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:08,338
And so many of these queens, modern ones,

72
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:16,228
who smoke, who drink, tell Me that it was taught by their governess

73
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:26,608
who came either from Sweden or from England or from Australia.

74
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:29,588
And they picked up these things.

75
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,338
Of course the men also thought that we are very backward, you see,

76
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,318
that’s the idea they gave them, “You are very backward people,

77
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:41,188
you don’t know how to smoke, you don’t know how to drink,

78
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:44,098
you have no ballroom dancing,” this that.

79
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:48,528
Even our military got corrupted with it.

80
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:51,158
In the military

81
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:54,158
is all English style things still going on.

82
00:11:54,158 --> 00:11:56,798
I don’t know when will they stop.

83
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:59,658
They don’t know anything about our own country.

84
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:02,628
They’ll know about England,

85
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:06,288
and you ask them anything about England they’ll know.

86
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:11,328
The whole education system came through English,

87
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:18,358
but all about England and western life than about Indian life.

88
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:24,248
Nobody ever cared for Indian things, you see.

89
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:27,468
Even in medicine same thing happened.

90
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:31,958
Nobody wanted to listen to any vaidya (ayurveda) or anyone.

91
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:41,778
They thought “Oh, these are useless primitive people, backward!”

92
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:45,918
So even one country, which was really, I should say,

93
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:58,798
had spirituality ruling in the politics also went down like this.

94
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:04,318
Before independence in this country, I remember,

95
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:08,938
we had to fight the British,

96
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:14,998
and what patriotism people had at that time.

97
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:20,588
I remember once we had gone to see a hockey match,

98
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:25,068
and My father always had a national flag on it,

99
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:28,428
that time it was not national it was congress flag, in the car.

100
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:31,988
So the soldiers came, they said, “Take down this flag!”

101
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:35,138
So My driver got down he said,

102
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:39,458
“You cut my throat first and then you take down the flag!”.

103
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:50,848
We all children joined him and they were shocked, went back.

104
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:56,288
Such enthusiasm, such patriotism came at that time

105
00:13:56,288 --> 00:14:05,968
when we were fighting these people.

106
00:14:05,968 --> 00:14:09,488
But they divided us and created a problem for us.

107
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:15,648
And you know before we could enjoy any fruits of our freedom,

108
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:23,218
we were fighting, we were divided.

109
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:27,758
I don’t know whom to blame for that.

110
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:31,108
If we had not accepted this division,

111
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:35,968
there would have been no problem.

112
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,178
But they accepted it.

113
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:40,738
Now, poor Bangladeshi’s are so, so, so poor.

114
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:48,368
If they were one with India, they would have been much better.

115
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:49,448
And what is Pakistan?

116
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:52,218
It’s just an empty place, you know,

117
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:54,068
no industries, nothing.

118
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:58,558
That’s why they are all the time talking about Kashmir, Kashmir.

119
00:14:58,558 --> 00:14:59,988
They have nothing else!

120
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:06,858
[In] their own country people are having fights, this that, but there’s no growth.

121
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:10,558
Now they cut out only this India.

122
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:21,808
Now here, after all this happening, you know, any war,

123
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:29,078
any kind of crisis like that, immediately changes the value system.

124
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:32,868
Not that in the West there were no value systems, there were,

125
00:15:32,868 --> 00:15:40,898
but the war completely changed them in the same way in India also.

126
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:46,478
Politicians, those who lost their lives in the fights,

127
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:55,088
or those who stood for something good were regarded as no ideal.

128
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:59,958
And people took a U-turn, absolutely a U-turn

129
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,758
and they became very self-centred,

130
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:07,998
only worried about their own personal things, their families,

131
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:14,788
or maybe accumulation of money and

132
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:17,408
transferring of money from here to Switzerland.

133
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:22,448
I mean something, I mean I tell you I’ve gone through My life

134
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,478
with the people who were fighting, fighting for freedom.

135
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:33,938
I mean they could not even think of these things.

136
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,578
I know My father, I know My mother, I know their friends,

137
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:42,778
I know so many people who were in our family used to come,

138
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:49,048
so many Sikhs and so many other people, Muslims even.

139
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:55,148
They could not think of taking any money,

140
00:16:55,148 --> 00:17:01,478
I mean it was really regarded as very low-level.

141
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:10,868
For what to take?

142
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:15,188
What is the need?

143
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:20,898
If you are satisfied in your heart of what you wanted, you got,

144
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:23,988
you’ve got your freedom, now finished.

145
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:29,648
But how these people who were absolutely at the bottom,

146
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,308
who did nothing for the country,

147
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:36,348
sacrificed nothing for the country,

148
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:45,358
just came up on top and all the good people went down.

149
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:52,928
If you read the history of Shivaji,

150
00:17:52,928 --> 00:17:58,058
or Rana Pratap, or any of them, Shalivahana, anyone,

151
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:04,988
you’ll be surprised how they used to worship Shakti.

152
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:10,908
All the Kshatriyas used to worship Shakti,

153
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:14,798
and they would go up to a point and not beyond.

154
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,938
Up to the point till the dharma was there.

155
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:22,448
That history I cannot repeat it to you.

156
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:29,558
But in the subtle way, one feels that

157
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:36,968
this partition suddenly changed the attitude of people,

158
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:44,568
or I should say those who were very low-level they came up.

159
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:51,268
I remember I was here at that time, partition time,

160
00:18:51,268 --> 00:19:01,078
and I was married and three people came to Me.

161
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:04,218
I was sitting outside in the garden,

162
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:06,998
knitting something for My child because I was pregnant.

163
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:12,828
So they came, and they looked at Me and they said,

164
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:18,828
“Can we have one room in your house?”

165
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:21,128
I said, “Why not, I’ve got it.

166
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:23,728
It’s a very big house of My father.

167
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:28,238
I’ll give it to you.”

168
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:32,548
They said, “We need for one or two months.

169
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:33,548
We are refugees.”

170
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,548
I said “Alright, and it has an outside door,

171
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,628
you need not bother us and there’s also kitchen attached

172
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:38,928
and a bathroom attached.

173
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,717
You can do whatever you like.”

174
00:19:41,717 --> 00:19:44,598
Just I offered.

175
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:49,808
In the evening My brother came, elder brother, and My husband

176
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:56,658
and both of them were friends and he just started shouting at Me.

177
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:58,098
These people were in the other room.

178
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:00,758
“What do you mean by keeping such people?

179
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:01,758
Who are they?

180
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:04,298
What will they do?” and this and that.

181
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:08,078
I said, “What will they do?”

182
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,338
“They may steal something from me!”

183
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:13,648
“So what is there in this house to steal?

184
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:19,708
They are refugees, look nice people to Me.

185
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:23,658
I have approved them because of vibrations they’re alright.”

186
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:27,248
“No, no, no, no, no better throw them away!”

187
00:20:27,248 --> 00:20:31,468
I said, Look at these people [my husband and brother],

188
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:35,698
“Without even talking to them, knowing them, suddenly

189
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:43,778
you are asking them to get out only because they are refugees.”

190
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:49,148
Then I did feel that in this country a new wave had started,

191
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:55,238
that a person is not respected if he has no money,

192
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:59,568
he’s not trusted if you have no money.

193
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:02,008
Actually it is the other way round,

194
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,598
those who have money, you better never trust them.

195
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,148
And those who don’t have money are much more honest people

196
00:21:09,148 --> 00:21:12,498
in this country than the people who have money,

197
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:18,338
who are all cheats practically.

198
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:21,608
So it happened like this and I said,

199
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,548
“No they are going to stay here!”

200
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,198
I put down My foot.

201
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,298
I said, “This house My father has given Me

202
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:33,658
and they are going to stay here.”

203
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:40,868
Poor things they stayed for a month in a very,

204
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:45,968
I think, must be very much embarrassed.

205
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:51,078
And while they were there so many Sikhs,

206
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:55,808
that time it was a big organisation – Sikhs and RSS were one,

207
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:58,498
and they came to My house and said,

208
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,928
“We’ve heard there’s a Muslim staying with you.”

209
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:02,328
There was a Muslim.

210
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:05,558
“And we’re going to kill that Muslim.”

211
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:10,338
I said, “What makes you think there’s a Muslim?”

212
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:11,938
“We’ve got reports.”

213
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:16,718
I said, “Wrong, there’s no Muslim in the house.”

214
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:22,568
I told him a lie.

215
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:26,478
So they said, “How are we to believe you?”

216
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,068
I said, “See I’m wearing a thing (bindi).

217
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,928
I am a Hindu lady.

218
00:22:31,928 --> 00:22:33,818
How will I keep a Muslim in my house?

219
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:40,788
We’re all frightened of them and there’s no one like that.”

220
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:43,128
Somehow or other they believed Me.

221
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:47,308
I told a complete lie but they believed Me.

222
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:55,848
They had brought lots of those swords, with blood.

223
00:22:55,848 --> 00:23:05,758
But I was not afraid and I told them in a very determined manner.

224
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,368
Anybody else in My place would have said,

225
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:17,288
“Alright, alright there is one you can take away.”

226
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:23,568
Then these three persons, who were there, left My house

227
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:29,118
and one of them is a very famous actress,

228
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:32,288
another one is a very famous poet

229
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:36,038
and another one is a very, very famous writer.

230
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,388
And it so happened that

231
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:45,298
they (a charitable organisation) wanted to make a film about young people

232
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:51,368
and I was the chairman of that, vice chairman of that,

233
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:53,538
and they wanted to call this actress.

234
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,978
I said, “Don’t tell her My name.”

235
00:23:56,978 --> 00:24:00,208
Because I had lost her completely.

236
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:03,768
I’d just said let it be wherever they are, let them be.

237
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:06,688
There’s no, sort of, I never made any enquiries or anything.

238
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:07,918
“Don’t tell them My name.”

239
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,918
They said “Why?”

240
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:17,378
I said, “For some reason you just don’t tell her My name,

241
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:20,658
otherwise she’ll be compelled to say yes, which I don’t want.”

242
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,868
So when they went to her and asked her,

243
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:28,148
she said, “I must get a sari, I must get a chappal,

244
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:31,578
I must get a purse to match, I must get this,

245
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:34,288
all this you have to pay, plus so much money you’ll have to pay.”

246
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:36,448
They said, “Ours is a charitable.”

247
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:38,978
She said, “Whatever it is.”

248
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:43,538
I said, “Alright, give her whatever she asks for.”

249
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:49,378
Then I went for the opening ceremony and she saw Me

250
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:54,588
and she couldn’t control herself, tears started rolling down her.

251
00:24:54,588 --> 00:24:56,658
Just came and fell at My feet.

252
00:24:56,658 --> 00:25:02,578
She said, “How are you here after such a long time?”

253
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:06,648
So they said, “She’s the one who’s making this film.”

254
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:07,648
“What?

255
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:14,128
She’s making this film, why didn’t you tell me?

256
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,128
My God, my God.”

257
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:18,158
She couldn’t help it, she was crying, crying, crying, crying.

258
00:25:18,158 --> 00:25:19,708
I said, “Now it’s alright.”

259
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,928
She said, “You take money from me.

260
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,528
I’ll pay for the whole making of the film.

261
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:26,268
You don’t know this lady.

262
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:27,658
You don’t know her.

263
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:32,078
What She’s done for me, nobody would do [what] she had done.”

264
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:38,498
She said, “She never told us anything how are we to know?”

265
00:25:38,498 --> 00:25:42,148
Such a change that she, immediately she telephoned to her husband

266
00:25:42,148 --> 00:25:46,148
and to this great poet, they all came running and they all…

267
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:53,888
But a small good gesture of administration:

268
00:25:53,888 --> 00:26:00,338
that was My house given to Me by My father.

269
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:04,108
That time of course My husband and My brother

270
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:11,988
didn’t know how to trust people.

271
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:14,378
But I trusted them, fully.

272
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:19,758
They were saying, “They will cut your throat.”

273
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:20,758
“Why?

274
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:23,068
Why will they cut My throat?

275
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:26,248
For what?”

276
00:26:26,248 --> 00:26:28,848
All kinds of funny things they were thinking.

277
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:32,048
And the worst thing I felt was

278
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:39,768
they were afraid because they had no money.

279
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:44,898
That is the beginning of the end, I think.

280
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:51,328
In our country this struggle for money started after that.

281
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:56,288
Without money people started suffering very much.

282
00:26:56,288 --> 00:27:00,158
Poor people don’t mind because they are used to it.

283
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:04,898
Whatever money they have, they eat it and sleep off.

284
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:09,718
There were not also very, very poor people as they are today

285
00:27:09,718 --> 00:27:12,848
but they were poor people no doubt.

286
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:16,888
But what I realised at that moment,

287
00:27:16,888 --> 00:27:23,048
that the people who have any position or any power or anything

288
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:31,808
are literally frightened of everybody else.

289
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:36,458
This is the beginning of our downfall.

290
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:42,258
We got frightened.

291
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:46,348
Those who were in charge got frightened

292
00:27:46,348 --> 00:27:55,558
that I may lose my seat or I may lose my money, I may lose my power.

293
00:27:55,558 --> 00:28:00,888
That fright kept them absolutely mad.

294
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:06,938
Supposing I am left with no money.

295
00:28:06,938 --> 00:28:08,668
So what?

296
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:10,398
What happens?

297
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:17,408
All these thoughts started coming after that partition, I felt it’s everywhere.

298
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:22,628
While I’ll tell you in My childhood,

299
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:25,358
My father never used to lock the house, it was a very big house

300
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:27,598
he never use to lock.

301
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,618
And we had a very beautiful gramophone

302
00:28:29,618 --> 00:28:33,798
will all that horn sort of a thing.

303
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:40,718
And one day one thief came and stole that.

304
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:45,648
So next day we discovered, My father said,

305
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:50,228
“Poor thing, he was fond of music so he’s taken away doesn’t matter,

306
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,068
but he didn’t take the records now what will he use,

307
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:56,628
he must have records.”

308
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,279
So My Mother started teasing him,

309
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,408
“Alright you advertise now.

310
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:03,528
The one who has stolen our gramophone

311
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:08,518
should come and take the records they are available for him.”

312
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:11,758
It’s so natural you know.

313
00:29:11,758 --> 00:29:14,938
He just felt [that] we have money after all,

314
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:17,398
this fellow doesn’t have money

315
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:24,038
and he wants to listen to music you see.

316
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:26,958
So My father said, ‘Alright’.

317
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,438
Otherwise he was a criminal lawyer

318
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:31,628
My father knew law very well.

319
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:34,408
Was not a stupid fool

320
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:40,358
but he couldn’t understand this fellow has only taken gramophone only

321
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:41,638
without the records.

322
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:42,638
He said,

323
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:46,848
“he must not have found it, you see it was there kept and all that.”

324
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:53,508
My Mother said, “You better advertise it.”

325
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:57,458
He was a politician also.

326
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:03,908
So that time, the feeling among the politician was to

327
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:07,908
how to raise the standard of these people

328
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:16,827
who are not having what we are having.

329
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:25,338
All the people who had money donated lavishly to so many things.

330
00:30:25,338 --> 00:30:30,248
I mean in My place there was one Rahbahadur Lakshminarayan,

331
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:37,798
he donated all his money, everything, to a big university.

332
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:41,098
Most of the things that happened in those days

333
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:45,328
were done by charity people.

334
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:48,668
I mean they never thought our children should have so much money,

335
00:30:48,668 --> 00:30:51,388
crores and crores and crores.

336
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,118
They never thought like that.

337
00:30:54,118 --> 00:31:00,128
Whatever limited money they had they wanted to donate

338
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:03,018
and do something good for others.

339
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:09,528
So when the Rajalakshmi, Lakshmi that is the one responsible

340
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:14,248
for looking after the benevolence of the people,

341
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:20,478
when She acts people think that they have,

342
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,968
not even think, they do it, automatically,

343
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:28,538
that they are there for benevolence.

344
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:31,548
They don’t have to tell themselves,

345
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:37,358
it’s just that they feel that it is their job,

346
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:41,158
this is what they have to do, is to look after the people

347
00:31:41,158 --> 00:31:46,208
they are to be brought to better levels of life.

348
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:52,778
This is what they think, they don’t think like a party politics,

349
00:31:52,778 --> 00:32:02,858
who is coming up, whom to kill, nothing of the kind!

350
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:06,708
Under the influence of the Goddess of Lakshmi,

351
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:16,688
which rules the political side we can say, the kingdoms and all that

352
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:24,148
– first thing is generosity, first thing is generosity.

353
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:32,048
For example, Mahavira was meditating and while coming out His cloth

354
00:32:32,048 --> 00:32:35,838
– He had one cloth around His body, dhoti and He had covered himself.

355
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:44,258
And the upper cloth just got caught up in the bushes.

356
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:46,648
So he cut it out and came out with half the cloth

357
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:49,438
– it was in His own palace.

358
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:54,608
So Shri Krishna wanted to take His test.

359
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:59,498
He said, “See I have no clothes, I’m just naked.”

360
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:03,128
He came before Him like a beggar.

361
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:06,728
“You have this, why don’t you give Me this cloth?

362
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:09,818
You can go to your palace and wear your dress.”

363
00:33:09,818 --> 00:33:11,038
He said, “Alright.”

364
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:17,748
He took it out and gave it to him.

365
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:21,558
And then He got some leaves and all that, covered Himself,

366
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:23,548
went to His palace and got dressed.

367
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:30,628
But now these Jains, you know, they make His statue so big,

368
00:33:30,628 --> 00:33:32,498
insult Him completely

369
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:46,368
by showing all kinds of nonsensical private parts to the details.

370
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:55,447
This is what is, where you have no worshipping of the Goddess.

371
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,858
Goddess is Shri Shobha!

372
00:33:57,858 --> 00:34:02,688
She’s the One who decorates you.

373
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:06,088
She’s a mother.

374
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,678
She decorates you with ornaments,

375
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,728
She decorates you with beautiful clothes, She’s your mother.

376
00:34:10,728 --> 00:34:13,908
She does it!

377
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:21,178
Like, Raja Janaka, He was the king so

378
00:34:21,178 --> 00:34:29,317
He had to wear ornaments, He had to wear beautiful clothes,

379
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,868
He had to do everything.

380
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:31,868
And when Nachiketa went to Him

381
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:36,148
he was quite surprised that why my guru has sent him to this king

382
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:39,518
who is wearing all kind of dresses and this and that and

383
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:43,268
he also had a big function of dancing and this.

384
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:49,098
He said, “He’s not a saint so why my guru touches His feet?

385
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:54,028
He’s a king.”

386
00:34:54,028 --> 00:35:01,908
Of course Raja Janaka knew what he was thinking about.

387
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,118
He said, “Why have you come here Nachiketa?”

388
00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:07,768
He said, “I’m here to get my Self-realisation.”

389
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:12,128
He said, “You can take all My kingdom

390
00:35:12,128 --> 00:35:15,718
but not easy to give you Self-realisation.”

391
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:22,728
He said, “Alright, whatever you say I’ll do.”

392
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:30,868
So He put a big sword on his head and asked him to sleep.

393
00:35:30,868 --> 00:35:36,798
He couldn’t sleep at all.

394
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,258
Then they were having a bath,

395
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:40,938
he said, “Come and have bath in the river.”

396
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:47,258
People came and told that there’s fire and everybody’s running away

397
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,348
and Raja Janaka was in His meditative mood,

398
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:52,048
He was just sitting quietly.

399
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:54,748
Nachiketa got a little upset.

400
00:35:54,748 --> 00:35:57,058
Then they said, “The fire is coming here

401
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:59,827
and all these cloths are going to be burnt.”

402
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:10,158
So Nachiketa ran out to save his things but still He was meditating.

403
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:14,978
Then they came out and Nachiketa found

404
00:36:14,978 --> 00:36:18,447
that nothing that was burnt was there.

405
00:36:18,447 --> 00:36:22,378
It was just an illusion for people.

406
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:27,408
He was amazed.

407
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:31,947
Then he realised what was wrong with him,

408
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:37,798
that he was doubting the Divine power Itself.

409
00:36:37,798 --> 00:36:43,058
The one who was Janaka, who was a king,

410
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:47,008
was not bothered about His own powers, these are what?

411
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:50,038
Because he is today, this you have to do it.

412
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:54,488
Because I’m married, I have to wear a mangalsutra.

413
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:59,308
So this is for the parampara, for the tradition style,

414
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:15,268
but inside He was a saint, a very high…high level of saintliness.

415
00:37:15,268 --> 00:37:26,068
When this thing happens that you get some position,

416
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:30,768
any power, even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised.

417
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:38,398
If somebody becomes leader, I don’t know what happens to him.

418
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:39,398
It is a myth.

419
00:37:39,398 --> 00:37:42,248
There’s nothing like leadership in Sahaja Yoga, nothing like that.

420
00:37:42,248 --> 00:37:45,828
It’s just a myth.

421
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:53,498
But suddenly people jump up.

422
00:37:53,498 --> 00:37:59,887
It is ego that gets pampered.

423
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:09,398
But this ego can be easily managed if you worship the Rajalakshmi.

424
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:13,008
She is the giver of balance.

425
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:27,768
Firstly, She rides on the elephant.

426
00:38:27,768 --> 00:38:31,428
Is not easy for a lady to climb on an elephant,

427
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:36,618
I have done it, it’s not easy.

428
00:38:36,618 --> 00:38:39,248
Without fear.

429
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:52,368
And She sits straight with a complete balanced attitude.

430
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:57,688
And Her blessings are tremendous.

431
00:38:57,688 --> 00:39:13,008
The first blessing one gets: the imbibement of dignity.

432
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:18,468
Dignity of a king, dignity of a queen.

433
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:26,988
You are a queen, so you can’t behave like street women.

434
00:39:26,988 --> 00:39:37,168
With Her blessing, first of all, you get that dignity.

435
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:46,648
That dignity is full of love, love for others.

436
00:39:46,648 --> 00:39:49,038
That personality emits nothing

437
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:56,098
but love and benevolence for others, nothing else.

438
00:39:56,098 --> 00:40:04,448
Wherever She looks, in every glance She blesses people.

439
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:07,458
She doesn’t expect anything.

440
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:12,828
She is a queen, what can you give to the queen?

441
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:17,388
She’s the highest of all in every way,

442
00:40:17,388 --> 00:40:19,058
what can you give it to Her?

443
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:23,318
These, all these politicians and all these so-called presidents

444
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:24,538
of all these countries are beggars.

445
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:31,678
All the time give me this, give me this,

446
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:35,078
like greedy people going around are beggars!

447
00:40:35,078 --> 00:40:42,518
They are not the people who can rule.

448
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:48,948
Hankering after things.

449
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:55,568
So first thing is the sign, is that such a person has a personality

450
00:40:55,568 --> 00:41:02,637
that just blesses people, thinks of their benevolence,

451
00:41:02,637 --> 00:41:08,558
cares for each and every person who comes along.

452
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:18,258
This is a blessing of the Goddess.

453
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:22,598
Then the second blessing of the Goddess

454
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:29,258
is that you develop a kind of a temperament,

455
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:38,188
which is very dignified, but also very humorous

456
00:41:38,188 --> 00:41:44,328
and understanding what other people are like.

457
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:54,568
There’s a story of a king who was going on a horse

458
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:55,698
and he met a drunkard.

459
00:41:55,698 --> 00:41:58,048
So you can say

460
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,788
these our drunkard can be compared to our politicians.

461
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:06,288
So the drunkard stopped.

462
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:10,178
He said, “I want to buy your horse.”

463
00:42:10,178 --> 00:42:12,778
People said, “Do you know what he is?”

464
00:42:12,778 --> 00:42:14,588
“Yeah I know he’s a king.

465
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:15,588
Alright.

466
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:16,588
So what?

467
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:17,588
I want to buy his horse.”

468
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:22,768
He said, “Alright not today, tomorrow we’ll sell the horse to you.”

469
00:42:22,768 --> 00:42:23,828
So went away.

470
00:42:23,828 --> 00:42:25,598
Next day he was called.

471
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:29,578
So he came with folded hands bent down.

472
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:34,758
He said, “What, you were the one who was going to buy my horse,

473
00:42:34,758 --> 00:42:36,458
what has happened to you?

474
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:39,908
I want to sell it to you.”

475
00:42:39,908 --> 00:42:48,298
He said, “Sir, the one who wanted to buy is dead.

476
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,028
I am an ordinary person.”

477
00:42:51,028 --> 00:43:12,168
Such a personality, such solid personality I should say,

478
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:15,648
that anybody would have been angry, would have said

479
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:16,688
“Beat this man!

480
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:17,718
Throw him away!

481
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,468
He talks to me like this,

482
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:24,644
behaves like this.”

483
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:30,300
What the king said was remarkable.

484
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:39,189
Because he knew he’s drunk, he knew he’s not in his senses,

485
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:44,110
that’s why he’s talking.

486
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,070
Didn’t get angry with him,

487
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,110
he said, “Alright, come along tomorrow, I’ll sell you the horse.”

488
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,140
That’s only possible if you have this Rajalakshmi in you

489
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:56,710
otherwise you would never behave like this.

490
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:03,000
Now what about today’s politicians anywhere?

491
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,990
They even shoot people, they kill people,

492
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,280
they arrest them,they put them into trouble I mean,

493
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:22,910
all kinds of things they are doing.

494
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:30,230
Such people have no right to call anybody as criminals!

495
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,950
But we accept!

496
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,699
As in Hindi we say, “Aaj kal ka zamana hai aisa.”

497
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,520
(Such is todays world)

498
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:48,410
We accept it – all such people as our rulers.

499
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:55,760
Then Rajalakshmi is the one who stands on dharma.

500
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,790
She stands on dharma.

501
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:10,210
If there is some adharmi then she will not bless that person.

502
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:18,110
Adharmi is to be taken out.

503
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:30,650
But if he’s not, then he will go all out to save that person.

504
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:38,220
But if he finds he’s adharmi, he will not.

505
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:45,610
Is a kind of a divine discretion he should have

506
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:53,670
as to whom to be kind and whom to be punishing.

507
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:59,820
That divine discretion should be there in a person,

508
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,110
otherwise you can play into the hands of ten people

509
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:14,000
who are around you, teaching you something, doing something.

510
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,740
One day I was in My mother’s place Nandgaon,

511
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,700
and there was one gentleman who impressed our Yogi very much.

512
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,320
I just kept quiet.

513
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:36,070
He was a big politician and he told Me,

514
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,500
“We have to do like this and we have to do.”

515
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,360
I said, “Alright, alright, alright.”

516
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:48,470
Then three, four professors from the university came to tell Me,

517
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:52,260
“Mother, he’s a politician, be very careful.

518
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,880
He’s a very bad man, you be careful about him.”

519
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,300
I said, “What do you know about him?”

520
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,170
They said, “He’s a politician.”

521
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,070
I said, “There are so many politicians.”

522
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,690
“But he’s not a good man.”

523
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,870
“But what do you mean?”

524
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,590
I said, “Now you sit down and I’ll tell you.

525
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:12,460
This man has eloped with the wife of a Brahmin.

526
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:20,679
He himself is not a Brahmin and this child is from him to her

527
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:26,090
and how much he has deceived people everything I know.”

528
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,090
They were shocked.

529
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,090
“You know Mother?”

530
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:30,430
“Of course.

531
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,450
I know everything!”

532
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:44,760
“Then why do You allow him to come close to You?”

533
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,290
“Do you think he is close to Me?”

534
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:53,830
I said, “You are sadly mistaken.

535
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,310
But it’s nice he’s come to Me

536
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,970
because he’s been troubling people too much and I’ll correct him.”

537
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,050
While some people thought he was a great achievement we have got,

538
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,090
and some of them came to tell Me be careful of this man

539
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:17,230
without knowing what he was.

540
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:22,210
This kind of a divine discretion has to be there.

541
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,270
If a king does not have that divine discretion

542
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:39,170
then he can punish the good and he may help the bad people.

543
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,240
But this divine discretion disappears when you are self-centred.

544
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,110
That’s the main point, is a complete detachment

545
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,699
about the power should be there.

546
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:52,610
Complete detachment.

547
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:55,860
Why should Rajalakshmi care for anything?

548
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:01,140
What does She get?

549
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,070
But now there are some who’ll pamper a person

550
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,550
this, this and that, and then they feel

551
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:11,790
“ah, we’re on top of the world!”

552
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,610
They just pamper, pamper and pamper

553
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:23,060
the ego of a politician and he thinks he is a very big man,

554
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:31,090
then in the election he doesn’t understand why he’s on the ground.

555
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:41,830
So with this self-dignity, self-knowledge, you know what you are.

556
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:44,090
Whatever you may tell Me, whatever you may say to Me,

557
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:48,040
I’ll listen, “Alright, alright, alright”,

558
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:54,990
but I don’t accept anything as something great.

559
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:01,400
Because if I am that, what is there to be great?

560
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,110
Now supposing this is a lamp here.

561
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,300
So is it great or not great?

562
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,410
It is a lamp.

563
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:23,710
So if I’m Adi Shakti, I’m Adi Shakti, So what?

564
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:28,120
If you are a king you are a king so what?

565
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,860
I mean if you are an impostor then you might feel your ego.

566
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:39,320
But if you are really the king then you won’t feel.

567
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:46,240
If you are under the influence of the Goddess

568
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,550
then that is the only thing you enjoy.

569
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,460
The rest of it is nothing.

570
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,240
Whether you have diamonds or you have silver

571
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:12,830
or you have anything makes no difference at all.

572
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:18,540
Now how people misuse the scriptures also one should see.

573
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,970
That, Rajalakshmi is sitting on the elephant alright,

574
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:29,090
so they should have all very big cars, you see.

575
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:34,990
She’s sitting on the elephant because elephant is the highest animal!

576
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:42,410
Is very kind, very forgiving and has such a tremendous memory.

577
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:49,480
That’s why She’s sitting on an elephant.

578
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:56,390
She’s not sitting there to show off.

579
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:02,870
But She’s sitting there to see around, what is happening

580
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:11,520
avalokan, She can see around what is happening, to be at a higher place.

581
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:21,189
That’s why a king is made to sit on a higher pedestal.

582
00:52:21,189 --> 00:52:25,130
But the purpose is not to show off.

583
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,189
But the purpose is

584
00:52:28,189 --> 00:52:34,669
that from that state he can see others better,

585
00:52:34,669 --> 00:52:44,689
he can be watchful of others.

586
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:47,000
If somebody gets a high position

587
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:57,330
then they think they are the owners of that position.

588
00:52:57,330 --> 00:53:08,550
This has all come because the brain has gone upside down I think.

589
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,660
How can it be?

590
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,580
Logically?

591
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:22,449
Now if you are this throne is given, alright, so with the throne

592
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:30,800
I sit on this, but this throne cannot give Me anything,

593
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,630
I can give something to this throne.

594
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,910
The king has to think he is obliging all these things th

595
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:45,630
at he is sitting on them because he is a king.

596
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:50,570
On the contrary he thinks all these things are important because something is lacking

597
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,900
in him or what?

598
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,870
And that’s why when they come to do Raj

599
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:03,970
they start gathering things which are useless absolutely,

600
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:11,460
clutter up their houses, homes, everything with something that is useless.

601
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:19,710
All their dignity, everything, is itself a decoration on them

602
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,689
and to show that they are kings.

603
00:54:21,689 --> 00:54:24,020
Of course they are given a crown,

604
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:30,360
they are given a big necklace, they are to wear something here

605
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
because they are kings.

606
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:41,110
But these are not actually his decorations

607
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:47,770
but these things get decorated by a king.

608
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:53,490
For example, you get some lanky panky fellow from the street,

609
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:59,840
half starved, who is a beggar, say, for example,

610
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:07,400
and put those ornaments on him and all the dresses of a king.

611
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:13,040
Put him on the stage, everybody may start laughing.

612
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,350
Nobody will think that he is a king by any chance,

613
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,550
because he doesn’t have that dignity, doesn’t have that face,

614
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,970
he doesn’t have that body, he doesn’t have that mind,

615
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,960
he doesn’t have that wisdom.

616
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,850
So how is he a king?

617
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:39,199
Like, there was one king who tried to make his shoes of pearls.

618
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:41,770
But he’s so stupid looking, you know,

619
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:45,810
that when I saw the pearls I said,

620
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:51,090
“This is the man only who can think like this!”

621
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,210
So stupid he was to look at.

622
00:55:54,210 --> 00:56:01,720
And was sure of these pearls being put on his shoes.

623
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,890
So there are many such things these days all of these stupid people are doing.

624
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:11,480
There are big, big cartoons coming out

625
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:17,460
and you can see for yourself how stupidly they live.

626
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:23,720
To Me it’s such a difference I tell you.

627
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,850
Such a difference.

628
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:28,680
To them all these things are so important,

629
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:36,060
which if they don’t have they’ll buy and put it.

630
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:45,270
I know of a gentleman who came with a garland to our program,

631
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:53,750
I mean to our dinner, I asked him, “Why are you carrying the garland?”

632
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:59,100
“See after all you see I was garlanded so I’m keeping the garland.”

633
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,180
We didn’t know what to do!

634
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,800
We Indians will never take a garland,

635
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,740
first of all, anybody gives you they’ll put it, except for the Gods.

636
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,320
They will take it out immediately.

637
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,930
Another lady who came to see Me and she said,

638
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,730
“I don’t understand these Indians,

639
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,570
I bought a garland, I put it in my neck

640
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:24,920
so they were all laughing on the street at me.”

641
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:31,650
Now you Indians understand this, how subtle it is, just see,

642
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,200
that you can’t put garland, you are not God.

643
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,980
You cannot buy a garland (laughing) and put it in your neck and walk out.

644
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:46,310
Innately you have to be that.

645
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:56,919
So the person who is innately a king has the blessings of the Rajalakshmi.

646
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:59,820
Then what does She do?

647
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,760
What does She do to such a man?

648
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,360
What She does is first

649
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:15,210
his name is written on the hearts of the people whom he rules.

650
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:23,730
She writes it with her own hand.

651
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,310
They adore him,

652
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:37,680
they admire him and they try to imbibe his qualities within himself.

653
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:45,050
Another blessing of Rajalakshmi is

654
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:54,980
that She grants a particular type of a body,

655
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:03,169
which has a coefficience, which gives vibrations.

656
00:59:03,169 --> 00:59:11,160
They may not be very selfish people

657
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:14,740
to make a big advertisement about themselves,

658
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,010
talking about themselves, this that.

659
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:26,740
But the way they are wherever they are, they show.

660
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:34,949
We had many like these in our times also.

661
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:40,429
Maybe that people didn’t accept them, maybe they are nowhere now,

662
00:59:40,429 --> 00:59:46,040
some new johnnies are looking to be more jumping.

663
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:51,310
But whatever name is written in the heart of the people,

664
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:56,419
are the people who are blessed by this Rajalakshmi.

665
00:59:56,419 --> 00:59:59,810
So what a politician has to understand [is]

666
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:05,400
that he has not to make money,

667
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:14,990
he does not have to have a big show about himself.

668
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:21,760
He does not have to do anything that is like

669
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,090
laundering the money from the country.

670
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:29,121
He does not have to kill others who oppose him,

671
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:33,340
he doesn’t have to shout at those who trouble them.

672
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,270
But what has he to do?

673
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,690
He has to remember that.

674
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:46,330
“I am here for the fame of a good man.”

675
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:53,880
He should worry about the fame he will be leaving after his death.

676
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,760
He should see to it that his fame is safe.

677
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:10,189
For example, see Shri Rama who was a king of benevolence, no doubt about it.

678
01:01:10,189 --> 01:01:16,300
But His own wife when somebody challenged that

679
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:21,040
– “She has lived with Ravana and how can She be pure?”

680
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:27,250
He knew that She was pure, still He decided that He will ask Her to go

681
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:37,260
because to keep the show, to keep the whole image of a king

682
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,650
and He sent Her away.

683
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:48,590
But nowadays you find somebody’s brother employed in America,

684
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:54,470
sister employed there and he has made, his uncle has made a big house

685
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:57,320
and his wife has accumulated so much money.

686
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:03,320
It is all going on.

687
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,390
Everybody will talk like that about that person,

688
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:08,990
that he’s just money oriented,

689
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:14,020
he just spends money on nonsensical things and he is just exploiting us.

690
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:21,440
Everybody will talk but nobody will tell him on the face.

691
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,669
So what you have to worry is about absolute correct character.

692
01:02:26,669 --> 01:02:32,640
These days this is another point.

693
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,640
Every politician

694
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,431
must have three, four keeps otherwise he is not a politician.

695
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:40,890
Like we had Nawabs, we had one Nawab in Lucknow

696
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,120
who had hundred and sixty five wives.

697
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,740
He thought if he doesn’t have hundred and sixty five,

698
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:52,400
people won’t accept him as a Nawab.

699
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,470
So this is another inferiority complex

700
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:59,360
that you should have some women around you

701
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:07,990
so that people will say what a powerful man he is.

702
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:16,360
Now those days are gone now, now Satya Yuga has started.

703
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:25,640
In Satya Yuga I assure you anybody who is not blessed by Rajalakshmi

704
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:35,110
will have to go to jail or will have to leave the seat,

705
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:40,550
will be thrown away or will be as they say,

706
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,090
“Doubly dying go to the waste, dust”.

707
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,080
It has to be.

708
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:52,840
They’ll be all exposed, whatever tricks they may try.

709
01:03:52,840 --> 01:04:05,630
And they will have the consequence of being artificially the rulers.

710
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:18,000
But a genuineness is the sign that the queen of blessings,

711
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,330
the goddess of Rajalakshmi, is residing in that person.

712
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:36,400
In Satya Yuga it will happen I’m sure.

713
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,930
But even in Sahaja Yoga I find people doing politics sometimes,

714
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:43,830
I was amazed!

715
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:49,360
People think politics means keeping groups,

716
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:55,260
making groups, telling things from here to there, there to there.

717
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,790
That shows you lack collectivity.

718
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:08,790
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi will try to cement everyone together

719
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:15,360
because the power lies in collectivity.

720
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,649
To break the collectivity for anything

721
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:29,620
is very dangerous for that person as well as for others.

722
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:35,030
So now you have entered into the kingdom of God,

723
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:41,220
you are now sitting in the court of God Almighty.

724
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:49,179
Here, of course, as courtiers you have to dress up well,

725
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:54,250
sit properly, should take up your seats.

726
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,100
You have to be systematic

727
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,860
and above board because you are Sahaja Yogis.

728
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:05,660
You are not ordinary people.

729
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,680
You are special people.

730
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:14,540
How many people in this world are going to be Sahaja Yogi?

731
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:17,929
You are special people,

732
01:06:17,929 --> 01:06:28,760
so try to make yourself such beautiful instruments of Rajalakshmi

733
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,630
that people when they will see you they will vote for you

734
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:46,870
and tomorrow you will rule the world.

735
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:51,990
I do not want you to get out of politics or get in politics

736
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:57,850
but you have to first get the blessings of the Rajalakshmi

737
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,370
and then only you should understand

738
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:04,600
what’s wrong with our country, what we have to do,

739
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:12,080
what is the purpose, why do we want to become politicians,

740
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,780
what we have to do, we have to have plans, what is your project.

741
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:23,920
All these things now put your attention from yourself to outside.

742
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,700
Like, that day I received a letter saying,

743
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,990
“my father is sick and my mother is sick then my son is sick,

744
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,900
and this and that and that and that.”

745
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:40,090
Such people can’t do much.

746
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,030
When the war of independence started in India

747
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:45,179
we gave up our studies, gave up our parents, gave up everything,

748
01:07:45,179 --> 01:07:48,040
we were very young people.

749
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,190
So now you have to know

750
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:55,490
that if you have to really take to politics

751
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:57,850
you have to have the blessings of Rajalakshmi

752
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:02,320
and for that you have to build up yourself

753
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:06,720
with that dignity, with that sense.

754
01:08:09,209 --> 01:08:14,439
I bless you from My heart that in every country such

755
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,940
people will come up.

756
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,339
May God bless you
