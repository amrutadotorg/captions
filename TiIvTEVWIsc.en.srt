1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,089
Nice, relaxed eh?

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:02,089
Relaxed, with blessings.

3
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:03,100
Everyone cleared out, I think.

4
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,930
And no more one more thing, I must say it
last, I've said it before but I have not said

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,930
it here, no one is going to say that “bhoot
did it” because such a person will be sent

6
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,080
away to the bhoot [unclear: clan?

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Or clap] not to Sahaja Yoga, don't put your
responsibility on the bhoots, either you are

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
a bhoot or you are a Sahaja Yogi.

9
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
One of the two.

10
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
You can't be both.

11
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,080
About Sahaja culture, alright.

12
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Sahaja culture I explained to you what is
a Sahaja culture is, in which you have grow

13
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
[this portion I would leave it out since it
is an “aside” direction”: last night,

14
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,190
where's Judy, she's there, come in, come in,
let them sit, now] then last night I talked

15
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:27,410
to you about ego.

16
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:34,790
That how ego manifests itself and how it is
difficult to get out of the ego.

17
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,940
It's easy to get out of the conditionings
super egos, but very difficult to get out

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:47,399
of ego because ego aggresses others, doesn't
trouble you at all, and you enjoy that aggression,

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,809
see.

20
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,960
Now, today I want to tell you about how ego
has been historically, traditionally torturing

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,329
people around.

22
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:05,059
So you'll see the manifestation of this ego,
and then you will know that if you are playing

23
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:12,329
anything any role with your ego, you could
be part and parcel of that destructive force.

24
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:19,079
So to begin with we'll see now, when this
ego started growing in man.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:44,729
First of all see, it started growing with
the protection, so 

26
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:55,429
the pituitary, which is within us started
growing when we raised our head, like this.

27
00:01:55,429 --> 00:02:02,659
When we were animals, our head were like this,
at that time the pineal body as it is called,

28
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:04,189
was very powerful.

29
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:09,080
They say in human beings the pineal doesn’t
work out, it is not true, it does, but they

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,739
don't know how it works.

31
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:23,349
So this pineal body within us was very active
when we were animal state.

32
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:29,010
But when we raised our head, you see a chemical
change took place within ourselves in the

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,909
sense that our brain started growing in a
pyramid, which I've told you how with the

34
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,819
parallelogram of forces and all that it has
started growing into a pyramid, and when it

35
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:48,079
became like that, you see because first it
was only the pineal body looking after the

36
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:53,900
super ego, up to the animal kingdom, up to
the kingdom were the animals sort of became

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,810
more sort of humanized, then the ego started
growing.

38
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,159
[Unclear: In this part, we think Mother meant,
“it is only human beings that can use the

39
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,159
matter.”)

40
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,329
It's the only animals who can use the matter.

41
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:04,469
Human beings can use the matter, not the animals.

42
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,030
Animals cannot use the matter for their own
purpose.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,250
When they started aggressing the matter, the
ego started developing, and we developed this

44
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,170
what you call “the pyramid of our brain”,
we starting growing, more and more and more

45
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,140
and more like this.

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,780
But when it reached it's height, then we started
using our ego more we didn't stop at that

47
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
point.

48
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,040
We started moving on the other side so this
went down and covered it covered it, completely

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,319
like that.

50
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,680
That's why we say the pineal body in the human
beings doesn't work, it functions, no doubt,

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
it functions.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:51,090
As a result of that, you see when we saw this
ego was growing, as a result of that people

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,670
felt extremely over-confident.

54
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,670
What's wrong?

55
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,500
business started long time back, since the
time of Columbus, as I've said if Columbus

56
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,389
had come to India, he would not have seen
Me here, he would have finished all the Indians

57
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,530
there, not him, he was a very nice man, but
those who followed him.

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,189
In the same way, this ego started destroying
people, and they had an idea of a triumph,

59
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,680
and killing people, occupying lands, occupying
territories, accumulating wealth.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,140
Went on, and on, and on, and on, on this level.

61
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,650
Then from there they started.

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,080
When the marriage system started in a proper
way, again the aggression started on the women

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,840
and now the women are aggressing men, like
that, it's all became so aggressive.

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,230
But when you are aggress you don't see that
you are aggressing, this is the problem of

65
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,479
the egoistical person.

66
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,970
Though he may be a seeker, though he may be
a very genuine seeker, but if he is in the

67
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,789
area of ego, he never feels his own catches,
because the ego is in between, the reality

68
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:54,789
means that.

69
00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:01,449
So he cannot see his own catches, he cannot
see how he is aggressing others, and he doesn't

70
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,740
see how he's hurting others, troubling others,
torturing others, and such a person can be

71
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:17,199
extremely arrogant, extremely what you call
the “strangulating”.

72
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,449
This is what happens when you get cancer also,
when you get the cancer, what happens, it

73
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,970
starts with the left side no doubt.

74
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:38,440
But when it comes into the person, then he
becomes a person who is vulnerable to a disease

75
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,410
or a disease where the person is aggressive.

76
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:51,920
The cells of the body first develop the aggression;
we call it “malignant”.

77
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,870
When this cell comes in contact with others
that also becomes malignant.

78
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,600
So that's how the malignancy spreads, and
when it spreads what happens?

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,270
That supposing in the nose there are some
cells which become malignant; so they start

80
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:17,889
obstructing other organs to grow, the only
nose will grow like that not outside but inside.

81
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:24,750
So they aggress, you see, the aggression starts
and they lose complete control with the whole,

82
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,979
because there is no co-ordination with the
whole, they don't see that the whole has to

83
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,770
grow together, and not only the nose, and
not only the eyes, isn't it?

84
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,400
and this breaking from the collectivity is
the first sign when you find a Sahaja yogi

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,449
behaves in a funny way, that if he is breaking
from the collectivity, then he is nothing

86
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:53,599
but a egoist, no doubt about it; by any argument,
by anything.

87
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,449
But a person who is a super ego fellow will
stick onto the collectivity; will try to be

88
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,750
very close to the ashram, he'll be very much
close to us very much here, around it, even

89
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,970
if we say “we don't want to”, it will
be there, why?

90
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:23,120
Because it realizes that it is aggressed and
also it realizes that it can be sly.

91
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:30,520
So when a left-sided person enters into an
ashram, that person will be very nice, quiet,

92
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,030
sweet, everything.

93
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,250
But the entities, the bhoots in him, will
aggress the people slyly, they'll torture

94
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:48,750
but those people can be cured very easily,
because they are troubled and tortured themselves,

95
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:54,560
but those who are egotistical will be very
difficult for them to get out it.

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,189
That's why I've been talking about ego yesterday
and today.

97
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:02,710
They can see all aggression, they manifest,
what's wrong?

98
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,389
Say now, I was talking about the chemicals.

99
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,419
Now, how did you discover these chemicals?

100
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,479
It is through your ego, through your science.

101
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,759
Now, if the science is not related to God
or to the whole, then you go like that, and

102
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,169
then you can produce hydrogen bombs, you can
produce these horrible chemicals, like it's

103
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,610
what you call “the fool-hardiness”.

104
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:34,880
You enter into every area, every place and
achieve the power over that, but then you

105
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,110
don't know what that is capable of.

106
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:45,330
Supposing now you make computers, supposes,
tomorrow these computers will eat you off.

107
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,290
I must tell you now there's a new disease
I have discovered in people that their conscious

108
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,930
mind overpowers them.

109
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,550
There was a fellow who was like this, very
egoistical, he didn't believe in God also.

110
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,230
He's an Indian and he met with an accident.

111
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,750
His wife is a doctor, she's a friend of Mine,
she brought him to Me.

112
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,400
In My presence, he got up and walked off nicely,
everything.

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,360
But on his own, whenever he wanted consciously
to do it, he couldn’t even raise his leg.

114
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Can you imagine?

115
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,090
So with these egoistical people now a new
disease is coming that consciously they cannot

116
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,290
do anything.

117
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:32,050
They cannot do anything, in this will come,
I'm promising you now, or I'm warning you

118
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,050
now.

119
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,890
As I warned the people who were going left-sided
that you will have a horrible disease and

120
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,050
this is the new disease for all the egoists
that consciously they won't be able to move,

121
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:49,110
they'll be mute, sitting there only, their
ego will take over.

122
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,280
It's a very dangerous era when you are born,
you must know.

123
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,350
This is the time we are precariously placed
either you get to God or you go to Hell, there

124
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,350
is nothing is between.

125
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,280
So a new disease will come very soon, there
is no insanity in it, nothing, you will be

126
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:16,330
quite alert, but you can't move your hands,
your whole nervous system refuses to work.

127
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,210
That's going to come, very soon it will manifest.

128
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,120
You have seen that egotistical people have
been going on like Hitler and all that, and

129
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,560
they have destroyed the world and they have
done so much harm to our value system.

130
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,860
In subtle way we say that all this manifestation
of 25 years of all this horrible hell they

131
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,750
have created for us is because of the wars,
because of the wars.

132
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:55,080
But these wars and things even if you avoid
by some chance you avoid it, still if ego

133
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,680
is there it will manifest itself.

134
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,490
If you avoid it outside it will manifest inside
and then you will find that you can't just

135
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,490
move.

136
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:13,070
You can't blink, you can't sleep, you can't
move your hands, even now people can't sleep,

137
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,980
many.

138
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:23,700
And I don't want Sahaja yogis to suffer from
that horrible disease, and Western people

139
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,730
are more liable to that kind of a thing.

140
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,210
The Sahaja yogis who are trying to get out
of the collectivity, who are asserting their

141
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:40,430
ego under the name of bhoots or whatever it
is, should understand that it is 99% it is

142
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,150
ego within us, and that ego has to be faced.

143
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,810
“Oh, I have a ego, I feel guilty”, then
alright you put it back here, [unclear: on

144
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,930
your ear], that's not the way.

145
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,930
That's not the way you'll do it.

146
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,050
Today you are very active, working very hard,
doing this, tomorrow fine you'll be just immobilized.

147
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:15,750
You can't move and persons don't care in this
country as it is even for people who are alright,

148
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,170
but you'll become like old people who cannot
move.

149
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,570
Who see everything, know everything, who are
conscious, at a very young age this will happen,

150
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,980
the slightest accident, the slightest disturbance,
will just trigger off to that area where you

151
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,250
will be absolutely like a mute person sitting.

152
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,010
You can't move your finger, you can't hold
anything.

153
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,860
You will not be in a coma, coma happens to
people who take pills and things to go to

154
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,470
the left, like drugs and things which take
you to the left.

155
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,490
But those who are right-sided you will not
be in coma, that’s one thing, is a curse,

156
00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:01,980
you’ll see everything, you'll be alert you
know everything but can't even turn your head.

157
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,510
Take it from Me.

158
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,630
That's coming, very soon.

159
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:13,880
You may be talking, you may not be talking,
it can go to that level, slowly, slowly, you'll

160
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,380
find your body will be immobilized.

161
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,580
People don't understand what dangers ego can
have.

162
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,870
It is not now the aggression outside so much,
because it goes into left Vishuddhi, and this

163
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:37,440
left Vishuddhi will creates this horrible
disease.

164
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,110
Now, how do we control our ego is very important
to understand.

165
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,100
First of all you must write your names and
beat yourselves with shoes for 108 times to

166
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,380
begin with.

167
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,300
Secondly discipline yourself, by disciplining,
get up in the morning, do your meditation,

168
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,180
with right hand towards the photograph, left
hand this way.

169
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,010
Not to use light at all, not to use sun don't
go to the sun at all.

170
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:11,000
Sun is to be avoided, keep to the moon, read
the books which describes the Maha Kalis of

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,070
the left-side Shaktis, don't read the books
like Abbaduta book.

172
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,700
You should never read it because you think
you are an Abbaduta I see, he said “I'm

173
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,870
omnipresent, I'm this thing”, the person
start feeing “I am this”.

174
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:33,950
I was reading the book of Abbaduta, I said
this book, this show what's gone wrong with

175
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,790
our incarnations.

176
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,830
What's gone wrong with our incarnations is
they never knew human beings at all, at what

177
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,220
level they are.

178
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:53,700
You come and tell them “I'm formless and
form, I'm this and that”, so what?

179
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,040
If you are that, alright, I'm Compassion,
I'm Love, I'm Peace, I'm that ... so what?

180
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:07,010
How do you fill-in these cups, you have to
come down to a human level, that's what they

181
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,120
did not try, and that's why it's all a waste,
I think on the contrary.

182
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:19,530
Everybody think I'm God, I'm Bramha, Shivo
Ham finished, and then they quarrel among

183
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:26,690
themselves, that growth, that maturity has
not come.

184
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,320
It is very shallow, the whole thing become
very shallow, you become a shallow person,

185
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,240
and you live with it, so the first thing practical
thing I'm telling you: beat yourself with

186
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,900
shoes and “I'm NOT this”, like that you
have to start first of all, telling yourself,

187
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,020
if you are a seeker, a truthful seeker, an
honest seeker, then I advise you this way,

188
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,440
that you watch yourself in the mirror, and
tell yourself, “now you Mr Ego XYZ, will

189
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:07,240
you get out from here, I know what I am, you
get out”, you have to get after all this

190
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,210
I mean, laugh at yourselves, smile at yourself,
make fun of yourself.

191
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,250
That's the best, and never feel hurt, if anybody
says “you are egoistical”, and then you'll

192
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:30,880
say “I know, I know”, if you know you
are egotistical, then how do you go further?

193
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,060
Now ego manifest in so many ways.

194
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,000
Through your eyes, through your ears, through
your mouth, through your nose, everyway, because

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,860
you go against God, that is you go against
collectivity, because you go against Shri

196
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,310
Krishna, against your Vishuddhi chakra.

197
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,730
That's first thing it manifest, nowadays nobody
beats people like this, you see, we have become

198
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,520
subtler in our ego manifestation; we use this
part, not hands.

199
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,829
It can be that you show temper through your
eyes or it can be you flirt with your eyes.

200
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,829
You become adulterous.

201
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,730
That is why Christ has said “don't become
adulterous”.

202
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,709
So now it is nice that the AIDS can work out
through the tears.

203
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,319
It's good.

204
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,519
Used to kiss people, alright, now kiss.

205
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,949
Nobody will kiss now.

206
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,730
You used all your Vishuddhi chakra so far
to express all filth.

207
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,309
Now the filth is pouring out.

208
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,600
So, in the second stage when we understand
that it is through the Vishuddhi that is this

209
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,789
America we express ourselves, our ego, so
what should we do?

210
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:49,549
First of all, stop talking, here the way the
people talk, I mean you see, you have just

211
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:55,000
start opening your mouth like this and like
that, you go on and the other is talking,

212
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,950
just you tell them something, they just come
on with all the knowledge they have known

213
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,100
everything, A to Z, and you don't know where
you are.

214
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,799
How do you stop talking?, I've told you a
practical thing, I'll get you beetle nuts,

215
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:16,059
which I'll vibrate, put it in mouth, and you
take it out when you have to talk otherwise

216
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,230
keep it there, that's Shri Ganesha, don't
take it out.

217
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,870
Stop talking.

218
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,520
If you stop talking, your hypocrisy will go
away.

219
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,250
It's through our face we are hypocritical,
everything works out through Vishuddhi.

220
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,960
Now see, a person who is extremely aggressive
you see can also act to be very, very sweet

221
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,379
you see, if they have to exploit you or make
money out of you.

222
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:52,169
They can act, acting; the whole acting comes
through this Vishuddhi.

223
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:59,830
Then you act, “you are a very gentle person,
you are very good”, but you are not, you

224
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,160
are aggressive.

225
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:12,860
So for that you have to know that talking
less will reduce 50% of your hypocrisy and

226
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
acting, 50%.

227
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,769
Now 50% still left, now what to do with the
50%?

228
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:32,659
50% is a thing where we have to know what
other chakras are responsible for ego manifestation.

229
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:38,299
Is one is the Hamsa, is very important Hamsa
is.

230
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:46,519
We use when we want to show our temper, indifference.

231
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:55,510
Then a person thinks “Oh God, what have
I done to this person?”

232
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,379
That's how we show our temper, all the time
like this.

233
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:10,260
That's Hamsa and that's why we have to use
what we call the simple thing called ghee

234
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:20,340
or something oilish for ears, for nose, for
eyes the kajal and for this portion also.

235
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:28,409
We have to put some ghee in hot water or milk
and take it so that you sooth down your nerves

236
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:35,990
and you smooth down your Vishuddhi and also
you sooth down the what you call in a general

237
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,840
way is the peritoneum but is the lining.

238
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,860
Lining as we sooth down our fingers and hands
when they are dried, we have to sooth them.

239
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,700
Rub ghee here, ghee here, oil here, oil there,
in the head.

240
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,950
Now, the modern style is not to put oil in
the head, you'll become balds.

241
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:06,769
Balded gentleman, of course you can still
act like Yull Brinner, but he died of cancer.

242
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:17,990
His sister is our disciple, and you will develop
funny hair styles everything and of this modern

243
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,590
fashion has started don't put any oil, I don't
know from it has come.

244
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,450
The children also they say “don't put any
oil in the ears”, this is doctors, they

245
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:31,960
want to create patients, don't listen to them.

246
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,539
Before going traveling or anywhere, put oil
in your ears, into your noses not the oil

247
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:45,779
but ghee, and control your peritoneum through
your Hamsa chakra, is very important.

248
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:53,120
This is the chakra which really helps you
very much to soothe down.

249
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,820
Now in Sanskrit and also in many colloquial
languages, ghee is called as “mir”, and

250
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,970
sneha is love.

251
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,249
Neha also is love.

252
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:12,509
So you have to oil it down, so the frictions
are less.

253
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:17,120
We know in nature, when we have the reduce
friction, we put oil.

254
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,910
Like we have to say launch a ship, I've launched
I know what it is, they had to put grease

255
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:32,270
on the thing, and it just touched the ship
and the ship moves, so smoothly onto the sea.

256
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,930
Beautifully it moves.

257
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:40,370
In India they put bananas, because bananas
is a very easily available, so they put bananas

258
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,759
you see under.

259
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,960
Here they use grease, in England for example
they use grease.

260
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,529
In the same way, we have to grease ourselves.

261
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:57,370
Our language, our tone, our speaking must
be greased, greased with love and love is

262
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:06,940
such a powerful thing that can attract any
one let it be even Hitler.

263
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,399
When you talk to someone or say something,
it should have that coating of chocolate of

264
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:22,700
Love, then you can give even give castor oil,
I do that.

265
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:31,249
So, all these things are to be understood
[Vedas] says that we should not become stupid

266
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:33,169
as the other people are.

267
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:43,480
We are yogis and we have to have a ideal life
which manifest itself in all kinds of dynamism

268
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:51,090
and we do not waste this great blessing that
we have got.

269
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:58,980
Now with this another chakra which is always
caught is the Agnya, Agnya chakra.

270
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,390
In the Agnya chakra we have to become thoughtlessly
aware but we can't.

271
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:12,600
Now if you watch your thoughts you will know
mostly we think of the people who have harmed,

272
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,450
who have troubled us, sometimes we have the
glimpse of the good things also.

273
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,640
We think of the good people also, sometimes,
normally we are thinking about the people

274
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,429
who have harmed us, hurt us, this thing, that.

275
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:31,980
Now, Christ who is Shri Ganesha and who has
all the powers to kill us and to finish us

276
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,769
off and destroy us completely has given us
the greatest weapon, is to forgive.

277
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:49,020
So the mantra here is “forgive” and you
have to see that you forgive others.

278
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,140
Anybody says anything, forgive.

279
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,840
When you forgive, God takes over.

280
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,789
And He knows how to handle or mishandle, to
do whatever He likes to that person.

281
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,909
That's not your job, you just forgive, so
you give him a ticket, go to God, I forgive

282
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:21,799
you, and you have to forgive and that is the
thing you can enjoy your Agnya chakra very

283
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:28,140
well, and raise your Kundalini beyond by saying
“forgive, forgive, forgive”, three times,

284
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,149
and you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,
no thoughts.

285
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:38,590
Agnya is the one that brings thoughts to you,
that's why Christ was so particular on the

286
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,460
eyes, that “thou shall not have adulterous
eyes”, try to concentrate your eyes on the

287
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:49,860
mother Earth for some time, she'll suck in,
so that your attention doesn't become that

288
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,019
wobbly, becomes concentrated, and equalized
and balanced.

289
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:01,890
When that is done your eyes become so powerful
even if you look at somebody, you can cure

290
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:07,050
that person and the innocence will start coming
in your eyes, you will not have lust and greed.

291
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,330
It is a very dangerous thing people are playing
here, I mean, I didn’t know all these things

292
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:17,019
people do but I saw it in the West, I mean,
everybody is looking at every girl, what is

293
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,220
the joyless pursuit?

294
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,419
Why, turn your eyes to anything that you don't
enjoy at all.

295
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:27,659
At every girl a man is looking, a girl is
looking at every man, what's this nonsense?

296
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,220
Why waste your energy.

297
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,710
I always look at about 3 feet height, you
see all the flowers there, you see all the

298
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,130
children.

299
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,750
One day somebody asked Me, “don't you feel
like looking at handsome men”?

300
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:48,600
I said “I'm not a fool, I look at the most
handsome things, at 3 feet level”.

301
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,710
He said, you must be a fool to look at this.

302
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,179
I'm not, that is what it is.

303
00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:02,070
So that will give you tremendous amount of
energy, because you preserve all your energy

304
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,070
through your eyes.

305
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:08,010
Eyes are the windows of that Power.

306
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,090
If you try to preserve it, it's alright, otherwise
like now they say “save water, because you've

307
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,650
wasted your water, so now save water”.

308
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:27,320
But when your eyes are innocent in this shower
of bliss, you enjoy that bliss, you don't

309
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,159
have to look at anyone, you don't have to
say anything, you just enjoy, just feel the

310
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,019
joy pouring into you completely.

311
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:41,250
Because the ego has vanished, you see it is
an aggression to look at everyone like that,

312
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,250
it's an aggression.

313
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:48,049
I've known people who mesmerize women, who
mesmerize men, I've known women like that,

314
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:52,279
I've seen in the parties, I've seen the bhoots
coming out of these women, and they look at

315
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:58,529
the man and he gets transfixed, completely,
falls in love with that woman, till he becomes

316
00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:01,610
like a beggar, she just lynches him.

317
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:08,120
It is prostitution, by men or women, it's
a horrible thing, it is dirt in your eyes,

318
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,630
so keep your eyes steady, try to steady them,
if they try to go here and there tell them,

319
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,440
you say “look there, there's the mother
Earth, she's the one that gives us all beautiful

320
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,499
things, look at that” and then the beauty
of that mother Earth will come into your eyes.

321
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:34,280
And the cleanliness and the innocence will
cleanse others, that's how it should be.

322
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:42,580
So to fight this ego one has to be prepared
and must have proper will power, because ego

323
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,899
kills the will power of man, completely.

324
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:49,770
A man who is an egoist is left with no will
power.

325
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,250
It does what the ego tells him to.

326
00:28:53,250 --> 00:29:02,610
It can murder people, it can be violent, all
the violence in America is from the ego manifestation.

327
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:10,460
Because there is no respect of the law, not
of human laws, but not of God's law also,

328
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,749
that's how people behave, that how they incur
diseases, a horrible things.

329
00:29:14,749 --> 00:29:23,039
A person who is not egotistical will not get
cancer.

330
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,269
You have to be egotistical to get cancer,
though it is a left-sided thing, but you have

331
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:34,570
to have ego, vulnerability comes through ego
and then it acts.

332
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:44,440
If you are egoistical, you are vulnerable
to cancer so first thing if you survive from

333
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:54,610
say cancer, you'll have the other one waiting,
where you'll be transfixed by bhoots.

334
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:59,130
You will become like some of the things I
see on TV, where people are given some sort

335
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,610
of artificial thing and they are just nothing
but machines and they move their hands like

336
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:11,580
machines, they walk like this, they look like
human being, and they walk straight like this,

337
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:19,249
they can't feel anything, like that you'll
become, because ego takes you away from emotions

338
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:23,771
and away from the left side and you become
really a person like a machine, you become

339
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:24,771
like a machine.

340
00:30:24,771 --> 00:30:33,489
I met one dentist, he came to Me, he said
to me “Mother, now I cannot apply, I cannot

341
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:38,700
feel and I do not feel bad when somebody dies”.

342
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:48,739
I said “so what do you do?”, “I jog”,
I mean jog means running away from yourself.

343
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:51,539
Jog for how many hours?

344
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:59,600
“5 hours”, out of the 10 hours he’s
awake, he is away 5 hours, he jogs, what else

345
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,159
will happen?

346
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,700
So all these artificial things have come to
us because is a manifestation of somebody's

347
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:14,870
ego, even drugs came to us because somebody
wanted to make money out of us.

348
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:20,470
All these gurus they wanted to make money
out of us, you see they are more interested

349
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:25,609
in making money, all egotistical people are
very money oriented, they can't get out of

350
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:28,450
it, any amount of money you give them.

351
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,639
Whatever I mean I have blessed people with
thousands and thousands of rupees, billion

352
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:39,799
and billions of things, but still their money
orientation doesn't go and then they lose

353
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:47,390
it in no time, they lose just like that, just
like that, Naturally, because they do not

354
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:54,140
recognize that it is a blessing one has got
it, now you have to share it.

355
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:03,529
I mean, actually coming to Sahaja Yoga there
was one gentleman who was really absolutely

356
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:11,119
on the verge of collapsing without any money,
he has become such a rich man overnight and

357
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,450
overnight again he become the same.

358
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:21,489
Is an example, he came to Me, came to Sahaja
Yoga, he became very rich, became all this,

359
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:25,789
and then suddenly he lost everything, and
even Sahaja Yogis started saying “Mother,

360
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:31,429
we come to You for a short time” and then
they go away and they become very rich, I

361
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:38,859
said, alright:, and then see afterwards one
year, before and after, where are they now?

362
00:32:38,859 --> 00:32:50,429
This man has become so poor that he doesn't
even have money to take a bus, so the calamities

363
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,360
come in like that and then they don't understand,
but I'm telling you unless and until you talk

364
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,309
of calamities, people don't learn, they need
a shock, otherwise they don't want to get

365
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,399
out of their egos, they cannot, they live
with it, they don't want to understand that

366
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,159
this is going to happen, then they'd better
do it, when they see it happening.

367
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:16,820
This case, one case of one gentleman has brought
forth before all the Indian Sahaja yogis a

368
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,279
very big lesson.

369
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,409
They were saying that “you should come to
Sahaja Yoga for short time and get out of

370
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:27,780
it, then you'll become very rich”, this
is what they have reached their conclusion

371
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:38,679
and now they don't say so, because the medium
through which you have got God's grace, if

372
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:41,769
it is lost, you have lost it.

373
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:49,289
So don't live with full confidence with that
horrible ego of yours, it is going to overpower

374
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:51,350
you.

375
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,600
And as you've seen the bhoots combine, also
egotistical people will always combine.

376
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,739
They are two egoists, they will always be
very friendly, because they combined together

377
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:08,560
they are just the same, but when they are
immobilized then what is going to happen?

378
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,300
They were sitting like statues, you can make
statues out of them I think, what will be

379
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,660
the next [unclear: state?]

380
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:22,770
I do not know, because they are not dead,
they are living, but they can't eat food,

381
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:31,500
they can look at food, they can't eat it,
but if you put injection in [unclear] because

382
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,050
the parasympathetic might be working or maybe
sympathetic might be working, the autonomous

383
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,280
might be working but the rest of it is finished.

384
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,650
The central nervous system is finished.

385
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,600
It can happen suddenly to someone.

386
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:58,000
Write it down, today I have told you about
this disease.

387
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,640
Try to keep to the group, try to share everything
and don't try your cunning clever methods.

388
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,691
Cunningness is cheating yourself, Gregoire
has told Me “Mother this intelligence, human

389
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:15,580
intelligence is so intelligent it can cheat
yourself”.

390
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,370
That's what I see.

391
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:26,830
Why do you want to cheat yourself, are you
mad?

392
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:32,070
This is what one has to realize, once you
understand that, you'll see most of the problems

393
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,220
of this world will subside.

394
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,400
How do you have atom bomb, how do you have
all these things?

395
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,240
Science never said “you make atom bomb”,
science was given to you for constructive

396
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:50,120
work, for saving time for meditation, not
to make atomic bombs to kill you, no, but

397
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:57,470
in a way it acts because America makes some
bombs, Russia makes some bombs, like two,

398
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:03,560
they'll be sitting on their heads, now they
cannot put their hands to the buttons.

399
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:12,160
Is a good idea, they are afraid of the devils
they have created themselves, see that's what

400
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:21,880
because it is so over-powering, so if you
want to avoid your own destruction, then beware,

401
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:34,390
be aware of yourself, not to boast, that “I
know, I know”, no, how you behave?

402
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:44,240
Some people are such that they say “we can't
live in an ordinary place, we cannot sleep

403
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,870
in an ordinary place and all that”, that
means they are beggars, that is what I feel

404
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:55,720
about such people, because if you are the
king like I am the Queen I should say, I don't

405
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,560
want anything, you make me sleep under this
tree, I can sleep, I can sleep anywhere, I

406
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,141
can live the way I like, and you know I live
in a palace, actually a palace, so what, that

407
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:10,850
palace is not important to Me, wherever I
go I make it a palace for Myself, because

408
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:18,890
I'm not bothered about comforts, no comfort
can crawl up on Me, nothing dominate can Me,

409
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:29,100
nothing can come over Me, nothing is important
to Me, because I'm the Queen, if I'm the beggar

410
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:38,000
then I want comfort, I want this, I want that,
there is no want left.

411
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:48,430
Nothing wanted, in that state when you arrive
then you'll enjoy Sahaja Yoga, your spirit,

412
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,480
and that's what happens when people come to
India.

413
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:00,880
I was amazed to see these people who came,
first time they came we spent 40,000 dollars

414
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:14,490
and 5 Americans came here, 4 or 5, 4 and 1
Canadian, so 5 and 4 ran away, imagine how

415
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:22,470
expensive that, 4 ran away, we tried, they
came to see Me and all that, “No, Mother

416
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,570
we can't stand this [unclear: discomfort],
we cannot stand this discomfort”, what comfort

417
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,090
do you want here?, I don't see any comfort,
horrible since I've come to this, you can

418
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:38,660
see my head, I've been sick in this horrible
place, what comforts you have?

419
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,680
And there they were boasting so much, they
ran away.

420
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:51,680
So, all you understand that those people who
are asking for things all the time, begging

421
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,370
for things have not achieved anything in life.

422
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,170
Now when you are coming this time to India
we are going to have a much more Spartan life

423
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:09,220
because we are not going to be stay in any
building whatsoever, as far as possible except

424
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:16,060
in Rowdy, maybe there also, we are going to
put you up in the pendalls outside, absolutely

425
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:29,190
in the forest, where there will be tigers
they will be snakes, crawling up you, and

426
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:40,730
you’ll have to have baths in the river which
are flowing in at a big speed.

427
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:51,710
And then also you will have their beautiful
music of the morning birds and beautiful fragrance,

428
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,050
it’s so beautiful and soothing.

429
00:39:55,050 --> 00:40:09,630
There where grows the essence of life and
that's what we have decided, I mean, I can

430
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,830
live there, why can't you live?

431
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:28,640
I can't understand, what is so special about
it, I'm an old woman now 63 years of age,

432
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:37,380
and all my life my father or my husband are
being extremely over-comfortable people, I

433
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,310
mean luxurious people.

434
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:46,310
I mean I have never known how to take a taxi
or take a bus all my life, I've never known

435
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:53,320
how to take a ticket to go by train, I've
never traveled by air alone, I mean, I don't

436
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,990
know how to travel by air alone, I mean, I've
always been like that, but I don't need anything,

437
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,560
I can travel alone, I can go anywhere, I can
do everything without feeling any fear, without

438
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:12,100
feeling any problems because as long I'm with
myself, what is there to worry?

439
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:18,350
And that’s what we have to achieve, that
is what we have to do.

440
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:23,260
Once we achieve that kind of a temperament,
is so beautiful, you'll respect yourself,

441
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,220
you'll love yourself, and that's how we love
others and respect others, those that don't

442
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,590
respect themselves cannot respect.

443
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,760
Egotistical people do not respect themselves,
if they respect themselves they would not

444
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,370
be egotistical, but it is so shameful to be
egotistical.

445
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,710
If you say “you are very egotistical”
that person will punch you, even if you say

446
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,840
something else, they won't, will they?

447
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,640
But is you say “you are egoistical”, they'll
punch you that means they feel hurt, if they

448
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,030
don't like why do they have it?

449
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:04,220
It's a very difficult thing to move that ego
from your heads, and you catch from one to

450
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,380
the other so fast that sometimes I don't understand.

451
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,620
But Indian climate and Indian up-bringing
is such, people don't get egotistical, I have

452
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,510
not known of anyone who is today good and
tomorrow standing with a punch, I've not seen

453
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,770
anyone like that in India, very steady people,
now see here is sitting somebody a doctor

454
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,300
and he missed his Nobel prize, a man like
that.

455
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,882
Can you believe that such a man is sitting
here?

456
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:32,110
He's another one.

457
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,400
You won't find this with anyone in India behaving
like that, they have ego, very subtle egos,

458
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:45,580
bureaucrats have I must say, and other politicians
have, [watch: Mother corrects India to abroad

459
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,770
very quickly here] but till they come to abroad
then they get even worse.

460
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:57,540
But normally a person's status is known the
way he is humble in India, otherwise they

461
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,710
don't believe you are from a royal family,
you are from a royal family you are extremely

462
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:10,580
humble, that the sign, like the [unclear:
shesha].

463
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,120
I talked to her five sentences as I said and
she said “this lady is very honorable, from

464
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:21,610
a royal family, must be” I am, but I mean,
I am, but I mean I've never told her, which

465
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:30,830
is not known to many people, but she said
“She must be from a royal family”.

466
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,600
What is the need to insult others, what is
the need to shout at others and talk in that

467
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
manner?

468
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,650
There is no need, you must talk in a way that
is sweet and nice, it looks nice, it shows

469
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,650
better.

470
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:52,280
Your personality is better seen by others,
at least for the sake of congenial concord

471
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:59,880
with others please try to get over your nonsensical
ego.

472
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:11,260
It keeps you out of bounds for the joy, the
ocean of joy that you have to have.

473
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:17,210
You are a miserable creature for nothing at
all, making everybody miserable.

474
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,550
But face it, face it, don't put it in your
left Vishuddhi, “Oh, I'm egotistical, I'm

475
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:27,300
very unhappy”, you're finished, I cannot
cure that, I'm already suffering you see,

476
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:31,320
all the time I get pain here, pain here, I
don’t know what to do, since I've come to

477
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,190
West I've developed a problem here because
all of you have in this left Vishuddhi and

478
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:39,920
I've put you inside My body.

479
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,190
You don't know how much you make Me suffer,
though I don't mind, I can see that.

480
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:54,490
I have to request you now to you look after
yourself and behave in a manner that this

481
00:44:54,490 --> 00:45:02,950
American ego disappears because there's another
way out that is Shri Krishna's time which

482
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,910
I don't want to use just now.

483
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:16,400
The first destruction will start in America
then construction will start.

484
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,100
Destruction is impossible, the clouds of destruction
will disappear, completely disappear, the

485
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:28,720
cool wind will blow it out, but you have to
be of sincerity and of understanding, without

486
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,550
any ego, that's your responsibility, for your
children, for your progeny, for your country,

487
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,880
it is your responsibility.

488
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,420
Good?

489
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:46,560
May God Bless you.

490
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:56,290
So now I'll be going for the another stride
and in the evening I may not meet you again.

491
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:06,120
But I hope you people will now give the full
list of the people who want to marry.

492
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:12,260
Those who have not yet decided, should decide,
even if you are not decided on people, give

493
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:19,710
me the list of the people who want to get
married in India, if not this year, then next

494
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,570
year, something like that, all of you should
give your names, those who want to marry that

495
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:32,850
is very important because it is impossible
to do it without getting everyone there, that's

496
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:34,520
one point is.

497
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,910
Secondly we should decide how many are going,
how they are going, and all these things are

498
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:46,700
to be done in a proper systematic way and
Babet must be informed about it, everybody

499
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,460
should say that so many are going from Los
Angeles this way, they are going from this

500
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,960
way and Babet should be able to organize it,
there should be no competition, nothing.

501
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,010
And you should see to it that you get the
cheapest price.

502
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:10,970
But not at the cost of disturbing yourself,
whatever you can get easily, just get it,

503
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,810
that's not so important.

504
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:19,700
The third point I've said that there is no
need for you to bring too much of luggage

505
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:26,061
especially for ladies, there is no need to
bring any make-ups or anything in India, no

506
00:47:26,061 --> 00:47:32,850
need at all it's a country where your skin
improves by itself, you don't have to do much

507
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:38,580
make-up or anything it's very smooth country,
where your skin nourishes itself, and you'll

508
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,250
feel very nice and even if you have to buy
you can buy, you can buy them in India which

509
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,920
are made out of not any chemicals or anything,
but natural things you see.

510
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,300
Even for toothpaste and all that, it is better
to use Indian toothpaste I think, so I think

511
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,830
now I've reached that conclusion, all these
horrible toothpaste here things are what chemicals

512
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:03,090
they have I don't know what will happen to
the teeth, so far my teeth are intact, I've

513
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:10,950
never been to a dentist, but I feel, I feel
there are full of horrible chemicals in it.

514
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:16,250
So don't spoil your skin with these horrible
make-ups and things like that, I mean to find

515
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,880
a proper shampoo here, I find it impossible
because sometimes maybe some shampoos can

516
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:29,500
just take out your hair like that, you see,
so try to acquire habits which are simple,

517
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,340
natural habits in a living not primitive,
again I say not primitive, but not very elaborate

518
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,290
and don't pay so much attention to your body
as you do, there is no need to pay, it is

519
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:46,740
alright whatever God has given it a body,
it's alright, you don't have worry too much

520
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,740
about it.

521
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,290
To do some little exercises in the morning,
or something, do your meditation properly,

522
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,580
be normal people, you don't have to overdo
anything, little bit is alright, but just

523
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,060
keep in the center, don't go to extremes in
anything.

524
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:06,720
Now you have to be bring a sweater and things
like that and as I told you a proper bedding

525
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,210
as I told that you have to bring.

526
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:14,690
Now, in India they will supply you with sheets
and everything, with nice cotton sheets, because

527
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:21,800
you must use as far as possible cotton and
as far as possible silks, or cotton natural

528
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,680
things, not artificial things like you'll
get into trouble if you use plastics and things

529
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:35,190
like that, so as far as possible try not to
bring many clothes because we can get you

530
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,190
everything.

531
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:46,010
Now, to come to the practical side of it I
would like to have all the what you call,

532
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:52,700
sizes, written down properly but make them
into 4 sizes.

533
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:01,470
You sort it out, you can do it, put them into
4 sizes, for kurtas, and for ladies' also

534
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:11,530
blouses into 4 sizes so you make 4 sizes,
A, B, C, D sizes for men and women, and we

535
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,940
keep that ready for you when you come.

536
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:19,230
Imagine how much these Indians work for it
and how much do I donate, that's all donation

537
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,150
whatever I give, what remains the money is
so little and they are now going to donate

538
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:31,590
so much money for your school, for your children,
imagine that Indians should do it, it's not

539
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,270
very good.

540
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:40,040
We have such a little money to be very frank
which has been given that I really feel shy

541
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,370
to take that money to India so I've kept it
now with Arneau, every money is kept there,

542
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:49,550
that you keep it there, but if you have to
have a school we have to a good school and

543
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:55,980
for that we need money but just now you don't
think of donating anything, because though

544
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,340
you are rich people you are incapable of donations
now.

545
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:03,560
II can see that clearly, because you have
to travel, you have to spend money on your

546
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,630
travels, Indians don't have to do that, so
it's alright but whatever they have said a

547
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,370
little amount for donations that much you
give them.

548
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:19,010
And you come there with love, but people come
back like traders I tell you really like traders,

549
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:25,580
because India is a place where one can buy
lots of things, you like everything “you

550
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:28,470
want buy this, you want to buy that” that's
not good.

551
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:34,589
Buy a few things of symbolic value, whatever
you need you should buy, you cannot bring

552
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:40,180
all the things that you need from India, but
people when they travel like that it is very

553
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:47,310
shameful I think people sometimes don't understand
how yogis have to carry so many things, now

554
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:55,570
you should carry things which are useful to
you, which are good for you but not too much.

555
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:55,840
