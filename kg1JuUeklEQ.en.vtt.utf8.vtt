WEBVTT

00:16.380 --> 00:19.380
yes

00:28.019 --> 00:37.329
What did he say mother could you please

00:34.149 --> 00:39.370
say something about the collective and

00:37.329 --> 00:43.089
the need for real-life selves to be

00:39.370 --> 00:45.580
together but alright that's a very nice

00:43.089 --> 00:51.309
addition I would like to say something

00:45.580 --> 00:54.489
about connecting so far as you know in

00:51.309 --> 00:58.839
the history of spirituality people have

00:54.489 --> 01:05.920
gotten realization many people one after

00:58.839 --> 01:08.800
another many people got it but I will

01:05.920 --> 01:14.610
say one in a million one in a ten

01:08.800 --> 01:18.520
million like because we have to have

01:14.610 --> 01:21.250
some of the food to talk about beginning

01:18.520 --> 01:24.940
we are missing what was written in the

01:21.250 --> 01:27.789
past but they those people who got

01:24.940 --> 01:31.119
realization single-handed suffered a lot

01:27.789 --> 01:35.500
and they could not transmit what it was

01:31.119 --> 01:40.900
needed to be given to others in a way

01:35.500 --> 01:44.920
that would be accepted now as you see

01:40.900 --> 01:48.430
any discovery is made like that people

01:44.920 --> 01:51.520
can benefit individually every person

01:48.430 --> 01:51.960
can say oh I have parted so I can have

01:51.520 --> 01:56.460
it

01:51.960 --> 01:59.400
ha but it is of a movin it is of Norman

01:56.460 --> 02:02.670
I can take it I will say a personality

01:59.400 --> 02:05.220
like Christ we once we had Christianity

02:02.670 --> 02:07.350
what have they done about it I mean it's

02:05.220 --> 02:09.840
a Saturday I mean to think such a

02:07.350 --> 02:11.850
personality too common what a great job

02:09.840 --> 02:12.569
he has done to establish himself for our

02:11.850 --> 02:16.140
detriment

02:12.569 --> 02:20.220
what people have done the reason was he

02:16.140 --> 02:22.140
wasn't he was alone it was not a mass

02:20.220 --> 02:23.520
thing that was not the time because he

02:22.140 --> 02:25.769
had to establish this Center without

02:23.520 --> 02:28.650
that it could not be mass all right

02:25.769 --> 02:30.870
it could not be a Hamas realization but

02:28.650 --> 02:32.850
he talked about you have to be born

02:30.870 --> 02:36.510
again and all that but the whole thing

02:32.850 --> 02:39.290
fizzled out because they could not get

02:36.510 --> 02:42.660
to the essence of it one person of that

02:39.290 --> 02:48.560
value coming on this earth found it

02:42.660 --> 02:51.870
impossible to convince people in fact so

02:48.560 --> 02:56.579
one has to understand that any anything

02:51.870 --> 02:59.160
that is if evolutionary first-first

02:56.579 --> 03:03.480
happens to one or two persons only but

02:59.160 --> 03:05.760
then it happens to many me now in sahaja

03:03.480 --> 03:07.739
yoga this another problem apart from

03:05.760 --> 03:09.810
that that it is happening to many people

03:07.739 --> 03:12.000
is them no doubt thousands are getting

03:09.810 --> 03:15.000
realization is no doubt is working out

03:12.000 --> 03:16.680
that you know that now the evolution has

03:15.000 --> 03:18.900
come to the stage as I say it's the

03:16.680 --> 03:21.799
Blossom time many flowers are there and

03:18.900 --> 03:24.930
they have to become fruits but now why

03:21.799 --> 03:27.130
necessary to have connectivity when

03:24.930 --> 03:28.780
people are between or as a shield

03:27.130 --> 03:34.570
that is a very important point one has

03:28.780 --> 03:36.670
to understand the thing is that now when

03:34.570 --> 03:39.400
you are getting realized what is

03:36.670 --> 03:42.670
happening to you you are getting related

03:39.400 --> 03:46.150
to the whole a my proposal is getting

03:42.670 --> 03:50.200
related to the mattress say your body is

03:46.150 --> 03:52.450
there and you are sleeping first you get

03:50.200 --> 03:56.230
a little a vaguely you open your fingers

03:52.450 --> 04:00.730
alright then you open your another thing

03:56.230 --> 04:02.950
now there is a little trouble on your

04:00.730 --> 04:04.960
finger and you can't see anything so you

04:02.950 --> 04:08.020
open your eyes and you pay your

04:04.960 --> 04:10.300
attention to your hands so that trouble

04:08.020 --> 04:12.640
may be all right but you need another

04:10.300 --> 04:15.310
hand to help so you want the another

04:12.640 --> 04:18.549
hand also to be awakened to that point

04:15.310 --> 04:21.580
like that so when the search opens are

04:18.549 --> 04:23.770
getting awakened more and more see the

04:21.580 --> 04:26.440
problems that are facing us we can sort

04:23.770 --> 04:28.690
them better because so many people are

04:26.440 --> 04:31.630
working out the problem you understand

04:28.690 --> 04:34.270
my point now together when we are

04:31.630 --> 04:42.630
together we understand now this problem

04:34.270 --> 04:42.630
I moved to America I had one in 1970

04:43.170 --> 04:51.520
1973 for starting yes 1973 Allegra's I

04:47.620 --> 04:53.830
was alone I mean I gave very good

04:51.520 --> 04:57.280
lectures we had very big halls filled up

04:53.830 --> 04:59.380
and everything is enough the reason is

04:57.280 --> 05:01.900
the people who got realization didn't

04:59.380 --> 05:04.060
have anybody to look after them there

05:01.900 --> 05:07.480
was nobody to support them give them

05:04.060 --> 05:08.920
assistance so they got lost I mean they

05:07.480 --> 05:11.590
are there some of them are here and

05:08.920 --> 05:14.040
there now now what has happened now

05:11.590 --> 05:17.770
today when I am going to America

05:14.040 --> 05:20.140
everybody is playing in Australia

05:17.770 --> 05:23.080
they're playing in India they're playing

05:20.140 --> 05:25.050
like the tension and we surprised some

05:23.080 --> 05:26.970
people are coming from India to go down

05:25.050 --> 05:29.310
Dominika some are coming from Australia

05:26.970 --> 05:31.409
to go down to America some are coming

05:29.310 --> 05:33.509
from France some from Switzerland they

05:31.409 --> 05:37.319
are all rushing to America now the job

05:33.509 --> 05:39.690
is in America all right so like the

05:37.319 --> 05:41.849
attention see as soon as somebody pricks

05:39.690 --> 05:44.970
me of my hand goes there my articles

05:41.849 --> 05:48.479
that everything works so the collective

05:44.970 --> 05:51.060
working out effort is going to solve the

05:48.479 --> 05:52.770
problem but supposing if this finger is

05:51.060 --> 05:56.460
fighting with this finger can I write

05:52.770 --> 06:00.030
anything or if they are secluded and

05:56.460 --> 06:05.460
alone then I can I use them all this

06:00.030 --> 06:08.009
body has to become absolutely in Concord

06:05.460 --> 06:10.889
with each other but so many are still

06:08.009 --> 06:15.629
sleeping those who are awakened at least

06:10.889 --> 06:18.599
must stick to it otherwise sahaja yoga

06:15.629 --> 06:21.360
cannot go today I find it much easier to

06:18.599 --> 06:23.219
give realization much as I was

06:21.360 --> 06:26.490
struggling with six people for four

06:23.219 --> 06:29.969
years in your London four years

06:26.490 --> 06:32.370
seek speed but once they got realization

06:29.969 --> 06:35.550
it started working fast and the more

06:32.370 --> 06:36.529
people we get because the channel that

06:35.550 --> 06:40.289
is to be used

06:36.529 --> 06:42.539
it's like nerves in the body you become

06:40.289 --> 06:45.719
a nerve of that body which is awakened

06:42.539 --> 06:48.330
and once the nerves start working out

06:45.719 --> 06:50.190
together realizing that there's one

06:48.330 --> 06:53.310
force that is flowing through them all

06:50.190 --> 06:58.319
of you have to work it out together with

06:53.310 --> 07:01.139
understanding of the divine it works

06:58.319 --> 07:03.419
first any person who's all nerves are at

07:01.139 --> 07:05.759
work will be much more dynamic than a

07:03.419 --> 07:10.800
person who is half dead or is full

07:05.759 --> 07:13.409
length so you can understand how

07:10.800 --> 07:18.270
collectivities important then another

07:13.409 --> 07:21.930
thing is that going to a very enjoyable

07:18.270 --> 07:24.979
part that when the colour sahaja Yogi's

07:21.930 --> 07:28.170
are collectively there they really know

07:24.979 --> 07:32.290
because for the first time I'm starting

07:28.170 --> 07:34.240
first before this you never enjoyed you

07:32.290 --> 07:37.030
enjoy flowers enjoyed everything else

07:34.240 --> 07:39.340
but not you wanted pure enjoyment of

07:37.030 --> 07:41.950
human being starts coming when you

07:39.340 --> 07:44.890
become truly realized I'll give you an

07:41.950 --> 07:51.160
example we went to Calcutta one day and

07:44.890 --> 07:53.320
I was in a room in a in one hotel and

07:51.160 --> 07:56.380
there were three for sahaja Yogi's in

07:53.320 --> 07:59.140
another hotel another one and one

07:56.380 --> 08:01.570
gentleman came to me for his daily

07:59.140 --> 08:03.670
language and whenever I raised him

08:01.570 --> 08:09.250
Kundalini you see they've all got

08:03.670 --> 08:10.870
vibrated and they all rushed to my to

08:09.250 --> 08:13.780
know what has happened suddenly how is

08:10.870 --> 08:15.640
it we got some joy within ourselves they

08:13.780 --> 08:17.980
came to see and this man was there it

08:15.640 --> 08:21.490
was a great room but they felt the

08:17.980 --> 08:23.530
vibration is tremendous so it is not the

08:21.490 --> 08:26.050
happening of an individual which is the

08:23.530 --> 08:27.520
happening of the world and the

08:26.050 --> 08:29.170
individual effort is going to be

08:27.520 --> 08:32.320
absolutely useless it will be all

08:29.170 --> 08:34.780
neutralized if you sit at home do your

08:32.320 --> 08:37.770
meditation it won't work you won't have

08:34.780 --> 08:43.110
any fun because the whole has to come I

08:37.770 --> 08:48.250
give an example that when you churn the

08:43.110 --> 08:50.770
butter in India I don't know you don't

08:48.250 --> 08:54.820
do that way we do it very naturally you

08:50.770 --> 08:58.150
put a little butter inside that and then

08:54.820 --> 09:00.610
again you structure so the butter starts

08:58.150 --> 09:03.040
gathering around that butter all of it

09:00.610 --> 09:05.590
comes together but some particles have

09:03.040 --> 09:07.900
left they stick to the sides stick to

09:05.590 --> 09:11.590
that there are no more as butter they

09:07.900 --> 09:14.800
are thrown away as but it is as simple

09:11.590 --> 09:18.490
as that you see the more you gather

09:14.800 --> 09:19.470
together really enjoy the spirit of

09:18.490 --> 09:27.730
friendship

09:19.470 --> 09:31.270
spirit of mirth spirit of love and pure

09:27.730 --> 09:34.750
form so far the loves buyers they say

09:31.270 --> 09:37.540
it's last there's money there space

09:34.750 --> 09:39.910
that's the relationship this is you a

09:37.540 --> 09:42.070
British so I must love you I'm Indian so

09:39.910 --> 09:44.440
I must love you all these nonsensical

09:42.070 --> 09:46.420
barriers are there you love a human

09:44.440 --> 09:51.339
being because he's a human being and

09:46.420 --> 09:54.790
he's a yogi speaks the same now today I

09:51.339 --> 09:56.709
have attended a wedding party and the

09:54.790 --> 09:58.450
bride and the bridegroom said we are

09:56.709 --> 10:00.390
coming to Paris with you mother there

09:58.450 --> 10:03.730
are hundred people coming to Madison

10:00.390 --> 10:05.589
because I haven't changed pets but I

10:03.730 --> 10:07.240
said you are asymptomatic I better enjoy

10:05.589 --> 10:10.870
your money who said what are we going to

10:07.240 --> 10:12.520
enjoy a line just to get our humans even

10:10.870 --> 10:13.089
if I tell you don't come they won't

10:12.520 --> 10:15.430
listen

10:13.089 --> 10:17.410
they will enjoy their honeymoon there I

10:15.430 --> 10:19.209
never said you come on the contrary I've

10:17.410 --> 10:20.920
seen you go where you might be to enjoy

10:19.209 --> 10:23.140
your honeymoon where every left they

10:20.920 --> 10:25.000
won't know because they know we're in

10:23.140 --> 10:29.050
German hands with their brothers is

10:25.000 --> 10:33.459
famous ancestors it's absolutely so I

10:29.050 --> 10:37.149
think that the enjoyment of human beings

10:33.459 --> 10:39.760
has not been there now there are people

10:37.149 --> 10:43.209
who live in India who live in Australia

10:39.760 --> 10:44.680
who live here all over the places but

10:43.209 --> 10:47.260
when the sahaja Yogi's go to you I

10:44.680 --> 10:51.459
should see them in the way they are

10:47.260 --> 10:53.800
sahaja Yogi's in the villages way to

10:51.459 --> 10:56.170
impress them way to feel the oneness

10:53.800 --> 10:57.490
never there felt like this for a white

10:56.170 --> 10:59.560
scheming they saw might scream they

10:57.490 --> 11:02.290
would just run away and hide themselves

10:59.560 --> 11:03.970
under this thing I see and even now

11:02.290 --> 11:05.740
people are sometimes writing to see a

11:03.970 --> 11:07.300
white skin in a village they say Oh God

11:05.740 --> 11:10.089
they have come just to destroy something

11:07.300 --> 11:12.459
but now that's all one now it's a human

11:10.089 --> 11:15.370
a human being is coming that all of this

11:12.459 --> 11:18.120
for there is nothing like a black or a

11:15.370 --> 11:22.529
white or anything left now it's such an

11:18.120 --> 11:25.990
such a love that promise and understand

11:22.529 --> 11:28.270
that's only possible if you learn how to

11:25.990 --> 11:32.290
live collectively and collectivities

11:28.270 --> 11:35.740
also teaches you where you are very

11:32.290 --> 11:38.590
important a person was not live collect

11:35.740 --> 11:40.390
cannot understand and seen people for

11:38.590 --> 11:43.840
their own families even their families

11:40.390 --> 11:48.220
their surgeries but once they come to

11:43.840 --> 11:51.120
the ashram they know what yet because of

11:48.220 --> 11:55.570
their chests you have to learn to adjust

11:51.120 --> 11:57.670
you can't have private bathroom to

11:55.570 --> 11:59.800
yourself and private room to yourself

11:57.670 --> 12:01.750
alright you can have if you want to have

11:59.800 --> 12:03.940
but you should also know how to exist as

12:01.750 --> 12:07.270
you know I live very comfortably myself

12:03.940 --> 12:09.520
but if it comes to live anywhere I have

12:07.270 --> 12:12.520
no problem of comfort already in the

12:09.520 --> 12:14.800
same way we are not barred from a job

12:12.520 --> 12:17.170
because of all these things away we can

12:14.800 --> 12:19.630
your bathrooms with us we do not enjoy

12:17.170 --> 12:21.940
life so you want to have everything

12:19.630 --> 12:24.400
absolutely first class that has lead

12:21.940 --> 12:26.620
said that even when we go to the picnic

12:24.400 --> 12:28.840
we take on the Metropolitan with us in

12:26.620 --> 12:31.300
the same way we cannot enjoy life you

12:28.840 --> 12:34.840
cannot enjoy nature we can enjoy

12:31.300 --> 12:37.870
anything as long as we become a just an

12:34.840 --> 12:41.380
individual oh I am the one who is well

12:37.870 --> 12:43.930
to it the last of all we must know by

12:41.380 --> 12:45.970
individualism will become malignant I

12:43.930 --> 12:48.940
don't say become communist because

12:45.970 --> 12:50.950
that's another monuments but by becoming

12:48.940 --> 12:53.770
individuals will be combining them what

12:50.950 --> 12:55.090
is malignancy that an individual self

12:53.770 --> 12:57.850
takes up upon itself

12:55.090 --> 12:59.770
I will grow I will put it doesn't know

12:57.850 --> 13:01.720
how to grow with the whole it has no

12:59.770 --> 13:06.190
coordination with the whole that's why

13:01.720 --> 13:08.740
you say it is a cancer cancer is nothing

13:06.190 --> 13:11.440
but is a malignant cell which is alone

13:08.740 --> 13:16.240
and he's saying that I have to achieve I

13:11.440 --> 13:19.810
can unit I can manage it and once it

13:16.240 --> 13:23.350
starts going like that whosoever touches

13:19.810 --> 13:25.960
that person becomes all these ideas we

13:23.350 --> 13:28.710
are higher race or we have greater

13:25.960 --> 13:30.100
people we are moneyed people we are

13:28.710 --> 13:32.649
something

13:30.100 --> 13:37.480
special we are of this club all these

13:32.649 --> 13:40.089
disappears it's all nonsensical they are

13:37.480 --> 13:42.130
identified with nonsensical things I am

13:40.089 --> 13:46.300
making ourselves miserable another salsa

13:42.130 --> 13:49.240
mr. eyed well you give up on that

13:46.300 --> 13:52.000
suddenly you find Oh what did you you

13:49.240 --> 13:55.720
don't want in it we just want to be in

13:52.000 --> 13:58.240
the company of sahaja Yogi's I have seen

13:55.720 --> 14:02.740
people ambassadors very highly placed

13:58.240 --> 14:05.259
people just getting me lost when they

14:02.740 --> 14:08.139
search the other day I had a businessman

14:05.259 --> 14:15.399
from Bombay I took him down with me to a

14:08.139 --> 14:17.589
place called hooray and it was all in a

14:15.399 --> 14:20.860
message that says there were no proper

14:17.589 --> 14:23.800
bathrooms aware it was just like he got

14:20.860 --> 14:25.899
for second act expected and there

14:23.800 --> 14:29.440
weren't even places to sit down properly

14:25.899 --> 14:31.720
only the beach and the palm trees and

14:29.440 --> 14:35.380
all sorts of thing was there and the man

14:31.720 --> 14:37.720
but mustard absolutely lost and he said

14:35.380 --> 14:40.000
I never wanted this day to finish still

14:37.720 --> 14:44.189
only they are really enjoyed myself

14:40.000 --> 14:49.449
though because there was such content

14:44.189 --> 14:55.209
such spontaneous love such attention and

14:49.449 --> 14:58.899
such purity in that to enjoy that purity

14:55.209 --> 15:00.819
you have to be in collective sitting

14:58.899 --> 15:03.069
down in the room you can't understand

15:00.819 --> 15:05.610
there is no reflection of you can't

15:03.069 --> 15:08.649
understand where are you how far your

15:05.610 --> 15:10.959
collectivity is the most important thing

15:08.649 --> 15:15.339
and those who try to break the

15:10.959 --> 15:18.759
collectivity arguing anti sahaja we call

15:15.339 --> 15:23.509
it a sahaja movement

15:18.759 --> 15:25.429
sahaja activity you have to be one with

15:23.509 --> 15:28.399
the hope those who have tried to

15:25.429 --> 15:32.269
separate themselves all of them go down

15:28.399 --> 15:37.909
in sahaja yoga try to be one with

15:32.269 --> 15:41.929
everyone to share and enjoy everybody

15:37.909 --> 15:45.619
speak because God has created you so you

15:41.929 --> 15:47.749
are salute and the enjoyment should not

15:45.619 --> 15:50.419
be lost because you have certain

15:47.749 --> 15:52.429
barriers like some people can't take out

15:50.419 --> 15:55.579
their shoes I mean just imagine how will

15:52.429 --> 15:57.679
they are identified with issues they can

15:55.579 --> 15:58.569
take out their shoes to that extent

15:57.679 --> 16:01.669
they're stupid

15:58.569 --> 16:04.599
see all this kind of stupidity drops out

16:01.669 --> 16:07.249
once you meet really wise people around

16:04.599 --> 16:11.599
to get rid of all these nonsensical

16:07.249 --> 16:16.039
ideas which are really haunted your head

16:11.599 --> 16:18.739
all these days get rid of them and you

16:16.039 --> 16:22.339
really enjoy everyone

16:18.739 --> 16:25.519
whether he is a doorman or he is the

16:22.339 --> 16:28.819
chairman all of them are mental it's

16:25.519 --> 16:31.479
nothing more than all that drops up and

16:28.819 --> 16:34.699
you start enjoying yourself

16:31.479 --> 16:36.820
that's why collectivity is the only way

16:34.699 --> 16:40.210
I can work out

16:36.820 --> 16:44.770
I can't think I can work out through the

16:40.210 --> 16:49.480
people who are separated divided it is

16:44.770 --> 16:51.930
said Christ has said also that they said

16:49.480 --> 16:55.000
what you know what having to do he said

16:51.930 --> 16:57.730
if when you love each other you have

16:55.000 --> 17:00.280
done that it is just students true and

16:57.730 --> 17:02.470
when I hear the loving conversation of

17:00.280 --> 17:04.300
the sahaja Yogi's I feel the happiness

17:02.470 --> 17:06.850
that's the greatest happiness for me

17:04.300 --> 17:10.480
that all of you should love each other

17:06.850 --> 17:12.550
in spirit without any return only for

17:10.480 --> 17:15.610
love's sake you're or should love each

17:12.550 --> 17:18.220
other and that is what it is and also

17:15.610 --> 17:20.200
Krishna has said wherever people are

17:18.220 --> 17:24.850
there together together in the name of

17:20.200 --> 17:27.160
God I decided so in the knee joint so

17:24.850 --> 17:30.310
called because you are all one moving

17:27.160 --> 17:32.560
with one rhythm with one understanding

17:30.310 --> 17:35.800
with one language so you all should

17:32.560 --> 17:37.870
always meet all each other and have

17:35.800 --> 17:43.030
record with each other it's so beautiful

17:37.870 --> 17:46.350
it's music it's political we understand

17:43.030 --> 17:46.350
that may God bless

17:51.030 --> 17:57.070
I'd see for yourself when you got out to

17:53.980 --> 17:59.170
a collectivity just abusing yourself at

17:57.070 --> 18:00.760
that point that this is one thing we are

17:59.170 --> 18:05.020
trying to teach me now I'm not going to

18:00.760 --> 18:07.500
listen to this nonsense we are going to

18:05.020 --> 18:10.120
be in otherwise also I mean we cannot

18:07.500 --> 18:12.340
people cannot take even drinks without

18:10.120 --> 18:15.280
somebody in there you can't take your

18:12.340 --> 18:17.980
food alone there's so many things I mean

18:15.280 --> 18:22.630
if you are not absolutely recluse you

18:17.980 --> 18:26.730
can't live alone then in religion in in

18:22.630 --> 18:33.120
the city especially in the realm of all

18:26.730 --> 18:33.120
how can I be you all have to be there

18:38.930 --> 18:44.450
I think it was a very good question

18:41.030 --> 18:49.400
right chaos this individualism must be

18:44.450 --> 18:51.320
given that doesn't mean you dress up

18:49.400 --> 18:55.520
like a military people

18:51.320 --> 18:57.440
that's not fascism or you should all

18:55.520 --> 18:59.570
behave in the same manner that's not

18:57.440 --> 19:02.600
necessary what I feel it's all the

18:59.570 --> 19:06.560
beauty but does that mean that if I say

19:02.600 --> 19:18.460
it is it is East you should say it is

19:06.560 --> 19:22.780
West that's the main number case is it

19:18.460 --> 19:25.550
that you can't dive into each other

19:22.780 --> 19:34.120
what's the problem in connectivity

19:25.550 --> 19:34.120
I can ask

19:44.530 --> 19:51.480
must get out of individual limitations I

19:59.850 --> 20:05.530
think everybody for some time more and

20:02.890 --> 20:07.060
given a national survival but Ashna must

20:05.530 --> 20:08.590
be such when there is collective dues

20:07.060 --> 20:15.220
now I show me there fighting and

20:08.590 --> 20:17.620
following this reversal yourself being

20:15.220 --> 20:20.410
in the National ones but I leave it to

20:17.620 --> 20:23.380
you it's all freedom you just decide

20:20.410 --> 20:26.440
yourself I have not any rules and

20:23.380 --> 20:30.250
regulations on how much because I've got

20:26.440 --> 20:32.950
you to use your wisdom and put

20:30.250 --> 20:39.040
everything right or self you are all

20:32.950 --> 20:42.520
very wise people but first have them God

20:39.040 --> 20:44.470
listen to others talk to them find out

20:42.520 --> 20:46.690
what's the problem is on small small

20:44.470 --> 20:49.510
things people find it's a very long

20:46.690 --> 20:52.540
moreover you have to have one person as

20:49.510 --> 20:54.490
a leader to whom you should listen to if

20:52.540 --> 20:56.440
I find that fellow is useless I'll throw

20:54.490 --> 20:58.540
him on it you know that throw him away

20:56.440 --> 21:00.280
not in the way people throw me but he

20:58.540 --> 21:03.070
just get out of sahaja line you know not

21:00.280 --> 21:06.000
so there should be no problem but

21:03.070 --> 21:10.360
everybody should not try to dominate

21:06.000 --> 21:15.090
each other that's a valid try to change

21:10.360 --> 21:19.270
your head as I would say how far can you

21:15.090 --> 21:22.810
just how far can you accommodate

21:19.270 --> 21:26.130
let's see that we have to learn that for

21:22.810 --> 21:26.130
me isn't it

21:26.580 --> 21:32.230
you must find out ways and methods of

21:29.650 --> 21:35.050
accommodating yourself and others just

21:32.230 --> 21:38.050
try to learn it's not difficult that's

21:35.050 --> 21:39.440
the whole attitude of life is of

21:38.050 --> 21:41.450
competition

21:39.440 --> 21:43.940
this another should be changed you must

21:41.450 --> 21:47.330
compete in level conflict in doing good

21:43.940 --> 21:49.610
things confident working for others like

21:47.330 --> 21:53.480
I won the know now I love take the fall

21:49.610 --> 21:55.600
is very comfortable and watch the TV

21:53.480 --> 21:56.800
this morning and I will not wash you

21:55.600 --> 21:59.270
[Music]

21:56.800 --> 22:00.640
then people start taking advantage

21:59.270 --> 22:04.790
essence let them take advantage

22:00.640 --> 22:10.520
disadvantage wonder actually if you see

22:04.790 --> 22:14.360
the other side competent service

22:10.520 --> 22:18.920
competing love confident good things of

22:14.360 --> 22:21.830
saying good words of communicating in a

22:18.920 --> 22:28.520
sweet away that others feel happy making

22:21.830 --> 22:32.240
others happy try to change your attitude

22:28.520 --> 22:34.100
towards others and you really enjoy I

22:32.240 --> 22:36.440
tell you you'll enjoy that's the way you

22:34.100 --> 22:38.810
know if you say something to hurt

22:36.440 --> 22:40.760
someone and upset someone it must be

22:38.810 --> 22:42.740
upsetting you definitely you may not

22:40.760 --> 22:44.720
sure but it must be because whatever you

22:42.740 --> 22:45.680
do to others comes back to you straight

22:44.720 --> 22:47.990
forward march

22:45.680 --> 22:56.750
I take it doesn't stay there altogether

22:47.990 --> 22:58.970
it comes back so just try to be kind you

22:56.750 --> 23:01.040
may say that the other may try to con

22:58.970 --> 23:03.280
doesn't matter nobody can harm you

23:01.040 --> 23:06.700
because you are the spirit you cannot

23:03.280 --> 23:09.530
you are the spirit so just try to

23:06.700 --> 23:11.240
understand the person I tell you after

23:09.530 --> 23:13.070
some time and find that person will

23:11.240 --> 23:15.890
become very some so many sahaja Yogi's

23:13.070 --> 23:18.890
have become like that automatically we

23:15.890 --> 23:24.050
are here for seeking God isn't it so to

23:18.890 --> 23:26.100
help them you have a patient give up

23:24.050 --> 23:29.430
your old methods and ways I must

23:26.100 --> 23:36.150
to be good to disturb to be angry

23:29.430 --> 23:39.210
there's no need at all I'm telling you

23:36.150 --> 23:47.460
from my experience I've tried my wisdom

23:39.210 --> 23:51.540
it works is it does work and you're

23:47.460 --> 23:57.120
probably and failed in your ascent in

23:51.540 --> 24:00.360
their quality I like you to move brings

23:57.120 --> 24:03.540
others to you I don't like people to

24:00.360 --> 24:09.410
criticize others try to support any

24:03.540 --> 24:12.870
children I never talk about their past

24:09.410 --> 24:14.790
or anything like that it's very sad

24:12.870 --> 24:17.880
sometimes I've seen people are very hard

24:14.790 --> 24:20.100
and in anger they say things which one

24:17.880 --> 24:23.010
should never see it's not gracious it's

24:20.100 --> 24:25.800
not in the mannerism of sahaja Yogi's

24:23.010 --> 24:28.380
you should never say these things do I

24:25.800 --> 24:30.780
ever say anything like that about your

24:28.380 --> 24:32.940
past when you write to me I know

24:30.780 --> 24:34.890
everything about you did I ever mention

24:32.940 --> 24:36.960
those things to you at all then why

24:34.890 --> 24:39.030
should you say things of the past I have

24:36.960 --> 24:41.130
heard these things people just rake it

24:39.030 --> 24:43.500
up and flung it back

24:41.130 --> 24:45.310
I've heard this kind of thing that you

24:43.500 --> 24:49.710
bring it on other people is on

24:45.310 --> 24:52.530
one should be very gracious many time

24:49.710 --> 25:01.750
and understand that everybody has

24:52.530 --> 25:05.980
tremendous potential respect yourself

25:01.750 --> 25:08.620
and respect others I hope now you won't

25:05.980 --> 25:11.200
have problem of collectivity after this

25:08.620 --> 25:12.940
lecture and if you are you can listen to

25:11.200 --> 25:16.750
this lecture again and again and my

25:12.940 --> 25:19.450
special humble request there try to come

25:16.750 --> 25:25.660
down your angles automatically other

25:19.450 --> 25:28.480
angles will come down but if it is a non

25:25.660 --> 25:31.120
surgery then you all should fight it

25:28.480 --> 25:33.910
together won't you join together if it's

25:31.120 --> 25:34.920
a nine century nobody dare touch you or

25:33.910 --> 25:38.920
trouble you

25:34.920 --> 25:47.200
those days are corner none of you will

25:38.920 --> 25:49.390
be drawn these are all satanic forces

25:47.200 --> 25:52.210
and they can work through yours we must

25:49.390 --> 25:54.640
know when they give you such ideas to

25:52.210 --> 25:59.460
fight and to quarrel understand that

25:54.640 --> 26:02.590
this is anti God you are doing horrible

25:59.460 --> 26:06.520
you have to move towards more

26:02.590 --> 26:09.850
understanding more coordination because

26:06.520 --> 26:12.250
this is such a tremendous book and of

26:09.850 --> 26:15.420
such a sublime nature and we have to be

26:12.250 --> 26:15.420
supplying ourselves

26:18.769 --> 26:26.190
all right now is there any other

26:21.029 --> 26:28.049
question with a very nice suggestion but

26:26.190 --> 26:31.399
don't give me such big suggestions that

26:28.049 --> 26:31.399
I have to speak for half an hour

26:51.620 --> 26:57.080
I'll say I just want to get even

27:00.030 --> 27:21.060
you come here and tell people no no she

27:18.570 --> 27:23.220
said that when collectively sahaja

27:21.060 --> 27:27.270
Yogi's become one that those who are not

27:23.220 --> 27:29.760
so lonely and isolated he stops you see

27:27.270 --> 27:32.820
sahaja Yogi's have to be strong enough

27:29.760 --> 27:36.810
not to eat like that there are people

27:32.820 --> 27:37.710
say who are in the water and some people

27:36.810 --> 27:40.320
are at the board

27:37.710 --> 27:43.200
all right now the people who are in the

27:40.320 --> 27:46.260
boat are in the boat so they are in a

27:43.200 --> 27:47.820
way different from the people who are in

27:46.260 --> 27:50.010
the water that's the situation

27:47.820 --> 27:51.840
all right now the people in the boat

27:50.010 --> 27:55.230
have to save the people who are in the

27:51.840 --> 27:57.060
hope in the in the water right so what I

27:55.230 --> 28:00.210
am saying that those who are on the boat

27:57.060 --> 28:01.890
must first of all be united and then

28:00.210 --> 28:03.810
with full strength will them on why this

28:01.890 --> 28:07.950
collectivity is just to pull out the

28:03.810 --> 28:12.390
rest of them this collectivity is just

28:07.950 --> 28:16.170
to achieve their emancipation their

28:12.390 --> 28:17.940
realization all right it doesn't mean

28:16.170 --> 28:21.240
that is they should exclude that to be

28:17.940 --> 28:24.050
the whole collectivity is to bring those

28:21.240 --> 28:27.570
people are but you see there are what so

28:24.050 --> 28:29.490
anti-god activities going on as well you

28:27.570 --> 28:32.600
know that for example there's a guru who

28:29.490 --> 28:35.000
makes lots of fun right and he has

28:32.600 --> 28:37.400
destroyed many people now they

28:35.000 --> 28:40.039
to me and they're saying so he may send

28:37.400 --> 28:42.590
somebody here paid for a job just to

28:40.039 --> 28:44.450
disturb us then the duty of all the

28:42.590 --> 28:46.309
sahaja Yogi's to get together and see

28:44.450 --> 28:48.679
that you tell him that you see now you

28:46.309 --> 28:51.200
are doing wrong guru has done wrong to

28:48.679 --> 28:53.179
us and he's going to do wrong to others

28:51.200 --> 28:55.970
why do join me that on that point

28:53.179 --> 28:58.309
everybody should be one but if they are

28:55.970 --> 29:00.799
not strong and if they are not one they

28:58.309 --> 29:03.280
cannot pull out of us you see my point

29:00.799 --> 29:08.179
is like not to exclude ease all

29:03.280 --> 29:17.270
collectivity is to include everybody all

29:08.179 --> 29:19.669
right I mean to say there is no

29:17.270 --> 29:26.470
specialization in sahaja yoga in simple

29:19.669 --> 29:26.470
words everybody is a doctor of em

29:40.830 --> 29:48.770
I mean to say that all the sahaja Yogi's

29:43.050 --> 29:52.230
must form a strong by which they achieve

29:48.770 --> 29:55.350
enlargement of sahaja yoga getting more

29:52.230 --> 29:59.670
people into such more people benefited

29:55.350 --> 30:01.980
by sahaja yoga all right well anyway

29:59.670 --> 30:04.140
have seen wherever there is connectivity

30:01.980 --> 30:08.930
like I would say Australia has the

30:04.140 --> 30:11.460
maximum collected or India positive but

30:08.930 --> 30:13.590
Australia in all the European countries

30:11.460 --> 30:16.440
on to the western-style communities

30:13.590 --> 30:19.470
Australia has the maximum connectivity

30:16.440 --> 30:23.130
and there achieve the maximum results

30:19.470 --> 30:27.210
only in Sydney today only one had told

30:23.130 --> 30:31.830
me that the halls like this get packed

30:27.210 --> 30:34.800
for programs very well there is no hope

30:31.830 --> 30:37.200
for new people who are coming and it's

30:34.800 --> 30:39.570
such a big company I am amazed I mean

30:37.200 --> 30:42.420
how many must be going there and it is

30:39.570 --> 30:44.640
because of collectivity and as soon as I

30:42.420 --> 30:47.040
went there it started gathering enough

30:44.640 --> 30:49.500
but before that the people were fighting

30:47.040 --> 30:51.270
among themselves and many people ran

30:49.500 --> 30:52.650
away from sahaja yoga because they

30:51.270 --> 30:57.110
thought these people are fighting what

30:52.650 --> 31:00.510
are going to give us maximum using

30:57.110 --> 31:04.500
Australia IT and is Austria is having

31:00.510 --> 31:07.350
some problem then I as soon as the

31:04.500 --> 31:09.930
problem came in the whole thing became a

31:07.350 --> 31:12.540
very small group again that problem is

31:09.930 --> 31:14.550
over now positivity has come the people

31:12.540 --> 31:21.150
have joined together again it has been

31:14.550 --> 31:23.160
nice it happens here was a TLC why

31:21.150 --> 31:27.020
Labour Party lost if they had not

31:23.160 --> 31:27.020
followed they would not have been so bad

31:28.450 --> 31:33.820
he's acted simple a simple equation

31:34.659 --> 31:37.869
united we stand
