00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.600
Beautiful!
So beautiful it is!

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.520
Wow, it’s so nice.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.320
How are you?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.080
May God bless you all.
May God bless you.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.240
So…

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.640
Hello!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080
Actually it was to start
at eleven

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.080
because my watch
was one hour before.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.640
Poor thing, then she had to prepare
something,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.760
and it took exactly so much time.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.920
So I think we are quite in time
for everything.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
Thank you.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.920
Put the flowers here,
will be a good idea.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
Hallo!

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.080
Hallo, how are you?
Huh? Good.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Please, please, be seated.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.960
I think, Nick, you’ll have to come
to Houston, if you don’t mind.
All right?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.520
We’ll get you the ticket
and you come along
to Houston with us,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.080
because this thing
has to be handled now further on, eh?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.960
YOGI: I’m very lucky, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Come forward.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.040
Keep the door open,
I think will be a good idea.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.040
It’s just the door, keep side open,
will be actually a good idea.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240
With the door open it should act.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.040
First time when I came
to United States,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.080
I came to Los Angeles first.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.360
Because it’s a place of angels.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.680
Actually, I thought

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.720
that it must be a very holy place
to come down first of all

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.480
in this great land
of United States.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.760
Now, as you know that United States —
or America, the whole of it —

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.920
is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.120
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.520
So, the central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.400
is United States.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.080
The central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.000
is governed by Shri Krishna.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.760
And His power is Radha.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.080
Ra-dha. “Ra” means “energy”,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.920
“dha” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.360
Ra-dha. Dha-re-ti-sa.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.600
So She is the one
who has sustained the energy,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.160
and so She is called as Radha.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.120
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.360
The word Krishna comes
from the word <i>krishi</i>,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.400
means “the ploughing”,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.200
or you can say, agriculture
is called as <i>krishi</i>.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.920
The one who ploughs

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.720
and puts the seed in the soil
is doing the <i>krishi</i>.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.080
And that’s why He is called
as Krishna.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.720
Now, the seed that He has sown

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.920
is the seed of spirituality.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.280
It is Shri Krishna
who said, in Sanskrit:

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.600
“<i>Nainam chhindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah</i>

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.160
<i>na chainam kledayantyapo
na shoshayati marutah</i>”
(Bhagavad Gita, Ch. II, V. 23),

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.360
meaning it cannot be —
means the spiritual life,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.720
or you can say, the eternal life,
or the Spirit —

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.880
cannot be killed by anything,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.040
by any weapon,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.400
neither can be blown away by air,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.720
nor can it be sucked in,
nor can it be destroyed.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.040
So, to prove that,
Christ came on this earth,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.480
and through His resurrection
He proved what Shri Krishna had said.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.040
And most of you Sahaja yogis
know the relationship

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.440
of Christ and Shri Krishna,
why He was called Christ.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.440
Christ word comes
from the same — <i>krishi</i>.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.600
And His first name comes
from the word Yashoda.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.880
Yashoda is also called
as Jesu or Yesu,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.080
and that’s why

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.400
Christ was called
as Jesu or Yesu.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.520
Some people call Him Yesu,
and some people call Him as Jesu,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.440
because of Yashoda, the mother,
foster mother of Shri Krishna.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.680
Also, you know that Radha
was the same as Mahalakshmi,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.880
so She was the same
as the mother of Christ, Mary.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.800
These, all these things,
we can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.040
Because when the Kundalini
moves up to the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.600
and if it stops there,
you can ask the question:

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.200
“Was Krishna the son
of Mother Mary—

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.880
was Jesus the son
of Mother Mary?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.080
Was the son of Ra— was [Mary]
the same as Radha?”,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.560
and then the Kundalini moves.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.560
So Sahaja Yoga today is the thing

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.200
which proves
what has been said so far.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.520
It proves. It’s not
just a cock-and-bull story.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.600
Because people do not believe
into all these things.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.400
They think that it’s all
cock-and-bull story:

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.800
who was Christ, who was Krishna,
who was Radha…
after all, there was no God.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.160
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.400
we can prove it,
that what we say is the truth.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:33.040
Because, as through Realisation,
you get connected to the mains.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.360
Your vibrations start flowing.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.400
Like the computer,
you start working.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.240
And whatever question you ask,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.120
answer comes to you
as tremendous vibrations,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.000
or it stops, or you might get heat,
or you might get blisters…

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.840
So the whole message
is communicated to you

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.040
through your fingertips.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.920
As Mohammed Saheb
has very clearly said

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.120
that “At the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.”

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.000
But the Muslims do not want
to talk about resurrection at all.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.720
Because they want to frighten
people with the doomsday.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.120
They don’t want to talk
about the resurrection time,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.080
which is going to come,
which is the intermediary time.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.960
Because they want
to use the time

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.360
which will frighten people,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.640
by saying that “Now your doomsday
is coming!”

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.000
“Now your doomsday is coming” —
so everybody is frightened about God,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.680
and they think that “Now we should
just wait for our doom,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.720
nothing else is in between.”

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.960
So this is how the Vishuddhi Chakra
is a special one.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:46.160
Now, Vishuddhi Chakra
was created on the Saturday.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.800
So it is the Saturn —

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.600
that’s the important star
of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.400
So, whenever the Saturn
is at the highest,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.960
America will be in a better place
to do things.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.160
But I don’t think they know much
about themselves.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.440
They don’t know what they are,
why they are on this earth,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.360
what is their work,
what they are supposed to do,

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.360
or what is the purpose of God
of creating America.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.640
The first job
of the Vishuddhi Chakra within us

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.480
was that when we became
human beings,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.320
we raised our heads up like that.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.800
When you raise your head up like that,
you have become a human being,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.880
in the sense that now
there is a new movement

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.760
in your consciousness.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.800
Now, the new movement
in your consciousness

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.080
started about six thousand
years back

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.320
when Shri Krishna came
on this earth.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.480
That the new movement was
that it is the Father,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.280
the advent of the Father
was celebrated.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.680
And that’s how people developed

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.880
a kind of a new instrument
within themselves called ego.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.080
When the brain
was lifted like this, you see,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.680
it expanded in a pyramidical…

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.120
it’s a pyramid,
it became a pyramid.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.600
In an animal, the brain is flat.
And gradually, it rises.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.400
When the head was raised,
when the responsibility was taken
of raising the head,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.440
the brain started growing
in such a way

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.880
that it became a pyramid.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.280
And when it became a pyramid,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.560
the attention became
a different attention

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.720
from that of animal.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.200
Because when the waves
of your consciousness

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.120
fell on the sides of the pyramid,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.800
they went into the parallelogram
of forces,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.840
by which the resultant force —

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.440
the resultant force —
now, it falls like this,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.800
goes like that,
the resultant force is like that —

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.640
had two sides: one was this,
another was this.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.800
So the consciousness,
or we can say, the attention,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.160
instead of going inside,
started going out.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.480
So one part of the resultant
was going outside,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.840
and that’s how,
when you became a human being,

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040
your attention went outside.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.840
It’s the human beings only
who have their attention outside.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.880
Not that the animals don’t have,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.680
but the attention
of human beings are such

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.680
that they create reactions.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.280
Like, you see something.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.760
Now, I see doctor’s house there,
for example.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.920
Then a reaction starts
in my mind:

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.680
What is this?…
What does this mean?…

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.720
How much it must have cost?…
From where did he buy it?…

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.680
Anything you see,
it starts giving you a reaction.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.120
Not to the animals.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.800
Animals, at the most
they will say, “This I must eat.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.800
That I must eat.
That I must get.”

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.920
But they do not think about it.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.080
It’s only the human beings
who reflect.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.920
And this reflection comes
because of the pyramid-like structure

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.560
of the brain.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.280
And this has a special reaction
in the brain itself,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.520
that we start developing
our own ego,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.280
our own myths,
our own mental projections.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.720
And when we develop
our own mental projections,

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.320
this ego starts developing:
“I know,” “What’s wrong?” —

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.560
all these nonsensical
things come.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.400
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.000
It starts pushing the other balloon
which was within us —

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.160
is of the superego —
as an animal,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.880
and then comes up in the centre.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.440
That’s how we now become
normal human beings.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.720
But then we start
increasing our ego.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:03.000
It starts overlapping
the superego,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.440
and a calcification takes place,
by which we develop our “I-ness”.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.200
So it is all the happening
that takes place

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.240
after we have lifted our head,
raised our head,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.400
and we are no more like animals.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.440
So, Vishuddhi Chakra

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.840
has a very big part to play
in the human evolution —

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.360
that by developing
your Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.280
you have become
human beings, first of all.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:41.520
Secondly, because it is
the chakra of the Father,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.440
who becomes again
the primordial…

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.160
as you call it in…

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.200
(Shri Mataji says
several words in Marathi)…

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.560
macrocosm,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.240
you become the macrocosm.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.120
You are the microcosm,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.560
and the Father is the macrocosm.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.880
So you become that
because of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.280
which is governed
by Shri Krishna,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.560
who becomes that macrocosm
called as Virat.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.400
In the brain it is expressed
in this part,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.920
in this part of the head.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.080
It is here

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.080
that you start manifesting
your macrocosm qualities.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.800
At this point.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.680
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra
has a speciality —

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.720
is that we always say,
“The responsibility on my shoulders.”

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.560
Always we say, “The responsibilities
are on my shoulders.”

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.320
The reason is,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.760
the Vishuddhi Chakra gives you
the sense of responsibility.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.400
And that’s why, you know,
the Americans feel responsible
for the whole world.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.600
Naturally.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.800
It’s perfectly understood

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.840
that they feel responsible
for the whole world.

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:10.920
But how much they are aware
of their role

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.800
as the responsible people,
that’s a different point.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.800
But they feel
they are responsible.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.680
But their role as responsible people
if they understand,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.880
then they have to be ideals!

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.280
Ideals!

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.080
Because a person who is
the responsible person in a family

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.920
has to be the ideal for others.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.920
It started very well, I should say,
at the time of Abraham Lincoln.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.600
It started very well.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.800
When you started talking
about democracy, is also…

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.840
democracy is nothing
but collectivity.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.120
He started talking about collectivity
“of the people, by the people”
(Gettysburg Address).

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.000
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.720
started coming right
in this Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.520
But then,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.440
the people who are in the centre

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.720
can only remain normal.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.760
But those who bend too much,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.680
or who bend backward too much,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.080
both suffer from problems.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.160
The ones who bend forward
to others are the people

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.040
who get their superego.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.280
They get over-humbled down,
like developing countries are.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.440
And those who bend backward
are the people

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.160
who try to dominate others,

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.520
who have ego.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.200
So, because of sudden
blessings of God,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.840
they discovered so many things.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.760
The ego started developing
in America too much.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.160
But ego is like a balloon,
as I told you,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.640
and keeps you floating
in the air.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.400
And when you are in the air,
you become shallow people.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.600
You have no moorings.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.840
But it has one more advantage.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.400
If you knew you are floating
in the air,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.000
you can have a complete
comprehensive view,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.600
complete vision of the whole —

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:19.800
if your eyes are pure
and your intentions are clear-cut.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:26.160
Now, the another thing
that happened by their coming here

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.160
was the problem

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.280
that they felt that “We are
a very new nation.”

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.280
It has an advantage,
as well as it has a disadvantage.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.680
To advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.760
because you can be transformed
into something better very easily

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.160
because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.480
You are very clean,

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.520
absolutely ready
to become something great.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.360
Or else, can be a possibility
that you are so new

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.160
that you are awed
by everything that is old,

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.560
which is very true
about Americans,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.160
that they bought
all the old bridges from England

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.800
to bring them down here.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.240
And the cravings about the old
is too much here.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.880
And that as if whatever is new
is all absurd.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.080
So maybe even Sahaja Yoga
may be an absurd thing for them.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.680
Because, according to them,
this is something new.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.360
Because they are new nations,

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.360
they have started discarding
all that is new.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.720
Is an absurd thing.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.320
Now, we must say
that Sahaja Yoga, as it is today,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.960
is the most ancient thing.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.320
It started with the universe,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.720
and now the culmination point
has come.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.480
Because it is a living process.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.040
As you see a flower on the tree,
so you’d say, “First new flower.”

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.560
But the flower
has come out of a seed,

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.680
which has got the roots;
then it became the trunk;

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.720
then it became the leaves;

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.600
and then it has now become
a flower.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:17.480
So, though it looks a new flower,
it has a big heritage.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:23.120
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga
is as ancient as this universe is.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:29.320
But to people who have
such a hankering for traditionalism,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.840
find it difficult to find out
what is real tradition.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.280
Only those who are traditional people
can know what is real tradition.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.600
Last time I came here in America
and I was shocked:

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.200
that a person came
to interview Me,

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:49.680
and when he was talking,
he asked about one gentleman

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.040
who was most untraditional
from Indian point of view.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.600
His name was
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
(well-known Indian religious figure).

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.800
He married a woman
and made her a “Mother”
(Ramakrishna declared his wife
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother).

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.320
I mean, it’s… nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.
Krishna has not done it.

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.760
An absurd stuff!

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.760
But for them,
he was the most traditional man.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.440
And he told Me that “Mother,
your Sahaja Yoga is not traditional

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.920
if you don’t believe
in Ramakrishna.”

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:18.280
Last fifty-sixty years, all such
neo-traditional people came up.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.320
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow
(Aurobindo, whose ashram
is situated in Pondicherry).

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.000
Another absurd situation.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.720
He called this woman a “Mother”
(Aurobindo declared Mirra Alfassa
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother),

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.920
and his relation with her
is ambiguous.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.200
You don’t know
what relationship they had.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.520
I mean, that is something,
in Indian tradition…

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.360
is an impossible situation.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.320
You have to have clear-cut
relationship with everyone,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.240
you cannot have ambiguous.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.880
Neither a friend, nor a wife,
nor a mother or a sister…

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.760
That kind of a situation
is most untraditional.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.200
Is never thought of.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.520
I mean, you Indians can know
this is not possible.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.640
This is an absurd situation.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.200
But for some people,
he is traditional.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.200
What happened
about sixty years back —

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.480
I think, about the time
of My birth only —

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.200
the negativity started taking
a new form

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.720
in understanding
the western confusion.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.200
They are all westernised,
if you see them.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.320
And the western confusion
they took over

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.720
for their own advantages.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.480
They used it
for their own advantages.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:27.320
And this is where the western people
have failed to make them out.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.440
The other day,
at the Jungian place,

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:37.680
I was to talk to Jung people
about Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.840
Now, Jung, I came to know
only when he died,

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.400
because there was a little article
about him.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.400
I never studied psychology.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.560
Of course, I tried to learn
some vocabulary to talk to them.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.640
Sometimes, I thought,
I may have to talk to them also.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.680
But these Jungians,
all very intellectuals and great people

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.320
sitting before Me, you see.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.520
About a hundred of them,
[and] the President
of American Jungian Society.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.720
I’d just gone through a book,
just before starting it,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.240
and I saw some diagram
which really puzzled Me.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.200
The first conception they had…

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.280
Of course, it’s all a mental
conception of Jung.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.120
I don’t blame him,
because he got Realisation

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.520
but he did not know
how the state was created,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.240
what was the framework
of the state,

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.000
and his movement
was still of a seeker

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.440
to find out how he got
his Realisation.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.480
And all movements were linear,

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.320
they were not expanding
from one point all over.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.680
So it was not so integrated.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.640
Now, the thing they showed was

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.080
that at the bottom of it
was the unconscious

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.960
which is never going
to be conscious;

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.680
on top of that was the conscious…
unconscious that can be conscious;

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.240
then, there was subconscious;
and on top of that was the ego.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.080
I mean, what a mess of a thing
it was, I tell you.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.840
I told them, see, now, the word
“unconscious” itself is confusing.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.720
What do you mean
by “unconscious”?

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.600
Whatever you don’t feel
on your central nervous system
is unconscious, all right.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.960
But what does that mean?

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:11.480
We don’t feel the subconscious —

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.920
then subconscious is also
unconscious.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.200
Whatever we don’t feel —
for example, there are certain sounds

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.440
of certain frequencies
we don’t hear at all.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.280
We hear whatever is tolerable
to us as human beings.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.440
That you all scientists know.
We don’t hear everything.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.840
So, all that is unconscious —
means it’s a mixed bag,

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.280
all sorts of things
mixed up together.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.640
But God is not a hotchpotch
person, you see.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.320
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.600
He knows what He is doing,
He is the greatest organiser.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.400
And how can He put you
into a bag like that —

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.400
that the unconscious is below;

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.960
then on top of it is the unconscious
that is going to be conscious;

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.960
on top of it is the subconscious;

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.720
on top of [it is] the consciousness;
on top of that, the ego!

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.040
So you go down
carrying all this inside you,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.480
and where do you go?

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.040
Now, how do you go?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.400
So the first mistake was

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.040
that there are layers
one on top of other.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.480
It’s not so.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.000
They are placed vertically!

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.840
The ego is on the right-hand side,
and superego, on the left-hand side.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.680
The future, on the right-hand side,
and the past, on the left-hand side.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.280
So, the subconscious,
on the left-hand side,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.840
and the supraconscious,
on the right-hand side.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.080
And the central path
is kept clear-cut.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.960
I mean, in any organisation…

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.640
say, if you go to the airport,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.720
do you have like this
that you have to pass
through the walls

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.800
to go to the aeroplane?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.480
If we human beings don’t commit
such horrible mistakes,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.200
how can God commit
such a mistake?

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.480
So it was absolutely wrong
to think that way.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.640
So, the central path is
in the centre,

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.000
while the right side is
on the right side,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.240
and the left side
on the left side.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:09.320
And you don’t have to go
to the subconscious at all!

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.520
Because they justified
all these people

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.720
who are trying
to make them hypnosis,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.320
or they are trying
to hypnotise them

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.360
or to give them a new type of a…
sort of an experience.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.560
“All that was unconscious,
we should accept that.”

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.440
Even some people,
if they start suddenly jumping,
they say, “Oh, it’s great!”

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.680
So the sensations that you get

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.080
from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.080
were accepted
as something great.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.440
It was a confusion
of your intellectuals, I should say.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640
Complete.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.000
But it is not so.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.080
Your path is straightforward.
Absolutely for Kundalini.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.120
Only thing, the one who has to raise it
had to come, that’s all.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.600
But otherwise,
it’s all very well,

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:57.120
and there is no need for you
to get into that horrible subconscious.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.280
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said, “Mother, it is so simple!”

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.680
I said, “It’s very simple.
Your unconscious is divided into four.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.560
One is the collective
subconscious,

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.760
one is the collective
supraconscious,

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.920
one is, you can say,
the collective hell,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:19.120
and on top is the super-collective
consciousness.

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.800
So, where do we have to go?
We should know our destination.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.160
Then, we have to reach it.”

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.040
And that is how the problem
of all these people

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480
getting entangled with Muktanand
(founder of Siddha Yoga).

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.920
Yesterday they asked Me a question,
“What’s wrong with Muktanand?
Why is he so dangerous?”

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.400
One lady, poor thing,
as sahaj would have it,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.560
she came, she said,
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back,
and I’m finished once and for all.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.640
He is such a dangerous man!
He flattered me,

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.080
I went there, and I don’t know
what has happened to my back.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.600
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes
in one place, I have to get up.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.960
And I have a vibrator,
I have to always put it…” — like that.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.160
So I said, “See. The dangers.”

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:03.400
Then the another theory they started
that we must suffer
if we are to go to God. Why?

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.560
I mean, that’s not God’s idea
by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.560
He made Christ suffer for you.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.040
Finished now, now you better not suffer.
There’s no need to suffer at all.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:18.480
So, all these ideas penetrated
into these western people.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.520
And this mental projection
they accepted

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.680
without even understanding
what is written in other books.
We should see.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.560
And they could only go
as far as those sixty years

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.400
when these horrible people

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.320
who went to India, very shallow people,
they saw some of these tantric books,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.520
because they wanted to justify Freud
through Indian culture.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.400
So they got the tantrikas,
erotic things and all that

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.880
and brought these books.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.320
And some of them read
I don’t know what books,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.440
to say that Kundalini [is]
in the stomach;
somebody says, in the brain…

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.320
I mean, they don’t know
where the Kundalini is.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.080
And they are writing
such big, big books.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.560
Can you imagine?
Such big, big books they have written!

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.240
Now, when the books are written,
every book is not a scripture.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.040
But to them, if it is written
in the book, you see, it’s a scripture.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:06.360
And that’s how the whole confusion
started going on.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.320
So these people came down,
took full advantage of it,

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.800
and now they have become
“great gurus”

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.360
with lot of money.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.160
Rich people.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.080
But now,
as the hand of God is great,

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:27.560
one by one they are getting out

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.920
of the heads of these people.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.360
And now I hope a day will come

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.920
when people will see
the light through.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.720
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is
to establish the truth within yourself.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.400
It is not that we can have
a membership.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.680
We cannot have a person
enrol into it.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:54.600
We cannot call them
as branded Sahaja yogis.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.760
It’s the growth of the person
that is to be seen.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.320
Now, there are so many lectures
which I have given

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.520
about <i>ritambhara pragnya</i>
and all those things,

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.440
and I think for every Sahaja yogi
it is necessary

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.480
to listen to those lectures,

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:13.400
go through it, understand them,
and to meditate, so that you grow.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.120
Because it’s not a plastic thing
that we can create.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.280
It’s a living process

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.440
of the living energy
of the living God.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.480
And so, it has to grow
within you.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.120
By thinking
you cannot make it grow,

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.840
but by not thinking
you allow it to grow more and more.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.800
As it starts growing within you,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.800
then only you realise
that what you are.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.600
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super-consciousness

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.920
and establish yourself there.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.000
Then only you will know
what I am talking about.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.600
Now, today’s puja
is another thing.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.560
Now, what is a puja?

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.680
Can you people say
what’s a puja is?

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.880
Actually, yesterday I had a puja…

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.440
and it’s not easy for Me to bear
the pujas, to be very frank, you know.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.960
Because the vibrations are so much
that… I don’t know…

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.400
And then I went to the airport;
two hours, we took out the vibrations

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.040
and put them
for all the New York airport.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.480
It was necessary.
It worked out.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.000
Because vibrations start flowing
with tremendous force,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.360
and if you people
do not absorb it,

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.000
it takes time for it to ooze out
from My body.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.120
Makes Me rather heavy with it.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:32.840
But then it oozes out,
I feel better…

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.880
And only thing that happens
by saying the mantras —

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.960
that you awaken the deities
within yourself

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.000
and start receiving
the vibrations.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.200
And when your deities
are awakened,

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.480
they are awakened through the power
of the deities within Me —

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.600
they have to work very hard
to do that,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.280
and that’s how they emit
too much vibrations,

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.240
which must be absorbed by you
when your deities are awakened.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.080
That’s how it works.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.400
You cannot describe it in words,
you cannot tell it in words.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.840
It’s a happening
that has to take place.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.400
Many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga first

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.040
can go little bit like that
in the beginning.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.120
Gradually they settle down,

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.720
come round, grow into it —
then it becomes all right.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.320
Some people just shoot off
in one day, and they are there.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.520
Makes no difference whatsoever.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.400
Because it’s a growing thing
and it has to grow.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.720
With some people,
the land is so fertile,

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.520
or maybe something,
that it just works out fast.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.720
So, nobody should blame anyone.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.880
And specially,
one should not feel guilty,

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.640
because that’s the Vishuddhi
on the left-hand side.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.280
Specially for America,
I am wearing this stone,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.800
which is called
as the black sapphire.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.920
Because this is the stone
of Shri Krishna.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.880
It’s the stone
of Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.360
Every chakra has a stone,

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.520
and this is the stone
of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.800
so I am wearing this,
just for coming to America.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.280
And I hope that today’s worship

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:14.400
will bring out the potential
of this country

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.600
by exciting the deities,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.400
Shri Krishna himself,
who is in charge,

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.320
by pleasing Him,
by making Him active.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.880
And He has great qualities,

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.440
and one of the greatest
qualities He has — that He has
the <i>samhara shakti</i>,

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.880
by which He can kill the demons.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.440
And all those demons
who are settled down here

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.720
are really mistaken.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.720
Because if this is the place
of Shri Krishna,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.800
they are very dangerously placed.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.160
Because once He is awakened here,
they all will be completely finished

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.000
through His Sudarshan Chakra,
which He has in His hand,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.880
and He can just kill them
one by one.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.560
But first, He is to be pleased,
and He is to be awakened.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.160
He has to be…
<i>prasanna</i>, that’s the word.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.040
<i>Prasanna</i> means “to be pleased”.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.680
And then, it works out.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.280
So today first we’ll have
Ganesha’s puja, little bit,

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:17.400
because Ganesha’s puja is meant
just to establish the innocence,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.080
the innocence of the place.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.600
Once the innocence is established —
that’s the most important,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.280
that’s the essence of everything,
Ganesha is the essence! —

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.520
and then we’ll have
Shri Krishna puja,

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.920
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.080
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas,
one after another,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.240
but a short time every time.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.440
All right?
