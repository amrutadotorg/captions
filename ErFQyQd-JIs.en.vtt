00:09.080 --> 00:13.600
Beautiful!
So beautiful it is!

00:18.520 --> 00:21.520
Wow, it’s so nice.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.320
How are you?

00:25.520 --> 00:29.080
May God bless you all.
May God bless you.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.240
So…

00:31.440 --> 00:33.640
Hello!

00:33.840 --> 00:36.080
Actually it was to start
at eleven

00:36.280 --> 00:40.080
because my watch
was one hour before.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.640
Poor thing, then she had to prepare
something,

00:42.840 --> 00:44.760
and it took exactly so much time.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.920
So I think we are quite in time
for everything.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.120
Thank you.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.920
Put the flowers here,
will be a good idea.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.360
Hallo!

01:32.560 --> 01:37.080
Hallo, how are you?
Huh? Good.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Please, please, be seated.

01:50.040 --> 01:55.960
I think, Nick, you’ll have to come
to Houston, if you don’t mind.
All right?

01:56.160 --> 01:59.520
We’ll get you the ticket
and you come along
to Houston with us,

01:59.720 --> 02:05.080
because this thing
has to be handled now further on, eh?

02:05.280 --> 02:08.960
YOGI: I’m very lucky, Mother.
SHRI MATAJI: May God bless you.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.200
Come forward.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.040
Keep the door open,
I think will be a good idea.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.040
It’s just the door, keep side open,
will be actually a good idea.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.240
With the door open it should act.

05:03.640 --> 05:07.040
First time when I came
to United States,

05:07.240 --> 05:10.080
I came to Los Angeles first.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.360
Because it’s a place of angels.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.680
Actually, I thought

05:14.880 --> 05:20.720
that it must be a very holy place
to come down first of all

05:20.920 --> 05:26.480
in this great land
of United States.

05:26.680 --> 05:31.760
Now, as you know that United States —
or America, the whole of it —

05:31.960 --> 05:34.920
is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

05:35.120 --> 05:41.120
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi Chakra.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.520
So, the central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

05:47.720 --> 05:50.400
is United States.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.080
The central part
of the Vishuddhi Chakra

05:53.280 --> 05:57.000
is governed by Shri Krishna.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.760
And His power is Radha.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.080
Ra-dha. “Ra” means “energy”,

06:03.280 --> 06:07.920
“dha” is the one
who has sustained the energy.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.360
Ra-dha. Dha-re-ti-sa.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.600
So She is the one
who has sustained the energy,

06:16.680 --> 06:19.160
and so She is called as Radha.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.120
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.360
The word Krishna comes
from the word <i>krishi</i>,

06:25.560 --> 06:28.400
means “the ploughing”,

06:28.600 --> 06:33.200
or you can say, agriculture
is called as <i>krishi</i>.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.920
The one who ploughs

06:36.120 --> 06:41.720
and puts the seed in the soil
is doing the <i>krishi</i>.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.080
And that’s why He is called
as Krishna.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.720
Now, the seed that He has sown

06:49.920 --> 06:55.920
is the seed of spirituality.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.280
It is Shri Krishna
who said, in Sanskrit:

07:00.480 --> 07:04.600
“<i>Nainam chhindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah</i>

07:04.800 --> 07:10.160
<i>na chainam kledayantyapo
na shoshayati marutah</i>”
(Bhagavad Gita, Ch. II, V. 23),

07:10.360 --> 07:14.360
meaning it cannot be —
means the spiritual life,

07:14.560 --> 07:18.720
or you can say, the eternal life,
or the Spirit —

07:18.920 --> 07:21.880
cannot be killed by anything,

07:22.080 --> 07:24.040
by any weapon,

07:24.240 --> 07:27.400
neither can be blown away by air,

07:27.600 --> 07:32.720
nor can it be sucked in,
nor can it be destroyed.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.040
So, to prove that,
Christ came on this earth,

07:36.240 --> 07:41.480
and through His resurrection
He proved what Shri Krishna had said.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.040
And most of you Sahaja yogis
know the relationship

07:45.240 --> 07:48.440
of Christ and Shri Krishna,
why He was called Christ.

07:48.640 --> 07:52.440
Christ word comes
from the same — <i>krishi</i>.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.600
And His first name comes
from the word Yashoda.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.880
Yashoda is also called
as Jesu or Yesu,

08:01.080 --> 08:04.080
and that’s why

08:06.480 --> 08:10.400
Christ was called
as Jesu or Yesu.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.520
Some people call Him Yesu,
and some people call Him as Jesu,

08:13.720 --> 08:18.440
because of Yashoda, the mother,
foster mother of Shri Krishna.

08:19.680 --> 08:23.680
Also, you know that Radha
was the same as Mahalakshmi,

08:23.880 --> 08:29.880
so She was the same
as the mother of Christ, Mary.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.800
These, all these things,
we can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.040
Because when the Kundalini
moves up to the Vishuddhi Chakra

08:40.240 --> 08:43.600
and if it stops there,
you can ask the question:

08:43.800 --> 08:47.200
“Was Krishna the son
of Mother Mary—

08:47.400 --> 08:51.880
was Jesus the son
of Mother Mary?

08:52.080 --> 08:58.080
Was the son of Ra— was [Mary]
the same as Radha?”,

08:59.680 --> 09:01.560
and then the Kundalini moves.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.560
So Sahaja Yoga today is the thing

09:04.760 --> 09:07.200
which proves
what has been said so far.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.520
It proves. It’s not
just a cock-and-bull story.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.600
Because people do not believe
into all these things.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.400
They think that it’s all
cock-and-bull story:

09:16.600 --> 09:20.800
who was Christ, who was Krishna,
who was Radha…
after all, there was no God.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.160
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today,

09:23.360 --> 09:27.400
we can prove it,
that what we say is the truth.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.040
Because, as through Realisation,
you get connected to the mains.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.360
Your vibrations start flowing.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.400
Like the computer,
you start working.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.240
And whatever question you ask,

09:43.440 --> 09:46.120
answer comes to you
as tremendous vibrations,

09:46.320 --> 09:50.000
or it stops, or you might get heat,
or you might get blisters…

09:50.200 --> 09:53.840
So the whole message
is communicated to you

09:54.040 --> 09:57.040
through your fingertips.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.920
As Mohammed Saheb
has very clearly said

10:00.120 --> 10:05.120
that “At the time of resurrection,
your hands will speak.”

10:05.320 --> 10:09.000
But the Muslims do not want
to talk about resurrection at all.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.720
Because they want to frighten
people with the doomsday.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.120
They don’t want to talk
about the resurrection time,

10:15.320 --> 10:18.080
which is going to come,
which is the intermediary time.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.960
Because they want
to use the time

10:21.160 --> 10:23.360
which will frighten people,

10:23.560 --> 10:26.640
by saying that “Now your doomsday
is coming!”

10:26.840 --> 10:30.000
“Now your doomsday is coming” —
so everybody is frightened about God,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.680
and they think that “Now we should
just wait for our doom,

10:32.880 --> 10:35.720
nothing else is in between.”

10:35.920 --> 10:39.960
So this is how the Vishuddhi Chakra
is a special one.

10:40.160 --> 10:46.160
Now, Vishuddhi Chakra
was created on the Saturday.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.800
So it is the Saturn —

10:49.000 --> 10:52.600
that’s the important star
of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.400
So, whenever the Saturn
is at the highest,

10:55.600 --> 10:58.960
America will be in a better place
to do things.

10:59.160 --> 11:05.160
But I don’t think they know much
about themselves.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.440
They don’t know what they are,
why they are on this earth,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.360
what is their work,
what they are supposed to do,

11:11.560 --> 11:16.360
or what is the purpose of God
of creating America.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.640
The first job
of the Vishuddhi Chakra within us

11:21.840 --> 11:24.480
was that when we became
human beings,

11:24.680 --> 11:27.320
we raised our heads up like that.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.800
When you raise your head up like that,
you have become a human being,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.880
in the sense that now
there is a new movement

11:36.080 --> 11:37.760
in your consciousness.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.800
Now, the new movement
in your consciousness

11:41.000 --> 11:44.080
started about six thousand
years back

11:44.280 --> 11:47.320
when Shri Krishna came
on this earth.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.480
That the new movement was
that it is the Father,

11:51.680 --> 11:55.280
the advent of the Father
was celebrated.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.680
And that’s how people developed

11:57.880 --> 12:03.880
a kind of a new instrument
within themselves called ego.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.080
When the brain
was lifted like this, you see,

12:08.280 --> 12:11.680
it expanded in a pyramidical…

12:11.880 --> 12:14.120
it’s a pyramid,
it became a pyramid.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.600
In an animal, the brain is flat.
And gradually, it rises.

12:18.800 --> 12:23.400
When the head was raised,
when the responsibility was taken
of raising the head,

12:23.600 --> 12:25.440
the brain started growing
in such a way

12:25.640 --> 12:27.880
that it became a pyramid.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.280
And when it became a pyramid,

12:30.480 --> 12:33.560
the attention became
a different attention

12:33.760 --> 12:35.720
from that of animal.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.200
Because when the waves
of your consciousness

12:40.400 --> 12:43.120
fell on the sides of the pyramid,

12:43.320 --> 12:46.800
they went into the parallelogram
of forces,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.840
by which the resultant force —

12:52.040 --> 12:54.440
the resultant force —
now, it falls like this,

12:54.640 --> 12:57.800
goes like that,
the resultant force is like that —

12:58.000 --> 13:02.640
had two sides: one was this,
another was this.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.800
So the consciousness,
or we can say, the attention,

13:06.000 --> 13:10.160
instead of going inside,
started going out.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.480
So one part of the resultant
was going outside,

13:13.680 --> 13:15.840
and that’s how,
when you became a human being,

13:16.040 --> 13:19.040
your attention went outside.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.840
It’s the human beings only
who have their attention outside.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.880
Not that the animals don’t have,

13:26.080 --> 13:29.680
but the attention
of human beings are such

13:29.880 --> 13:32.680
that they create reactions.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.280
Like, you see something.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.760
Now, I see doctor’s house there,
for example.

13:39.960 --> 13:41.920
Then a reaction starts
in my mind:

13:42.120 --> 13:44.680
What is this?…
What does this mean?…

13:44.880 --> 13:48.720
How much it must have cost?…
From where did he buy it?…

13:48.920 --> 13:51.680
Anything you see,
it starts giving you a reaction.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.120
Not to the animals.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.800
Animals, at the most
they will say, “This I must eat.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.800
That I must eat.
That I must get.”

13:59.000 --> 14:01.920
But they do not think about it.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.080
It’s only the human beings
who reflect.

14:05.280 --> 14:10.920
And this reflection comes
because of the pyramid-like structure

14:11.120 --> 14:12.560
of the brain.

14:12.760 --> 14:18.280
And this has a special reaction
in the brain itself,

14:18.480 --> 14:22.520
that we start developing
our own ego,

14:22.720 --> 14:26.280
our own myths,
our own mental projections.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.720
And when we develop
our own mental projections,

14:29.920 --> 14:33.320
this ego starts developing:
“I know,” “What’s wrong?” —

14:33.520 --> 14:35.560
all these nonsensical
things come.

14:35.760 --> 14:40.400
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

14:40.600 --> 14:44.000
It starts pushing the other balloon
which was within us —

14:44.200 --> 14:46.160
is of the superego —
as an animal,

14:46.360 --> 14:48.880
and then comes up in the centre.

14:49.080 --> 14:53.440
That’s how we now become
normal human beings.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.720
But then we start
increasing our ego.

14:57.920 --> 15:03.000
It starts overlapping
the superego,

15:03.200 --> 15:09.440
and a calcification takes place,
by which we develop our “I-ness”.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.200
So it is all the happening
that takes place

15:13.400 --> 15:17.240
after we have lifted our head,
raised our head,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.400
and we are no more like animals.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.440
So, Vishuddhi Chakra

15:22.640 --> 15:26.840
has a very big part to play
in the human evolution —

15:27.040 --> 15:30.360
that by developing
your Vishuddhi Chakra,

15:30.560 --> 15:35.280
you have become
human beings, first of all.

15:35.560 --> 15:41.520
Secondly, because it is
the chakra of the Father,

15:41.720 --> 15:45.440
who becomes again
the primordial…

15:45.640 --> 15:49.160
as you call it in…

15:50.520 --> 15:54.200
(Shri Mataji says
several words in Marathi)…

15:55.480 --> 15:56.560
macrocosm,

15:56.760 --> 15:59.240
you become the macrocosm.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.120
You are the microcosm,

16:02.320 --> 16:05.560
and the Father is the macrocosm.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.880
So you become that
because of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

16:10.080 --> 16:12.280
which is governed
by Shri Krishna,

16:12.480 --> 16:16.560
who becomes that macrocosm
called as Virat.

16:16.760 --> 16:20.400
In the brain it is expressed
in this part,

16:20.600 --> 16:22.920
in this part of the head.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.080
It is here

16:25.280 --> 16:31.080
that you start manifesting
your macrocosm qualities.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.800
At this point.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.680
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra
has a speciality —

16:36.880 --> 16:40.720
is that we always say,
“The responsibility on my shoulders.”

16:40.920 --> 16:44.560
Always we say, “The responsibilities
are on my shoulders.”

16:44.760 --> 16:46.320
The reason is,

16:46.520 --> 16:50.760
the Vishuddhi Chakra gives you
the sense of responsibility.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.400
And that’s why, you know,
the Americans feel responsible
for the whole world.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
Naturally.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.800
It’s perfectly understood

17:01.000 --> 17:03.840
that they feel responsible
for the whole world.

17:04.040 --> 17:10.920
But how much they are aware
of their role

17:11.280 --> 17:14.800
as the responsible people,
that’s a different point.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.800
But they feel
they are responsible.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.680
But their role as responsible people
if they understand,

17:22.880 --> 17:25.880
then they have to be ideals!

17:26.080 --> 17:27.280
Ideals!

17:27.480 --> 17:31.080
Because a person who is
the responsible person in a family

17:31.280 --> 17:33.920
has to be the ideal for others.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.920
It started very well, I should say,
at the time of Abraham Lincoln.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.600
It started very well.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.800
When you started talking
about democracy, is also…

17:43.000 --> 17:45.840
democracy is nothing
but collectivity.

17:46.040 --> 17:51.120
He started talking about collectivity
“of the people, by the people”
(Gettysburg Address).

17:51.320 --> 17:54.000
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

17:54.200 --> 17:58.720
started coming right
in this Vishuddhi Chakra.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.520
But then,

18:01.720 --> 18:06.440
the people who are in the centre

18:06.640 --> 18:08.720
can only remain normal.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.760
But those who bend too much,

18:11.960 --> 18:14.680
or who bend backward too much,

18:14.880 --> 18:17.080
both suffer from problems.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.160
The ones who bend forward
to others are the people

18:20.360 --> 18:23.040
who get their superego.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.280
They get over-humbled down,
like developing countries are.

18:27.480 --> 18:31.440
And those who bend backward
are the people

18:31.640 --> 18:34.160
who try to dominate others,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.520
who have ego.

18:36.720 --> 18:42.200
So, because of sudden
blessings of God,

18:42.400 --> 18:44.840
they discovered so many things.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.760
The ego started developing
in America too much.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.160
But ego is like a balloon,
as I told you,

18:52.360 --> 18:55.640
and keeps you floating
in the air.

18:55.840 --> 18:59.400
And when you are in the air,
you become shallow people.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.600
You have no moorings.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.840
But it has one more advantage.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.400
If you knew you are floating
in the air,

19:07.600 --> 19:11.000
you can have a complete
comprehensive view,

19:11.200 --> 19:13.600
complete vision of the whole —

19:13.800 --> 19:19.800
if your eyes are pure
and your intentions are clear-cut.

19:20.640 --> 19:26.160
Now, the another thing
that happened by their coming here

19:26.360 --> 19:28.160
was the problem

19:28.360 --> 19:33.280
that they felt that “We are
a very new nation.”

19:33.480 --> 19:37.280
It has an advantage,
as well as it has a disadvantage.

19:37.480 --> 19:41.680
To advantage is that if you are new,
it’s very good

19:41.880 --> 19:46.760
because you can be transformed
into something better very easily

19:46.960 --> 19:50.160
because there is no conditioning
in your mind.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.480
You are very clean,

19:54.680 --> 19:59.520
absolutely ready
to become something great.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.360
Or else, can be a possibility
that you are so new

20:04.560 --> 20:07.160
that you are awed
by everything that is old,

20:07.360 --> 20:09.560
which is very true
about Americans,

20:09.760 --> 20:14.160
that they bought
all the old bridges from England

20:14.360 --> 20:15.800
to bring them down here.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.240
And the cravings about the old
is too much here.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.880
And that as if whatever is new
is all absurd.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.080
So maybe even Sahaja Yoga
may be an absurd thing for them.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.680
Because, according to them,
this is something new.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.360
Because they are new nations,

20:34.560 --> 20:37.360
they have started discarding
all that is new.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.720
Is an absurd thing.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.320
Now, we must say
that Sahaja Yoga, as it is today,

20:43.520 --> 20:45.960
is the most ancient thing.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.320
It started with the universe,

20:48.520 --> 20:51.720
and now the culmination point
has come.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.480
Because it is a living process.

20:54.680 --> 20:59.040
As you see a flower on the tree,
so you’d say, “First new flower.”

20:59.240 --> 21:02.560
But the flower
has come out of a seed,

21:02.760 --> 21:06.680
which has got the roots;
then it became the trunk;

21:06.880 --> 21:09.720
then it became the leaves;

21:09.920 --> 21:12.600
and then it has now become
a flower.

21:12.800 --> 21:17.480
So, though it looks a new flower,
it has a big heritage.

21:17.680 --> 21:23.120
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga
is as ancient as this universe is.

21:23.320 --> 21:29.320
But to people who have
such a hankering for traditionalism,

21:29.640 --> 21:32.840
find it difficult to find out
what is real tradition.

21:33.040 --> 21:38.280
Only those who are traditional people
can know what is real tradition.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.600
Last time I came here in America
and I was shocked:

21:41.800 --> 21:45.200
that a person came
to interview Me,

21:45.400 --> 21:49.680
and when he was talking,
he asked about one gentleman

21:49.880 --> 21:53.040
who was most untraditional
from Indian point of view.

21:53.240 --> 21:55.600
His name was
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
(well-known Indian religious figure).

21:55.800 --> 21:58.800
He married a woman
and made her a “Mother”
(Ramakrishna declared his wife
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother).

21:59.000 --> 22:02.320
I mean, it’s… nobody has done it.
Rama has not done it.
Krishna has not done it.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.760
An absurd stuff!

22:04.960 --> 22:07.760
But for them,
he was the most traditional man.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.440
And he told Me that “Mother,
your Sahaja Yoga is not traditional

22:10.640 --> 22:12.920
if you don’t believe
in Ramakrishna.”

22:13.120 --> 22:18.280
Last fifty-sixty years, all such
neo-traditional people came up.

22:18.480 --> 22:22.320
Another one was this Pondicherry fellow
(Aurobindo, whose ashram
is situated in Pondicherry).

22:22.520 --> 22:25.000
Another absurd situation.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.720
He called this woman a “Mother”
(Aurobindo declared Mirra Alfassa
as an incarnation of the Divine Mother),

22:27.920 --> 22:29.920
and his relation with her
is ambiguous.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.200
You don’t know
what relationship they had.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.520
I mean, that is something,
in Indian tradition…

22:34.720 --> 22:36.360
is an impossible situation.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.320
You have to have clear-cut
relationship with everyone,

22:39.520 --> 22:41.240
you cannot have ambiguous.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.880
Neither a friend, nor a wife,
nor a mother or a sister…

22:45.080 --> 22:47.760
That kind of a situation
is most untraditional.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.200
Is never thought of.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.520
I mean, you Indians can know
this is not possible.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.640
This is an absurd situation.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.200
But for some people,
he is traditional.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.200
What happened
about sixty years back —

23:01.400 --> 23:03.480
I think, about the time
of My birth only —

23:03.680 --> 23:07.200
the negativity started taking
a new form

23:07.400 --> 23:10.720
in understanding
the western confusion.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.200
They are all westernised,
if you see them.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.320
And the western confusion
they took over

23:16.520 --> 23:18.720
for their own advantages.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.480
They used it
for their own advantages.

23:21.680 --> 23:27.320
And this is where the western people
have failed to make them out.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.440
The other day,
at the Jungian place,

23:32.640 --> 23:37.680
I was to talk to Jung people
about Sahaja Yoga and Jung.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.840
Now, Jung, I came to know
only when he died,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.400
because there was a little article
about him.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.400
I never studied psychology.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.560
Of course, I tried to learn
some vocabulary to talk to them.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.640
Sometimes, I thought,
I may have to talk to them also.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.680
But these Jungians,
all very intellectuals and great people

23:54.880 --> 23:56.320
sitting before Me, you see.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.520
About a hundred of them,
[and] the President
of American Jungian Society.

24:00.720 --> 24:04.720
I’d just gone through a book,
just before starting it,

24:04.920 --> 24:09.240
and I saw some diagram
which really puzzled Me.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.200
The first conception they had…

24:11.400 --> 24:13.280
Of course, it’s all a mental
conception of Jung.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.120
I don’t blame him,
because he got Realisation

24:16.320 --> 24:18.520
but he did not know
how the state was created,

24:18.720 --> 24:22.240
what was the framework
of the state,

24:22.440 --> 24:25.000
and his movement
was still of a seeker

24:25.200 --> 24:27.440
to find out how he got
his Realisation.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.480
And all movements were linear,

24:29.680 --> 24:32.320
they were not expanding
from one point all over.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.680
So it was not so integrated.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.640
Now, the thing they showed was

24:36.840 --> 24:39.080
that at the bottom of it
was the unconscious

24:39.280 --> 24:40.960
which is never going
to be conscious;

24:41.160 --> 24:46.680
on top of that was the conscious…
unconscious that can be conscious;

24:46.880 --> 24:51.240
then, there was subconscious;
and on top of that was the ego.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.080
I mean, what a mess of a thing
it was, I tell you.

24:55.280 --> 24:59.840
I told them, see, now, the word
“unconscious” itself is confusing.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.720
What do you mean
by “unconscious”?

25:01.920 --> 25:06.600
Whatever you don’t feel
on your central nervous system
is unconscious, all right.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.960
But what does that mean?

25:08.160 --> 25:11.480
We don’t feel the subconscious —

25:11.680 --> 25:14.920
then subconscious is also
unconscious.

25:15.360 --> 25:19.200
Whatever we don’t feel —
for example, there are certain sounds

25:19.400 --> 25:22.440
of certain frequencies
we don’t hear at all.

25:22.640 --> 25:26.280
We hear whatever is tolerable
to us as human beings.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.440
That you all scientists know.
We don’t hear everything.

25:30.640 --> 25:34.840
So, all that is unconscious —
means it’s a mixed bag,

25:35.040 --> 25:37.280
all sorts of things
mixed up together.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.640
But God is not a hotchpotch
person, you see.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.320
He is a clear-cut gentleman.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.600
He knows what He is doing,
He is the greatest organiser.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.400
And how can He put you
into a bag like that —

25:49.600 --> 25:51.400
that the unconscious is below;

25:51.600 --> 25:54.960
then on top of it is the unconscious
that is going to be conscious;

25:55.160 --> 25:56.960
on top of it is the subconscious;

25:57.160 --> 26:00.720
on top of [it is] the consciousness;
on top of that, the ego!

26:00.920 --> 26:05.040
So you go down
carrying all this inside you,

26:05.240 --> 26:06.480
and where do you go?

26:06.680 --> 26:09.040
Now, how do you go?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.400
So the first mistake was

26:11.600 --> 26:15.040
that there are layers
one on top of other.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.480
It’s not so.

26:16.680 --> 26:20.000
They are placed vertically!

26:20.720 --> 26:25.840
The ego is on the right-hand side,
and superego, on the left-hand side.

26:26.040 --> 26:30.680
The future, on the right-hand side,
and the past, on the left-hand side.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.280
So, the subconscious,
on the left-hand side,

26:33.480 --> 26:35.840
and the supraconscious,
on the right-hand side.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.080
And the central path
is kept clear-cut.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.960
I mean, in any organisation…

26:41.160 --> 26:43.640
say, if you go to the airport,

26:43.840 --> 26:46.720
do you have like this
that you have to pass
through the walls

26:46.920 --> 26:48.800
to go to the aeroplane?

26:49.000 --> 26:52.480
If we human beings don’t commit
such horrible mistakes,

26:52.680 --> 26:55.200
how can God commit
such a mistake?

26:55.400 --> 26:58.480
So it was absolutely wrong
to think that way.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.640
So, the central path is
in the centre,

27:01.840 --> 27:04.000
while the right side is
on the right side,

27:04.200 --> 27:06.240
and the left side
on the left side.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.320
And you don’t have to go
to the subconscious at all!

27:09.520 --> 27:11.520
Because they justified
all these people

27:11.720 --> 27:13.720
who are trying
to make them hypnosis,

27:13.920 --> 27:16.320
or they are trying
to hypnotise them

27:16.520 --> 27:20.360
or to give them a new type of a…
sort of an experience.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
“All that was unconscious,
we should accept that.”

27:22.760 --> 27:26.440
Even some people,
if they start suddenly jumping,
they say, “Oh, it’s great!”

27:26.640 --> 27:28.680
So the sensations that you get

27:28.880 --> 27:31.080
from the subconscious
and the supraconscious

27:31.280 --> 27:33.080
were accepted
as something great.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.440
It was a confusion
of your intellectuals, I should say.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.640
Complete.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.000
But it is not so.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.080
Your path is straightforward.
Absolutely for Kundalini.

27:44.280 --> 27:49.120
Only thing, the one who has to raise it
had to come, that’s all.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
But otherwise,
it’s all very well,

27:52.800 --> 27:57.120
and there is no need for you
to get into that horrible subconscious.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.280
When I told them, they were amazed.
They said, “Mother, it is so simple!”

28:00.480 --> 28:03.680
I said, “It’s very simple.
Your unconscious is divided into four.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.560
One is the collective
subconscious,

28:06.760 --> 28:09.760
one is the collective
supraconscious,

28:09.960 --> 28:12.920
one is, you can say,
the collective hell,

28:13.120 --> 28:19.120
and on top is the super-collective
consciousness.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.800
So, where do we have to go?
We should know our destination.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.160
Then, we have to reach it.”

28:26.360 --> 28:30.040
And that is how the problem
of all these people

28:30.240 --> 28:32.480
getting entangled with Muktanand
(founder of Siddha Yoga).

28:32.680 --> 28:36.920
Yesterday they asked Me a question,
“What’s wrong with Muktanand?
Why is he so dangerous?”

28:37.120 --> 28:39.400
One lady, poor thing,
as sahaj would have it,

28:39.600 --> 28:43.560
she came, she said,
“Oh, I went there, I broke my back,
and I’m finished once and for all.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.640
He is such a dangerous man!
He flattered me,

28:45.840 --> 28:48.080
I went there, and I don’t know
what has happened to my back.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.600
I can’t sit for more than ten minutes
in one place, I have to get up.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.960
And I have a vibrator,
I have to always put it…” — like that.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
So I said, “See. The dangers.”

28:58.480 --> 29:03.400
Then the another theory they started
that we must suffer
if we are to go to God. Why?

29:03.600 --> 29:07.560
I mean, that’s not God’s idea
by any chance.
Why should you suffer?

29:07.760 --> 29:09.560
He made Christ suffer for you.

29:09.760 --> 29:13.040
Finished now, now you better not suffer.
There’s no need to suffer at all.

29:13.240 --> 29:18.480
So, all these ideas penetrated
into these western people.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.520
And this mental projection
they accepted

29:21.720 --> 29:25.680
without even understanding
what is written in other books.
We should see.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.560
And they could only go
as far as those sixty years

29:28.760 --> 29:30.400
when these horrible people

29:30.600 --> 29:34.320
who went to India, very shallow people,
they saw some of these tantric books,

29:34.520 --> 29:38.520
because they wanted to justify Freud
through Indian culture.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.400
So they got the tantrikas,
erotic things and all that

29:41.600 --> 29:42.880
and brought these books.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.320
And some of them read
I don’t know what books,

29:45.520 --> 29:48.440
to say that Kundalini [is]
in the stomach;
somebody says, in the brain…

29:48.640 --> 29:50.320
I mean, they don’t know
where the Kundalini is.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.080
And they are writing
such big, big books.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.560
Can you imagine?
Such big, big books they have written!

29:55.760 --> 29:59.240
Now, when the books are written,
every book is not a scripture.

29:59.440 --> 30:03.040
But to them, if it is written
in the book, you see, it’s a scripture.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.360
And that’s how the whole confusion
started going on.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.320
So these people came down,
took full advantage of it,

30:09.520 --> 30:13.800
and now they have become
“great gurus”

30:14.400 --> 30:16.360
with lot of money.

30:16.560 --> 30:18.160
Rich people.

30:18.360 --> 30:23.080
But now,
as the hand of God is great,

30:23.280 --> 30:27.560
one by one they are getting out

30:28.720 --> 30:33.920
of the heads of these people.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.360
And now I hope a day will come

30:36.560 --> 30:38.920
when people will see
the light through.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.720
So the task of Sahaja Yoga is
to establish the truth within yourself.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.400
It is not that we can have
a membership.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.680
We cannot have a person
enrol into it.

30:49.880 --> 30:54.600
We cannot call them
as branded Sahaja yogis.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.760
It’s the growth of the person
that is to be seen.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.320
Now, there are so many lectures
which I have given

31:00.520 --> 31:02.520
about <i>ritambhara pragnya</i>
and all those things,

31:02.720 --> 31:06.440
and I think for every Sahaja yogi
it is necessary

31:06.640 --> 31:08.480
to listen to those lectures,

31:08.680 --> 31:13.400
go through it, understand them,
and to meditate, so that you grow.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.120
Because it’s not a plastic thing
that we can create.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.280
It’s a living process

31:18.480 --> 31:24.440
of the living energy
of the living God.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.480
And so, it has to grow
within you.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.120
By thinking
you cannot make it grow,

31:30.320 --> 31:33.840
but by not thinking
you allow it to grow more and more.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.800
As it starts growing within you,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.800
then only you realise
that what you are.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.600
That’s the only way you have to reach
a state of that super-consciousness

31:43.800 --> 31:45.920
and establish yourself there.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.000
Then only you will know
what I am talking about.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.600
Now, today’s puja
is another thing.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.560
Now, what is a puja?

31:53.760 --> 31:55.680
Can you people say
what’s a puja is?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.880
Actually, yesterday I had a puja…

31:58.080 --> 32:01.440
and it’s not easy for Me to bear
the pujas, to be very frank, you know.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.960
Because the vibrations are so much
that… I don’t know…

32:06.160 --> 32:09.400
And then I went to the airport;
two hours, we took out the vibrations

32:09.600 --> 32:13.040
and put them
for all the New York airport.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.480
It was necessary.
It worked out.

32:15.680 --> 32:20.000
Because vibrations start flowing
with tremendous force,

32:20.200 --> 32:22.360
and if you people
do not absorb it,

32:22.560 --> 32:26.000
it takes time for it to ooze out
from My body.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.120
Makes Me rather heavy with it.

32:29.320 --> 32:32.840
But then it oozes out,
I feel better…

32:33.040 --> 32:36.880
And only thing that happens
by saying the mantras —

32:37.080 --> 32:39.960
that you awaken the deities
within yourself

32:40.160 --> 32:43.000
and start receiving
the vibrations.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.200
And when your deities
are awakened,

32:46.400 --> 32:50.480
they are awakened through the power
of the deities within Me —

32:50.680 --> 32:52.600
they have to work very hard
to do that,

32:52.800 --> 32:55.280
and that’s how they emit
too much vibrations,

32:55.480 --> 32:59.240
which must be absorbed by you
when your deities are awakened.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.080
That’s how it works.

33:01.280 --> 33:05.400
You cannot describe it in words,
you cannot tell it in words.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.840
It’s a happening
that has to take place.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.400
Many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga first

33:10.600 --> 33:13.040
can go little bit like that
in the beginning.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.120
Gradually they settle down,

33:15.320 --> 33:18.720
come round, grow into it —
then it becomes all right.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.320
Some people just shoot off
in one day, and they are there.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.520
Makes no difference whatsoever.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.400
Because it’s a growing thing
and it has to grow.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.720
With some people,
the land is so fertile,

33:31.920 --> 33:34.520
or maybe something,
that it just works out fast.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.720
So, nobody should blame anyone.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.880
And specially,
one should not feel guilty,

33:39.080 --> 33:41.640
because that’s the Vishuddhi
on the left-hand side.

33:41.840 --> 33:45.280
Specially for America,
I am wearing this stone,

33:45.480 --> 33:47.800
which is called
as the black sapphire.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.920
Because this is the stone
of Shri Krishna.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.880
It’s the stone
of Vishuddhi Chakra.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.360
Every chakra has a stone,

33:55.560 --> 33:57.520
and this is the stone
of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

33:57.720 --> 34:01.800
so I am wearing this,
just for coming to America.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.280
And I hope that today’s worship

34:07.480 --> 34:14.400
will bring out the potential
of this country

34:15.120 --> 34:18.600
by exciting the deities,

34:18.800 --> 34:22.400
Shri Krishna himself,
who is in charge,

34:22.600 --> 34:27.320
by pleasing Him,
by making Him active.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.880
And He has great qualities,

34:30.080 --> 34:33.440
and one of the greatest
qualities He has — that He has
the <i>samhara shakti</i>,

34:33.640 --> 34:35.880
by which He can kill the demons.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.440
And all those demons
who are settled down here

34:38.640 --> 34:40.720
are really mistaken.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.720
Because if this is the place
of Shri Krishna,

34:43.920 --> 34:46.800
they are very dangerously placed.

34:47.000 --> 34:51.160
Because once He is awakened here,
they all will be completely finished

34:51.360 --> 34:54.000
through His Sudarshan Chakra,
which He has in His hand,

34:54.200 --> 34:56.880
and He can just kill them
one by one.

34:57.080 --> 35:00.560
But first, He is to be pleased,
and He is to be awakened.

35:00.760 --> 35:05.160
He has to be…
<i>prasanna</i>, that’s the word.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.040
<i>Prasanna</i> means “to be pleased”.

35:07.240 --> 35:08.680
And then, it works out.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.280
So today first we’ll have
Ganesha’s puja, little bit,

35:11.480 --> 35:17.400
because Ganesha’s puja is meant
just to establish the innocence,

35:17.600 --> 35:20.080
the innocence of the place.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.600
Once the innocence is established —
that’s the most important,

35:22.800 --> 35:25.280
that’s the essence of everything,
Ganesha is the essence! —

35:25.480 --> 35:27.520
and then we’ll have
Shri Krishna puja,

35:27.720 --> 35:32.920
and then the puja of the Devi,
of the Power.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.080
So, that’s how we’ll have three pujas,
one after another,

35:36.280 --> 35:38.240
but a short time every time.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.440
All right?
