00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.650
Yesterday was such a nice time we had together,
and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:14.409
I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely
going in a tempest.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:23.770
We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja,
I think, only yesterday: it’s to feel the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.290
joy of God’s love.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:45.200
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali”
means the “rows of lights”.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:59.540
It was celebrated firstly because thousands
of years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.869
day.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:11.900
That means the benevolence of human beings
was crowned, was accepted.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:26.040
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal
personality being shown to be a king, to be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.840
the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.290
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent
king was crowned.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.569
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:10.609
That’s only possible if
the people who choose the king have no other

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:22.280
consideration but that of benevolence of all
the people.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:32.840
So one has to come to the conclusion that
they have to be Sahaja Yogis, because other

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.150
think that: “How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.590
Some think: “How much power-oriented we
could be?”

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:55.609
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”
or any other domination.

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.139
So we’ve got two types of theories: as we
see, is one is communism and another is democracy,

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:08.480
where one is power-oriented, the another is
money-oriented, and in both the cases we say

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.689
that it’s all failed.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:18.690
And it’s a good news for all of you to know
that Russia, which was a country known to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:28.690
be run in complete fear, has turned out to
be the best for Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.900
It is one of the super powers.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:47.240
When the government is like that, I think
the people are better.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.720
They do not have these false notions of individual
freedom.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.360
They do not think that: “Ah, what’s wrong?”

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.960
I told them: “You must put oil on in your
head because you’ll become bald."

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.590
Next day all of them were done with the oil,
nothing doing.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:20.800
So the kind of obedience they had, from very
beginning of their country, that sense of

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.530
obedience is so great, you tell them anything,
immediately they do it.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.940
Not one, thousands.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.900
One thousand were sitting in the hall; two
thousand were outside waiting for Me, on a

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.190
follow-on.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.810
Imagine how wise and deep they are?

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.690
While in the West we are lost in our so-called
freedom idea of so-called freedom: “What’s

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:48.690
wrong?”

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.740
But actually we are slaves, if you see.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.920
Any fashion that starts, everybody starts
doing it.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.520
But why?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.379
Why do we follow those fashions?

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:03.689
We must see how we are slaves.

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:06.849
Because others will laugh at us if we don’t
do like that.

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.700
They’ll make fun of us.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.419
Because they will criticize us.

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:18.370
So because they have got a freedom to criticize,
we are frightened of such people who can criticize.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.750
And now the criticizing people are criticizing
them.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.500
Critics have critics, their critics are there,
there are other critics, and there are critics

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.539
after critics.

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.220
So only the critics are produced.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.289
Where is the benevolence?

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:35.199
There’s no question of benevolence at all.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:47.669
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed
to be free, the idea of benevolence is finished.

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:53.610
Because whatever good for you, whatever is
benevolent for you, can be only understood

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.699
if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:02.340
But if you have this kind of freedom is to
go amuck, do what you like: “Because everybody’s

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.270
doing it, I must do it.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.199
Everybody is singing like this; so I must
do it."

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.629
But from where does this idea come in?

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:22.211
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs
who want to befool you, make slaves out of

00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:27.889
you, and this slavery is so-called freedom
for you.

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:33.060
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery
because you do what they tell you, behave

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.639
in the same manner as whatever they say.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:42.500
There are no fashions in that country, very
few, very few women indulge into fashions.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500
Nothing.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.810
And men are also very simple.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.370
They have no fashionable things.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:55.270
They have only things which are convenient,
good for their climate.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.750
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh
or don’t laugh.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.699
It’s everybody laughs here.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:11.349
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This
is stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him,

00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:12.419
that’s all."

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:21.440
So one has to understand that it was the king,
Rama, who was made the, actually accepted

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.389
by the public, like a crown was put on his
head to say that benevolence is the highest

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:30.389
thing.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:39.090
And whatever is benevolent for us should be
accepted in our freedom, if we are really

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.880
a free country.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.810
But if we are not free inside, we are bound
by what people will say; they’ll criticize

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.810
us.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.820
Do you know as a result of that, there is
no art in this country [Italy]?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.470
But I saw lot of art growing in Russia.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:05.230
Because any art you produce is criticized,
so people have to be careful: “This should

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.610
not be so much, little this, little that."

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.070
Nobody can produce any art there.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.050
Any musician is there is criticized in these
countries.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.200
There if you go, the musicians are tremendous
musicians.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:29.510
They have of a very high quality musicians
there, very high quality of dramatist, not

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.480
at all boring as they are here.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:39.720
If you go any play in England, it’s so boring
that you feel like running away from there,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.440
extremely boring.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.170
There was a play, we went to see, it was called
as “Star Express” or “Express Star”

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.170
or something.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.660
There was nothing, except on the wheels they
were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.290
Nothing there ! So anybody would go mad with
it, I tell you.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.130
We were there hardly for fifteen minutes,
came out with a headache.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.870
We didn’t know where to go.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.790
So with this kind of criticism that we have,
it’s only freedom we have is to criticize

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.620
other, make fun of others, react to others.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:19.880
How can you enjoy?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.880
To enjoy others first of all you must accept
the goodness of other people, not mentally,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.889
from your heart.

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:37.110
And that will bring the benevolence on this
country of ours which we call the Kingdom

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.399
of God.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:51.209
Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura
was killed.

00:10:51.209 --> 00:11:03.170
Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil
from the Hell, they say: very cunning, very

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:08.750
clever, and he was killed by the Goddess.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:19.709
Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation,
Kartikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:21.320
to kill.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:28.740
So when he was killed it was celebrated because
the evil was killed, but we don’t find that,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:35.500
these days the evil people are getting peace
awards.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.880
So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted
brain?

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.740
How is it they are using perversion?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.510
Just the opposite of it.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:57.930
What has worked out these things, so again
we find the same so-called freedom to become

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.779
also evil.

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:05.240
So we have freedom to become evil.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:14.199
First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent,
and secondly to become evil we have freedom.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:20.600
So the Narakasura within us must be killed,
the one which teaches us evil, to do evil

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.860
to others.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:28.339
If you are busy doing evil to others, you
can never enjoy.

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:35.209
Because you enjoy doing evil to others.

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:39.420
So that has to be faced within ourselves,
not in other people.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:46.990
It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi
is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that,

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.320
but very difficult to say: “Mother, I am
caught up.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:54.519
I have got this problem within myself."

00:12:54.519 --> 00:12:58.699
So when you start seeing yourself your heart
opens out.

00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:04.940
Unless and until you learn how to open out
your heart how can you enjoy?

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.800
Open your heart.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.329
Many people live on very superficial level.

00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:13.960
All right, some of them might say that: “I
am possessed, Mother.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.730
I’ve got this possession."

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.730
Why?

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.230
“I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning."

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.430
But why?

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.990
You don’t want to enjoy.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.300
So watch yourself, see for yourself.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.610
This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll
put you right."

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.610
See in the mirror.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.079
Tell yourself: “This kind of a useless conditioning
I’ve got it from where?

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:39.860
Because I’m Indian, because I’m French,
because of English."

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:45.850
Open the heart.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:51.750
And opening the heart is only possible if
Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed,

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.550
finished, once for all.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:00.839
In small, small things there is joy.

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:06.190
In very little things also there’s a ripple
of joy.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.020
If you are sensitive you can catch it.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.410
And why not enjoy?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:20.360
Why to have these stupid conditioning on our
heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:27.029
Enjoyment is only possible if you take out
this one sitting on your heart.

00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:36.399
So, that is the second part of the Diwali
that you have to open your heart.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:41.940
Forget your nationality, forget your race,
forget everything.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.590
It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis
have.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:52.459
They must be respected, they must be treated
like this, or maybe that we are something

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:54.870
great and they are no good.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:15:01.459
If you cannot mix up with the collective,
something’s wrong with you.

00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:02.459
Nothing wrong with others.

00:15:02.459 --> 00:15:07.529
Easy to find faults with others.

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:08.690
But what’s the use?

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.100
If you start finding faults with others you
do not become clean.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.100
Supposing I find that your clothes are not
clean.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.610
My clothes are not going to get clean by that,
are they?

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:27.470
It’s so practical and simple it is that
we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:35.870
us, and improve ourselves, so that we can
really, really, from our heart, enjoy.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:42.220
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the
Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.279
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of
Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:53.790
And it was so that She came out of the water.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:16:03.029
Through the water, She came out so clean.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:13.660
And She has no pride.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.610
She doesn’t assert Herself.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.810
She doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:25.259
But human beings are just opposite if they
have money, they ride on a horse all the time,

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:26.670
they cannot come down.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.370
It’s impossible to talk to them.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:39.870
So a person who has money is not the one who
is worshipping Lakshmi, who is not a “Lakshmi

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.790
pati” as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.509
Because She stands only on a lotus.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:47.880
Can you imagine how light She must be to stand
on a lotus?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.649
She has a big body, everything is there, but
She stands on a lotus.

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:58.980
That She takes all Her weight within Herself,
She just sucks in Her weight as Shri Krishna

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.160
has described.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:06.910
That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside
his body, in the same way, we have to suck

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:18.450
in all the weight of money, weight of your
positions, weight of your so-called education,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:24.839
weight of some aristocratic family you are
born of.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:36.610
This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy
person, to go down very fast.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:42.390
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the
lotus.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:50.390
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,
that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.810
lotus, nothing.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.340
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.550
Unless and until you have balance you cannot
stand on a lotus.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.559
So She is so balanced.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:09.600
Her center of gravity is so balanced that
She cannot topple down.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.630
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them:
“How are you?”

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:21.720
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means just
ok] Ten years have passed, sometimes like

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:22.720
this also.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.600
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means you are
up side down]

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600
[Laughter]
Why?

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.990
Because you must be grounded in the Mother
Earth, into the practical side of it.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:44.100
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging
in the air, but we are grounded in the Mother

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.350
Earth.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:54.470
And the slightest thing happens to us, again
we come back to our balance.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.919
So this is Her position when She stands up
in a lotus.

00:18:58.919 --> 00:19:04.480
Now She has a hand, one hand like this [which
gives], one hand like this [which protects],

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.049
and there are two hands which have got again
the lotuses, the pink ones.

00:19:08.049 --> 00:19:14.010
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is Her fragrance
I think is spread on the sky.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:28.470
And She is pink, pink because that shows that
Her house, Her nature is pink, pink is inviting,

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.640
is loving.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:42.080
She is a very fond hostess, that She wants
everybody to come in, in Her house.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:49.010
But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten
dogs outside and nobody can come inside the

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.550
house.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.980
Only the dogs and he lives.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.840
He can’t live with human beings.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:04.230
So the house is closed, the doors are closed,
everything’s closed, money is closed permanently.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:12.039
So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi
pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:19.750
Because he must have a cozy, beautiful – cozy,
again I say, cozy house.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:26.270
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital,
anything drops, you feel frightened: “Oh,

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.360
my God."

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.080
Then you’ll pick it up.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.950
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:38.840
It’s all right, in the house, in the home,
if somebody comes and stays.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.010
Then it’s little bit this here and there,
doesn’t matter, then you put it right, but

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.799
that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:52.210
It should not be taken as a lousy house, but
a house which is inviting.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:58.000
When people come in, you give them a place
to sit down and make them enjoy.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.140
It’s not done, in India at least.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:05.050
I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting
westernized, that anybody drops something

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.830
on the carpet we’ll never clean it in their
presence because it’s very bad manners.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.970
Carpet is not important than the guest, is
it?

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:21.540
Or if we break something, say, a glass, then
we say: “Very good, it’s something has

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.540
gone out, some bad thing has gone out."

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:29.179
Or a thermometer is broken we say the same
thing.

00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:44.970
All these things happen, in a way, just to
see how far we are open-hearted or to suggest

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.490
to you that something is going wrong.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:54.940
If something falls off just see what’s going
on in your brain.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.120
What are you thinking?

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.982
Is there something funny you are thinking
about somebody or something wrong you are

00:22:01.982 --> 00:22:02.982
thinking?

00:22:02.982 --> 00:22:05.820
Then it’s up to you.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.810
Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:15.510
So, another conditioning we have, which is
a very, very funny conditioning, either we’ll

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:23.350
have the lousiest of lousiest houses or we’ll
have houses which will just look like hospitals,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:27.250
even a rat would not enter there, leave alone
human beings.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:31.620
They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll
polish everything.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.860
Husband, wife will fight on that.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.529
They’ll have divorces for it.

00:22:38.529 --> 00:22:40.909
But not even a rat will enter that house.

00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:43.650
I have seen many houses like that.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.950
And I’ve seen the other way round also:
those that are lousiest, where there’s no

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.570
garden, there are no flowers, nothing beautiful.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:23:03.760
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that
extreme, but something that will give joy

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.240
to others, to visitors, to people who come
to your house, we’ll soothe the sick.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.220
People should feel happy to come to your house.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.970
So there’s no showing off.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:27.120
Not to show off but to make them comfortable
and very happy.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:32.620
You can do lots of things, very interesting
things, if you have the Lakshmi principle

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.620
in you.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.740
I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:41.049
He had a very beautiful house, everything,
and he was so interesting.

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:45.820
He had made the house very interestingly,
very nice, very beautiful.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.799
And you didn’t feel any aggression at all
in that house.

00:23:50.799 --> 00:24:00.260
So, I saw his dining room done with very good,
beautiful, green marble and white lights.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.230
I said: “Must be quite expensive."

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.520
“No, that’s the beauty.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520
It’s very cheap.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520
You know how I did it cheaply."

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.529
All the time he was telling Me how he did
things cheaply, means he has never shown off

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:15.529
it’s expensive.

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:19.159
But a person who’s aggressive will say:
“Oh, you know, this one I got it for so

00:24:19.159 --> 00:24:22.110
much, so much, so much."

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.960
But a person who wants to give you joy will
say: “No, I tell you it’s so cheap, you

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.690
won’t believe what a sum."

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.510
That’s the sign of a person who wants to
give joy to his guests.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:40.279
He’ll never try to say that: “It’s very
expensive, I spent so much money, this is

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.650
so, this that."

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.350
This is showing off.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.770
And then ultimately you’d say: “It’s
very good,” three times.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:47.929
“Then it’s yours.

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:48.929
Have it."

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:49.929
Of course he can’t give you the floor.

00:24:49.929 --> 00:24:54.090
The rest of it you can take.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.600
That’s, that’s what it is a personality
which is joy-giving.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.590
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also,
a beetle comes, a black beetle with horrible

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:17.710
thorny legs, and enters into this lotus for
a sleeping in the night, you see.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:25.360
And the lotus closes down its cosiness on
it and sleeps very comfortably.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.399
And then next day it opens out, so it flies
out.

00:25:30.399 --> 00:25:37.820
That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your
hearts should be.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:46.970
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing
and that comforting feeling, when they are

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.890
in your company.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.710
But not a person who was reactionary.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.320
Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately
say: “I don’t like this carpet."

00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.830
See, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners
to say like that, to say that: “I don’t

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.830
like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:11.220
Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician
who could be of a very high level, could be

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.480
of a very ordinary level, you should be able
to enjoy everything; otherwise you are not

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.980
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.409
If you are going to criticize a musician that:
“Oh, God, what a musician.

00:26:23.409 --> 00:26:27.660
He’s no good this, that” then he’s not
going to improve.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:33.230
But if you encourage the musician: “Oh,
you are very good.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.830
You are very great,” he’ll play much better
next time; you’ll see that.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.149
There’s no falsehood about it.

00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:44.070
Some people think it’s not honest.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:52.970
But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal
kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.820
You be honest to yourself.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:01.190
And there’s no need to tell anybody your
opinion very honestly.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:06.600
Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions,
and direct towards yourself.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.970
Like you see somebody.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:13.309
Now, honestly you want to tell him that he
is wearing a funny dress, honestly.

00:27:13.309 --> 00:27:21.550
You better look at yourself, what sort of
a dress you are wearing.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.600
And what business you have got to tell him
that he’s wearing funny?

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.110
On the contrary, you say: “This is very
nice.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.110
I like it.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.110
It’s very nice.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.110
It’s good, good.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.110
Nice one."

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.610
They’ll say: “No ” But he’ll say that:
“No, not so good.

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.610
Yours is nice."

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.240
“Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you
see, very cheaply.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.570
I’ll tell you from where.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.660
And you can have it if you like.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.120
I can take yours.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.980
You take mine."

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:51.309
So the basic, subtle point is that, that with
your love, you are encouraging everyone, you

00:27:51.309 --> 00:28:03.330
are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence
in him, [in] his personality and a kind of

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.570
a rapport which is very subtle.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:17.549
So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is
so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything,

00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:21.760
like as we see the world is today.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.100
But the lotus covers with his fragrance the
whole of that pond and covers it up completely

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.539
and you forget the thing what is behind.

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:36.559
It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves,
you see, like the ears of the elephant and

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:39.350
that covers the whole thing.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:40.870
So you don’t see any filth or dirt.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.929
What you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves.

00:28:44.929 --> 00:28:50.980
Sometimes they are like a “tali”[plate],
like a big tali that we use for eating.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:57.580
And then all these things are covered with
you.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.750
There’s no honesty about it.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:07.149
They could say: “Why should we be honest,
let such say all the worms and the filth growing

00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:08.149
about?”

00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:17.529
But the honesty lies in honestly understanding
what is your job as Sahaja Yogi is.

00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:26.039
You are not there to point out the bad points
but you are there to cover all the bad points,

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:28.700
all the loopholes, with your love.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:35.149
That’s your job, and there you have to be
honest.

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:41.940
Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these
days, it has created only cheats and thugs

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:47.070
and thieves.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.440
Even a thief can be won over.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.950
You can.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.620
I’ll give you an example.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.490
I met one boy in Delhi market.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.100
Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering
so I brought him in the car home.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.340
So in the family, My brother and My husband
both got very worried.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.840
He said: “Who is this brother-in-law you
have brought in?”

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.580
I said: “He is My nephew.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.020
All right, let it be.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.340
Doesn’t matter, whatever you say, I’ll
keep him."

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.760
So I looked after him.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.090
I treated him.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.860
He got all right.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.630
These two persons got after him: “We could
send him to the police, send him to the police,

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:21.630
this.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.679
I said: “Let’s try now, let us see, he’s
a good man, he’ll be all right."

00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:26.679
“No, send him to the police."

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:30.470
Might have been, I don’t know, might have
been.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:35.960
And they were after his life; till ten days
he was all right, I soothed him down.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.870
After tenth day, he was so fed up with these
two persons, he ran away.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.210
And he ran away, and he ran away with what,
do you know?

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:50.720
He ran away with all the things that belonged
to My brother and My husband.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.610
And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything
nicely.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:31:00.130
[Laughter] He didn’t touch that; he didn’t
touch that.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:05.269
Shri Mataji to someone: Hello, see when I
am talking, don’t talk to each other.

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:06.780
This is a new Sahaja Yogi?

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.700
Tell him not to talk.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.800
When I’m talking don’t talk.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.380
That’s not the way.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.210
So he just ran away.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:20.120
And imagine, he left – I had a necklace,
a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace,

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.049
I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t
touch it.

00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:30.080
He didn’t touch anything and he took away
whatever was possible from their purse, from

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.100
their things, whatever were left, everything
he took away.

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.100
“Now,” I said, “now go to the police."

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:40.230
[Laughter] “Fine.

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.790
What?”

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:50.669
So, this is how one has to know that the honesty
is for yourself, not for others.

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:54.150
Don’t try to be honest with others.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:56.700
Be honest to yourself.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.889
Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe
it’s rational and maybe that it is just

00:32:01.889 --> 00:32:06.360
a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt
others.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:11.000
So first check on your mind and find out if
you are trying to hurt others or you are trying

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
to please others.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.010
Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:20.750
If you are going to say something to please
others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:29.140
And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice
things to others, how niceness comes to you.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.110
Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me
that: “Mother, he is very bad.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:37.269
He has troubled me so much, this thing, that
thing.

00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:39.990
I don’t like him,” so I tell him: “No,
no, he was praising you a lot."

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.720
It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.120
“He was praising you.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.639
He was so much in love with you.

00:32:46.639 --> 00:32:47.649
He’s so kind to you.

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:49.929
He was telling Me he loves you very much."

00:32:49.929 --> 00:32:50.940
He said: “Really?”

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.460
“Yeah, he did say."

00:32:52.460 --> 00:33:00.059
Next day you find them going together.

00:33:00.059 --> 00:33:05.200
So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s
very little, is left out, very little here

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200
and there.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.870
And some of them are really very superficial
but most of you have very little things left

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.210
here and there.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:18.510
And only if you can watch that part you can
throw it away and you can really become very

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:24.750
joyous people.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:34.850
Now there are some people who never smile,
who never laugh.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.500
So then you are allowed to tickle them.

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.420
[Laughter] It’s absurd.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:50.159
It’s said that you have to be like children;
you have to be like children.

00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:52.860
You play with something, finished; then you
play with another, finished.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.860
You don’t get involved into anything.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.940
You don’t get attached to anything.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:02.679
Unless and until you’ve that child-like
heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:02.679 --> 00:34:03.679
It’s useless.

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:09.000
You will be here for years together; you will
be useless, absolutely.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.520
Specially if you are coming from false gurus,
it’s very difficult.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.460
Because what I have known of false gurus,
they never laugh, never smile.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.800
They are very serious.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.130
Only take your money, keep on the backside.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:33.429
So it is important that we should be in a
very joyous mood, alert, aware, enjoying every

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.180
bit of it.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:39.270
That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles
is.

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:45.701
Now another thing is that, the suggestion
is of the left hand is like this, means She

00:34:45.701 --> 00:34:46.899
is giving.

00:34:46.899 --> 00:34:54.960
A person who has money must give, not to the
Pope, I never mean that, but must give to

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.650
somebody who needs it.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:02.820
But so secretly that this [right] hand should
not know, is so far away, this one [right

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:03.820
hand is up].

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.090
This [left] hand should give, just secretly.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.100
Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to
anyone.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:13.380
I find it difficult, because I find it that
people will not like it.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.730
So there is a way of giving.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.470
There are so sweet ways of giving.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.310
Just try to notice what that person likes.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.930
Sometimes even children understand.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.440
Like I know, of My granddaughter.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:36.770
She said: “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even
have any good chappels.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.860
I feel so bad about it.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.860
But how to give him?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.370
He will not take money from me."

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.640
So I said: “You do one thing.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.840
You go and do something to his chappel."

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.360
So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels
more, you see.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.020
When they were walking together it broke.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.850
So she said: “Ah, see now, the chappels
are broken."

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:56.200
She took him to a chappel shop and bought
him a chappel.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.460
He said: “But I have no money."

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.830
“No, just take it.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.830
Just take it.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.830
It’s all right.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.190
Just, I’ll be very happy if you take."

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.410
That’s how!

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:12.680
It’s so sweet to hear and to do it, how
beautiful it must be!

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:20.030
We like to hear everything, we want to see
in a film everything good, in a television,

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:24.430
but when it comes to us we are different.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:30.400
When we see a mother-in-law torturing her
daughter-in-law, we always say: “Oh, look

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.670
at her, how cruel she is."

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.940
But we don’t want to see we are the same.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.990
So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.400
Out of question!

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.590
Nobody has to be cruel to anyone, nobody has
right to be cruel, whether they are leaders

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:56.300
or non-leaders or anything they are, you have
no business anyway to be cruel to anyone,

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.810
hurting anyone.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:02.280
We are not daggers, we are lotuses.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:09.360
Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with
a lotus.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:13.000
It’s such a delicate thing.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.800
But it can be only understood if you go deep
into it, into Sahaja Yoga, otherwise it cannot

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.420
be understood.

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.860
Now, a saint is a saint.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.860
He cannot become cruel, he cannot.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.560
There’s no need.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:36.600
What is the need to be cruel?

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.370
So then with one hand there should be “daana”
[donation], means “giving”.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.720
Giving in a way that is secret.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.010
There’s no need to give Me anything.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.470
I’ve been telling you: “Don’t give Me
anything."

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.470
I don’t want to take anything.

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:51.510
If you give Me anything, gold and silver,
I’ll leave it here.

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.020
I cannot take it.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:38:00.070
The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t
appreciate that you are loving Me, this thing,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.750
but a flower is sufficient for Me.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:07.590
But a person who needs something you must
give.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:14.080
I’m so self-contained, you know that very
well, that I can live anywhere, I can live

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.920
on the street, I can live anywhere, I have
no problem, I can do without food, no problem.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.760
All right, in adoration you want to give Me
something, but I’ve been telling that: “Don’t

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760
give Me.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.770
If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll
leave it here.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.810
I will not take it."

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:38.360
And we have now passed a law or regulation,
everything, but I hope you’ll listen to

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.820
Me.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:47.820
So what is needed is the thing that we should
know what is the dearth of another person,

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:48.820
what will he need?

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:54.390
You need silver for Puja, all right, I’ll
give you silver, all right.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:39:00.860
But in such a sweet manner that you don’t
feel that Mother is giving us it.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:10.650
So there should be a feeling of giving at
the right time, at the best opportune moment,

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.920
to give something.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.900
That is also one thing, just like a cameraman
knows when to click, in the same way you must

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.640
know when to click when giving is concerned.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:36.870
When odd times if you give, it can be a very
hurting thing, the person can feel very hurt,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.830
if you give at the odd time to someone something.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:45.100
You have so many stories of that kind, like
Sudama’s is that thing, when he went to

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.500
see Shri Krishna.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:52.300
And Shri Krishna took out his procession,
in the procession there were just taking out

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.440
his bad eye with some pearls.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.810
So, Sudama said: “Let one pearl fall in
to my lap also."

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:00.810
He was very poor.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:07.970
But when he went back, he saw his house was
made of gold by Shri Krishna.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.110
It was such a surprise!

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.800
So that elevates the heart.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.650
So it should be elevating.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:25.830
It should not be sensational, but it should
be elevating, and that helps the person because,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:34.550
whatever you give for spiritual growth, is
the one that is the best thing that you can

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:40.500
give to anyone, even in material things.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:48.360
Even in material things, you give something
in for spiritual growth.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.500
There are so many ways, if you want to think
about it, of giving someone something that,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:59.370
spiritually, he feels comforted, he feels
happy and joyous.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:05.220
Then another hand [right] is like this.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:12.622
This hand is showing that you have to protect,
you have to protect.

00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:18.090
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis, well some of them
who are very superficial join hands with non

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:19.090
Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.550
Immediately, you can make out the fraternity.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:27.990
If I see one woman going with another woman
whom I know is a bhootish one, I know that

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:29.170
another must be.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.350
That’s how the combination always works.

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:40.170
There’s a fraternity of good Sahaja Yogis
and a fraternity of bad Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:46.460
So when you see this [right] hand is a protection
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.990
We all have to protect each other, nobody
should touch you.

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.790
Of course, I’m all the time worried about
your protection.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:42:00.390
If anybody comes and criticizes a Sahaja Yogi,
any one, he may be the Prime minister and

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:03.110
things, I’ll stand by the Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:07.420
I’ll go up to any court or anywhere and
I‘ll stand by that Sahaja Yogi.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.620
Even, he may be wrong, still I’ll I‘ll
stand by the Sahaja Yogi because his Spirit

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.780
is there.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.090
So we have to protect.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:22.170
We have to protect our children, we have to
protect our wives, we have to protect our

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:28.690
husbands, we have to protect anaraksha [unsure]
as they call it.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:34.900
Protect all the artists, protect all the people
who need protection in this world.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.930
So many people need protection from Sahaja
Yogis.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:44.200
Now see, the classical art is dying out, there
are having funny sort of modern art.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.540
I don’t mind if it is really modern in the
sense that they are evolved people and they

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.020
are producing something of a spiritual value.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.060
But one line like that [horizontal] and one
line like that [vertical] makes a drawing

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.060
or a painting.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.250
Don’t support such nonsense.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.870
Then poetry, which is wrong, should not be
supported.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:07.570
Or literature which is talking of filthy things,
ugly things, dirty things should never be

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:08.680
protected.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:15.520
But whatever is good, whatever is beautiful
produced, created by any one, even by a child,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.470
must be protected.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:25.080
Like a politician who is a honest politician
is a good politician who is benevolent, he

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.530
may not be a Sahaja Yogi, but he should be
protected.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.430
In your heart of hearts you should think:
“Mother, please protect this man."

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.460
You must have feelings for them.

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.710
So what we have to protect here is the goodness,
is the peace.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:45.960
That’s our duty, we have to protect.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.510
We should not say: “All right, why should
we care?

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.820
He is not a Sahaja Yogi."

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.130
No, but he is a good man.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:55.100
Whether he is a Sahaja Yogi or not doesn’t
matter, but he is a good man so we protect

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.840
him because of his virtues.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.890
You must protect a person who is virtuous,
it’s very important.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:08.380
For his virtuous sake, you must protect him.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:13.280
And you should not be only limited among yourselves,
Sahaja Yogis, you are the protectors of the

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.510
world!

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:19.630
You are the kings of the world, think like
that.

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:24.750
You have to worry about everything, what’s
happening here and what’s happening there.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:28.150
You must know every thing.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.630
So, some people say: “Mother says, don’t
see television."

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.690
I do not say like that, absolutely.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:40.010
What I was saying, you must see what is happening
in the world.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:43.930
But all the time glued to the television,
your eyes will be spoiled, and see all dirty,

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.220
filthy nonsense, there’s no need.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.520
Why should I tell you?

00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.100
You yourself will know.

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.850
But you must see things, you must be informed,
well informed, specially the ladies must be

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:56.300
very well informed.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.180
It’s very important, because what I found,
ladies in Sahaja Yoga, they come, they just

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.380
jump in the sea, finish there, that’s not
the way.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:10.240
You must learn how to swim, you must know
how to make others also to swim, protect them,

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.551
You must know every thing that’s going on
in this world where you are born.

00:45:13.551 --> 00:45:16.490
You’re not to be just excluded from there,
you must know everything.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:21.260
You ask Me, I’m a woman, I know everything
about every country, I know the problem.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.680
That’s how I can solve.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.930
In Colombia I went there, you know what has
happened now in Colombia.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:35.700
In Russia, everywhere, you have to put your
attention to all these things.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:43.180
Specially, the women must know they are shaktis
and they’re shaktis of love, of attention.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:52.490
So this protective speciality has to be with
us and we must know we are in charge.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.470
We are in charge of this world.

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.480
We are in charge of the whole humanity; we
have to look after them.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.950
We are not limited Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.760
We are unlimited.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.040
We are eternal beings.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.340
And take up that personality within yourself,
then only the Diwali is completed.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.780
You can’t have Diwali with something that
is short lived, you have to have something

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:19.310
that’s burning for ever.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:25.620
So this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga is that
you become really a great personality.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:31.080
But, it’s not the end of it.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.350
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told
you.

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:39.700
But once this Lakshmi principle covers you
up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:47.510
is that you think of the world as a great
challenge to you, that you have to give them

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.940
Mahlakshmi principle, that you have to give
them Realization.

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.930
You have to raise them up.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:47:02.050
And this principle, once starts working in
the Mahalaksmi principle, then all the problems

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.710
are your own.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.780
You have to start working it out.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:17.470
Change he attitude, is the best way I can
say towards all other things that we have

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.170
to solve the problem, we are here to solve
the problem.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:25.600
Like, I’ve seen, it’s a very commun thing,
somebody comes out with problem, I tell them:

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600
“Do this."

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.220
They’ll say: “But, in this this."

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.220
“Then do that."

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.520
“But in this, that."

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.810
Like that they go on all the loops, false
loops, until I’ll say: “Now this is your

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:35.810
problem, not Mine.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:41.600
I’m giving you hundred solutions and none
of them suits you."

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.600
But here you should know you are the one who
has to solve the problem.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:46.190
It is your problem.

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:47.312
The world is your problem.

00:47:47.312 --> 00:47:49.530
Why were you born at this time?

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:54.350
Why did you get your Realization and why are
you Sahaja yogis?

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.790
Just for name’s sake?

00:47:56.790 --> 00:48:02.840
So in every field you have to take a responsibility
to see what you can do.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.610
Supposing you are an architect, all right,
have designs made!

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:09.440
Create designs, just try.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.970
I’ll help you.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.010
You are a musician?

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:18.250
Then take up ways and methods of spreading
good music.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:23.540
If you are writer then write something interesting,
not boring, something interesting, something

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.260
which will elevate people.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:32.680
If you are a government servant, all right,
try to show that you are acting for the government

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.100
that is of a much higher level.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:39.300
And such a person will be respected, very
much respected.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.860
Everybody’s personality will grow, not that
you run away from somewhere because most of

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.400
the people say that: “Mother, we get caught
up, this, that, you know."

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.750
It depends on.

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:54.710
Now I told you that I have to sometimes shake
hands with six hundred people who are sometimes

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:56.160
absolutely drunk.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:02.030
So it’s all right; that’s My job.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:06.341
So we are not going to run away.

00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:10.520
We are covered with the protection of the
spirituality.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:19.940
If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna
nobody can touch you.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:28.240
So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you
get all the tatwas, all the principles, satisfied

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:35.170
in you, fully, and also the Mahalakshmi principle
flows through your being.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:40.760
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable
people.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.370
Not to find faults.

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:49.370
If you are finding faults, then know that
you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:53.600
If you are trying to control others, then
know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:58.510
Even the leaders, I would say, should never
try to control.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:04.130
They must know how the principle is working
in the silence; see for themselves how it

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:05.580
is working.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:11.100
It’s a trick you must learn.

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.300
Of course, little correction is needed.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.720
That time you correct the person, at that
time, doesn’t matter.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:23.410
But you must know how the whole principle
of benevolence is working itself.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:28.410
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence
part; you must know that.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:37.510
As I’ve told you before also, you have to
be like the sea which receives all the rivers

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:38.510
into it.

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.710
If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive
anything.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:50.100
So you have to be like a sea to receive everything
and you have to be at the height.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:57.720
As I told you the other day, the same way,
that very close to the sea there should be

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.820
a personality which is above everything else.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:06.030
Such a beautiful personality you should have,
is the depth of the sea and the height of

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.030
the Kailasha.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.460
May God bless you all.
