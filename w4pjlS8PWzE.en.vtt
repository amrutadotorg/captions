WEBVTT

00:56.120 --> 01:02.650
Yesterday was such a nice time we had together,
and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think.

01:02.650 --> 01:14.409
I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely
going in a tempest.

01:14.409 --> 01:23.770
We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja,
I think, only yesterday: it’s to feel the

01:23.770 --> 01:26.290
joy of God’s love.

01:26.290 --> 01:45.200
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali”
means the “rows of lights”.

01:45.200 --> 01:59.540
It was celebrated firstly because thousands
of years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this

01:59.540 --> 02:00.869
day.

02:00.869 --> 02:11.900
That means the benevolence of human beings
was crowned, was accepted.

02:11.900 --> 02:26.040
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal
personality being shown to be a king, to be

02:26.040 --> 02:35.840
the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

02:35.840 --> 02:44.290
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent
king was crowned.

02:44.290 --> 02:51.569
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

02:51.569 --> 03:10.609
That’s only possible if
the people who choose the king have no other

03:10.609 --> 03:22.280
consideration but that of benevolence of all
the people.

03:22.280 --> 03:32.840
So one has to come to the conclusion that
they have to be Sahaja Yogis, because other

03:32.840 --> 03:39.150
think that: “How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

03:39.150 --> 03:43.590
Some think: “How much power-oriented we
could be?”

03:43.590 --> 03:55.609
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”
or any other domination.

03:55.609 --> 04:01.139
So we’ve got two types of theories: as we
see, is one is communism and another is democracy,

04:01.139 --> 04:08.480
where one is power-oriented, the another is
money-oriented, and in both the cases we say

04:08.480 --> 04:10.689
that it’s all failed.

04:10.689 --> 04:18.690
And it’s a good news for all of you to know
that Russia, which was a country known to

04:18.690 --> 04:28.690
be run in complete fear, has turned out to
be the best for Sahaja Yoga.

04:28.690 --> 04:32.900
It is one of the super powers.

04:32.900 --> 04:47.240
When the government is like that, I think
the people are better.

04:47.240 --> 04:54.720
They do not have these false notions of individual
freedom.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.360
They do not think that: “Ah, what’s wrong?”

04:58.360 --> 05:02.960
I told them: “You must put oil on in your
head because you’ll become bald."

05:02.960 --> 05:07.590
Next day all of them were done with the oil,
nothing doing.

05:07.590 --> 05:20.800
So the kind of obedience they had, from very
beginning of their country, that sense of

05:20.800 --> 05:26.530
obedience is so great, you tell them anything,
immediately they do it.

05:26.530 --> 05:30.940
Not one, thousands.

05:30.940 --> 05:35.900
One thousand were sitting in the hall; two
thousand were outside waiting for Me, on a

05:35.900 --> 05:39.190
follow-on.

05:39.190 --> 05:41.810
Imagine how wise and deep they are?

05:41.810 --> 05:47.690
While in the West we are lost in our so-called
freedom idea of so-called freedom: “What’s

05:47.690 --> 05:48.690
wrong?”

05:48.690 --> 05:52.740
But actually we are slaves, if you see.

05:52.740 --> 05:57.920
Any fashion that starts, everybody starts
doing it.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.520
But why?

05:59.520 --> 06:01.379
Why do we follow those fashions?

06:01.379 --> 06:03.689
We must see how we are slaves.

06:03.689 --> 06:06.849
Because others will laugh at us if we don’t
do like that.

06:06.849 --> 06:08.700
They’ll make fun of us.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.419
Because they will criticize us.

06:11.419 --> 06:18.370
So because they have got a freedom to criticize,
we are frightened of such people who can criticize.

06:18.370 --> 06:23.750
And now the criticizing people are criticizing
them.

06:23.750 --> 06:28.500
Critics have critics, their critics are there,
there are other critics, and there are critics

06:28.500 --> 06:29.539
after critics.

06:29.539 --> 06:31.220
So only the critics are produced.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.289
Where is the benevolence?

06:32.289 --> 06:35.199
There’s no question of benevolence at all.

06:35.199 --> 06:47.669
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed
to be free, the idea of benevolence is finished.

06:47.669 --> 06:53.610
Because whatever good for you, whatever is
benevolent for you, can be only understood

06:53.610 --> 06:56.699
if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

06:56.699 --> 07:02.340
But if you have this kind of freedom is to
go amuck, do what you like: “Because everybody’s

07:02.340 --> 07:05.270
doing it, I must do it.

07:05.270 --> 07:10.199
Everybody is singing like this; so I must
do it."

07:10.199 --> 07:15.629
But from where does this idea come in?

07:15.629 --> 07:22.211
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs
who want to befool you, make slaves out of

07:22.211 --> 07:27.889
you, and this slavery is so-called freedom
for you.

07:27.889 --> 07:33.060
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery
because you do what they tell you, behave

07:33.060 --> 07:37.639
in the same manner as whatever they say.

07:37.639 --> 07:42.500
There are no fashions in that country, very
few, very few women indulge into fashions.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
Nothing.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.810
And men are also very simple.

07:44.810 --> 07:48.370
They have no fashionable things.

07:48.370 --> 07:55.270
They have only things which are convenient,
good for their climate.

07:55.270 --> 08:01.750
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh
or don’t laugh.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.699
It’s everybody laughs here.

08:04.699 --> 08:11.349
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This
is stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him,

08:11.349 --> 08:12.419
that’s all."

08:12.419 --> 08:21.440
So one has to understand that it was the king,
Rama, who was made the, actually accepted

08:21.440 --> 08:29.389
by the public, like a crown was put on his
head to say that benevolence is the highest

08:29.389 --> 08:30.389
thing.

08:30.389 --> 08:39.090
And whatever is benevolent for us should be
accepted in our freedom, if we are really

08:39.090 --> 08:41.880
a free country.

08:41.880 --> 08:47.810
But if we are not free inside, we are bound
by what people will say; they’ll criticize

08:47.810 --> 08:48.810
us.

08:48.810 --> 08:53.820
Do you know as a result of that, there is
no art in this country [Italy]?

08:53.820 --> 08:57.470
But I saw lot of art growing in Russia.

08:57.470 --> 09:05.230
Because any art you produce is criticized,
so people have to be careful: “This should

09:05.230 --> 09:08.610
not be so much, little this, little that."

09:08.610 --> 09:11.070
Nobody can produce any art there.

09:11.070 --> 09:16.050
Any musician is there is criticized in these
countries.

09:16.050 --> 09:20.200
There if you go, the musicians are tremendous
musicians.

09:20.200 --> 09:29.510
They have of a very high quality musicians
there, very high quality of dramatist, not

09:29.510 --> 09:31.480
at all boring as they are here.

09:31.480 --> 09:39.720
If you go any play in England, it’s so boring
that you feel like running away from there,

09:39.720 --> 09:42.440
extremely boring.

09:42.440 --> 09:47.170
There was a play, we went to see, it was called
as “Star Express” or “Express Star”

09:47.170 --> 09:48.170
or something.

09:48.170 --> 09:52.660
There was nothing, except on the wheels they
were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar.

09:52.660 --> 09:58.290
Nothing there ! So anybody would go mad with
it, I tell you.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.130
We were there hardly for fifteen minutes,
came out with a headache.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.870
We didn’t know where to go.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.790
So with this kind of criticism that we have,
it’s only freedom we have is to criticize

10:07.790 --> 10:11.620
other, make fun of others, react to others.

10:11.620 --> 10:19.880
How can you enjoy?

10:19.880 --> 10:25.880
To enjoy others first of all you must accept
the goodness of other people, not mentally,

10:25.880 --> 10:27.889
from your heart.

10:27.889 --> 10:37.110
And that will bring the benevolence on this
country of ours which we call the Kingdom

10:37.110 --> 10:41.399
of God.

10:41.399 --> 10:51.209
Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura
was killed.

10:51.209 --> 11:03.170
Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil
from the Hell, they say: very cunning, very

11:03.170 --> 11:08.750
clever, and he was killed by the Goddess.

11:08.750 --> 11:19.709
Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation,
Kartikeya, but Goddess gave Him the power

11:19.709 --> 11:21.320
to kill.

11:21.320 --> 11:28.740
So when he was killed it was celebrated because
the evil was killed, but we don’t find that,

11:28.740 --> 11:35.500
these days the evil people are getting peace
awards.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.880
So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted
brain?

11:40.880 --> 11:44.740
How is it they are using perversion?

11:44.740 --> 11:48.510
Just the opposite of it.

11:48.510 --> 11:57.930
What has worked out these things, so again
we find the same so-called freedom to become

11:57.930 --> 12:02.779
also evil.

12:02.779 --> 12:05.240
So we have freedom to become evil.

12:05.240 --> 12:14.199
First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent,
and secondly to become evil we have freedom.

12:14.199 --> 12:20.600
So the Narakasura within us must be killed,
the one which teaches us evil, to do evil

12:20.600 --> 12:21.860
to others.

12:21.860 --> 12:28.339
If you are busy doing evil to others, you
can never enjoy.

12:28.339 --> 12:35.209
Because you enjoy doing evil to others.

12:35.209 --> 12:39.420
So that has to be faced within ourselves,
not in other people.

12:39.420 --> 12:46.990
It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi
is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that,

12:46.990 --> 12:49.320
but very difficult to say: “Mother, I am
caught up.

12:49.320 --> 12:54.519
I have got this problem within myself."

12:54.519 --> 12:58.699
So when you start seeing yourself your heart
opens out.

12:58.699 --> 13:04.940
Unless and until you learn how to open out
your heart how can you enjoy?

13:04.940 --> 13:07.800
Open your heart.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.329
Many people live on very superficial level.

13:10.329 --> 13:13.960
All right, some of them might say that: “I
am possessed, Mother.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.730
I’ve got this possession."

13:15.730 --> 13:16.730
Why?

13:16.730 --> 13:20.230
“I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning."

13:20.230 --> 13:21.430
But why?

13:21.430 --> 13:26.990
You don’t want to enjoy.

13:26.990 --> 13:29.300
So watch yourself, see for yourself.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.610
This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll
put you right."

13:31.610 --> 13:32.610
See in the mirror.

13:32.610 --> 13:37.079
Tell yourself: “This kind of a useless conditioning
I’ve got it from where?

13:37.079 --> 13:39.860
Because I’m Indian, because I’m French,
because of English."

13:39.860 --> 13:45.850
Open the heart.

13:45.850 --> 13:51.750
And opening the heart is only possible if
Narakasura sitting on your heart is killed,

13:51.750 --> 13:54.550
finished, once for all.

13:54.550 --> 14:00.839
In small, small things there is joy.

14:00.839 --> 14:06.190
In very little things also there’s a ripple
of joy.

14:06.190 --> 14:09.020
If you are sensitive you can catch it.

14:09.020 --> 14:11.410
And why not enjoy?

14:11.410 --> 14:20.360
Why to have these stupid conditioning on our
heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy?

14:20.360 --> 14:27.029
Enjoyment is only possible if you take out
this one sitting on your heart.

14:27.029 --> 14:36.399
So, that is the second part of the Diwali
that you have to open your heart.

14:36.399 --> 14:41.940
Forget your nationality, forget your race,
forget everything.

14:41.940 --> 14:45.590
It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis
have.

14:45.590 --> 14:52.459
They must be respected, they must be treated
like this, or maybe that we are something

14:52.459 --> 14:54.870
great and they are no good.

14:54.870 --> 15:01.459
If you cannot mix up with the collective,
something’s wrong with you.

15:01.459 --> 15:02.459
Nothing wrong with others.

15:02.459 --> 15:07.529
Easy to find faults with others.

15:07.529 --> 15:08.690
But what’s the use?

15:08.690 --> 15:13.100
If you start finding faults with others you
do not become clean.

15:13.100 --> 15:17.100
Supposing I find that your clothes are not
clean.

15:17.100 --> 15:21.610
My clothes are not going to get clean by that,
are they?

15:21.610 --> 15:27.470
It’s so practical and simple it is that
we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with

15:27.470 --> 15:35.870
us, and improve ourselves, so that we can
really, really, from our heart, enjoy.

15:35.870 --> 15:42.220
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the
Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi.

15:42.220 --> 15:47.279
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of
Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

15:47.279 --> 15:53.790
And it was so that She came out of the water.

15:53.790 --> 16:03.029
Through the water, She came out so clean.

16:03.029 --> 16:13.660
And She has no pride.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.610
She doesn’t assert Herself.

16:15.610 --> 16:19.810
She doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

16:19.810 --> 16:25.259
But human beings are just opposite if they
have money, they ride on a horse all the time,

16:25.259 --> 16:26.670
they cannot come down.

16:26.670 --> 16:31.370
It’s impossible to talk to them.

16:31.370 --> 16:39.870
So a person who has money is not the one who
is worshipping Lakshmi, who is not a “Lakshmi

16:39.870 --> 16:42.790
pati” as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.509
Because She stands only on a lotus.

16:44.509 --> 16:47.880
Can you imagine how light She must be to stand
on a lotus?

16:47.880 --> 16:52.649
She has a big body, everything is there, but
She stands on a lotus.

16:52.649 --> 16:58.980
That She takes all Her weight within Herself,
She just sucks in Her weight as Shri Krishna

16:58.980 --> 17:00.160
has described.

17:00.160 --> 17:06.910
That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside
his body, in the same way, we have to suck

17:06.910 --> 17:18.450
in all the weight of money, weight of your
positions, weight of your so-called education,

17:18.450 --> 17:24.839
weight of some aristocratic family you are
born of.

17:24.839 --> 17:36.610
This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy
person, to go down very fast.

17:36.610 --> 17:42.390
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the
lotus.

17:42.390 --> 17:50.390
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,
that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the

17:50.390 --> 17:52.810
lotus, nothing.

17:52.810 --> 17:57.340
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

17:57.340 --> 18:01.550
Unless and until you have balance you cannot
stand on a lotus.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.559
So She is so balanced.

18:03.559 --> 18:09.600
Her center of gravity is so balanced that
She cannot topple down.

18:09.600 --> 18:15.630
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them:
“How are you?”

18:15.630 --> 18:21.720
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means just
ok] Ten years have passed, sometimes like

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
this also.

18:22.720 --> 18:27.600
[Shri Mataji mimes a sign that means you are
up side down]

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
[Laughter]
Why?

18:28.600 --> 18:35.990
Because you must be grounded in the Mother
Earth, into the practical side of it.

18:35.990 --> 18:44.100
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging
in the air, but we are grounded in the Mother

18:44.100 --> 18:46.350
Earth.

18:46.350 --> 18:54.470
And the slightest thing happens to us, again
we come back to our balance.

18:54.470 --> 18:58.919
So this is Her position when She stands up
in a lotus.

18:58.919 --> 19:04.480
Now She has a hand, one hand like this [which
gives], one hand like this [which protects],

19:04.480 --> 19:08.049
and there are two hands which have got again
the lotuses, the pink ones.

19:08.049 --> 19:14.010
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is Her fragrance
I think is spread on the sky.

19:14.010 --> 19:28.470
And She is pink, pink because that shows that
Her house, Her nature is pink, pink is inviting,

19:28.470 --> 19:30.640
is loving.

19:30.640 --> 19:42.080
She is a very fond hostess, that She wants
everybody to come in, in Her house.

19:42.080 --> 19:49.010
But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten
dogs outside and nobody can come inside the

19:49.010 --> 19:50.550
house.

19:50.550 --> 19:53.980
Only the dogs and he lives.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.840
He can’t live with human beings.

19:56.840 --> 20:04.230
So the house is closed, the doors are closed,
everything’s closed, money is closed permanently.

20:04.230 --> 20:12.039
So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi
pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati.

20:12.039 --> 20:19.750
Because he must have a cozy, beautiful – cozy,
again I say, cozy house.

20:19.750 --> 20:26.270
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital,
anything drops, you feel frightened: “Oh,

20:26.270 --> 20:27.360
my God."

20:27.360 --> 20:30.080
Then you’ll pick it up.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.950
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable.

20:32.950 --> 20:38.840
It’s all right, in the house, in the home,
if somebody comes and stays.

20:38.840 --> 20:43.010
Then it’s little bit this here and there,
doesn’t matter, then you put it right, but

20:43.010 --> 20:45.799
that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

20:45.799 --> 20:52.210
It should not be taken as a lousy house, but
a house which is inviting.

20:52.210 --> 20:58.000
When people come in, you give them a place
to sit down and make them enjoy.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.140
It’s not done, in India at least.

21:00.140 --> 21:05.050
I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting
westernized, that anybody drops something

21:05.050 --> 21:09.830
on the carpet we’ll never clean it in their
presence because it’s very bad manners.

21:09.830 --> 21:13.970
Carpet is not important than the guest, is
it?

21:13.970 --> 21:21.540
Or if we break something, say, a glass, then
we say: “Very good, it’s something has

21:21.540 --> 21:22.540
gone out, some bad thing has gone out."

21:22.540 --> 21:29.179
Or a thermometer is broken we say the same
thing.

21:29.179 --> 21:44.970
All these things happen, in a way, just to
see how far we are open-hearted or to suggest

21:44.970 --> 21:49.490
to you that something is going wrong.

21:49.490 --> 21:54.940
If something falls off just see what’s going
on in your brain.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.120
What are you thinking?

21:56.120 --> 22:01.982
Is there something funny you are thinking
about somebody or something wrong you are

22:01.982 --> 22:02.982
thinking?

22:02.982 --> 22:05.820
Then it’s up to you.

22:05.820 --> 22:09.810
Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth.

22:09.810 --> 22:15.510
So, another conditioning we have, which is
a very, very funny conditioning, either we’ll

22:15.510 --> 22:23.350
have the lousiest of lousiest houses or we’ll
have houses which will just look like hospitals,

22:23.350 --> 22:27.250
even a rat would not enter there, leave alone
human beings.

22:27.250 --> 22:31.620
They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll
polish everything.

22:31.620 --> 22:34.860
Husband, wife will fight on that.

22:34.860 --> 22:38.529
They’ll have divorces for it.

22:38.529 --> 22:40.909
But not even a rat will enter that house.

22:40.909 --> 22:43.650
I have seen many houses like that.

22:43.650 --> 22:47.950
And I’ve seen the other way round also:
those that are lousiest, where there’s no

22:47.950 --> 22:52.570
garden, there are no flowers, nothing beautiful.

22:52.570 --> 23:03.760
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that
extreme, but something that will give joy

23:03.760 --> 23:09.240
to others, to visitors, to people who come
to your house, we’ll soothe the sick.

23:09.240 --> 23:14.220
People should feel happy to come to your house.

23:14.220 --> 23:19.970
So there’s no showing off.

23:19.970 --> 23:27.120
Not to show off but to make them comfortable
and very happy.

23:27.120 --> 23:32.620
You can do lots of things, very interesting
things, if you have the Lakshmi principle

23:32.620 --> 23:33.620
in you.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.740
I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman.

23:35.740 --> 23:41.049
He had a very beautiful house, everything,
and he was so interesting.

23:41.049 --> 23:45.820
He had made the house very interestingly,
very nice, very beautiful.

23:45.820 --> 23:50.799
And you didn’t feel any aggression at all
in that house.

23:50.799 --> 24:00.260
So, I saw his dining room done with very good,
beautiful, green marble and white lights.

24:00.260 --> 24:04.230
I said: “Must be quite expensive."

24:04.230 --> 24:05.520
“No, that’s the beauty.

24:05.520 --> 24:06.520
It’s very cheap.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.520
You know how I did it cheaply."

24:07.520 --> 24:14.529
All the time he was telling Me how he did
things cheaply, means he has never shown off

24:14.529 --> 24:15.529
it’s expensive.

24:15.529 --> 24:19.159
But a person who’s aggressive will say:
“Oh, you know, this one I got it for so

24:19.159 --> 24:22.110
much, so much, so much."

24:22.110 --> 24:25.960
But a person who wants to give you joy will
say: “No, I tell you it’s so cheap, you

24:25.960 --> 24:28.690
won’t believe what a sum."

24:28.690 --> 24:34.510
That’s the sign of a person who wants to
give joy to his guests.

24:34.510 --> 24:40.279
He’ll never try to say that: “It’s very
expensive, I spent so much money, this is

24:40.279 --> 24:41.650
so, this that."

24:41.650 --> 24:44.350
This is showing off.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.770
And then ultimately you’d say: “It’s
very good,” three times.

24:46.770 --> 24:47.929
“Then it’s yours.

24:47.929 --> 24:48.929
Have it."

24:48.929 --> 24:49.929
Of course he can’t give you the floor.

24:49.929 --> 24:54.090
The rest of it you can take.

24:54.090 --> 24:59.600
That’s, that’s what it is a personality
which is joy-giving.

24:59.600 --> 25:09.590
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also,
a beetle comes, a black beetle with horrible

25:09.590 --> 25:17.710
thorny legs, and enters into this lotus for
a sleeping in the night, you see.

25:17.710 --> 25:25.360
And the lotus closes down its cosiness on
it and sleeps very comfortably.

25:25.360 --> 25:30.399
And then next day it opens out, so it flies
out.

25:30.399 --> 25:37.820
That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your
hearts should be.

25:37.820 --> 25:46.970
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing
and that comforting feeling, when they are

25:46.970 --> 25:48.890
in your company.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.710
But not a person who was reactionary.

25:50.710 --> 25:55.320
Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately
say: “I don’t like this carpet."

25:55.320 --> 26:01.830
See, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners
to say like that, to say that: “I don’t

26:01.830 --> 26:05.830
like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja
Yoga.

26:05.830 --> 26:11.220
Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician
who could be of a very high level, could be

26:11.220 --> 26:17.480
of a very ordinary level, you should be able
to enjoy everything; otherwise you are not

26:17.480 --> 26:18.980
a Sahaja Yogi.

26:18.980 --> 26:23.409
If you are going to criticize a musician that:
“Oh, God, what a musician.

26:23.409 --> 26:27.660
He’s no good this, that” then he’s not
going to improve.

26:27.660 --> 26:33.230
But if you encourage the musician: “Oh,
you are very good.

26:33.230 --> 26:35.830
You are very great,” he’ll play much better
next time; you’ll see that.

26:35.830 --> 26:40.149
There’s no falsehood about it.

26:40.149 --> 26:44.070
Some people think it’s not honest.

26:44.070 --> 26:52.970
But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal
kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga.

26:52.970 --> 26:54.820
You be honest to yourself.

26:54.820 --> 27:01.190
And there’s no need to tell anybody your
opinion very honestly.

27:01.190 --> 27:06.600
Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions,
and direct towards yourself.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.970
Like you see somebody.

27:07.970 --> 27:13.309
Now, honestly you want to tell him that he
is wearing a funny dress, honestly.

27:13.309 --> 27:21.550
You better look at yourself, what sort of
a dress you are wearing.

27:21.550 --> 27:24.600
And what business you have got to tell him
that he’s wearing funny?

27:24.600 --> 27:26.110
On the contrary, you say: “This is very
nice.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.110
I like it.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.110
It’s very nice.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.110
It’s good, good.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.110
Nice one."

27:30.110 --> 27:32.610
They’ll say: “No ” But he’ll say that:
“No, not so good.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.610
Yours is nice."

27:33.610 --> 27:36.240
“Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you
see, very cheaply.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.570
I’ll tell you from where.

27:37.570 --> 27:38.660
And you can have it if you like.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.120
I can take yours.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.980
You take mine."

27:41.980 --> 27:51.309
So the basic, subtle point is that, that with
your love, you are encouraging everyone, you

27:51.309 --> 28:03.330
are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence
in him, [in] his personality and a kind of

28:03.330 --> 28:06.570
a rapport which is very subtle.

28:06.570 --> 28:17.549
So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is
so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything,

28:17.549 --> 28:21.760
like as we see the world is today.

28:21.760 --> 28:28.100
But the lotus covers with his fragrance the
whole of that pond and covers it up completely

28:28.100 --> 28:30.539
and you forget the thing what is behind.

28:30.539 --> 28:36.559
It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves,
you see, like the ears of the elephant and

28:36.559 --> 28:39.350
that covers the whole thing.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.870
So you don’t see any filth or dirt.

28:40.870 --> 28:44.929
What you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves.

28:44.929 --> 28:50.980
Sometimes they are like a “tali”[plate],
like a big tali that we use for eating.

28:50.980 --> 28:57.580
And then all these things are covered with
you.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.750
There’s no honesty about it.

28:59.750 --> 29:07.149
They could say: “Why should we be honest,
let such say all the worms and the filth growing

29:07.149 --> 29:08.149
about?”

29:08.149 --> 29:17.529
But the honesty lies in honestly understanding
what is your job as Sahaja Yogi is.

29:17.529 --> 29:26.039
You are not there to point out the bad points
but you are there to cover all the bad points,

29:26.039 --> 29:28.700
all the loopholes, with your love.

29:28.700 --> 29:35.149
That’s your job, and there you have to be
honest.

29:35.149 --> 29:41.940
Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these
days, it has created only cheats and thugs

29:41.940 --> 29:47.070
and thieves.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.440
Even a thief can be won over.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.950
You can.

29:50.950 --> 29:53.620
I’ll give you an example.

29:53.620 --> 29:56.490
I met one boy in Delhi market.

29:56.490 --> 30:01.100
Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering
so I brought him in the car home.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.340
So in the family, My brother and My husband
both got very worried.

30:04.340 --> 30:06.840
He said: “Who is this brother-in-law you
have brought in?”

30:06.840 --> 30:08.580
I said: “He is My nephew.

30:08.580 --> 30:10.020
All right, let it be.

30:10.020 --> 30:12.340
Doesn’t matter, whatever you say, I’ll
keep him."

30:12.340 --> 30:13.760
So I looked after him.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.090
I treated him.

30:15.090 --> 30:16.860
He got all right.

30:16.860 --> 30:20.630
These two persons got after him: “We could
send him to the police, send him to the police,

30:20.630 --> 30:21.630
this.

30:21.630 --> 30:25.679
I said: “Let’s try now, let us see, he’s
a good man, he’ll be all right."

30:25.679 --> 30:26.679
“No, send him to the police."

30:26.679 --> 30:30.470
Might have been, I don’t know, might have
been.

30:30.470 --> 30:35.960
And they were after his life; till ten days
he was all right, I soothed him down.

30:35.960 --> 30:40.870
After tenth day, he was so fed up with these
two persons, he ran away.

30:40.870 --> 30:44.210
And he ran away, and he ran away with what,
do you know?

30:44.210 --> 30:50.720
He ran away with all the things that belonged
to My brother and My husband.

30:50.720 --> 30:54.610
And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything
nicely.

30:54.610 --> 31:00.130
[Laughter] He didn’t touch that; he didn’t
touch that.

31:00.130 --> 31:05.269
Shri Mataji to someone: Hello, see when I
am talking, don’t talk to each other.

31:05.269 --> 31:06.780
This is a new Sahaja Yogi?

31:06.780 --> 31:08.700
Tell him not to talk.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.800
When I’m talking don’t talk.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.380
That’s not the way.

31:13.380 --> 31:16.210
So he just ran away.

31:16.210 --> 31:20.120
And imagine, he left – I had a necklace,
a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace,

31:20.120 --> 31:24.049
I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t
touch it.

31:24.049 --> 31:30.080
He didn’t touch anything and he took away
whatever was possible from their purse, from

31:30.080 --> 31:34.100
their things, whatever were left, everything
he took away.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.100
“Now,” I said, “now go to the police."

31:37.100 --> 31:40.230
[Laughter] “Fine.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.790
What?”

31:41.790 --> 31:50.669
So, this is how one has to know that the honesty
is for yourself, not for others.

31:50.669 --> 31:54.150
Don’t try to be honest with others.

31:54.150 --> 31:56.700
Be honest to yourself.

31:56.700 --> 32:01.889
Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe
it’s rational and maybe that it is just

32:01.889 --> 32:06.360
a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt
others.

32:06.360 --> 32:11.000
So first check on your mind and find out if
you are trying to hurt others or you are trying

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
to please others.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.010
Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet.

32:15.010 --> 32:20.750
If you are going to say something to please
others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk.

32:20.750 --> 32:29.140
And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice
things to others, how niceness comes to you.

32:29.140 --> 32:33.110
Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me
that: “Mother, he is very bad.

32:33.110 --> 32:37.269
He has troubled me so much, this thing, that
thing.

32:37.269 --> 32:39.990
I don’t like him,” so I tell him: “No,
no, he was praising you a lot."

32:39.990 --> 32:43.720
It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.120
“He was praising you.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.639
He was so much in love with you.

32:46.639 --> 32:47.649
He’s so kind to you.

32:47.649 --> 32:49.929
He was telling Me he loves you very much."

32:49.929 --> 32:50.940
He said: “Really?”

32:50.940 --> 32:52.460
“Yeah, he did say."

32:52.460 --> 33:00.059
Next day you find them going together.

33:00.059 --> 33:05.200
So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s
very little, is left out, very little here

33:05.200 --> 33:06.200
and there.

33:06.200 --> 33:11.870
And some of them are really very superficial
but most of you have very little things left

33:11.870 --> 33:13.210
here and there.

33:13.210 --> 33:18.510
And only if you can watch that part you can
throw it away and you can really become very

33:18.510 --> 33:24.750
joyous people.

33:24.750 --> 33:34.850
Now there are some people who never smile,
who never laugh.

33:34.850 --> 33:37.500
So then you are allowed to tickle them.

33:37.500 --> 33:41.420
[Laughter] It’s absurd.

33:41.420 --> 33:50.159
It’s said that you have to be like children;
you have to be like children.

33:50.159 --> 33:52.860
You play with something, finished; then you
play with another, finished.

33:52.860 --> 33:53.860
You don’t get involved into anything.

33:53.860 --> 33:56.940
You don’t get attached to anything.

33:56.940 --> 34:02.679
Unless and until you’ve that child-like
heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

34:02.679 --> 34:03.679
It’s useless.

34:03.679 --> 34:09.000
You will be here for years together; you will
be useless, absolutely.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.520
Specially if you are coming from false gurus,
it’s very difficult.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.460
Because what I have known of false gurus,
they never laugh, never smile.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.800
They are very serious.

34:16.800 --> 34:20.130
Only take your money, keep on the backside.

34:20.130 --> 34:33.429
So it is important that we should be in a
very joyous mood, alert, aware, enjoying every

34:33.429 --> 34:35.180
bit of it.

34:35.180 --> 34:39.270
That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles
is.

34:39.270 --> 34:45.701
Now another thing is that, the suggestion
is of the left hand is like this, means She

34:45.701 --> 34:46.899
is giving.

34:46.899 --> 34:54.960
A person who has money must give, not to the
Pope, I never mean that, but must give to

34:54.960 --> 34:56.650
somebody who needs it.

34:56.650 --> 35:02.820
But so secretly that this [right] hand should
not know, is so far away, this one [right

35:02.820 --> 35:03.820
hand is up].

35:03.820 --> 35:06.090
This [left] hand should give, just secretly.

35:06.090 --> 35:08.100
Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to
anyone.

35:08.100 --> 35:13.380
I find it difficult, because I find it that
people will not like it.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.730
So there is a way of giving.

35:14.730 --> 35:18.470
There are so sweet ways of giving.

35:18.470 --> 35:23.310
Just try to notice what that person likes.

35:23.310 --> 35:27.930
Sometimes even children understand.

35:27.930 --> 35:30.440
Like I know, of My granddaughter.

35:30.440 --> 35:36.770
She said: “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even
have any good chappels.

35:36.770 --> 35:37.860
I feel so bad about it.

35:37.860 --> 35:38.860
But how to give him?

35:38.860 --> 35:40.370
He will not take money from me."

35:40.370 --> 35:42.640
So I said: “You do one thing.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.840
You go and do something to his chappel."

35:45.840 --> 35:49.360
So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels
more, you see.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.020
When they were walking together it broke.

35:51.020 --> 35:54.850
So she said: “Ah, see now, the chappels
are broken."

35:54.850 --> 35:56.200
She took him to a chappel shop and bought
him a chappel.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.460
He said: “But I have no money."

35:58.460 --> 35:59.830
“No, just take it.

35:59.830 --> 36:00.830
Just take it.

36:00.830 --> 36:01.830
It’s all right.

36:01.830 --> 36:05.190
Just, I’ll be very happy if you take."

36:05.190 --> 36:06.410
That’s how!

36:06.410 --> 36:12.680
It’s so sweet to hear and to do it, how
beautiful it must be!

36:12.680 --> 36:20.030
We like to hear everything, we want to see
in a film everything good, in a television,

36:20.030 --> 36:24.430
but when it comes to us we are different.

36:24.430 --> 36:30.400
When we see a mother-in-law torturing her
daughter-in-law, we always say: “Oh, look

36:30.400 --> 36:31.670
at her, how cruel she is."

36:31.670 --> 36:35.940
But we don’t want to see we are the same.

36:35.940 --> 36:39.990
So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.400
Out of question!

36:42.400 --> 36:48.590
Nobody has to be cruel to anyone, nobody has
right to be cruel, whether they are leaders

36:48.590 --> 36:56.300
or non-leaders or anything they are, you have
no business anyway to be cruel to anyone,

36:56.300 --> 36:57.810
hurting anyone.

36:57.810 --> 37:02.280
We are not daggers, we are lotuses.

37:02.280 --> 37:09.360
Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with
a lotus.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.000
It’s such a delicate thing.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.800
But it can be only understood if you go deep
into it, into Sahaja Yoga, otherwise it cannot

37:17.800 --> 37:21.420
be understood.

37:21.420 --> 37:24.860
Now, a saint is a saint.

37:24.860 --> 37:27.860
He cannot become cruel, he cannot.

37:27.860 --> 37:29.560
There’s no need.

37:29.560 --> 37:36.600
What is the need to be cruel?

37:36.600 --> 37:41.370
So then with one hand there should be “daana”
[donation], means “giving”.

37:41.370 --> 37:44.720
Giving in a way that is secret.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.010
There’s no need to give Me anything.

37:46.010 --> 37:47.470
I’ve been telling you: “Don’t give Me
anything."

37:47.470 --> 37:48.470
I don’t want to take anything.

37:48.470 --> 37:51.510
If you give Me anything, gold and silver,
I’ll leave it here.

37:51.510 --> 37:53.020
I cannot take it.

37:53.020 --> 38:00.070
The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t
appreciate that you are loving Me, this thing,

38:00.070 --> 38:04.750
but a flower is sufficient for Me.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.590
But a person who needs something you must
give.

38:07.590 --> 38:14.080
I’m so self-contained, you know that very
well, that I can live anywhere, I can live

38:14.080 --> 38:18.920
on the street, I can live anywhere, I have
no problem, I can do without food, no problem.

38:18.920 --> 38:24.760
All right, in adoration you want to give Me
something, but I’ve been telling that: “Don’t

38:24.760 --> 38:25.760
give Me.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.770
If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll
leave it here.

38:27.770 --> 38:29.810
I will not take it."

38:29.810 --> 38:38.360
And we have now passed a law or regulation,
everything, but I hope you’ll listen to

38:38.360 --> 38:39.820
Me.

38:39.820 --> 38:47.820
So what is needed is the thing that we should
know what is the dearth of another person,

38:47.820 --> 38:48.820
what will he need?

38:48.820 --> 38:54.390
You need silver for Puja, all right, I’ll
give you silver, all right.

38:54.390 --> 39:00.860
But in such a sweet manner that you don’t
feel that Mother is giving us it.

39:00.860 --> 39:10.650
So there should be a feeling of giving at
the right time, at the best opportune moment,

39:10.650 --> 39:13.920
to give something.

39:13.920 --> 39:18.900
That is also one thing, just like a cameraman
knows when to click, in the same way you must

39:18.900 --> 39:21.640
know when to click when giving is concerned.

39:21.640 --> 39:36.870
When odd times if you give, it can be a very
hurting thing, the person can feel very hurt,

39:36.870 --> 39:39.830
if you give at the odd time to someone something.

39:39.830 --> 39:45.100
You have so many stories of that kind, like
Sudama’s is that thing, when he went to

39:45.100 --> 39:47.500
see Shri Krishna.

39:47.500 --> 39:52.300
And Shri Krishna took out his procession,
in the procession there were just taking out

39:52.300 --> 39:54.440
his bad eye with some pearls.

39:54.440 --> 39:58.810
So, Sudama said: “Let one pearl fall in
to my lap also."

39:58.810 --> 40:00.810
He was very poor.

40:00.810 --> 40:07.970
But when he went back, he saw his house was
made of gold by Shri Krishna.

40:07.970 --> 40:11.110
It was such a surprise!

40:11.110 --> 40:14.800
So that elevates the heart.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.650
So it should be elevating.

40:16.650 --> 40:25.830
It should not be sensational, but it should
be elevating, and that helps the person because,

40:25.830 --> 40:34.550
whatever you give for spiritual growth, is
the one that is the best thing that you can

40:34.550 --> 40:40.500
give to anyone, even in material things.

40:40.500 --> 40:48.360
Even in material things, you give something
in for spiritual growth.

40:48.360 --> 40:53.500
There are so many ways, if you want to think
about it, of giving someone something that,

40:53.500 --> 40:59.370
spiritually, he feels comforted, he feels
happy and joyous.

40:59.370 --> 41:05.220
Then another hand [right] is like this.

41:05.220 --> 41:12.622
This hand is showing that you have to protect,
you have to protect.

41:12.622 --> 41:18.090
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis, well some of them
who are very superficial join hands with non

41:18.090 --> 41:19.090
Sahaja Yogis.

41:19.090 --> 41:22.550
Immediately, you can make out the fraternity.

41:22.550 --> 41:27.990
If I see one woman going with another woman
whom I know is a bhootish one, I know that

41:27.990 --> 41:29.170
another must be.

41:29.170 --> 41:32.350
That’s how the combination always works.

41:32.350 --> 41:40.170
There’s a fraternity of good Sahaja Yogis
and a fraternity of bad Sahaja Yogis.

41:40.170 --> 41:46.460
So when you see this [right] hand is a protection
to all the Sahaja Yogis.

41:46.460 --> 41:50.990
We all have to protect each other, nobody
should touch you.

41:50.990 --> 41:54.790
Of course, I’m all the time worried about
your protection.

41:54.790 --> 42:00.390
If anybody comes and criticizes a Sahaja Yogi,
any one, he may be the Prime minister and

42:00.390 --> 42:03.110
things, I’ll stand by the Sahaja Yogis.

42:03.110 --> 42:07.420
I’ll go up to any court or anywhere and
I‘ll stand by that Sahaja Yogi.

42:07.420 --> 42:11.620
Even, he may be wrong, still I’ll I‘ll
stand by the Sahaja Yogi because his Spirit

42:11.620 --> 42:13.780
is there.

42:13.780 --> 42:17.090
So we have to protect.

42:17.090 --> 42:22.170
We have to protect our children, we have to
protect our wives, we have to protect our

42:22.170 --> 42:28.690
husbands, we have to protect anaraksha [unsure]
as they call it.

42:28.690 --> 42:34.900
Protect all the artists, protect all the people
who need protection in this world.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.930
So many people need protection from Sahaja
Yogis.

42:37.930 --> 42:44.200
Now see, the classical art is dying out, there
are having funny sort of modern art.

42:44.200 --> 42:48.540
I don’t mind if it is really modern in the
sense that they are evolved people and they

42:48.540 --> 42:51.020
are producing something of a spiritual value.

42:51.020 --> 42:55.060
But one line like that [horizontal] and one
line like that [vertical] makes a drawing

42:55.060 --> 42:56.060
or a painting.

42:56.060 --> 42:57.250
Don’t support such nonsense.

42:57.250 --> 43:00.870
Then poetry, which is wrong, should not be
supported.

43:00.870 --> 43:07.570
Or literature which is talking of filthy things,
ugly things, dirty things should never be

43:07.570 --> 43:08.680
protected.

43:08.680 --> 43:15.520
But whatever is good, whatever is beautiful
produced, created by any one, even by a child,

43:15.520 --> 43:20.470
must be protected.

43:20.470 --> 43:25.080
Like a politician who is a honest politician
is a good politician who is benevolent, he

43:25.080 --> 43:27.530
may not be a Sahaja Yogi, but he should be
protected.

43:27.530 --> 43:31.430
In your heart of hearts you should think:
“Mother, please protect this man."

43:31.430 --> 43:34.460
You must have feelings for them.

43:34.460 --> 43:39.710
So what we have to protect here is the goodness,
is the peace.

43:39.710 --> 43:45.960
That’s our duty, we have to protect.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.510
We should not say: “All right, why should
we care?

43:47.510 --> 43:48.820
He is not a Sahaja Yogi."

43:48.820 --> 43:51.130
No, but he is a good man.

43:51.130 --> 43:55.100
Whether he is a Sahaja Yogi or not doesn’t
matter, but he is a good man so we protect

43:55.100 --> 43:56.840
him because of his virtues.

43:56.840 --> 44:01.890
You must protect a person who is virtuous,
it’s very important.

44:01.890 --> 44:08.380
For his virtuous sake, you must protect him.

44:08.380 --> 44:13.280
And you should not be only limited among yourselves,
Sahaja Yogis, you are the protectors of the

44:13.280 --> 44:14.510
world!

44:14.510 --> 44:19.630
You are the kings of the world, think like
that.

44:19.630 --> 44:24.750
You have to worry about everything, what’s
happening here and what’s happening there.

44:24.750 --> 44:28.150
You must know every thing.

44:28.150 --> 44:31.630
So, some people say: “Mother says, don’t
see television."

44:31.630 --> 44:34.690
I do not say like that, absolutely.

44:34.690 --> 44:40.010
What I was saying, you must see what is happening
in the world.

44:40.010 --> 44:43.930
But all the time glued to the television,
your eyes will be spoiled, and see all dirty,

44:43.930 --> 44:45.220
filthy nonsense, there’s no need.

44:45.220 --> 44:46.520
Why should I tell you?

44:46.520 --> 44:49.100
You yourself will know.

44:49.100 --> 44:54.850
But you must see things, you must be informed,
well informed, specially the ladies must be

44:54.850 --> 44:56.300
very well informed.

44:56.300 --> 45:01.180
It’s very important, because what I found,
ladies in Sahaja Yoga, they come, they just

45:01.180 --> 45:03.380
jump in the sea, finish there, that’s not
the way.

45:03.380 --> 45:10.240
You must learn how to swim, you must know
how to make others also to swim, protect them,

45:10.240 --> 45:13.551
You must know every thing that’s going on
in this world where you are born.

45:13.551 --> 45:16.490
You’re not to be just excluded from there,
you must know everything.

45:16.490 --> 45:21.260
You ask Me, I’m a woman, I know everything
about every country, I know the problem.

45:21.260 --> 45:25.680
That’s how I can solve.

45:25.680 --> 45:31.930
In Colombia I went there, you know what has
happened now in Colombia.

45:31.930 --> 45:35.700
In Russia, everywhere, you have to put your
attention to all these things.

45:35.700 --> 45:43.180
Specially, the women must know they are shaktis
and they’re shaktis of love, of attention.

45:43.180 --> 45:52.490
So this protective speciality has to be with
us and we must know we are in charge.

45:52.490 --> 45:54.470
We are in charge of this world.

45:54.470 --> 45:58.480
We are in charge of the whole humanity; we
have to look after them.

45:58.480 --> 46:00.950
We are not limited Sahaja Yogis.

46:00.950 --> 46:02.760
We are unlimited.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.040
We are eternal beings.

46:05.040 --> 46:10.340
And take up that personality within yourself,
then only the Diwali is completed.

46:10.340 --> 46:14.780
You can’t have Diwali with something that
is short lived, you have to have something

46:14.780 --> 46:19.310
that’s burning for ever.

46:19.310 --> 46:25.620
So this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga is that
you become really a great personality.

46:25.620 --> 46:31.080
But, it’s not the end of it.

46:31.080 --> 46:34.350
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told
you.

46:34.350 --> 46:39.700
But once this Lakshmi principle covers you
up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

46:39.700 --> 46:47.510
is that you think of the world as a great
challenge to you, that you have to give them

46:47.510 --> 46:52.940
Mahlakshmi principle, that you have to give
them Realization.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.930
You have to raise them up.

46:54.930 --> 47:02.050
And this principle, once starts working in
the Mahalaksmi principle, then all the problems

47:02.050 --> 47:04.710
are your own.

47:04.710 --> 47:07.780
You have to start working it out.

47:07.780 --> 47:17.470
Change he attitude, is the best way I can
say towards all other things that we have

47:17.470 --> 47:20.170
to solve the problem, we are here to solve
the problem.

47:20.170 --> 47:25.600
Like, I’ve seen, it’s a very commun thing,
somebody comes out with problem, I tell them:

47:25.600 --> 47:26.600
“Do this."

47:26.600 --> 47:28.220
They’ll say: “But, in this this."

47:28.220 --> 47:29.220
“Then do that."

47:29.220 --> 47:30.520
“But in this, that."

47:30.520 --> 47:34.810
Like that they go on all the loops, false
loops, until I’ll say: “Now this is your

47:34.810 --> 47:35.810
problem, not Mine.

47:35.810 --> 47:41.600
I’m giving you hundred solutions and none
of them suits you."

47:41.600 --> 47:44.600
But here you should know you are the one who
has to solve the problem.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.190
It is your problem.

47:46.190 --> 47:47.312
The world is your problem.

47:47.312 --> 47:49.530
Why were you born at this time?

47:49.530 --> 47:54.350
Why did you get your Realization and why are
you Sahaja yogis?

47:54.350 --> 47:56.790
Just for name’s sake?

47:56.790 --> 48:02.840
So in every field you have to take a responsibility
to see what you can do.

48:02.840 --> 48:06.610
Supposing you are an architect, all right,
have designs made!

48:06.610 --> 48:09.440
Create designs, just try.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.970
I’ll help you.

48:10.970 --> 48:13.010
You are a musician?

48:13.010 --> 48:18.250
Then take up ways and methods of spreading
good music.

48:18.250 --> 48:23.540
If you are writer then write something interesting,
not boring, something interesting, something

48:23.540 --> 48:26.260
which will elevate people.

48:26.260 --> 48:32.680
If you are a government servant, all right,
try to show that you are acting for the government

48:32.680 --> 48:35.100
that is of a much higher level.

48:35.100 --> 48:39.300
And such a person will be respected, very
much respected.

48:39.300 --> 48:43.860
Everybody’s personality will grow, not that
you run away from somewhere because most of

48:43.860 --> 48:48.400
the people say that: “Mother, we get caught
up, this, that, you know."

48:48.400 --> 48:49.750
It depends on.

48:49.750 --> 48:54.710
Now I told you that I have to sometimes shake
hands with six hundred people who are sometimes

48:54.710 --> 48:56.160
absolutely drunk.

48:56.160 --> 49:02.030
So it’s all right; that’s My job.

49:02.030 --> 49:06.341
So we are not going to run away.

49:06.341 --> 49:10.520
We are covered with the protection of the
spirituality.

49:10.520 --> 49:19.940
If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna
nobody can touch you.

49:19.940 --> 49:28.240
So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you
get all the tatwas, all the principles, satisfied

49:28.240 --> 49:35.170
in you, fully, and also the Mahalakshmi principle
flows through your being.

49:35.170 --> 49:40.760
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable
people.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.370
Not to find faults.

49:42.370 --> 49:49.370
If you are finding faults, then know that
you are not Sahaja Yogis.

49:49.370 --> 49:53.600
If you are trying to control others, then
know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

49:53.600 --> 49:58.510
Even the leaders, I would say, should never
try to control.

49:58.510 --> 50:04.130
They must know how the principle is working
in the silence; see for themselves how it

50:04.130 --> 50:05.580
is working.

50:05.580 --> 50:11.100
It’s a trick you must learn.

50:11.100 --> 50:13.300
Of course, little correction is needed.

50:13.300 --> 50:16.720
That time you correct the person, at that
time, doesn’t matter.

50:16.720 --> 50:23.410
But you must know how the whole principle
of benevolence is working itself.

50:23.410 --> 50:28.410
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence
part; you must know that.

50:28.410 --> 50:37.510
As I’ve told you before also, you have to
be like the sea which receives all the rivers

50:37.510 --> 50:38.510
into it.

50:38.510 --> 50:41.710
If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive
anything.

50:41.710 --> 50:50.100
So you have to be like a sea to receive everything
and you have to be at the height.

50:50.100 --> 50:57.720
As I told you the other day, the same way,
that very close to the sea there should be

50:57.720 --> 51:00.820
a personality which is above everything else.

51:00.820 --> 51:06.030
Such a beautiful personality you should have,
is the depth of the sea and the height of

51:06.030 --> 51:07.030
the Kailasha.

51:07.030 --> 51:08.460
May God bless you all.
