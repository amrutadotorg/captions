00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:10.870
We must know that Sahaja Yoga is
a living process.

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.081
It is the same type of a process by which

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:20.925
a seed sprouts into a tree.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:26.576
It is a living process. So it is God’s job.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:33.079
I mean, He has to do it. It is not
your job.

00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:40.003
To sprout the seed is His job.

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:46.676
But the problem comes in because,
at this stage

00:00:46.877 --> 00:00:53.700
where human being is the seed, he has
freedom,

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:55.481
they have freedom.

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:59.160
With that freedom they can spoil

00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:03.603
His manifestation, His working.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.981
So the first thing one has to remember
that we must have wisdom about it.

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:12.388
The first point of wisdom is

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:17.869
that it is God Almighty who is going
to do this job.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.503
We are not doing it. You cannot sprout
the seed,

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:28.257
then how can you sprout your seed also?

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:34.803
And in that wisdom we must learn one thing
and know, within ourselves,

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:46.532
that you are part and parcel of the whole
process.

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.756
Though you have your own freedom,

00:01:49.957 --> 00:01:55.392
freedom also is a part and parcel
of the same process.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:02:01.712
You are not separated from God. You do
not have any separated entity.

00:02:01.912 --> 00:02:06.182
You are part and parcel of that whole
process. All right?

00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:12.923
So to think that you have to decide
something about it is also wrong.

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:16.312
You are in the same machinery, brought
to this stage

00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:22.757
when you are given freedom for your
further evolution.

00:02:22.957 --> 00:02:28.221
So at this stage, when you have your
freedom,

00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:33.045
you must know that freedom wants to be
given to you

00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:37.454
to understand the value of freedom.

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:46.870
And in that freedom, you must understand
what is glorious for you.

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.925
Once you understand that, then you
tell yourself that,

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:54.371
“Now, see: I have to become something more.

00:02:54.572 --> 00:02:58.698
That’s why God has done this,
only thing I have to do

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:09.060
is to completely coordinate, cooperate and
surrender to His will, so that I become.”

00:03:09.261 --> 00:03:13.764
This is the first preparation we have
to make.

00:03:15.332 --> 00:03:22.132
In that surrendering, you will do
the greatest thing

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:29.464
because by that you do not interfere
with His work.

00:03:30.702 --> 00:03:36.027
Unless and until you surrender, you
cannot have the wisdom.

00:03:37.562 --> 00:03:43.523
So first of all you understand this,
through your little wisdom that you have,

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.649
and then you’ll have the full wisdom.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.487
First of all, understand this with
the little wisdom that you have,

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:56.611
that, without surrendering, you will be
obstructing the ways of God.

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:59.639
He knows what is good for you.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:05.846
He wants to give you the highest which
you cannot achieve yourself.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.965
He’s going to give you the highest.
If you want to achieve it,

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.870
you cannot achieve it. It is His doing.

00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:18.493
It is His daan (दान), as you call it,
His gift to you.

00:04:18.693 --> 00:04:27.362
In that case you must know that
[the] best way to achieve it

00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:34.181
is to allow His working to work out.

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:37.505
Now when you think of surrendering,

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:42.068
first of all the brain wave starts working.

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:45.719
“What do I surrender?”

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:52.654
You think by surrendering, say, your
material wealth.

00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:55.998
That’s not what He wants.

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.496
It’s all wealth He has given to you.
What is He going to do [with that]?

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:04.341
It’s [not] equal to even a dust particle
of His feet.

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:10.372
So that one is not going to help.

00:05:10.573 --> 00:05:14.916
Sometimes [aside: “All right now”] –

00:05:15.117 --> 00:05:19.966
sometimes [aside: “May God bless you”] -

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:30.605
you may feel that, “I should give
my intelligence,”

00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:33.774
or that is what is asked.

00:05:33.975 --> 00:05:38.517
Nobody wants to have your idiots
and stupid people!

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:42.836
So you don’t give up your intelligence
either.

00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:51.681
Then some people think that, “I give up my
heart.” Is all right, some people say it.

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:56.056
We don’t want heartless people either.

00:05:56.257 --> 00:06:00.549
Then some people will say that, “Mother,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:09.368
we’ll give up our, what you call,
the relationships with others.”

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.823
That also is not needed.

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.788
Because your heart should be there where
it is.

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:21.969
The light has to come in your heart.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.575
What can you give your heart to whom?
When the One who has given you the heart,

00:06:26.776 --> 00:06:32.621
what’s the use of giving Him back
the heart? Isn’t it?

00:06:32.822 --> 00:06:38.247
One who has given you intelligence, what’s
the use of giving Him [it back]?

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.351
Something that you have achieved yourself
has to be given.

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:48.591
What have you achieved is your ego
and your super-ego.

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:53.048
What you have achieved is nothing
but your ego.

00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:00.770
And this ego you have to give up, which
is a difficult task.

00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:05.362
Ego, if it comes, say, out of money,
material things,

00:07:05.563 --> 00:07:08.136
it is better you give up some material
things,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.809
not to God but somebody else. It’s better.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.018
If the material things are creating that
thing in you.

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:21.453
If your intelligence is creating ego

00:07:21.653 --> 00:07:24.458
that you think you have a very high IQ,

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.944
it’s better to bring it down a little.

00:07:29.894 --> 00:07:32.413
It is for you to judge.

00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:39.424
Watch yourself: what makes your ego
bloated up?

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:47.320
If you could start looking at your ego,
you will be amazed

00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:57.945
that any useless thing can bloat it,
and can also deflate it.

00:07:58.947 --> 00:08:02.685
It can get hurt for nothing at all.

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:06.610
It becomes so important.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.797
Then the superego part of it also comes up.

00:08:10.998 --> 00:08:13.887
That is what also you have to give up.

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:16.925
And in superego you can have your
conditionings

00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:19.893
due to your gurus and wrong types of doings

00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:25.871
and wrong types of conditionings [that]
you have had from childhood.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:31.922
Like, for example, somebody is a Catholic,
you see: for him, Pope is everything.

00:08:32.123 --> 00:08:37.467
Or somebody is a Hindu: for him
a particular temple is everything.

00:08:37.668 --> 00:08:42.263
All these are conditionings. Why they
are conditionings [is] that,

00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:47.918
without finding out the truth about them,
you have just accepted them as it is.

00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:52.374
This is the simple thing is.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.884
So if you can find out the truth

00:08:55.085 --> 00:09:00.872
about all these things, you will give
it up.

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:03.862
You may, may not. There are many people
who know the truth,

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:07.881
still they do not give up. You see, human
beings are complicated stuff.

00:09:08.082 --> 00:09:10.221
Even if they know the truth they will
not give up.

00:09:10.422 --> 00:09:16.221
But supposing you try to find the truth
about all these things:

00:09:16.438 --> 00:09:18.900
then you may give, may not give.

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:21.444
But going back into the whole thing,

00:09:21.645 --> 00:09:26.004
make a schedule of the whole thing that,

00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:30.851
“Morning time I’ll find out about this,
and evening time about this.”

00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:34.482
The whole [of] your life you will go on
finding one by one,

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:41.243
and ultimately you will find that you have
gone now up to the grave.

00:09:41.444 --> 00:09:46.153
So that procedure also is not going
to help you.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:49.926
By God’s grace you are realised souls

00:09:50.127 --> 00:09:55.505
and you can find out in a second whether
you are on the conditioning side or not.

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:59.267
If your left is catching, you are
conditioned.

00:09:59.468 --> 00:10:05.071
If your right is catching, you are
on an ego trip.

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.856
All right. So now you know very simple
method is to know that,

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:12.879
through vibrations, you can find out

00:10:13.079 --> 00:10:19.147
[if] Mr Ego is there or superego is there
or you are wobbly.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.797
This is the biggest thing we have got now,

00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:28.564
because this is my preparation.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:36.447
My preparation is this, that first give
you Realisation.

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:41.821
First give you Realisation.

00:10:42.022 --> 00:10:49.251
Once you are realised then I won’t have
to say much.

00:10:49.452 --> 00:10:54.060
If you are conditioned on the left side
you will get pains, this, that.

00:10:54.261 --> 00:10:56.139
If you are conditioned [on] right-hand side

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.856
you’ll have problems with health
or something.

00:11:00.057 --> 00:11:04.126
So you will come to me and I will be
able to tell you.

00:11:04.326 --> 00:11:13.770
This is my own preparation: is to make
you alert and aware,

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:21.890
so that you have light to see things.

00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:29.472
Now your preparation should be to use
this awareness all the time.

00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:38.272
Further I will go to say that: to use this
knowledge within you all the time.

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:42.352
That people forget.

00:11:42.553 --> 00:11:46.118
So the first [thing] we must know

00:11:46.318 --> 00:11:51.941
[is] that this preparation has been done
for us.

00:11:52.142 --> 00:11:58.008
We have got the vibrations.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:12.164
We have got the knowledge to verify and
we must use this.

00:12:12.365 --> 00:12:16.088
That you are in a new dimension
is the first acceptance.

00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:22.009
If you have that acceptance within you,
then your judgement will be better.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:27.880
But this acceptance is missing.

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:32.778
Now there is, in Sanskrit, a word,
‘abhyas’,

00:12:32.979 --> 00:12:35.079
that every day doing the same thing,

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.228
in that manner you will remember that
you are realised,

00:12:39.428 --> 00:12:46.624
and that your awareness is not that
of the awareness of ordinary people.

00:12:47.073 --> 00:12:50.114
So, first preparation is to prepare
yourself,

00:12:50.315 --> 00:12:56.358
to tell yourself that you have this new
awareness within you,

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:00.586
is to make yourself known.

00:13:01.749 --> 00:13:06.231
You see, in the University when you
graduate,

00:13:06.432 --> 00:13:10.615
there is a ceremony held for that.
You have to go with a gown

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:14.176
and they give you a proper roll and
all that.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.606
Why is it necessary?

00:13:16.807 --> 00:13:22.830
Because you may forget you are
a graduate. Yes!

00:13:23.779 --> 00:13:26.205
And that’s exactly what happens to you,

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:30.598
that you forget you are realised souls.

00:13:33.636 --> 00:13:39.281
I mean, we have had a ceremony in the sense
that, I mean, everything we have done

00:13:39.482 --> 00:13:42.895
to prove that you are realised souls.

00:13:43.096 --> 00:13:48.067
But this is what is missing from our
people, that they cannot understand

00:13:48.268 --> 00:13:53.621
that they are realised souls, that they
are people

00:13:53.822 --> 00:14:00.783
who are on a level that nobody [else] is.

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:08.686
You are twice-born people, who are very,
very rare.

00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:14.651
Very rarely you will find people who are
twice-born.

00:14:14.852 --> 00:14:19.454
I mean, I found nobody – can you imagine? –

00:14:19.654 --> 00:14:21.774
all my lifetime, except for my father
and a few here and there.

00:14:21.975 --> 00:14:27.426
I mean, they are not to be counted because
My father I chose and that’s how.

00:14:27.627 --> 00:14:32.674
So, first of all if you make yourself known

00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:40.122
to your own intelligence that, “I am
a realised soul”,

00:14:40.323 --> 00:14:45.642
you’ll be seeing that your priorities will
be changing very fast.

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:50.909
I mean, supposing somebody gives you
a huge big property

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.876
or a huge big wealth.

00:14:54.077 --> 00:15:00.463
Immediately you become conscious of it,
you see, you start walking like this.

00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:03.718
When you are a student you walk like this,

00:15:03.918 --> 00:15:08.211
suddenly you get the degree and walk
like this.

00:15:09.151 --> 00:15:12.529
What about Realisation?

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.978
[Aside to a Sahaja Yogi: “So happy
to see you here, very happy.

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:17.983
May God bless you.”]

00:15:18.221 --> 00:15:20.532
What about your Realisation?

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:23.495
Now you’ve got your Realisation.

00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:27.286
Then what are you doing about it?

00:15:28.066 --> 00:15:36.422
This is the first preparation: is of
identifying that you are a realised soul.

00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:43.690
We have to talk in a different way –
we are realised souls now.

00:15:43.891 --> 00:15:48.110
We are people of a different knowledge.

00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:51.602
We are people of a different awareness,
as I told you.

00:15:51.803 --> 00:15:54.970
Now see this beautiful building: we all
are enamoured by it

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:00.122
and it looks very beautiful. It’s done
so well, beautifully

00:16:00.323 --> 00:16:05.220
and it’s very important for human beings.
All right?

00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:07.866
But for the Divine even this green leaf

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:10.847
is more important than the whole building
put together

00:16:11.048 --> 00:16:12.563
and all such buildings put together.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:16.663
For the Divine. Because that leaf is living

00:16:16.864 --> 00:16:19.975
and a bird which is more aware than
that leaf is,

00:16:20.176 --> 00:16:24.289
is much more important to the Divine.

00:16:24.638 --> 00:16:28.987
So you, the human beings who are now
aware to this extent

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:33.530
how much important you must be to Divine?

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:40.254
How much God Himself must be interested
in you? Just think of it!

00:16:41.408 --> 00:16:47.690
Once you recognise this point, then
relatively you will also know

00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:51.366
that you are very important in God’s plan.

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:58.795
Not world’s plan I am talking. It is God’s
plan.

00:17:00.275 --> 00:17:02.926
So all the forces of His blessings

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:12.459
and all His loftiness, all of them are
with you

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.083
to help you, to support you, to give you
whatever you like.

00:17:17.284 --> 00:17:19.431
You are on the stage and they are looking
after you.

00:17:19.632 --> 00:17:24.171
I mean, now you have entered on the stage.

00:17:30.972 --> 00:17:35.965
But I find Sahaja Yogis, once they get
Realisation,

00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:42.550
I don’t know what happens to them,
that if they give up their ego

00:17:42.751 --> 00:17:48.258
then they become like, absolutely, you see,

00:17:48.459 --> 00:17:53.159
I don’t know what you call them… bananas?
Let’s see.

00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:14.367
Each one of you is the special one created
by God.

00:18:14.568 --> 00:18:17.833
Now you see for yourself, just think
of yourself.

00:18:18.034 --> 00:18:22.874
I mean, you are the ones who know such
a lot about life.

00:18:23.075 --> 00:18:26.974
Even if you get a little bit possessed,
doesn’t matter.

00:18:27.175 --> 00:18:34.462
But you know that you are possessed.
Now think of it.

00:18:38.793 --> 00:18:41.446
This is the second preparation one has
to have –

00:18:41.647 --> 00:18:54.240
is understanding that it is God Almighty
Himself [who is] worried about you.

00:18:54.441 --> 00:18:59.399
He’s sent everybody to help you,
“Go ahead!”

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:04.190
So you don’t have to worry about your
money,

00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:06.635
you don’t have to worry about all other
things.

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:11.380
The third thing comes automatically

00:19:14.742 --> 00:19:18.595
that you don’t have to worry about all
these things at all.

00:19:18.796 --> 00:19:24.325
They’ll be looked after. You all have been
looked after, you know that.

00:19:24.526 --> 00:19:28.597
Everyone has been helped.

00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:35.922
But if you know that He is Almighty and
He’s compassion

00:19:36.123 --> 00:19:41.618
and that you have fallen into His grace –
think of it!

00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:50.809
Establish yourself at that point.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.196
This is the preparation one has to have,

00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:05.542
that He is the one who has given all this.

00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:15.298
Then, the modern Sahaja Yogis are
specially blessed

00:20:15.911 --> 00:20:19.245
because they have a ‘walkie-talkie’
with them.

00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:24.824
Any problem that they have

00:20:25.666 --> 00:20:31.466
are handled in form, in person!

00:20:38.786 --> 00:20:44.624
There was never such a blessing before.

00:20:45.572 --> 00:20:52.635
But ego is the point, how to...

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:55.885
To begin with, it is ego, you have seen it.

00:20:56.086 --> 00:20:58.773
If you have ego you will not accept you are
a realised soul.

00:20:58.974 --> 00:21:03.255
Imagine, how silly it is.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.917
If you have a superego also you will not
recognise it.

00:21:08.124 --> 00:21:11.296
You will go back to the same position
as you were.

00:21:11.497 --> 00:21:15.899
You will never accept that you are
a realised soul if you have a superego.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.080
You’ll never accept:

00:21:19.908 --> 00:21:24.311
“Oh, how can it be, Mother? After all, You
see, what, I am an ordinary human being.”

00:21:24.512 --> 00:21:27.066
You’ll go on like this. “How can I cure
others?

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:30.311
How can I give Realisation? It is not
possible.”

00:21:30.512 --> 00:21:35.264
You see, this kind of a humility,
nonsensical. I mean, it’s all right.

00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:39.201
I mean, it’s like a soldier saying, “Oh,
how can I kill?”

00:21:39.402 --> 00:21:42.462
It’s like that. It has no meaning.

00:21:42.663 --> 00:21:45.616
This kind of a humility has no meaning
for you.

00:21:45.817 --> 00:21:48.078
“How can I do it, Mother? What can I do?

00:21:48.283 --> 00:21:51.695
Oh, I am no good. I’m of no use.”

00:21:51.896 --> 00:21:55.876
This language must be given up.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.805
When it is ego, then it is even worse.

00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:10.640
You can harm yourself and you can harm
Sahaja Yoga, at the extreme point.

00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:14.411
Egoistical people are extremely difficult,

00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:19.672
they are such a drag, because they try
to do everything

00:22:19.877 --> 00:22:23.096
through their intelligence and
understanding and this and that,

00:22:23.297 --> 00:22:26.244
and such a rambling goes on and on and on,

00:22:26.445 --> 00:22:28.324
and you try to pull them back, again
they go back.

00:22:28.525 --> 00:22:32.871
It’s so boring, you know, very boring.

00:22:33.072 --> 00:22:35.402
Because you know, I see the stuff,
supposing,

00:22:35.603 --> 00:22:38.462
I know this is it [a cup of tea], I want
you to have it.

00:22:38.663 --> 00:22:42.962
And between taking this cup to the lip,
[if] every time

00:22:43.163 --> 00:22:45.808
you are pulling it out, every time you are
pulling it out,

00:22:46.009 --> 00:22:50.454
now how am I to take it to your lip?
It’s very boring!

00:22:50.655 --> 00:22:54.144
And this egoistical temperament

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:59.073
is very prevalent in the West,
surprisingly.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:05.280
And I just don’t understand. They can
take to all kinds of filth,

00:23:05.481 --> 00:23:09.606
all kinds of perversions without arguing
about it, you know.

00:23:09.807 --> 00:23:17.989
Just take to it! Any kind of perversion –
“What’s wrong?”.

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:25.460
But it is for them the most wrong thing
is to be accepting the fact

00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:31.246
that you are a realised soul through Sahaja
Yoga.

00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:46.342
They’ll take anything else but not
the truth.

00:23:47.041 --> 00:23:52.083
This ego is like a horse sitting on your
head.

00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:57.742
You have to sit on the horse, and the horse
is sitting on your head.

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:03.156
You are carrying the load of the horse –
imagine!

00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:06.855
What is the sense in such a thing?

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.137
If you start analysing yourself,

00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:16.274
again you go into another trip.
You see, here

00:24:16.475 --> 00:24:21.077
you have been such ‘trippers’ you see,
like [a] Jack in the box, you see.

00:24:21.278 --> 00:24:26.426
Because you have been taking trips after
trips, there’s a sort of a spring.

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:33.198
You see, you try to see your ego, you go
on a trip of superego.

00:24:33.399 --> 00:24:35.713
You try to see your superego and you go
on a trip of [ego].

00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:39.616
I mean, a person who has been bouncing
all the time sort of,

00:24:39.817 --> 00:24:43.453
to this trip or that trip or that trip
or that trip, you see,

00:24:43.654 --> 00:24:46.179
is just like a person travelling all
the time, doesn’t know

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.035
whether he has to get down or has
to go further. It’s like that!

00:24:50.236 --> 00:24:55.418
The habit of the mind is so egoistical

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:59.491
that you just take the ride on the thing.
But the thing is

00:24:59.692 --> 00:25:06.479
[that] it is not that you take the ride,
but the ego takes you on a ride.

00:25:08.119 --> 00:25:14.333
And whenever there is any such a thing
coming up, it grabs you.

00:25:14.534 --> 00:25:19.699
And the progress is extremely slow.

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:29.854
Now the trouble with the Divine is that
it has its own protocol.

00:25:36.354 --> 00:25:42.016
And if the King has to come to your house,
you have to go and invite the King.

00:25:42.217 --> 00:25:49.271
The King doesn’t write to you that, “Please
invite me to your house,” does he?

00:25:51.109 --> 00:25:55.389
That’s why he’s King, after all!

00:25:56.065 --> 00:26:02.769
And he doesn’t implore people that,
“Please invite me.”

00:26:04.368 --> 00:26:11.009
This Mr. Ego expects

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:22.280
that you should be invited by the Divine.

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:27.651
That the Divine must go out of the way
to fetch you out.

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:30.499
Ego, in simple words, is nothing

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:41.834
but absolutely wrong ideas about one’s own
value:

00:26:46.117 --> 00:26:54.456
by which you think that, “I am everything.”

00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:01.928
What are you? Now don’t go onto
a superego trip.

00:27:02.129 --> 00:27:05.212
What are we?

00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:10.481
Nothing! We cannot even sprout the seed.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.721
Every day-to-day life you can see this
clearly: how ego jumps up.

00:27:18.922 --> 00:27:27.695
Supposing somebody says that,

00:27:29.427 --> 00:27:33.941
“British have these qualities,” one feels
very happy.

00:27:34.142 --> 00:27:38.692
“Oh, what a praise it is! What a praise
for British!

00:27:38.893 --> 00:27:42.499
Oh, we are British!” immediately.

00:27:42.699 --> 00:27:48.043
Somebody says that, “British lack these
qualities,” finished!

00:27:48.244 --> 00:27:54.965
You are absolutely… then that person
is the worst person in the whole world.

00:27:57.106 --> 00:27:59.604
First of all, you must know that neither
you are British,

00:27:59.805 --> 00:28:05.103
nor Indian nor anything. You are just
human beings.

00:28:11.333 --> 00:28:17.212
Ignorance is responsible for this ego.

00:28:18.371 --> 00:28:24.369
It is complete ignorance about yourself
gives you this ego.

00:28:25.334 --> 00:28:33.379
So, once we are going towards light,
we must know

00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:37.401
what are our hurdles, [this] is
the preparation;

00:28:37.602 --> 00:28:43.437
is the ignorance that we have about
ourselves,

00:28:43.637 --> 00:28:47.192
that’s why we are going to see ourselves;

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:51.535
and because of the ignorance, ego and
super-ego both have come onto us,

00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:56.872
so at least we’ll have nothing to do with
them.

00:28:58.035 --> 00:29:04.186
I mean, supposing you have to go
on the Himalayas, all right?

00:29:04.387 --> 00:29:08.057
There you are going for an expedition.

00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:12.991
You are supposed to carry the lightest
things that you have.

00:29:13.192 --> 00:29:18.854
You don’t carry three luggage of tiffin
carriers, four luggage of this,

00:29:19.055 --> 00:29:25.162
and five things of that, to have a nice
little bed there and sleep over.

00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:27.397
All that you leave here.

00:29:27.597 --> 00:29:32.575
In the same way, when you are going
on the expedition of knowing yourself,

00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:41.554
all that is loading up yourself must be
put down.

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:46.519
So again we come to ego and superego.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:56.562
Actually, these two are terrible elephants
which must be kept down on the ground.

00:29:57.174 --> 00:29:59.686
So we make our own study.

00:29:59.887 --> 00:30:02.556
You see, these preparations are needed
because we have

00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:05.643
already gone on this side too much
or that side too much.

00:30:05.844 --> 00:30:07.616
So the preparation is to bring you down,

00:30:07.817 --> 00:30:09.479
“Come along here. Now you stand
in the centre”,

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:12.099
or “We bring you down here and stand
in the centre”.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.878
The preparation is nothing but is just
to bring you down here, that’s all.

00:30:19.532 --> 00:30:25.889
So with ego we move on, and see

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:34.578
what the ego has subtler and subtler
and subtler forms.

00:30:36.342 --> 00:30:42.497
Even in superego you have subtler and
subtler and subtler forms.

00:30:42.698 --> 00:30:51.606
To understand ego you must see what
do you plan about your life.

00:30:51.807 --> 00:30:59.532
It’s very easy. What are your plans
about future life.

00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:04.994
To understand your superego you must
know what affects you very much,

00:31:05.195 --> 00:31:08.485
what makes you very unhappy

00:31:08.686 --> 00:31:15.146
or you can say, what makes you more happy
and what makes you more unhappy.

00:31:15.347 --> 00:31:20.886
Both things, happiness and unhappiness,
are the shadows of these two trees.

00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:27.468
One is ego, another is superego.
Just watch yourself.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:36.541
What makes you very happy? Good clothes?
Good living?

00:31:36.742 --> 00:31:40.061
Or when your name appears in “Who’s who?”

00:31:40.262 --> 00:31:44.322
or all such nonsensical things which make
you laugh, you see, all that.

00:31:44.523 --> 00:31:50.053
You just see that. What makes you unhappy?

00:31:50.254 --> 00:31:54.690
When, I mean, [there is] some sort
of a heartbreak and this and that.

00:31:54.891 --> 00:31:58.587
You see, all this kind of a nonsense.

00:31:59.202 --> 00:32:06.008
Both things are not yourself. They are
just outside.

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:10.130
So what is inside, if you have to find out,

00:32:10.331 --> 00:32:11.707
first the outside must be taken away.

00:32:11.908 --> 00:32:20.029
If you have to taste the fruit you take out
the outside, you peel it out.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.966
In the same way, this must be peeled out.

00:32:26.912 --> 00:32:30.838
Now this you should see within yourself
and without also.

00:32:31.038 --> 00:32:35.914
You can see it very clearly without.
It’s very easy.

00:32:36.115 --> 00:32:43.502
How you deal with others is the point –

00:32:43.702 --> 00:32:47.001
what is your relationship with others.

00:32:47.202 --> 00:32:51.757
It is easier to know this outside than
inside, perhaps.

00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:58.562
When you talk to others, what is the impact
they have from you?

00:33:01.006 --> 00:33:06.245
Are you appreciated by others or not?

00:33:06.446 --> 00:33:14.611
Among Sahaja Yogis, do you respect another
Sahaja Yogi as a Sahaja Yogi or not?

00:33:14.812 --> 00:33:18.936
Do you expect that whatever stage you
are, the other Sahaja Yogi

00:33:19.137 --> 00:33:24.160
will also come up and he must be given
the due respect?

00:33:24.361 --> 00:33:28.596
Also you must see that when any Sahaja
Yogi, who has achieved something

00:33:28.797 --> 00:33:31.152
or who is at a better level, tries to pull
you up –

00:33:31.353 --> 00:33:35.992
[do] you like it or resist it or get upset
about it?

00:33:37.703 --> 00:33:40.341
If somebody tells you, “This should be
done, that should be done,”

00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:46.520
do you take it as if he has abused you?

00:33:49.721 --> 00:33:53.475
If he is telling you about Sahaja Yoga
you should be thankful,

00:33:53.676 --> 00:33:55.732
I mean, in all normal way.

00:33:55.942 --> 00:34:00.971
I feel thankful to you if you tell me
something that concerns Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:05.213
Anything! Even if you tell me, “Mother,
this may not be all right if You say.

00:34:05.414 --> 00:34:07.453
You see, the human beings are like this,”
I accept it

00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:11.664
and I do it according to your wishes.

00:34:13.145 --> 00:34:18.238
Or do you like it or not? This is how you
will judge your ego.

00:34:18.439 --> 00:34:20.943
This is only your Mr. Ego.

00:34:21.144 --> 00:34:24.697
Actually, it is better to have another
person to fight your ego

00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:27.840
and yourself; both put together.

00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:31.929
If somebody tells you that, “This should
be done,”

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.839
“Oh, I see, I have been doing that.
Yes, all right. You come and help me.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.225
You pull me out.

00:34:39.086 --> 00:34:45.921
Work it out. Try and help me. I am
horrible!”

00:34:46.122 --> 00:34:52.015
That’s the way, if you do it, [that] you
can get over this ego.

00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:54.955
But the other person should say, “You are
very nice. All right,

00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:59.079
do what you please,” and then you feel
happy.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.986
This person is not so all right and you
are also not so all right.

00:35:04.187 --> 00:35:08.648
Because you have to pull out people.
For example, if you understand

00:35:08.849 --> 00:35:14.198
that you are in a crisis, you are in
an emergency,

00:35:14.399 --> 00:35:18.756
people are getting drowned and some
people are trying to pull them out,

00:35:18.957 --> 00:35:24.428
they themselves are halfway down, halfway
up, they are trying to pull you out,

00:35:24.628 --> 00:35:28.671
at that time if they say, “Hold my hand
now!”

00:35:28.871 --> 00:35:34.536
If you feel upset about it then you are
not wise.

00:35:38.866 --> 00:35:44.113
Now in Sahaja Yoga there is no leader
as such.

00:35:44.314 --> 00:35:46.071
I mean, nobody is appointed as leader.

00:35:46.272 --> 00:35:51.137
Anybody tries to be … tries to do that,
he goes down.

00:35:51.338 --> 00:35:54.833
But there is an innate leadership within,

00:35:55.034 --> 00:36:02.811
and such a person is extremely humble
and congenial and appealing

00:36:03.012 --> 00:36:08.714
and commanding too, has to be commanding.

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:12.750
And one should not feel bad at that time,

00:36:12.951 --> 00:36:15.185
because if he says, “Go and steal
something,”

00:36:15.386 --> 00:36:23.067
or “You go and join some - one of these
nonsensical things”,

00:36:23.268 --> 00:36:26.288
then of course he is wrong! But if he is
saying that, “In Sahaja Yoga

00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:29.816
you have to come up!” Even dominatingly
if he says,

00:36:30.017 --> 00:36:32.857
I mean, it’s a very good thing,
I would say.

00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:39.523
Supposing somebody is in your neighbourhood
who is always criticising.

00:36:39.724 --> 00:36:43.558
In a way it’s a blessing because [if]
there’s somebody who is criticising us,

00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:46.826
he’s trying to perfect us. I mean, we
should take it.

00:36:47.027 --> 00:36:50.515
Not to feel bad about it.

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:55.869
Supposing somebody is saying something
about you,

00:36:57.351 --> 00:37:03.125
if it is not true, then what is there
to feel bad?

00:37:04.216 --> 00:37:10.039
If he is telling lies about you, there is
nothing to be frightened about.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.269
If he is telling the truth, then you have
to be thankful.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:18.430
Though sometimes the truth could be
very unpalatable.

00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:22.013
Could be very, very bad, but it is a good
thing.

00:37:22.215 --> 00:37:26.234
There is a saying in Marathi (Marathi
words),

00:37:26.435 --> 00:37:35.180
“Keep the house of the person who talks…
who is a nindak,

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:40.249
backbiter, the one who backbites.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:47.469
Keep the house of such a man who is
your backbiter next to you, next door.”

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.178
That you know about your defects, you see,
you correct yourself.

00:37:52.379 --> 00:37:54.635
Is the wise attitude.

00:37:54.836 --> 00:37:56.207
Because you cannot correct yourself,

00:37:56.465 --> 00:38:01.486
so have a mirror by which you correct
yourself.

00:38:01.686 --> 00:38:05.321
I mean, you should thank such a man
that he is criticising you.

00:38:05.522 --> 00:38:10.893
See, by pampering you if he is going to
completely destroy you, what’s the use?

00:38:11.094 --> 00:38:13.599
This is what the gurus are doing.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.973
They are all pampering you and destroying
you

00:38:17.174 --> 00:38:22.359
and ultimately you find out that “Oh,
you have been befooled”.

00:38:23.358 --> 00:38:27.571
So if you accept the situation in which
you say, “All right,

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:38.524
if this is what is going to be the truth,
it’s very much better for my ego.

00:38:39.178 --> 00:38:45.384
And if it is not the truth then what is
so important?”

00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:55.422
This attitude helps in Sahaja Yoga
very much,

00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:58.970
a very wise attitude towards oneself is.

00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:02.050
And you will be surprised as you’ll grow
with this attitude,

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.812
you won’t be easily hurt by what people
say to you.

00:39:07.013 --> 00:39:09.921
You won’t bother. You know how much
people criticise Me

00:39:10.122 --> 00:39:13.504
and say all kinds of things, argue with Me,

00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:16.349
and I’m not bothered because I know they
are foolish, what is there?

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:21.075
They are stupid people. What is there?
Even if they praise Me, what is it?

00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:23.482
After all, whatever they praise Me
is My nature,

00:39:23.683 --> 00:39:26.581
nothing so great. You see, it makes
no difference.

00:39:26.782 --> 00:39:30.590
I am just watching My chakras working.
I am not bothered. I

00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:33.887
In the same way, it will happen to you,
then you will not be bothered.

00:39:34.088 --> 00:39:42.974
But this will help your unloading you.
This will help your unloading.

00:39:45.314 --> 00:39:53.778
And, the unhappy part of it: in that we
should prepare ourselves in a way that,

00:39:53.979 --> 00:39:56.614
“Nothing can make me unhappy.

00:39:56.815 --> 00:40:00.370
What can make me unhappy if I am
a realised soul?”

00:40:00.571 --> 00:40:04.494
You say, all right? Supposing you want
to marry someone –

00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:08.578
take a concrete case – and you find
the person

00:40:08.779 --> 00:40:14.562
has sort of misbehaved or you cannot
[marry]. So what?

00:40:14.763 --> 00:40:19.402
“I am there. My value is myself I know.”

00:40:19.603 --> 00:40:22.380
So your value, your self-esteem should
be such

00:40:22.581 --> 00:40:25.778
that nothing should make you unhappy.

00:40:25.979 --> 00:40:33.154
It’s all a drama going on. It’s all
a drama.

00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:38.258
But these things must be accepted by your
great intelligence,

00:40:38.459 --> 00:40:42.999
because what I find here is the difficulty
with the Western mind is this

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.753
that – it has too much of IQ, you see,
too much over-developed.

00:40:47.985 --> 00:40:53.843
So it is such a polished surface that
nothing stays there, everything...

00:40:55.241 --> 00:40:58.635
The first simple thing is that you are
a realised soul itself

00:40:58.836 --> 00:41:05.356
hould settle down there somehow,
onto your intelligence,

00:41:05.557 --> 00:41:09.865
that you are a realised soul now.

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:16.284
All of you believe in the heart, not
in the brain.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.529
That you are a realised soul, is first
thing you must tell your intelligence.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.698
And then you must tell your intelligence
also that,

00:41:25.899 --> 00:41:33.066
“Nothing can make me unhappy and nothing
can befool me.”

00:41:33.664 --> 00:41:40.216
If these three points settle down on your
intelligence, you see,

00:41:42.262 --> 00:41:45.714
I will see the rest of it.

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:55.280
You just fix these three points on your
intelligence.

00:41:56.307 --> 00:42:01.634
Then you will be amazed [that] you will
become a very loving person,

00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:06.893
extremely considerate of others. It will
all work out automatically.

00:42:07.094 --> 00:42:10.282
Because, you see, when your intelligence
is like that,

00:42:10.483 --> 00:42:13.716
nothing goes in. You are all the time
worried about others.

00:42:13.917 --> 00:42:17.960
Either you are afraid of others or you are
aggressive on others.

00:42:18.161 --> 00:42:24.080
You cannot go straightforward, you know.
This is what happens.

00:42:25.373 --> 00:42:30.233
If you could understand these three points
clearly…

00:42:30.434 --> 00:42:35.002
Yogini: Nobody does that. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: Nobody does that.

00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:38.802
Shri Mataji: She says, “Nobody does that.
That’s the problem.”

00:42:39.003 --> 00:42:45.227
Is absolutely, she’s so practical.
She is so practical, you see.

00:42:45.428 --> 00:42:50.098
Just now in the car she said, “Everybody
does something other [than they should].

00:42:50.299 --> 00:42:53.782
They do not do what is the first to be
done.”

00:42:54.009 --> 00:42:57.049
Like she said, “They’ll marry, you have
to marry

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.443
and enjoy your wife and your husband
and your children.

00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:04.632
They’ll do everything else but that.”

00:43:05.155 --> 00:43:09.633
It is that. You see, nobody does that.

00:43:09.834 --> 00:43:11.836
It’s so practical, you know, if you do it.

00:43:12.037 --> 00:43:18.310
Listening to Mataji is not the thing I want
you to do, but doing of it is.

00:43:18.511 --> 00:43:24.348
Sit down and tell your intelligence,
your IQ, that,

00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:27.476
“Mr IQ, now please listen.

00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:31.245
This is what has happened to me, and
this is what I am.

00:43:31.446 --> 00:43:35.648
I am a realised soul and nothing should
pamper me

00:43:35.849 --> 00:43:41.898
and nothing should make me unhappy.”
That’s all.

00:43:42.099 --> 00:43:45.446
“Nobody can hurt me.”

00:43:45.647 --> 00:43:50.877
Otherwise you are, “Aaahahhahaa,
aahhaahah,” like that,

00:43:51.078 --> 00:43:54.755
it goes in two ways. Never in a straight
way.

00:43:54.956 --> 00:43:59.872
Where just you are compassion and
you are love,

00:44:00.083 --> 00:44:03.207
absolutely relying upon yourself,
absolutely.

00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:05.731
And when you have Me with you.

00:44:05.932 --> 00:44:09.583
Can you think of those sages who had nobody
to guide,

00:44:09.784 --> 00:44:13.162
nobody to tell, nobody to talk to.

00:44:13.363 --> 00:44:16.767
All your granthis and all that, I am
breaking.

00:44:16.968 --> 00:44:19.403
You don’t have to do anything. But only
thing you do not create

00:44:19.603 --> 00:44:24.285
your own granthis, your own knots.

00:44:24.486 --> 00:44:27.155
If you do not create, things will work out.

00:44:27.356 --> 00:44:30.351
This is a very simple preparation.

00:44:30.552 --> 00:44:34.973
So I don’t have to tell you, “Love your
brothers and sisters,” and this and that.

00:44:35.174 --> 00:44:41.358
That’s going the other way around.
But you just tell your intelligence.

00:44:41.558 --> 00:44:46.500
This is enlightenment of the intelligence.

00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:53.040
If that intelligence comes into you then
it is wisdom.

00:44:55.877 --> 00:44:59.050
“That anybody is laughing at me,
everybody’s making fun of me

00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:02.751
or anybody is trying to dominate me,”
all these fears

00:45:02.952 --> 00:45:08.090
or all this aggressiveness, all this will
disappear just like that.

00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:14.508
That now you are a flower and you are
fragrant

00:45:14.709 --> 00:45:19.304
and the fragrance is blowing, and many
bees are going to come to you.

00:45:19.505 --> 00:45:23.985
That’s what you are. This is the beginning.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:30.101
Go on telling yourself like that. If you
could do that,

00:45:30.302 --> 00:45:35.754
if you can bring your intelligence to this
level,

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:41.924
not too high, not too low, but in
the centre,

00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.944
everything can be solved in no time.

00:45:45.145 --> 00:45:50.337
When I am now living with you people,
going through your Kundalinis,

00:45:50.538 --> 00:45:53.266
all that, I have found out this point only:

00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:57.863
that you just don’t tell your intelligence
this.

00:46:00.186 --> 00:46:03.775
So that you start giving up all kinds
of fanaticism,

00:46:03.976 --> 00:46:08.322
all fears and this, and superstitions and
all nonsense.

00:46:08.523 --> 00:46:12.451
Because nothing can harm you. No stars
can harm you,

00:46:12.652 --> 00:46:16.166
not your science can harm you, what time
you were born.

00:46:16.367 --> 00:46:19.417
Nothing can harm you now. You are
beyond it.

00:46:19.618 --> 00:46:28.671
So astrology is finished. Horoscopes
are finished.

00:46:28.872 --> 00:46:32.810
All other… what other things you had
like this?

00:46:33.011 --> 00:46:34.614
Sahaja Yogi: Karmas.
Sahaja Yogini: Karmas.

00:46:34.815 --> 00:46:36.504
Shri Mataji: Karmas, karmas are finished.

00:46:36.705 --> 00:46:40.906
Sahaja Yogini: Palmistry.
Shri Mataji: Palmistry is finished.

00:46:41.107 --> 00:46:45.684
Sahaja Yogi: Biorhythm. Shri Mataji: Eh?
Sahaja Yogi: Biorhythm.

00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:51.885
Shri Mataji: Biorhythm’s finished!
Biorhythm’s finished! All that.

00:46:52.086 --> 00:46:55.253
I mean, you are beyond that. Now all these
things, all such things.

00:46:55.454 --> 00:47:00.084
Then the other side of it: all love affairs
finished.

00:47:00.285 --> 00:47:02.416
All fear of love affairs finished.

00:47:02.617 --> 00:47:08.530
Everything finished, nonsense.
It’s only love.

00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:13.212
Now whomsoever you will get, you will love
that person, that person will love you.

00:47:13.413 --> 00:47:16.181
If he doesn’t care or loves you, it doesn’t
matter.

00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:19.856
As long as you love, finished!

00:47:20.063 --> 00:47:23.475
All expectations finished,

00:47:23.676 --> 00:47:30.038
all expectations finished, all expectations
for happiness.

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:34.971
Joy is single and absolute. When you
are in joy,

00:47:35.172 --> 00:47:41.653
you are at a state where there is no
movement: you are just there.

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:49.813
So get rid of these both feelings of,
“I am very happy now.”

00:47:52.342 --> 00:47:57.704
“I am now in joy. I am established in joy

00:47:57.904 --> 00:48:02.386
and that’s what I have to grow within me,
not my old stuffs.

00:48:02.597 --> 00:48:06.982
That’s dead, finished.” When the trees
drop out their leaves,

00:48:07.182 --> 00:48:15.568
people don’t expect them to again rise
and get attached to the trees.

00:48:15.769 --> 00:48:19.055
In the same way whatever is gone
and finished is finished now.

00:48:19.255 --> 00:48:22.982
Now let us grow what is new coming in us,

00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:27.870
and this is to be nurtured now –
is the joy,

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:36.747
is that dignified, majestic, that beauty
within ourselves, you see.

00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:45.118
Then you don’t get upset, not bothered
what others have to say about you.

00:48:47.002 --> 00:48:54.716
It will happen. It will happen if you put
it down on your intelligence.

00:48:54.917 --> 00:48:58.900
And people will see that in you because
you don’t do anything funny,

00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:03.047
you don’t do anything wrong. People will
like you.

00:49:03.248 --> 00:49:06.428
Even those who are not realised will see
that dignity in you,

00:49:06.629 --> 00:49:10.425
that you are so dignified

00:49:11.485 --> 00:49:16.390
because you have your own understanding
of yourself.

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:23.135
It’s a very simple thing, but as she has
said it, nobody does it.

00:49:23.336 --> 00:49:25.932
Tell your intelligence.

00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:36.869
Even now I find that some people do have
that joy within them trickling in.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:43.274
But you have to prosper into that, you have
to come into that,

00:49:43.475 --> 00:49:46.878
dropping out all that is nonsensical.

00:49:47.079 --> 00:49:51.067
Otherwise, you go off like that,

00:49:53.433 --> 00:49:57.033
and it takes hardly any time or hardly
anything.

00:49:57.243 --> 00:50:02.294
Whatever is done wrong, is done wrong,
finished.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.119
Just to be finished off because it’s dead
now.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.228
So why bother about it? Just to finish off.

00:50:16.555 --> 00:50:26.135
Because if I tell you something, say, with
a harsh tone it will not stick on there.

00:50:26.336 --> 00:50:30.056
If I do it delicately also it will not
work out,

00:50:30.257 --> 00:50:36.205
because, what I told you, there’s a polish.

00:50:36.406 --> 00:50:41.661
Take out the polish, and what is
the polish?

00:50:42.526 --> 00:50:53.231
Polish is the all understanding of norms,

00:50:53.432 --> 00:50:58.251
the all understanding of norms of life.

00:50:58.452 --> 00:51:02.637
Because you thought [that] if you were
in this condition,

00:51:02.838 --> 00:51:06.936
you would be happy. That’s why you are
doing it.

00:51:07.137 --> 00:51:10.206
Because you thought, if you do like this,

00:51:10.407 --> 00:51:18.378
there is a fear, there’s the left-side
problem.

00:51:18.837 --> 00:51:26.561
But if this all understanding of the mind,
if you clear it out

00:51:26.762 --> 00:51:32.937
with your light, with your own wisdom,

00:51:33.138 --> 00:51:42.224
then you’ll be amazed [that] this thing
will stick into you, completely.

00:51:42.425 --> 00:51:45.339
This wisdom will stick into you.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:47.437
Forget that old nonsense.

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:50.356
So many things you have already sorted
out yourself,

00:51:50.557 --> 00:51:55.581
you know, so many things which were
nonsensical before.

00:51:56.057 --> 00:52:03.222
But the identification of all these ideas
should be achieved.

00:52:03.423 --> 00:52:04.848
Should be achieved, is the point.

00:52:05.049 --> 00:52:12.151
You know that this is all nonsensical, but
is to be achieved.

00:52:12.352 --> 00:52:15.475
That’s the preparation.

00:52:16.289 --> 00:52:21.472
You see, you have the light, you have
the movement now.

00:52:21.673 --> 00:52:26.602
You are moving into it, but the light
is not here.

00:52:26.803 --> 00:52:30.625
[It] dangles, sometimes falls like this,
falls like that.

00:52:30.826 --> 00:52:35.369
If you can fix your light properly,

00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:43.465
just by this understanding that whatever
were the norms before

00:52:45.858 --> 00:52:50.954
were due to ignorance, and we have to have
our norms of our own now

00:52:51.155 --> 00:52:54.511
[regarding] what is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:52:56.617 --> 00:53:02.515
And these norms, I am going to tell you how

00:53:02.732 --> 00:53:08.473
these norms are going to come to you
like faith,

00:53:08.674 --> 00:53:15.951
like entire dependence on spirituality,
entire dependence on your vibrations.

00:53:16.152 --> 00:53:21.909
All these norms of the new life, we have
to accept.

00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:25.802
But to be achieved, I mean to say to be
achieved, you see,

00:53:26.003 --> 00:53:28.280
not just to be understood in a lecture.

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.861
So I’ll tell you about that in the evening,

00:53:33.062 --> 00:53:36.316
and tomorrow I will tell you [about]
the real becoming.

00:53:36.554 --> 00:53:40.015
All right? Thank you.

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:43.474
May God bless you.

00:53:44.492 --> 00:53:50.368
Just go on saying, now are you in for
opening? Sahaja Yogis: We do.

00:53:55.235 --> 00:54:00.355
Shri Mataji: You do not want to assume
your positions, that’s the problem.

00:54:01.665 --> 00:54:04.090
Better?

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:12.600
This is what I am saying.

00:54:13.786 --> 00:54:16.621
You see, it’s moving out.

00:54:16.822 --> 00:54:20.863
You just say that, “Nothing can happen.

00:54:21.427 --> 00:54:27.465
No bhoot can catch me. I can catch
the bhoots.”

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:29.701
That’s the truth.

00:54:29.902 --> 00:54:32.023
Yogi (Douglas Fry): Lunch. Lunch is served.

00:54:32.223 --> 00:54:35.718
Shri Mataji: Hah?
Yogi (Douglas Fry): Lunch is served.

00:54:36.313 --> 00:54:38.036
Sahaja Yogini: Do you want to take Your
lunch with him, Mother, or…?

00:54:38.237 --> 00:54:41.234
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogini: Do you want
to take Your lunch with him?

00:54:41.435 --> 00:54:44.267
Shri Mataji: Or else?
Yogini: Well, in the dining hall.

00:54:44.468 --> 00:54:47.280
Yogi: I don’t know.
Yogi 2: He’s told in the dining hall.

00:54:47.511 --> 00:54:49.327
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogini: It’s a very nice family.

00:54:49.542 --> 00:54:51.005
Shri Mataji: No no, he was nice or not,

00:54:51.206 --> 00:54:54.355
I will have with you people.
Yogini: Thank You.
