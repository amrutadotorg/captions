1
00:00:04,412 --> 00:00:09,825
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

2
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:20,027
 First, I used to bow to all the seekers of the Truth

3
00:00:24,185 --> 00:00:29,290
 and today, all those seekers of Truth

4
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:37,011
 have shown that truth is love, and love is truth.

5
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:45,094
With the power of love, you have been able to establish

6
00:00:45,903 --> 00:00:52,626
 a beautiful place for Sahaja Yoga in England.

7
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:08,641
 I must congratulate you all for fulfilling your desire

8
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:16,502
 so beautifully, working it out together  and

9
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:27,651
 and the collectivity

10
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:34,213
 which you have achieved – not only in England, but all over the world.

11
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:42,259
 All of you feel so responsible that Shudy Camps

12
00:01:43,657 --> 00:01:48,803
 should be a perfect piece of art,

13
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:52,390
the perfect piece of love,

14
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:59,366
 perfect piece of peaceful atmosphere.

15
00:02:08,102 --> 00:02:12,043
 There’s dedication, no doubt,

16
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:19,255
 but apart from dedication, the collective oneness, the integration

17
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:28,272
 of your feelings is beautifully demonstrated.

18
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,642
 Even Indians wanted to send you something

19
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:44,350
 for Shudy Camps and it was not ready before I left,

20
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:51,083
 so they were saying that they will be able to give you
 when you come there for your tours.

21
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:57,723
 Every country wanted to express their love.

22
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:10,652
 They say love begets love; I loved you, no doubt,

23
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:19,731
but in so many faces, when you see the reflection of that Divine Love,

24
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:29,260
 it is multiplied beyond My expectation.

25
00:03:30,982 --> 00:03:35,945
 I cannot describe My joy:

26
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:43,468
you can sing, dance, jump,  say “Jai” – I also feel like saying your “Jai”,

27
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:49,569
 and singing like …

28
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:57,276
 This is the beginning of our collective effort

29
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:02,517
and we have to go further and further with this.

30
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:10,676
Tomorrow is a great day for Me, as well as for you –

31
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,903
 it has to be one step forward;

32
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:27,392
very substantial step forward and you must be looking forward to it.

33
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:36,266
 I am sure something will work out in the inner building of Shudy Camps,

34
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:40,531
 in every Sahaja Yogi’s heart.

35
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:48,328
All that is expressed outside has to be expressed within,

36
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:51,428
 and that is what we have to achieve.

37
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,991
May God bless you!
