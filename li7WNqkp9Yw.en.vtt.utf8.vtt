WEBVTT

02:11.462 --> 02:17.665
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium

02:17.866 --> 02:23.793
and now I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

02:23.993 --> 02:30.936
because yesterday's experience, last night's experience,

02:31.137 --> 02:35.121
was the work of Mahakali.

02:35.322 --> 02:43.005
She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes.

02:43.205 --> 02:53.858
On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy,

02:55.093 --> 03:00.227
she's very happy when she sees her disciple are joyous.

03:00.428 --> 03:03.912
Joy is her own quality, is her energy,

03:04.113 --> 03:07.618
and yesterday you must have been amazed to see

03:07.819 --> 03:15.266
so many middle-aged ladies of France smiling and laughing.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.637
I'd never seen them smiling;

03:19.786 --> 03:22.968
it's very surprising how they were so joyous

03:23.169 --> 03:28.629
and so very happy and this is the energy of Mahakali

03:28.830 --> 03:32.613
that gives you all that joy after Realization

03:32.814 --> 03:35.801
and the joy you enjoy among yourselves,

03:36.002 --> 03:39.684
all these are the qualities of Mahakali

03:39.885 --> 03:44.075
and when they will read out the names of Mahakali

03:44.276 --> 03:54.036
you will know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga

03:54.237 --> 03:56.864
and how it has helped you all

03:57.065 --> 04:00.862
to get drenched into the Ocean of Joy.

04:05.492 --> 04:16.955
To begin with I have to tell you one thing that

04:17.168 --> 04:20.389
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing,

04:20.590 --> 04:25.449
you have to feel a joy within yourself,

04:27.067 --> 04:31.028
and joy from other Sahaja Yogis.

04:31.229 --> 04:36.229
If you, if you cannot feel that, that means you are not yet grown

04:37.666 --> 04:41.972
and there's some problem, maybe with your parents,

04:42.173 --> 04:44.714
maybe with your children, maybe it's family, with your country,

04:44.915 --> 04:48.145
whatever it is but there's some sort of a conditioning

04:48.346 --> 04:51.879
which is working out that doesn't give you that joy.

04:55.626 --> 05:02.445
And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is very important,

05:02.646 --> 05:04.466
which I think people don't understand,

05:04.667 --> 05:09.054
even if they live in ashrams, they don't understand one thing,

05:09.255 --> 05:11.888
that you have to be collective.

05:13.161 --> 05:18.530
If you are not collective then you are thrown out, gradually.

05:19.609 --> 05:26.636
Now this Mahakali power has got seven strings you can say this,

05:28.527 --> 05:30.894
and these strings are there to throw you out

05:31.095 --> 05:33.933
into collective subconscious (next couple of words inaudible).

05:35.350 --> 05:38.212
Like as in the sitar you have seen for the resonance,

05:38.413 --> 05:40.771
there are other strings also.

05:42.452 --> 05:45.105
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

05:45.306 --> 05:52.972
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts throwing you out,

05:53.173 --> 05:56.981
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

05:57.182 --> 06:00.658
and where you just disappear.

06:01.596 --> 06:04.642
And all kinds of problems start,

06:06.065 --> 06:09.274
I have seen this happening in every country,

06:09.475 --> 06:14.906
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

06:15.107 --> 06:19.185
For France I have the same report

06:19.763 --> 06:26.466
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

06:28.302 --> 06:32.072
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,

06:32.273 --> 06:35.100
as the Mahakali has a double action.

06:35.624 --> 06:37.702
She's extremely loving, full of joy,

06:37.903 --> 06:42.546
full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful,

06:42.747 --> 06:46.655
She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil,

06:46.856 --> 06:51.312
and those people who try to do evil.

06:51.513 --> 06:54.412
So once you are thrown out into the left side

06:54.631 --> 06:56.803
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

06:57.004 --> 06:58.921
of left-side diseases to begin with,

06:59.122 --> 07:01.708
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

07:01.909 --> 07:06.785
you develop diseases like mellitus, this, er, er,

07:06.986 --> 07:09.999
you must have heard of the disabilities caused

07:10.200 --> 07:13.613
by the muscles getting degenerated.

07:13.814 --> 07:17.814
All muscular degeneration comes from this problem.

07:20.205 --> 07:22.955
So at any cost that must be avoided.

07:25.901 --> 07:29.997
But if you are not in the collective, if you do not understand the collective,

07:30.198 --> 07:33.327
and if you are out of the collective

07:33.543 --> 07:37.980
you'll be surprised that negative forces will join together

07:38.181 --> 07:40.930
and they'll pull you out.

07:41.130 --> 07:44.490
So this is one of the things that happens,

07:45.936 --> 07:52.331
so be very careful that don't avoid the collective programmes.

07:55.543 --> 08:00.895
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,

08:01.096 --> 08:04.824
that She's the one who gives you the feeling

08:05.025 --> 08:10.256
for your wife, for your husband,

08:10.457 --> 08:14.053
She is the one.

08:15.486 --> 08:19.962
Now there also, the same problem.

08:20.163 --> 08:27.852
If both of them are alright, She's alright

08:28.053 --> 08:32.711
but if She finds any one of them going astray

08:32.912 --> 08:36.084
She'll throw that person out and out and out

08:36.284 --> 08:38.496
and the, another person, if that person is attached

08:38.697 --> 08:43.543
to that person also will be thrown out. So this business of falling in love,

08:43.744 --> 08:46.293
this nonsense that we have here, that you fall in love,

08:46.494 --> 08:49.550
but the word is all right because you fall really in love.

08:49.751 --> 08:51.891
It's a real falling happens.

08:53.243 --> 08:56.002
So what happens when you start falling in love,

08:56.203 --> 08:59.315
there's a kind of a maya of this Mahakali

08:59.516 --> 09:02.836
and you just get infatuated, your ego gets pampered,

09:03.037 --> 09:06.336
or something like that, or you have certain ideas of a wife

09:06.537 --> 09:10.138
or something and then you think 'Oh, that's the one for me.'

09:11.865 --> 09:15.220
So in these cases only two things can happen;

09:15.421 --> 09:18.369
either you can be lost completely because of

09:18.570 --> 09:22.636
your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire

09:22.837 --> 09:26.226
and you, you've finished, I mean your personality is finished.

09:26.500 --> 09:32.130
Or else, the another thing which is even more serious is that,

09:32.331 --> 09:35.331
that you'll completely break forever and hate each other.

09:35.433 --> 09:39.633
That's why they say that there's a love and hate relationship.

09:39.834 --> 09:42.435
How can love be hate?

09:43.615 --> 09:49.406
But it becomes, because of the, this quality of the Goddess

09:49.607 --> 09:53.304
that She is on one side extremely loving,

09:53.505 --> 09:57.473
extremely kind, extremely soft,

09:57.673 --> 10:00.142
she goes up to a point.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.847
And then She throws you on the other side,

10:04.048 --> 10:08.331
and that is why in these countries where people always fall in love, you see,

10:08.532 --> 10:13.304
they don't marry otherwise, unless and until they have fallen in love.

10:13.657 --> 10:16.457
In that they cross all the maryadas also.

10:17.394 --> 10:19.662
In falling in love they will marry somebody

10:19.863 --> 10:24.045
who is already married or who is, they'll carry on with somebody

10:24.246 --> 10:28.698
who is not yet divorced

10:28.899 --> 10:33.655
or also they will have marriages, er, among themselves

10:33.855 --> 10:36.465
in the same household or something.

10:36.666 --> 10:38.564
All kinds of things they do and the old woman

10:38.765 --> 10:42.100
marries a young man or a young, er,

10:42.311 --> 10:44.202
old man marries a young girl, like that,

10:44.421 --> 10:47.378
all nonsensical things, without any maryadas.

10:47.579 --> 10:50.831
And they do not stick together, they have no maryadas.

10:51.191 --> 10:57.214
To marry is to create a maryada, maryada of your behaviour

10:57.415 --> 10:59.999
and this is the maryada which, if you do not keep,

11:00.258 --> 11:04.275
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

11:04.476 --> 11:07.783
So first of all one has to be collective,

11:08.031 --> 11:09.320
the ones who are not collective,

11:09.539 --> 11:13.150
who do not attend every time a collective programme.

11:13.351 --> 11:14.869
You might give suggestions,

11:15.070 --> 11:17.577
that you would like to come for such and such thing.

11:17.932 --> 11:20.411
For example, I have already explained,

11:20.612 --> 11:23.379
that you shouldn't talk, put my,

11:23.580 --> 11:26.637
there are so many tapes which they have not, never heard.

11:26.838 --> 11:30.067
List...let them listen to my tape then go into meditation

11:30.268 --> 11:32.793
and then do the aarti and finish it off.

11:32.994 --> 11:36.011
Because these tapes are to be heard again and again.

11:36.212 --> 11:40.737
Now those who get any questions out of those tapes

11:40.938 --> 11:44.901
can, next time, discuss it before starting the tapes.

11:45.102 --> 11:49.571
That's a very good thing and that works. In India nobody speaks,

11:49.772 --> 11:53.594
they just put my tapes on or show my video,

11:53.795 --> 11:59.815
after that they just have meditation and aarti. Finished.

12:00.016 --> 12:03.050
After that nobody talks. But before starting it,

12:03.251 --> 12:08.245
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss the problems

12:08.446 --> 12:15.140
or discuss anything that they felt about the previous programme.

12:15.341 --> 12:17.874
Because you have not come here to marry someone

12:18.075 --> 12:20.700
or to fall in love into something.

12:22.098 --> 12:24.437
You have not come here to get after some woman

12:24.638 --> 12:28.217
because she's your wife or some man because he's your husband.

12:28.418 --> 12:32.418
You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives.

12:33.543 --> 12:36.566
But you have come here for your ascent;

12:39.215 --> 12:40.806
and if you have come here for your ascent

12:41.007 --> 12:44.801
you have to keep a watch. How is your mind working?

12:45.793 --> 12:48.490
Supposing I say that you should have good married life,

12:48.691 --> 12:52.452
of course, I do say, you should have good married life.

12:52.653 --> 12:56.106
But not at the cost of losing your ascent.

12:58.213 --> 13:03.426
It has happened with people, we have lost a complete,

13:03.627 --> 13:06.012
I should say, a city like that.

13:06.213 --> 13:09.361
Such stupidity came, comes up over people.

13:10.710 --> 13:13.212
So be careful not to get lost,

13:13.413 --> 13:17.157
you have not come here to have only a happy married life

13:17.358 --> 13:21.313
but happy married life is just one step.

13:21.514 --> 13:24.040
But if that step is taking you away

13:24.241 --> 13:28.928
from the real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

13:33.225 --> 13:38.071
Also we must understand the innocence means purity,

13:38.272 --> 13:40.526
purity of thought. As I explained yesterday

13:40.727 --> 13:43.722
I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

13:43.923 --> 13:48.781
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans.

13:48.982 --> 13:53.982
Very important. Specially French.

13:56.739 --> 13:59.543
Because the whole society is suffering.

14:00.670 --> 14:06.961
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

14:07.162 --> 14:13.078
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

14:13.279 --> 14:17.279
Like I was told that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.989
I mean you go for a pilgrimage.

14:20.935 --> 14:24.013
It's like you have to go to buy a sari and you

14:24.214 --> 14:28.815
end up with a shaving stick.

14:29.016 --> 14:30.651
It's that stupid.

14:30.852 --> 14:36.068
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for what?

14:36.732 --> 14:48.136
You are coming there for your ascent, it's a pilgrimage.

14:48.337 --> 14:50.430
But in the pilgrimage I've never heard anybody

14:50.643 --> 14:55.238
falls in love with each other and goes to marriage.

14:55.439 --> 14:59.855
So this bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga,

15:00.056 --> 15:01.841
that is one of the biggest loads.

15:02.042 --> 15:06.354
And, and must understand that purity means chastity.

15:10.119 --> 15:13.277
Innocence means chastity,

15:13.478 --> 15:16.908
not only physical also mental chastity.

15:19.392 --> 15:21.990
You have to have mental chastity,

15:22.191 --> 15:27.105
if you don't have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

15:27.926 --> 15:35.145
Actually in the West it is more mental that physical, is a fact.

15:38.192 --> 15:41.731
And that's why their brains (inaudible?) have gone off.

15:41.932 --> 15:45.565
And they are becoming just like, I think, potatoes now, I think.

15:46.206 --> 15:49.098
Because if you go on mentally imagining

15:49.299 --> 15:52.236
and playing around and working it out this way,

15:52.437 --> 15:54.642
it's going to be absolutely dangerous

15:54.843 --> 15:58.103
because it's all imagination, it has nothing to do with reality.

15:58.304 --> 16:00.846
The more you get into this kind of a nonsense

16:01.047 --> 16:04.023
the more you become away from reality.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.744
That never means you should be dry,

16:06.945 --> 16:11.094
it never means you should be, er,

16:11.295 --> 16:14.040
negligent of your responsibility, does not mean.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.692
As I said, the sap...

16:31.042 --> 16:39.260
As I've said that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

16:39.461 --> 16:44.424
Then it purifies, it nourishes

16:44.625 --> 16:49.042
every part of the plant separately in a different way.

16:49.243 --> 16:53.612
Like it's a mother, so mother, father, is a father,

16:53.813 --> 16:59.172
sister, is a sister, brother, is a sister, brother is a brother.

16:59.373 --> 17:02.211
The brother-sister relations

17:02.412 --> 17:08.544
cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?

17:16.388 --> 17:21.304
Now what happens really is that such a confusion in the mind

17:21.505 --> 17:27.019
and it has created tremendous problems for us.

17:29.863 --> 17:35.107
Then the sap nourishes all these things and comes back.

17:36.631 --> 17:39.266
It doesn't get attached to something:

17:39.467 --> 17:43.094
'Oh, she's my wife so the first priority is my wife.'

17:43.295 --> 17:46.250
Because I've said, of course, family life has to be all right,

17:46.451 --> 17:48.732
you must look after your family life.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.782
But that doesn't mean that you make everything suffer,

17:52.983 --> 17:55.842
that doesn't mean that your ascent should be finished.

17:56.053 --> 17:58.178
Cannot be that.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.868
You are not like ordinary people, you are saints

18:02.069 --> 18:05.412
and for the saints the main thing is their ascent,

18:05.623 --> 18:11.047
not their family life, not their material possessions, nothing.

18:11.248 --> 18:14.598
Nor their children, but their ascent, once they ascend

18:14.799 --> 18:18.912
everything will ascend with it.

18:24.872 --> 18:31.864
Now the understanding of chastity should be there.

18:32.124 --> 18:35.025
It can come to you very easily if you ascend,

18:35.226 --> 18:38.234
it's such a vicious circle.

18:38.435 --> 18:41.091
It is such a vicious circle.

18:41.292 --> 18:45.292
Now first of all you get your Realization, all right.

18:47.331 --> 18:53.537
Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali shakti

18:54.038 --> 18:56.167
because she's the primordial.

18:56.368 --> 19:00.368
Mahakali shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

19:00.665 --> 19:03.665
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.

19:05.477 --> 19:09.774
And she remains as a virgin within you.

19:09.975 --> 19:13.349
Means She's purity, She has a power to purify.

19:15.365 --> 19:22.845
All that happens when you get your Realization.

19:23.127 --> 19:28.884
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.

19:31.495 --> 19:35.495
Now the one who's sitting there is Shri Ganesh.

19:37.940 --> 19:41.072
Now people don't understand what is innocence is.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.616
Shri Ganesha is sitting there

19:44.850 --> 19:53.908
and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

19:54.109 --> 19:57.463
even over his Mother because He's like a guard,

19:57.664 --> 20:02.611
and He's the one who tells whether She can ascend or not.

20:02.812 --> 20:08.601
Unless and until He gives permission She cannot ascend.

20:09.578 --> 20:17.018
So Shri Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er,

20:17.925 --> 20:23.778
OK, alright, you can rise.

20:23.979 --> 20:30.775
And he stops all his work.

20:30.975 --> 20:34.685
You have seen th... Me, sitting for hours together.

20:34.913 --> 20:36.475
I don't have to go even to the bathroom

20:36.670 --> 20:40.203
or anywhere because Shri Ganesha stops all his work.

20:41.797 --> 20:44.971
He's only worried now about the ascent

20:45.172 --> 20:50.278
and on every chakra he checks your purity,

20:51.380 --> 20:55.427
and then accordingly the Kundalini tries to purify.

20:57.763 --> 21:02.360
But when it reaches the mental level,

21:02.561 --> 21:05.524
mental level has all these funny ideas of romance,

21:05.725 --> 21:08.419
this nonsense, that nonsense.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.515
I was surprised the other day,

21:11.716 --> 21:14.982
there was a girl who was having a trouble with her husband

21:15.183 --> 21:18.364
of expressing her love to her husband after marriage;

21:18.565 --> 21:21.166
before marriage she was all right.

21:22.135 --> 21:25.935
So I told her: 'Read some book where they have described

21:26.230 --> 21:30.229
the romance between husband and wife'.

21:31.363 --> 21:33.380
So she said, 'There is no book I have known.'

21:33.581 --> 21:35.224
Then I asked one professor to find out,

21:35.425 --> 21:37.358
he said there's no such book.

21:41.243 --> 21:45.087
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage.

21:46.322 --> 21:50.760
But also with maryadas, not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga,

21:50.961 --> 21:53.822
not at the cost, cost of your ascent.

21:57.204 --> 21:59.546
So all these ideas people have in the West,

21:59.742 --> 22:01.960
I know you are so much conditioned about it.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.000
So, you say now let us see,

22:04.188 --> 22:05.744
this is some (? inaudible word) after all,

22:05.945 --> 22:08.922
we have to give all the benefit to them.

22:10.656 --> 22:14.056
Now we select people, we do everything.

22:15.744 --> 22:18.215
Is all the work of Mahakali

22:18.416 --> 22:21.098
because you have to work on the vibrations,

22:21.299 --> 22:23.418
it's all the work of Mahakali.

22:23.619 --> 22:27.495
And after marriages also some marriages do fail.

22:27.988 --> 22:29.529
The reason being they do not know

22:29.730 --> 22:32.550
what is the purpose of their marriages.

22:40.395 --> 22:43.168
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that

22:43.309 --> 22:48.324
She is purity. Absolute purity.

22:49.309 --> 22:54.521
And that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,

22:54.722 --> 22:57.722
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

22:58.604 --> 23:02.981
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

23:03.182 --> 23:05.307
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

23:06.148 --> 23:10.148
Then they won't have these conditionings as we have had.

23:11.742 --> 23:14.617
And so many problems can be just avoided

23:14.818 --> 23:17.330
if you really become pure people.

23:18.487 --> 23:21.205
I see in the other society in which I move,

23:21.406 --> 23:22.668
nobody seems to be safe,

23:22.869 --> 23:25.478
somebody's wife is running with somebody's husband,

23:25.674 --> 23:28.181
somebody's daughter is running with somebody's father,

23:28.369 --> 23:32.236
somebody's running, a boy running with somebody's mother.

23:32.895 --> 23:36.769
Next day you find somebody else standing there husband and wife.

23:36.981 --> 23:40.600
Or sometimes it's so biz...funny that you can't believe it,

23:40.803 --> 23:45.139
how can it be? And everybody's in danger.

23:46.389 --> 23:47.715
A man goes to the house,

23:47.916 --> 23:51.692
he finds his wife run away with another man.

23:51.934 --> 23:56.495
Or a man goes for his work, he's run away with another woman.

23:56.696 --> 24:02.250
So the, She, She's the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

24:02.469 --> 24:05.859
Stithi means consolidation.

24:07.401 --> 24:13.393
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

24:13.659 --> 24:19.238
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

24:22.012 --> 24:24.051
Like when we make the aeroplane,

24:24.254 --> 24:26.858
first we have to consolidate it.

24:27.059 --> 24:28.944
Fix it up properly, work it out,

24:29.145 --> 24:31.561
so that when it goes in the air

24:31.762 --> 24:36.543
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

24:38.489 --> 24:47.047
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

24:47.248 --> 24:52.059
he just stops the action of excretion completely

24:52.261 --> 24:56.384
and the ascent starts.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.986
They are doing their work all right,

24:59.186 --> 25:01.274
despite the fact they have been insulted,

25:01.475 --> 25:04.438
they have been neglected, we have misbehaved,

25:04.639 --> 25:06.688
whatever we might have done,

25:06.889 --> 25:09.076
they are doing their jobs alright.

25:09.295 --> 25:12.641
We can see it, so many people getting their Realization.

25:12.842 --> 25:15.431
But what are we doing about it?

25:17.408 --> 25:20.884
We cannot be even collective,

25:22.994 --> 25:26.462
we cannot attend collective things.

25:27.202 --> 25:29.314
And look at them how generous they are,

25:29.515 --> 25:33.863
they are extremely collective, they are extremely collective,

25:34.064 --> 25:40.704
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships Shri Krishna.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.243
His heart will catch.

25:46.120 --> 25:50.229
Why? Because you must also worship Shiva.

25:54.401 --> 25:58.001
They are so collective and so much connected with Me.

26:00.277 --> 26:01.998
So they are all collective, in the same way

26:02.199 --> 26:05.899
you are also devas, you also should be collective.

26:08.714 --> 26:10.233
As soon as you become collective

26:10.434 --> 26:13.434
all these nonsensical things will drop out.

26:14.224 --> 26:17.849
All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective

26:18.050 --> 26:21.542
because you have not dropped out all these things,

26:21.742 --> 26:25.520
or else you are afraid of dropping them out.

26:27.404 --> 26:29.218
So let us know what is our purpose (is?),

26:29.419 --> 26:32.067
our purpose is to ascend.

26:33.482 --> 26:36.682
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us.

26:37.761 --> 26:41.651
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.

26:41.878 --> 26:49.471
She is purify; She's giving you all the powers.

26:49.847 --> 26:57.011
She is protecting you all the time, She is giving you joy.

26:58.436 --> 27:00.133
But what are we doing for Her?

27:00.334 --> 27:12.695
Her only, only desire is that my children should be saintly,

27:12.896 --> 27:16.496
that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint.

27:17.092 --> 27:20.825
That he doesn't fall at every woman, fall at every man.

27:21.194 --> 27:23.678
It's not so cheap, you see.

27:26.952 --> 27:28.912
And mentally specially,

27:30.944 --> 27:33.405
I mean if the Sahasrara is spoilt

27:33.606 --> 27:35.832
how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

27:37.473 --> 27:40.473
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

27:43.410 --> 27:47.981
And that purity should manifest.

27:48.182 --> 27:52.049
Through you we are going to change the world.

27:52.643 --> 27:54.247
Through no-one else.

27:54.448 --> 27:57.848
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the world.

27:58.159 --> 28:01.959
Now look at the generosity, when my body is so generous.

28:03.956 --> 28:07.408
Yesterday one lady came, I think she,

28:07.609 --> 28:11.471
she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs and I,

28:11.672 --> 28:15.672
my liver started pumping vibrations, terrible.

28:17.226 --> 28:20.102
She had a very bad liver though; she had taken drugs,

28:20.303 --> 28:22.282
I mean she had taken drugs and all that suffering

28:22.483 --> 28:26.982
was done to me, by this liver of mine.

28:27.342 --> 28:32.269
It didn't think that 'Oh Mother, she's come all the way out suffering'

28:32.470 --> 28:37.347
so started just pumping for that woman.

28:39.074 --> 28:44.057
So generous it is. And they are so generous themselves

28:44.258 --> 28:46.388
the way they bestow blessings (all over?).

28:46.589 --> 28:50.504
How they are hard working, how they are running about.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.582
What are we giving them?

28:58.762 --> 29:01.457
They give us joy, they look after us,

29:01.658 --> 29:05.191
they look after our children, they look after everything,

29:05.392 --> 29:09.059
they manage everything. Now what are we doing for them?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.246
Also I've heard that people don't help

29:12.447 --> 29:14.217
when they have to do postering, they have to do,

29:14.418 --> 29:18.277
very few people come up.

29:18.478 --> 29:24.292
This is being ungrateful,
very ungrateful to those.

29:24.493 --> 29:26.655
All the deities are present

29:26.855 --> 29:29.987
when you are having those collective programmes.

29:32.636 --> 29:34.458
And surprisingly the old Sahaja Yogis

29:34.659 --> 29:38.272
are more difficult than the new ones.

29:38.473 --> 29:40.860
I mean this I just, surprising.

29:41.061 --> 29:45.334
I mean are they becoming now out of date or something?

29:46.389 --> 29:49.485
Christ has said 'First will be the last'.

29:49.686 --> 29:52.906
I hope that's not going to happen.

29:53.107 --> 29:54.616
Sort of a confidence they develop,

29:54.817 --> 29:56.445
'Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.'

29:56.646 --> 30:00.646
We have had a horrible results in London

30:01.334 --> 30:03.125
of this consciousness that 'We are old,

30:03.326 --> 30:04.875
we'll do whatever we like.

30:05.076 --> 30:09.138
We may attend the collective or not.' A kind of a ego.

30:11.467 --> 30:14.545
Please be careful.

30:14.746 --> 30:18.429
Christ has clearly said 'First will be the last.'

30:18.629 --> 30:22.835
And I've seen so many of them, just getting out like that,

30:23.036 --> 30:26.364
even I don't know how they get out.

30:29.591 --> 30:34.825
In such stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.

30:35.026 --> 30:40.583
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja Yogi

30:40.784 --> 30:44.929
just got up and said: 'I am Maha Mataji.'

30:45.828 --> 30:49.963
Everyone started looking at him. 'What do you mean?'

30:50.164 --> 30:56.632
'I am Maha Mataji and I'm going to do all this myself.'

30:58.102 --> 31:01.579
So they said, 'Alright, so we are going out of ashram.'

31:01.782 --> 31:05.221
'No, no, no, I can't manage the ashram, I'm getting out.'

31:05.422 --> 31:08.066
And he went and stayed with someone, that lady,

31:08.270 --> 31:14.004
who heard against me and got cancer and died.

31:20.869 --> 31:23.731
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

31:23.932 --> 31:28.728
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

31:31.963 --> 31:37.850
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

31:38.051 --> 31:44.582
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

31:45.449 --> 31:48.577
So that is how we are organizing

31:48.778 --> 31:52.473
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

31:52.674 --> 31:54.179
And then they come back that

31:54.380 --> 31:56.567
'Mother I have got now these troubles so I have come back,

31:56.768 --> 32:00.307
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.'

32:00.508 --> 32:02.088
I say: 'What do you mean, out of Sahaja Yoga?'

32:02.289 --> 32:05.672
'I didn't attend any collective programme.'

32:09.352 --> 32:12.632
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

32:13.109 --> 32:18.322
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

32:18.523 --> 32:22.267
who is going to be collective?

32:22.468 --> 32:25.874
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

32:30.829 --> 32:35.194
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

32:35.395 --> 32:38.051
must attend the programme.

32:39.715 --> 32:41.912
And the second thing is that

32:42.113 --> 32:50.113
there was a little problem of generosity of people.

32:50.902 --> 32:54.435
Of course that's also is a character of Mahalaxshmi,

32:54.655 --> 32:57.209
She's very generous.

32:57.546 --> 33:03.616
And when you are generous in giving vibrations

33:04.335 --> 33:08.766
and looking after people, this and that,

33:08.967 --> 33:12.115
then Mahalaxshmi's principle works out.

33:12.316 --> 33:14.568
But Mahalaxshmi doesn't give money to people

33:14.769 --> 33:17.855
who are miserly, will never give.

33:19.043 --> 33:24.664
They may have money in the bank but they can never enjoy.

33:27.586 --> 33:32.768
So if there is need people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.

33:32.969 --> 33:37.328
I have been supplying lot of money, as you know, from the very beginning.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.135
Those who are early Sahaja Yogis will know

33:39.336 --> 33:41.536
how much I have been able to pay.

33:41.719 --> 33:45.099
But now we are growing and everybody should know

33:45.300 --> 33:51.690
that we have to pay. After all this is our responsibility.

33:51.894 --> 33:55.500
Where are we going to spend our money, in what?

33:55.701 --> 33:58.044
I mean my family feels that, that what,

33:58.287 --> 34:01.724
whatever money I'm spending for Sahaja Yoga is the best.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.192
They get punyas, is the best for them.

34:05.393 --> 34:13.393
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health and prosperity.

34:13.674 --> 34:16.674
If you do not have punyas you cannot get it.

34:17.595 --> 34:21.852
It will come and go away.

34:22.053 --> 34:26.365
It will disappear, into thin air.

34:29.591 --> 34:33.528
So I was surprised that people are not generous.

34:36.981 --> 34:42.964
We have to know that we are so much better off people

34:43.165 --> 34:46.165
than many others.

34:47.235 --> 34:50.143
Like the Eastern Bloc people are not so good

34:50.344 --> 34:52.203
in money matters just now.

34:52.727 --> 34:56.714
I'm not saying that we have to help them but we have to think.

34:56.922 --> 34:59.343
Have we sent something for them as presents?

34:59.946 --> 35:01.946
Can we do something for them?

35:02.548 --> 35:07.141
The matter has the value which is again Mahakali's power.

35:07.342 --> 35:11.295
Is the power of Mahakali,

35:11.639 --> 35:17.751
that the matter carries the love.

35:17.952 --> 35:20.454
Expresses.

35:23.681 --> 35:28.424
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,

35:28.625 --> 35:30.307
they gave me something.

35:30.508 --> 35:34.765
I really don't take anything and I don't need anything

35:34.966 --> 35:37.653
but certain things which show so such concern,

35:37.854 --> 35:43.042
such understanding, such love.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.604
How will you express your love?

35:47.956 --> 35:51.229
To those people who're so far away.

35:54.487 --> 36:01.653
You just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja Yoga also

36:01.854 --> 36:07.463
and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

36:08.510 --> 36:13.202
For collectivity we have to know that Shri Bhairavanath

36:13.403 --> 36:18.098
and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

36:18.299 --> 36:23.144
these three principles that work within

36:23.345 --> 36:26.784
us, all of them have parallel work to do, parallel work,

36:26.985 --> 36:31.073
they do not interfere for each other. But if it comes to help

36:31.274 --> 36:37.436
they go all out, there's no quarrel.

36:37.636 --> 36:40.342
No quarrel between the two, no.

36:40.600 --> 36:43.061
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there,

36:43.272 --> 36:47.412
if Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.

36:48.517 --> 36:55.475
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

36:55.676 --> 36:58.418
what a great work we are doing today,

36:58.683 --> 37:03.034
people are not conscious of that, they take it just by the way.

37:03.472 --> 37:06.912
In the war you have seen how people fight,

37:07.113 --> 37:11.464
even if they have the fear of dying.

37:11.759 --> 37:15.259
Formerly nobody was paid also in the military.

37:16.923 --> 37:20.104
But they went and fought, maybe for their country,

37:20.305 --> 37:24.104
for anything. And they used to join together to fight,

37:24.305 --> 37:27.948
they allowed themselves to be killed, they helped each other,

37:28.149 --> 37:31.417
they did this, all these qualities are there

37:31.618 --> 37:34.597
when we want to hate someone.

37:34.798 --> 37:37.462
But when we want to love someone why shouldn't we help,

37:37.674 --> 37:40.727
those qualities emerging out of us.

37:45.028 --> 37:49.491
These are the qualities of Mahakali

37:49.692 --> 37:53.846
because She is the expert of war affairs.

37:55.112 --> 37:57.831
She's the One who makes people work

37:58.894 --> 38:04.187
and She's the One who makes them fight because is the desire.

38:04.388 --> 38:10.630
They have nothing there, just the desire to do something

38:10.831 --> 38:17.794
and then they join together and then the Mahasaraswati helps them to act

38:17.995 --> 38:22.302
but first the desire is so strong.

38:22.502 --> 38:25.119
Now the desire has to be very very strong within us

38:25.320 --> 38:28.991
that we have to be for the emancipation of the whole world,

38:29.195 --> 38:31.546
we are the people, we are the special people,

38:31.726 --> 38:32.679
we are in the (foundation?).

38:32.961 --> 38:40.105
Nothing else is more important than our own personality

38:40.306 --> 38:44.839
being completely dedicated for Sahaja Yoga.

38:46.508 --> 38:51.982
This desire has to be extremely strong and very pure.

38:53.393 --> 38:58.839
Those actually desire it, actually,

38:59.191 --> 39:01.347
they get their Realization like that,

39:01.550 --> 39:03.393
they reach their depth like that

39:03.594 --> 39:05.800
and they enjoy doing work of Sah...

39:06.001 --> 39:09.735
they all the time they enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

39:15.212 --> 39:17.191
As we say in, there's a saying that

39:17.392 --> 39:20.970
when you get the re...water of Ganges to drink,

39:21.171 --> 39:26.460
why should you take water from dirty, er, rivers?

39:28.873 --> 39:31.527
So the whole attention is that side,

39:32.004 --> 39:35.740
the all the joy you get out of this romance and this love,

39:35.915 --> 39:41.141
and this and that, becomes zero before it because it's Nirananda.

39:41.401 --> 39:44.244
Only joy.

39:44.445 --> 39:47.562
In the marriage you see wife says like this, says that,

39:47.763 --> 39:54.346
er, all this is so conditioning. Any, any joy.

39:55.222 --> 39:57.771
You have different joys on different centers,

39:57.972 --> 40:00.099
they are all given by Mahakali,

40:00.300 --> 40:03.542
but the greatest of all you have got after Realization

40:03.831 --> 40:09.190
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach, to Nirananda state.

40:11.082 --> 40:13.894
If you are in that state of Nirananda,

40:14.647 --> 40:19.420
You are absolutely purified.

40:19.799 --> 40:23.898
But how to bring the purity.

40:24.694 --> 40:27.990
Just by developing thoughtless awareness

40:28.191 --> 40:32.519
and looking at things without thinking.

40:35.752 --> 40:40.230
For that you have to be collective. If you are collective,

40:40.431 --> 40:42.720
I am there, wherever you are collective,

40:43.009 --> 40:46.988
wherever you gather, I am there

40:47.189 --> 40:49.335
and nothing gives me greater pleasure

40:49.568 --> 40:53.787
to hear that all of you are attending this programme.

40:54.867 --> 40:57.707
You'll be amazed that in Australia we have so many

40:57.908 --> 41:08.017
centers in every, every city but they all attend

41:08.218 --> 41:13.764
the programmes of collectivity

41:13.965 --> 41:21.381
because they know collectivity is the ocean of nourishment.

41:23.847 --> 41:29.450
This is the simplest thing we have to do,

41:29.651 --> 41:33.655
but the bhoots are much more collective.

41:33.856 --> 41:39.207
Much more collective. Bhoots can go

41:39.408 --> 41:43.594
to such a length of fraternity

41:43.795 --> 41:47.701
that you'll be amazed.

41:51.572 --> 41:54.394
There was a lady in France only.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.731
She was an old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

41:58.931 --> 42:02.722
She had become absolutely mad so she put her in the,

42:02.923 --> 42:04.177
I mean absolutely bhootish,

42:04.377 --> 42:07.363
and so she put her in a elderly home.

42:07.564 --> 42:12.183
And in the elderly home she only knew how to go to church on Sundays,

42:12.384 --> 42:14.088
she would dress up and go to church,

42:14.288 --> 42:17.210
that's only sensible thing she used to do.

42:18.923 --> 42:24.227
So she put her in the thing and there was a church,

42:24.436 --> 42:28.602
and she told me this, her daughter told me that it is very amazing

42:28.803 --> 42:31.749
that all of them get up in the morning,

42:31.949 --> 42:34.552
dress up well and go to church

42:34.753 --> 42:37.875
and in the, inside the church there are graves of people

42:38.076 --> 42:42.555
who have died, out of those, I mean,

42:42.755 --> 42:47.054
half-mad or full-mad elderly people.

42:47.255 --> 42:50.589
Otherwise they did not know even how to wear their dresses,

42:50.790 --> 42:54.582
they didn't know how to eat their food, they didn't know anything

42:54.783 --> 42:57.098
but when it came to going

42:57.299 --> 43:00.687
to church to that bhootish place where all the bhoots were there,

43:00.930 --> 43:04.117
they all would get up in the morning, dress up properly

43:04.312 --> 43:08.393
and go to the church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.

43:08.594 --> 43:11.688
As if like possessions.

43:11.889 --> 43:15.010
Such a fraternity of bhoots there is.

43:15.211 --> 43:17.267
As soon as one bhoot comes in,

43:17.468 --> 43:20.476
one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

43:20.694 --> 43:23.463
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.

43:23.664 --> 43:28.934
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots, immediately.

43:29.146 --> 43:32.968
Then he came here, now he's gathering those bhoots.

43:33.169 --> 43:34.820
People are getting friendly with him.

43:35.021 --> 43:38.130
Exactly who are bhoots you can make it out

43:38.331 --> 43:39.849
by just seeing a bhoot sitting there

43:40.050 --> 43:42.666
and who is sitting next to that person.

43:42.862 --> 43:46.028
They are so attracted like a magnet,

43:46.229 --> 43:49.502
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

43:54.276 --> 43:58.629
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can know

43:58.830 --> 44:02.759
because they know my past, they are in the past.

44:03.025 --> 44:06.223
And they know who has got bhoots

44:06.424 --> 44:08.533
and how they attract each other,

44:08.838 --> 44:12.829
and how they act on a bhootish person.

44:17.041 --> 44:20.940
That is why the positive collectivity has to be there.

44:22.347 --> 44:26.706
But when it comes to positivity they do not get collective.

44:27.808 --> 44:30.355
All those who do not get collective will gradually

44:30.556 --> 44:35.628
go into the fraternity of bhoots

44:35.829 --> 44:38.829
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

44:39.067 --> 44:42.470
She is the One who knows everything about these bhootish things,

44:42.671 --> 44:45.257
she's in charge, I mean.

44:45.457 --> 44:48.833
She's the Lord of all these bhoots and She knows

44:49.034 --> 44:52.233
and She looks after then and She manages them.

44:52.515 --> 44:56.069
But where's, (inaudible word?) want to go into that realm,

44:56.335 --> 45:00.389
what has She to do?

45:00.590 --> 45:03.190
She has locked them up on one side

45:03.391 --> 45:05.515
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there,

45:05.719 --> 45:09.414
just enter through back doors into that area,

45:09.615 --> 45:13.154
what can you do?

45:14.547 --> 45:17.920
Of course She protects, She doesn't want anyone to go there,

45:18.121 --> 45:20.758
She's just kept them out and told the bhoots

45:20.959 --> 45:25.953
not to come this side, but Sahaja Yogis only go there.

45:26.154 --> 45:29.647
That's been reported.

45:32.522 --> 45:37.875
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has gone very far,

45:38.076 --> 45:41.219
very much in so many other countries.

45:41.420 --> 45:43.732
In France you have seen yesterday

45:43.933 --> 45:50.063
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted on people. '

45:50.263 --> 45:53.834
It was wonderful to see that, everybody came to me

45:54.035 --> 45:56.920
and they were full of smiles, I have never seen

45:57.121 --> 46:00.717
any French woman of that age smiling, never, no question,

46:00.918 --> 46:03.878
even if you tickled them, even if you certify that

46:04.090 --> 46:07.818
this is a joke they'll not smile like that.

46:08.019 --> 46:10.027
I've never seen their teeth.

46:10.394 --> 46:14.455
Yesterday the whole face was lit up, so many of them,

46:14.656 --> 46:17.355
something so miraculous it was.

46:17.556 --> 46:24.925
This anandini shakti of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

46:25.126 --> 46:28.199
and you are the people who will now

46:28.399 --> 46:30.336
guide or misguide them.

46:31.416 --> 46:34.860
If you become, all of you become,

46:35.061 --> 46:37.120
higher personalities,

46:37.321 --> 46:39.929
if you become collective all of you,

46:40.129 --> 46:42.263
and if you become generous,

46:42.471 --> 46:46.343
and if you become absolutely pure, they will say

46:46.544 --> 46:50.921
'Now look at these people, how beautiful they look.'

46:51.132 --> 46:54.236
You already look very beautiful, your faces shine,

46:54.437 --> 46:58.437
but it will all disappear.

47:00.574 --> 47:09.387
And the effects of disappearance are not very simple.

47:09.587 --> 47:14.385
So be careful, I of course bless you,

47:14.586 --> 47:22.586
with all the qualities of Bhairava,

47:23.180 --> 47:27.444
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

47:27.645 --> 47:29.850
and He is the One who is running up and down,

47:30.051 --> 47:32.582
morning till evening every time, specially in the night

47:32.848 --> 47:36.506
He is working so very hard killing these horrible rakshasas,

47:36.707 --> 47:40.535
this, that,

47:42.865 --> 47:47.677
and achieving such results.

47:47.877 --> 47:53.201
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.

47:53.452 --> 47:57.625
May God Bless You.
