WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.975
Last year, we had a program in Akurdi,

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:16.237
when I had simply said that if you try and see the penicillin factory, many people will pass.

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:21.594
At that time, people did not realize why Mataji took the name of penicillin factory?

00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:26.619
The reason is that I had come here to Pune for my brother's wedding.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.817
And I had stayed in your guest house.

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:40.310
Then I woke up in the morning and walked around here barefoot, and I wanted that if this place also becomes lively,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.625
then the workers who come here will definitely be affected by this atmosphere.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:55.659
And today we saw the scene. Then we will also remember the reason why Sita and Ram walked barefoot in Maharashtra.

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:04.118
God has done a lot of work. We are not aware of what God has done for us.

00:01:04.118 --> 00:01:09.353
Look at the entire creation, how beautifully God has created it.

00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:27.221
We see it in our daily lives, but we do not realize that the food we eat, the fruits we eat, these fruits have also been prepared for us by God.

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:34.097
We cannot harvest fruits from a single flower. We cannot do a single living thing.

00:01:34.097 --> 00:01:40.908
Science says that we became humans through the process of amoeba. God himself did that.

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:53.055
God incarnated in this world many times. In the form of Vishnu. And he did this work of evolution.

00:01:53.055 --> 00:02:02.505
But whenever this incarnation happened in the world, people did not understand what benefit it gave us.

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:07.928
Therefore, no one among us had such a structure. Therefore, no one had such a high level for us.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:19.710
Why don't we think about why Shri Vishnu took ten incarnations? And if we look carefully, then look at the fish incarnation first.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.315
Did he take a fish incarnation? Because first the fish came out of the water.

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:32.101
If you look at each incarnation before him, you will notice that then reptiles were created.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:38.448
In this way, God has a hand in the many kinds of animals that were created.

00:02:38.448 --> 00:02:46.555
Finally, now humans have become humans. In this human creation, we should consider Christ's incarnation as the last one.

00:02:46.555 --> 00:03:00.564
After them, Buddha became, Mahavir became. Nanak, Kabir all became. Great saints and sadhus became like Dnyanesha in our Maharashtra.

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:05.568
Their names are too few to mention. They became Namdev, Eknath, Tukaram.

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:17.709
They became great saints like Ramdas Swami. These saints did not establish any religion, as we understand it. They established that religion within us. Inside us.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.811
They have built the religion of man. Not outside.

00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:30.845
We built temples, we became Hindus. We built mosques, we became Muslims. Wow. Christians built churches, we became Christians.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:34.811
We should first accept the fact that you are only human.

00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:40.293
Christians have also said that those who are not against me are mine. Who are they?

00:03:40.293 --> 00:03:47.633
But they were not allowed to speak. They were finished off in three years. They only spoke for three years. After that, they were not allowed to speak.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:54.319
A very big blessing like Sainath, Dattatreya, had come here. He was a Muslim.But we believe in him.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:05.600
We believe that he was Dattatreya, right? How did we know that? He was an incarnation of Dattatreya, indeed, how did we know that?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:15.373
We knew because of his power. We knew because of the power he had. But in between, a situation has now come to humans that you yourself should know your own power.

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:26.321
Is Ashtavinayak true or false, is Jyotirlinga true or false, that's all I have seen in London, the people there don't know anything.

00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:34.883
There is a place called Stonehenge there. There too, such stones have come out. And they have vibrations, those consciousness waves.

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:40.771
They don't know what it is. What names are given to it, it is what it is. But when you look there, you know, there are vibrations.

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:50.597
At that time, everyone has said that you have to be born again.

00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:58.003
Muslims used to call him Pir. That you have to become a "Pir".

00:04:58.003 --> 00:05:07.477
Nanak has called him "Par". There is no difference between Nanak and Mohammed. Not even that much difference. There is only one thing.

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:17.675
Christ has clearly told him "You are to be born again". You have to be born again. Baptism is called baptism.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:26.675
In Hinduism, it is called Brahmatva. You have to become a Brahmin. Now we have Brahmins by birth. There is nothing like that.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:31.333
If that were the case, Vyasa Muni would not have been a Brahmin. The one who wrote the Gita.

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:43.613
He was the son of a Kolini. Valmiki himself was a spider, religion is determined by birth, etc. By putting all these misleading ideas into your head, you are creating something different and this is different.

00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:56.308
These people have worked on how to break the world, how to dissolve them, how to break them, how to establish a kingdom of enmity and hatred among themselves.

00:05:56.308 --> 00:06:12.454
But man is an appendage of God. If God is a complete body, then every cell in it is a man, every cell is a man.

00:06:12.454 --> 00:06:19.821
Only when he awakens, then he realizes that he is an appendage of this entire universe.

00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.028
He does not realize it until that happens. We do some external devotion.

00:06:24.028 --> 00:06:34.125
That is what happened to Tulsidas. Tulsidas himself put a pillar on Ram and Ram came and stood in front of him, recognized him.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:38.305
No one recognized Christ. If he had recognized him, he would not have been crucified.

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:47.663
The one who is the true son of God, the incarnation of Ganesha, the true incarnation of Brahma, the true incarnation of Brahma, you crucified him.

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:53.533
If he had recognized that Sainath, now it is a matter of the day after tomorrow.

00:06:53.533 --> 00:07:03.464
These are the incarnations of Datta, but in this land of yours, Maharashtra, they were not even allowed to eat. You are a big devotee of Datta. Did you know Datta?

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:08.269
Now that he has gone, everything is starting to worship him.

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:14.150
But you have given a lot of respect to the Bhamtas during their lives.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:23.543
At that time, it happened in ignorance. You had no knowledge, no eyes. You did not see. That is why this has happened.

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:33.912
God has decided to forgive everyone for it. Forget what happened. You should forget the past and the future. Just get what is now.

00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:37.709
And to get that, God has placed this power within us.

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:47.685
This is in us since time immemorial, this mother, Kundalini, Jagdamba, is called her, God has placed this power within us.

00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:58.781
It is dormant like a bud. It is in the triangular bone. It is called sacrum in English. Look. Sacrum means sacred. It means holy, sacred.

00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:05.677
Even at that time, people knew in Latin that “this” meant something special and sacred.

00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:22.417
It is written that by awakening this power you will see the soul. This power should be awakened within us.

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:34.073
If this power is awakened, then by just speaking or thinking of someone, we are fine, what we have done is fine, we are satisfied with this. Our life will be wasted.

00:08:34.073 --> 00:08:44.038
If we do not connect this machine to the mains, it will not work. It will not get power.

00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:51.961
All the effort we have put in making it, working hard, will be wasted.

00:08:51.961 --> 00:09:04.767
Until you do not understand what God has made you through hard work, until you do not know what you are, you will also be wasted.

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:10.003
Then you should have a relationship with God.

00:09:10.003 --> 00:09:24.001
Sahaj means “born-in”. The relationship you have with God to be in yoga is born-in. It is born-in within you.

00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:39.613
This seed resides within you as a seed, as a power, as a kundalini. But this kundalini also does not usually awaken. This is undeniable.

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:57.448
If you give a wild man a seed and he does not know how a tree grows. If you tell him that such a big tree has grown from this seed, he will say, “How is this possible?”

00:09:57.448 --> 00:10:04.789
He will break it, he will break it. That is, even if we penetrate into it, we will not understand. If this power existed, it would have been seen in him.

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:19.909
But when he gives it to a gardener, he knows that when he puts it in the womb of this land, Mother Earth, it will sprout because that power is dormant in it.

00:10:19.909 --> 00:10:26.997
And that is why the form of a mother is needed. Because only a mother is ready to work hard.

00:10:26.997 --> 00:10:36.221
Getting angry, getting upset is a very easy task. But people find it difficult to love. We do not find it difficult at all.

00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:44.232
Similarly, the awakening of Kundalini will happen only among such people, who themselves are the embodiment of love.

00:10:44.232 --> 00:10:53.585
In those who do not have love, in those who do not have the realization of God, in those who do not have the right to it, Kundalini will not awaken in front of them.

00:10:53.585 --> 00:11:03.755
Now see for yourself. If the school master comes, the children will immediately stand up. But if a school porter comes, will the children stand up?

00:11:03.755 --> 00:11:11.827
Only the one who has the authority can do this work and this authority is also in love. We do not understand that.

00:11:11.827 --> 00:11:16.619
When we say authority, we understand that it is just beating. But this is the authority of love.

00:11:16.619 --> 00:11:20.429
Only the person who has the authority of this love can awaken this Kundalini.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:39.021
That is the statement. Not only that, Adi Shankaracharya, who founded Hinduism and was its inspirer, has also said that God cannot be attained by doing Yoga Sankhya etc., debating on it, giving speeches on it, talking a lot about it or standing on one's head or singing bhajans or anything.

00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:45.912
It is attained through the awakening of Kundalini and the awakening of Kundalini happens by the grace of the mother herself.

00:11:45.912 --> 00:11:56.738
He has written very clearly. And even in his last book, which is famous as Soundarya Lahari, he has not explained anything about it

00:11:56.738 --> 00:12:04.079
First he wrote a book called "Vivek Chudamani", in which he did nothing. He only praised his mother.

00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:09.060
He knew about her one thousand chakras, all their detailed descriptions,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.148
what does it mean when she says "Hum", what happens to her when she says "Ha",

00:12:13.148 --> 00:12:23.656
how they move and how the energy channels are formed at that time and how the Kundalini awakens, etc.He just kept on describing them.

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:29.559
Then people asked that you are so learned, what is this? There is nothing beyond this.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:34.639
Apart from this, if the Kundalini does not awaken, then why should we tell the rest?

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:43.865
That is, if we want to plant a seed, we give a lecture here, now this seed is like this, it is like that, it is like that, so will anything come of it?

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:49.998
You either do Hatha Yoga in front of it or stand on your head, otherwise, many people cut off their tongues and put them in their throats.

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:53.969
What kind of things do they do? Standing on one leg for hours.

00:12:53.969 --> 00:13:01.341
They would fast, they would investigate. They would do this, they would do that, they would keep taking names. They would do everything like parrots. Try it.

00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:12.610
Try it. Will that plant come? It will come easily, it will come automatically. Spontaneous. You won't have to do anything for it.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.948
Today you have become a human being, what have you done to it?

00:13:15.948 --> 00:13:19.597
Now, how did Madame Curie discover penicillin?

00:13:19.597 --> 00:13:26.324
It is said in her own book. She says that I was searching everywhere, I could not find anything.

00:13:26.324 --> 00:13:35.358
Once I was sitting quietly, then from somewhere unknown, from the unknown, I suddenly knew that penicillin would be found here.

00:13:35.358 --> 00:13:42.481
Everything that is known is right in front of us. Everything is kept in the library. What is unknown is known from there, it is known.

00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:55.680
And what is most unknown is this truth that you are the soul, you are the soul. This is not the body - mind, intellect, ego. You are the soul. This is the real truth.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:07.756
And once this truth is presented within us, felt and the soul starts flowing within us, then we will have real meaning, that is, we will become capable.

00:14:07.756 --> 00:14:13.473
Before that, if we were told that you should not do this, do not do that, break this and that.

00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:19.247
Wear black clothes or wear white clothes. Otherwise, put this in your head and become a hermit and walk around,

00:14:19.247 --> 00:14:22.643
otherwise what, what is the meaning of the things that are happening all over the world?

00:14:22.643 --> 00:14:30.110
Those who did all this, you have seen the tradition for thousands of years, does it have any meaning?

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:37.407
Until you become aware, until the light comes into you, it is impossible to change.

00:14:37.407 --> 00:14:44.291
Take the example of the seed itself. The seed changes only when the bud awakens in it.

00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:57.025
That bud must awaken. Until that bud awakens in you, no change can happen in you.

00:14:57.025 --> 00:15:01.137
You cannot grow. You cannot grow.

00:15:01.137 --> 00:15:05.389
And whatever behavior you have that is like walking blindly, it cannot change.

00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:14.652
As soon as you have eyes, you will immediately realize that this is black here, this is white here, this is blue here.

00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:17.142
In the darkness, all the colors look the same.

00:15:17.142 --> 00:15:25.174
You do not understand anything and do not understand anything. Now one method is that you come to this room. It is dark.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:28.747
You grope and grope and grab a chair.

00:15:28.747 --> 00:16:05.073
The chair means the room. We know the story of the elephant. (talking to Yogi, “Come a little further…”)

00:16:05.073 --> 00:16:09.431
We want to have darshan. There is a lot here too.

00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:14.657
Mother, give us darshan. Even if thousands of people come, we want darshan. Ah, darshan has been given.

00:16:14.657 --> 00:16:19.860
How many times have you come to the feet of God. From here, went to Pandurang on foot.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.116
Rubbed his feet there too. But has anything happened to you?

00:16:25.116 --> 00:16:32.415
I used to ask myself this question. I saw that poor Pandurang's feet, his feet too, his feet were worn out.

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:37.055
But has anything happened here? I mean, the sandalwood fairy is wearing out, Pandurang.

00:16:37.055 --> 00:16:42.184
He is wearing out, but what has happened to you? Have you smelled the sandalwood?

00:16:42.184 --> 00:16:46.797
Because the sandalwood that is there has not yet awakened.

00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:53.066
It should awaken. After that, let's talk about the rest. First, get some light.

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:58.611
Now, if you come to this room in the dark. As I was saying earlier, what will you see?

00:16:58.611 --> 00:17:02.847
This is the truth that you see, that is the truth that you see. If a fan touches it, the fan is the truth.

00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:09.263
They used to fight for it. The fan owner would fight with the chair owner, the chair owner would fight with the mat owner.

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:18.108
It went on like this. What he said was the truth, what he said was the truth. But since everyone's eyes were closed, now look, mother is going to tell you this. You sit quietly.

00:17:18.108 --> 00:17:30.072
Open your eyes and see. From that you also know that if you press a button, light is visible everywhere.

00:17:30.072 --> 00:17:34.923
But you need a knower. Only the one who knows this light will know. Only he will do it.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:40.792
If he tells you that you want to light this lamp, then press here. The lamp will light immediately.

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:49.614
But behind that lamp, there is such a big pre-pitha. There is a whole history behind it.

00:17:49.614 --> 00:17:54.482
Therefore, it is not something that we just press a button.

00:17:54.482 --> 00:18:01.263
That is, this Kundalini that is in us and these chakras that God has built in us, and which are located, which you can see.

00:18:01.263 --> 00:18:05.275
The rising of Kundalini, its vibration is visible in many people.

00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:12.775
So, this work that God has done is not of today.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:20.872
It is from where you were carbon, what you were before that, and the entire universe is within us. The entire universe is within us.

00:18:20.872 --> 00:18:25.374
But to know that universe, first we must obtain the light of the soul.

00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:30.579
In the evening I will speak on the soul. Today I will speak on Kundalini.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:36.583
Kundalini power is your pure desire, pure desire.

00:18:36.583 --> 00:18:41.855
That is, there is no other mixture in that desire.

00:18:41.855 --> 00:18:46.874
Only to attain God, to merge in God,

00:18:46.874 --> 00:18:55.814
to attain the darshan of the soul and attain God through the soul, this pure desire has been placed in you by God in the form of Kundalini.

00:18:55.814 --> 00:18:59.161
It is there. But it is dim.

00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:07.093
If it gets a little boost, it will become fully awakened, overcome all your desires,

00:19:07.093 --> 00:19:11.257
and pull all the mind inside and give you the darshan of the soul.

00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:14.783
Now if you say to take this mind to the soul, can you take it?

00:19:14.783 --> 00:19:19.524
No, you cannot take it. Your attention is on me, on my speech.

00:19:19.524 --> 00:19:22.905
But if I say to take this mind there, you cannot take it.

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:29.209
But once that event happens, automatically the mind is drawn inside and the person recognizes that soul. When this happens, there is a sudden change in the person

00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:41.595
Suddenly. At the same time. The face suddenly shines, the eyes start shining, just like diamonds.

00:19:41.595 --> 00:19:48.402
Cool streams flow from the hands. Sheesham Shivam.

00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:54.361
If electricity comes here, you have to tell it how to convert its current, how to use it?

00:19:54.361 --> 00:20:04.969
How to move it from here to there, how to connect it, how to insert instruments like rheostats etc. in it, that is also Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:04.969 --> 00:20:15.275
Once you have passed it, take its education. But it is so easy to achieve, because inside you, now you don't have to tell me that this is the color blue.

00:20:15.275 --> 00:20:23.474
But once someone had told you that this is the color blue. Now we know what the color blue is. We know what the color red is.

00:20:23.474 --> 00:20:34.213
We have to tell you once. So if I tell you once that this chakra is the Vishuddhi Chakra of Shri Krishna, and when it is damaged, it causes diseases like cold, cough etc.

00:20:34.213 --> 00:20:40.816
This chakra is also damaged by excessive remembrance of the Name. Similarly, this chakra, this is the Vishuddhi Chakra on the left.

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:43.997
This chakra is damaged by eating tobacco etc.

00:20:43.997 --> 00:20:56.519
Or a person thinks that I am always wrong, that is, a person who thinks about himself using some inferiority complex also damages this chakra.

00:20:56.519 --> 00:21:01.376
Then how to overcome it etc. Because you can do it only after the connection.

00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:09.544
Before that, where will you make a telephone call when you do not have a connection? We remember God all the time, that's it.

00:21:09.544 --> 00:21:13.824
Then, we worship the pinda with our hands on our hips and we get a heart attack.

00:21:13.824 --> 00:21:16.452
How did you get a heart attack when Shiva is in your heart?

00:21:16.452 --> 00:21:19.967
The reason for that is such an unauthorized act.

00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:30.560
You still have to go to the kingdom of God. Until you go to the kingdom of God, you are not a citizen of God.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.626
Without becoming a citizen of God, how can you use whatever blessings are in His kingdom?

00:21:37.626 --> 00:21:45.859
What right do you have over Him? Suppose, if you are a citizen of India, you have a right over the Prime Minister of India.

00:21:45.859 --> 00:21:51.461
But if you go to England and demonstrate, people will catch you and take you away. Who are you?

00:21:51.461 --> 00:22:01.331
Then a person should go to the kingdom of God first. And then devotion really blossoms.

00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:04.724
Krishna has said this very beautifully in the Gita.

00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:08.029
Krishna was a great politician.

00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:18.727
Because his entire life was a special play.  He would explain it to people through a play.

00:22:18.727 --> 00:22:19.871
They don't listen to it straight away.

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:23.433
Then you understand when you have to hit something somewhere.

00:22:23.433 --> 00:22:27.355
If the ghee doesn't come out with a straight finger, then you have to use a slightly crooked finger.

00:22:27.355 --> 00:22:32.297
And that was the time. So Krishna told only Arjuna. He didn't tell anyone else.

00:22:32.297 --> 00:22:38.198
And if Arjuna didn't understand that either, then he did things by reversing the finger.

00:22:38.198 --> 00:22:44.158
And in just two words, I will tell you the Gita, what is its essence. So now you too can understand.

00:22:44.158 --> 00:22:50.418
First, for the first time, he told you to attain knowledge.

00:22:50.418 --> 00:22:53.805
How will you attain knowledge by reading books?

00:22:53.805 --> 00:22:58.803
Kabir has said, “Every time a learned Pandit becomes a fool”

00:22:58.803 --> 00:23:04.252
and I see such fools coming here every day. “Phadtamurkh” is a very sharp word in our Marathi.

00:23:04.252 --> 00:23:14.135
Ramdas must have seen many learned fools. That is when he mentioned them as “Phadtamurkh”. And these learned fools will not do it.

00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:21.332
Knowledge means that the consciousness that is inside us is awakened, so we should know it in that consciousness.

00:23:21.332 --> 00:23:29.044
Today we have human consciousness. Suppose if there is dirt here, we cannot go through that dirt. We can immediately put our finger on its nose.

00:23:29.044 --> 00:23:33.876
But if you ask a horse to be ridden, it does not want to get dirty. It will go straight ahead.

00:23:33.876 --> 00:23:38.498
That consciousness has not come into it. Its mind has not become that conscious.

00:23:38.498 --> 00:23:45.271
Or its personality has not come into the consciousness that this is dirt.

00:23:45.271 --> 00:23:51.122
It does not want to go through this dirt. Again, no matter what color you give it, it does not want to understand it.

00:23:51.122 --> 00:23:54.719
We understand the association of colors. We understand what beauty is.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:57.922
These things have come into the consciousness of a person.

00:23:57.922 --> 00:24:00.805
But we still understand sin and virtue only with our intellect.

00:24:00.805 --> 00:24:03.182
We do not want to do it because our mother told us that it is bad.

00:24:03.182 --> 00:24:07.647
We do not want to do it because our father told us to do it, or because it is written in the Gita.

00:24:07.647 --> 00:24:12.360
But that has not yet come into our consciousness.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.740
After Sahaja Yoga, it comes into our consciousness.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.031
That is, even if you say you can do it, you cannot do it. There will be trouble. Bring vibrations.

00:24:22.031 --> 00:24:27.758
If you try to do something, you will immediately get stuck in your head.

00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:32.927
It will happen automatically. You will not have to make any effort for it.

00:24:32.927 --> 00:24:38.548
When this Dharma awakens in you, you will not have to tell me. You will start it yourself.

00:24:38.548 --> 00:24:42.347
There was a householder. He used to smoke a lot.

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:49.014
Even after Sahaj Yoga, he did not try. He could have quit in a moment. But he did not try.

00:24:49.014 --> 00:24:52.990
Now, since he had been smoking since childhood, he could not quit.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:25:01.113
Finally, he came to me and said, “Mother, when I sit in meditation, my mouth feels so big. I don’t understand whether I am becoming like Hanuman or not.”

00:25:01.113 --> 00:25:05.075
Now, should I tell you the truth? I know that you smoke.

00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:08.945
Going back. Sometimes you smoke like this, is it true or not?

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:16.601
It is good to say, Mother. There is no doubt about it. Now I believe it, he said. now just promise me in front of me that you will not smoke.

00:25:16.601 --> 00:25:21.502
What is the point of hiding it from me? As soon as he said it, the tobacco suddenly quit and it was gone.

00:25:21.502 --> 00:25:30.446
Such things get quit in this way. Dharma is automatically awakened within. No need to tell, no need to work hard for it.

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:41.738
I realized that this was the awakening of Dharma. Knowledge is that consciousness within you, within your personality.

00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:45.147
That consciousness must become conscious.

00:25:45.147 --> 00:25:55.228
This is what Krishna called “knowledge” and that is why he said that only through knowledge can you become like God. This knowledge.

00:25:55.228 --> 00:26:03.432
About devotion, he then said that if you want to do devotion, do it unwavering. That is very good.

00:26:03.432 --> 00:26:07.544
Give me the flowers, fruits, whatever you want. I will take it. When I take it, I take everything.

00:26:07.544 --> 00:26:11.945
When I give it, it is unwavering. Now, you see, there is a flaw in this word.

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:16.591
Unwavering. That is, when there is no other.

00:26:16.591 --> 00:26:25.116
That is, when it has been enlightened. Only when it has been enlighted  devotion is fun. Otherwise, who do you call by calling them?

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:34.041
As I told you now, there are many types of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:37.047
Infinite people have received infinite blessings.

00:26:37.047 --> 00:26:47.467
One of us had an architect. He said, "Mother, I used to worship so many gods, I used to worship so many goddesses, but I have eighteen worlds of poverty."

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:52.740
When I came to Sahaja Yoga, he said, "It starts raining." What does "rain" mean?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:27:03.401
So, he said, they sent me to build special houses in places where it was raining a lot, and there was only money there.

00:27:03.401 --> 00:27:14.378
A very ordinary man. A farmer. He had a small farm. It was not even half an acre and a fisherman.

00:27:14.378 --> 00:27:20.064
Every day he would come to see me and bring me a beautiful garland of flowers.

00:27:20.064 --> 00:27:24.586
I said, "Dada, why are you spending so much? It is too much for you, Patil. Don't do this.

00:27:24.586 --> 00:27:29.494
I don't feel good about it." You know what I mean, mother, then why are you saying this to me?

00:27:29.494 --> 00:27:38.638
He said that half of my farm was completely wasteland. Half of the land means I use about half an acre of land.

00:27:38.638 --> 00:27:48.475
A man came to me and said, should I take the soil from this land? If I use this soil, bricks will be good.

00:27:48.475 --> 00:27:56.150
That is, if I mix a little of that soil and say, I start getting so much money from it, what is the meaning of a garland?

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:01.335
In this way, the Lakshmi element that is in your navel chakra is awakened.

00:28:01.335 --> 00:28:07.157
That is why Krishna has said that you should do unwavering  devotion.

00:28:07.157 --> 00:28:11.653
Until you have a connection with God, what is the use of breaking these walls.

00:28:11.653 --> 00:28:21.467
So many warriors go. Look at their condition? Poverty. Their health is bad. They have cancer. Trouble in their throat.

00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:29.199
What kind of brains have those idiots cracked. What kind of things? Their condition like a beggar.

00:28:29.199 --> 00:28:35.000
Would Vitthal like this? But they have not yet had a relationship with Vitthal.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.567
As soon as they did, everything changed!

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:41.091
So they told them to do unwavering devotion.

00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:48.842
First get the Lord. Then that devotion becomes real fun. Otherwise it seems like something imaginary.

00:28:48.842 --> 00:28:52.732
Our children have abandoned the name of God.

00:28:52.732 --> 00:29:00.639
Because here we have to wake up at four in the morning, burn sandalwood, bathe God. What did he get from doing that? That's all he gets angry about.

00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:06.737
If he wants to drink alcohol, he drinks alcohol, he uses black money, he also uses black money.

00:29:06.737 --> 00:29:11.192
All kinds of businesses. All kinds of businesses. They just wake up in the morning and spend it.

00:29:11.192 --> 00:29:21.188
What did they get then? If they don't get anything, then why should we do this hard work? So they have concluded that there is no God.

00:29:21.188 --> 00:29:31.625
In Algeria, the elders, the elderly, are very much like Khomeini. They call them fundamentalists.

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:38.110
And they used to cut off the hand of a person if he made a slight mistake.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.367
If someone did something, they would cut off his throat.

00:29:40.367 --> 00:29:47.462
They used to bury him in the sand, and beat him with shoes on top. They have started some kind of race.

00:29:47.462 --> 00:29:57.420
They have started it. Just like Khomeini. Extreme fanaticism. Seeing that, the children there became communists. They said there can be no such God.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:04.148
How can there be such an evil God? But only one of them came to our London and got realised.

00:30:04.148 --> 00:30:13.641
A boy. He immediately went and said that there is God. He is not even fanatic and he was not in the middle of saying no to him.

00:30:13.641 --> 00:30:21.168
And today we will be surprised, there are many educated, well-educated children of Muslims here. Five hundred children have got realised in Algeria.

00:30:21.168 --> 00:30:28.815
Then think about your children tomorrow in your society.

00:30:28.815 --> 00:30:37.465
To add to that, this is the time of Nikari. At that time, we should have unwavering devotion.

00:30:37.465 --> 00:30:47.807
Third is “Karma Yoga”, Shri Krishna said that whatever you want to do, you should place it at the feet of God.

00:30:47.807 --> 00:30:51.693
Many people ask me. “Whatever we, Mother, used to do, we placed it at the feet of God”.

00:30:51.693 --> 00:30:55.291
These are impossible things.

00:30:55.291 --> 00:30:59.499
Shri Krishna used to say impossible things. Impossible.

00:30:59.499 --> 00:31:07.442
Oh, no matter how much you say you placed it in the hands of God, but have you placed it? Because as long as the ego is there, it will not go away. That ego must go away.

00:31:07.442 --> 00:31:12.459
Now, if people want to give up the ego, they will have to fight with it. People see it from that perspective.

00:31:12.459 --> 00:31:18.798
Just like a balloon that gets hit, it gets bigger and bigger. Such a person gets a double ego.

00:31:18.798 --> 00:31:22.692
They say, ‘We have given up this, we have given up that, we have given up this.’

00:31:22.692 --> 00:31:25.959
Only the intellect seems to have been given up. Nothing else has been given up.

00:31:25.959 --> 00:31:35.930
People get such a false ego, and thinking that we have given up everything on God, they live in a lie. In delusion.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:50.116
That happens only when, this happens only when it starts flowing through your hands easily. And what do you say? It is flowing, it is going, it is coming, something third. You are the third.

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:54.669
This consciousness is flowing, Mataji Kundalini is coming up.

00:31:54.669 --> 00:32:02.333
A woman came to America with me. She said, "Mother, I came with you so much that you give my son realization, but it doesn't happen."

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:11.242
She said, "What should I do now?" She said, "You give me a certificate." How can you give a certificate like that? She said, "It should happen."

00:32:11.242 --> 00:32:20.699
Even if it's your wish, it shouldn't happen. It should happen. There's no lying in it. There's no counting money. There's no standing on your head. Whatever is, is what it is.

00:32:20.699 --> 00:32:32.131
Then it will happen in Karma Yoga too, Karma Yoga really happens only when you get self realisation.

00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:36.735
Then they say it is happening, it is coming and going. Now we have become witnesses.

00:32:36.735 --> 00:32:46.511
Until this happens, people should not remain in delusion and think that we have become very big dharmic.

00:32:46.511 --> 00:32:57.184
Then it should be said that Dharma becomes so awakened, like a flower should become a fruit and the whole flower should disappear, a person becomes beyond the qualities and becomes beyond the Dharma.

00:32:57.184 --> 00:33:04.323
That state should come. Nowadays, such and such a thing, various types of Gurus, various types of things have come out.

00:33:04.323 --> 00:33:10.595
“पायलीचे पन्नास निघाले पण मिडाले काय?” is indeed a Marathi proverb. It was said to be fifty per measure, but did we even get anything?. All talk, no action.

00:33:10.595 --> 00:33:18.101
Just yesterday a householder came to me. He said, I think I have had a revelation. Who gave it to me? Our Guru. He said, look at this.

00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:25.368
Do you think you should tell me where this man's Kundalini is? Ah, I need that much knowledge.

00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:29.455
I cannot tell you that. Well, tell me where yours is. I cannot tell you that either.

00:33:29.455 --> 00:33:32.640
He said, then what was the realisation?

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.632
Suppose a blind man's eyes are healed, if he says, "My eyes are healed," the doctor asks him, "Tell me how many fingers he has."

00:33:38.632 --> 00:33:41.247
I cannot tell him, but his eyes are healed. How can that happen?

00:33:41.247 --> 00:33:49.522
He has to see it, he has to understand it, he has to know it, otherwise how did your eyes heal?

00:33:49.522 --> 00:33:56.243
There are such gurus. He says, I have kriya. Why is that?

00:33:56.243 --> 00:34:04.834
A householder came, sat with both feet near me. He said, "Ah, you don't want to sit with Mataji like that, both feet. I know that, but what should I do? If I put my feet close like that, I would become like a frog.

00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:10.376
Why is that? Is that what our Guru said that if you become enlightened, you will become like a frog.

00:34:10.376 --> 00:34:18.650
Now, what will you become like a frog after becoming a human? Why a snake or a scorpion? Think about it simply.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:24.402
Do you fly like a frog, do you stand on your head, that means you don't even have your own balance.

00:34:24.402 --> 00:34:36.687
The body balance that you had achieved in the human body till now, has also been lost and beyond it, you started dancing wildly, flying like crazy, taking off your clothes - so what kind of stupidity is this?

00:34:36.687 --> 00:34:40.456
And that means we have got realisation.

00:34:40.456 --> 00:34:45.897
If a human being wants to cross over, then all the animals should cross over first. Why humans?

00:34:45.897 --> 00:34:52.728
Some people take off their sleeves. But even stupid people have their limits.

00:34:52.728 --> 00:35:01.639
Now if you have such wisdom, there is a supply department for you. Many people come prepared in this way.

00:35:01.639 --> 00:35:06.521
There was a gentleman in our Nagpur. I know him well.

00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:13.114
He was very popular in our boss's company, his father told him to do it somewhere.

00:35:13.114 --> 00:35:18.953
His father was also in our office. So the boss told him that it's okay, I will send him a personal.

00:35:18.953 --> 00:35:25.910
He went there and did fifty businesses. He did black market, smuggling, bigling, whatever he wanted to do.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.773
Then his father died. So he got property etc.

00:35:29.773 --> 00:35:34.102
He sold his wife's jewellery, sold the house. He did this and that and ran away.

00:35:34.102 --> 00:35:41.477
His mother came crying, what should we do now, we trusted him and gave him the jewellery. We took everything away.

00:35:41.477 --> 00:35:44.803
Now how can we go to the police when our son has stolen something like this and that.

00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:48.628
So the poor man went to his mother's house somewhere in Baroda.

00:35:48.628 --> 00:35:52.976
Now this gentleman has become a very big name. What is his name? He named him Gulab Baba.

00:35:52.976 --> 00:35:59.709
He named him Gulab Baba. He, his mother told me that he sent me a lot of money and money, everything happened.

00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:04.994
He gave us a house back. He wanted to send money. So I swore to him once. He said, "Tell me. Who are you? How do you send money?"

00:36:04.994 --> 00:36:14.111
I wrote in a letter. Then I came to know that this Maharaj is famous by the name of Gulab Baba. Gulab Baba. That is, he is a braggart.

00:36:14.111 --> 00:36:20.200
So I sent a message to tell Gulab Baba that I am coming to Nagpur.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:25.102
After that, for three months, Gulab Baba was not seen anywhere.

00:36:25.102 --> 00:36:32.543
And he was telling everyone what was going on, the horse numbers. And all these Marwari people were going there and asking for the horse numbers.

00:36:32.543 --> 00:36:36.235
Now think about this. Does God know the horse numbers?

00:36:36.235 --> 00:36:41.338
But there were people standing in lines there.

00:36:41.338 --> 00:36:46.272
You will be surprised, thousands of people were with him.

00:36:46.272 --> 00:36:55.857
So now you can see for yourself the wisdom of man. All these types. Ghostly.

00:36:55.857 --> 00:37:01.544
What if someone gave you a diamond or a horse? Doesn't God have any more sense?

00:37:01.544 --> 00:37:09.402
Otherwise, the goddess comes into the body of our wives. In the body. In the body of all the maids.

00:37:09.402 --> 00:37:12.691
She did not see any other place for her, poor thing.

00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:21.909
She started worshipping them. She came to their feet. But how difficult it is to come into the body. How much trouble it causes to a person.

00:37:21.909 --> 00:37:26.126
People become like crazy. All these are types of ghosts.

00:37:26.126 --> 00:37:33.121
In our Maharashtra, they do it especially in temples. This type in the temple of Mahalaxmi.

00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:38.841
Their trustees said, Mother, you are here in our presence and this is in our house. First I said, close this. First thing.

00:37:38.841 --> 00:37:47.750
Second, close this shop, then I will come. And I called them to the temple. I said, first close this money-making business that you have started in the name of God.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:54.906
So they got angry with me. I said, go. You will get angry today, tomorrow you will get angry. The government took it in ten days.

00:37:54.906 --> 00:38:01.992
Then you give importance to your own people and they take advantage of you.

00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:06.443
You will not get God through them. God is within you, get Him.

00:38:06.443 --> 00:38:13.430
Then the third way. Nanak said to search within oneself.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:17.271
Search within oneself, he used to sing endless hymns.

00:38:17.271 --> 00:38:22.273
Search within oneself, Baba, search within oneself. Oh, who is going to search?

00:38:22.273 --> 00:38:27.539
I said that if you take this penicillin, you will feel better.

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:34.322
So if you walk on the road and take penicillin, I will feel better. Did you take penicillin?

00:38:34.322 --> 00:38:43.683
Did you cure yourself? Did it benefit you? That is, the addition of wisdom, which is said to be given in the wrong place.

00:38:43.683 --> 00:38:50.049
Then when the addition of wisdom came, they would make fun of God. Not God. This seems to be something completely false.

00:38:50.049 --> 00:39:00.607
This. Either it may be bad wisdom or it may be good wisdom. It is not good wisdom. Good wisdom is God Himself.

00:39:00.607 --> 00:39:05.653
Therefore, we first ask Vinayak to give us good wisdom.

00:39:05.653 --> 00:39:09.706
The one who gives good wisdom is our naive Vinayak.

00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:18.626
And we ask him, you give us good wisdom, let us also get God through your good wisdom.

00:39:18.626 --> 00:39:31.212
Now who is Vinayak? Who is Shankar? Who is Krishna? What is his place among us? Who is Christ? Who is Mohammed? We know nothing about them.

00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:39.690
A Haridas Bhuvan used to stand, put tar brought from somewhere on us, and he would give us a lecture by putting black paint on his face.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.706
I had to put my head on his feet, the end.

00:39:42.706 --> 00:39:49.527
Oh, what a great treasure God has given you. Shouldn't you get it? You should get it.

00:39:49.527 --> 00:39:55.164
And you will definitely get it. Especially in this holy land of Maharashtra.

00:39:55.164 --> 00:39:58.719
Today, when I saw Shivaji Maharaj, I immediately remembered those days.

00:39:58.719 --> 00:40:06.428
What is it? What is his understanding? He is like an incarnation. He knows what religion is.

00:40:06.428 --> 00:40:16.766
How much importance he gave to the daughter-in-law of Muslims and convinced people that how should we view other people's wives.

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:21.456
Despite being kings and emperors, what brilliant people have become in this country.

00:40:21.456 --> 00:40:23.314
That is a characteristic of Maharashtra.

00:40:23.314 --> 00:40:29.797
But it is transcended, it is awakened. The greatest Sahaja Yogi was from Maharashtra.

00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:39.219
But the work that was needed at that time, at that time our country was under foreign rule, so we had to fight with them, he did that work.

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:42.792
But he was successful in that too. He did it with religion. He did not do wrong.

00:40:42.792 --> 00:40:52.395
Today, the situation has come that Shivaji should awaken in us so that we can do what we have done for our own freedom.

00:40:52.395 --> 00:40:57.763
This work is very simple and straightforward.

00:40:57.763 --> 00:41:00.572
We have done all the alchemy for that.

00:41:00.572 --> 00:41:08.944
We have penetrated into everyone's Kundali and removed all the types of people of every caste.

00:41:08.944 --> 00:41:11.360
We have detailed knowledge of everyone.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:18.595
That we know this. That they have come from the here and now. That they have come from this drama.

00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:24.522
Then we will tell you how to arrange it properly. It is very simple.

00:41:24.522 --> 00:41:30.696
But you should not have any delusional ideas about yourself. First of all, you should not have any inferiority complex.

00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:37.541
Many people think, Mother, I am a palmer, what is wrong with me, what kind of work am I? Hey, if it were you, why would you come here in front of me?

00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:46.874
Secondly, I am someone. Sistham Bharati. A scientist is very big.

00:41:46.874 --> 00:41:55.551
Is that what I said? Now ask a question, mother, are you really the one who has all the knowledge of science?

00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:58.021
Suddenly, power started in his hands.

00:41:58.021 --> 00:42:00.851
This power comes from somewhere.

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:08.464
Where does the power come from in the tree that we see so big outside, from that root. It is buried below.

00:42:08.464 --> 00:42:14.495
If we become just a tree, can we survive? In the western countries, these people are just trying to become a tree.

00:42:14.495 --> 00:42:17.890
Now they are thinking only about how to give life?

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:22.662
From morning to evening, they have this one play, how to give life now.

00:42:22.662 --> 00:42:31.762
Only after finding the roots, the tree will remain and because of those roots, it is in this country. It is in hand.

00:42:31.762 --> 00:42:35.281
Now the entire human life will be happy.

00:42:35.281 --> 00:42:39.708
This power that he needs will be fulfilled by Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:39.708 --> 00:42:50.974
This evening I will tell you everything about the chakras. And I will tell you in the evening how this improves our political, social, economic and mental as well as our physical condition.

00:42:50.974 --> 00:42:54.884
But I have told you a lot now. If you have any questions, ask.

00:42:54.884 --> 00:43:00.855
And now get realisation  because it is too late. Then everyone should get realisation first.

00:43:00.855 --> 00:43:02.939
Nothing will happen unless you get realisation it. Then if you have any questions, ask.
