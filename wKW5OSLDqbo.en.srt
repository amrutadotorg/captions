1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,120
It's been two years since Shri Mataji came to Sydney and

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,000
many people have joined Sahaja Yoga and

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,960
many people will remember Her.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,880
Many people are developing their realization

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,360
and it's a great experience that's happening

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,720
not only of course in Sydney but all over the world.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
Sahaja Yoga is a happening,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,880
it's an actualization of something that lies within us.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,400
The subtle body that is represented here on the chart

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,480
is a map or a chart of our inner mechanism

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,960
that mechanism of our subtle body which

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,360
doctors can't of course see,

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,080
or operate on but which lies quietly working

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,720
as the basis of our whole human existence.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,360
Within that subtle body

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,600
there is system of what we call centers or chakras

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,280
and those chakras are the

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,840
I suppose we could call them, energy centers which

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,480
give us at first the vitality

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,080
for physical existence but

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,160
as we develop, as we evolve into higher of human beings,

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,320
they become slowly to stage where

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,080
they can be enlightened.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,000
We become aware of the seeking within each one of us.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,160
We become aware of that inner subtlety that is always there

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,880
but which due to our human existence,

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,520
we become disconnected from.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,160
What is this subtlety?

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,880
The subtlety is the eternal Spirit of Almighty God,

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,880
that aspect of God which lies quietly,

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,680
the witness to all that we do but

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,760
not manifesting in our daily being.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,880
The Spirit is what we have to become,

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,200
it's what Christ has said, "We have to become the Spirit."

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,960
It's what Mohammed said, it's what the Buddha said,

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,960
it's what all the Hindu philosophers, all the Hindu saints

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,840
and all the great incarnations that  have come on this earth,

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
have said.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
"You have to become the Spirit." You have to be born again.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,440
And what is this being born again?

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,200
So many people hear about re-birth,

42
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,160
hear about being born again. Cults that are developing,

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,440
talking about being born again

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,920
and yet it's actually only mental activity at that stage.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,120
You have to become something, you have to get your own powers,

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,360
you have to be able to maneuver those powers

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
before we can speak of being a realized soul.

48
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,680
You actually develop within yourself an awareness,

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,080
but not only an awareness but a practical capacity

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,800
to become a spiritual person.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
For all these lifetimes we've been a human being.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,680
We've reached the stage in evolution now where,

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
we can just go that extra stage further

54
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,880
to become a spiritual being.

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Now whose going to do the job? How does it happen?

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,880
What is the mechanism within us that allows this process to work?

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Until recently meaning,

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,920
until the last ten years,

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
this process has been one whereby

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,400
individuals and perhaps on a one to one basis

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,440
a few people got their Self Realization.

62
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,760
It was almost as if that first on the tree of life there were

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,880
just a few flowers and those flowers turned to fruit.

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
But now the grace of God is completely overflowing,

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,520
He wants everybody to have it,

66
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,680
He wants us to take that last step in our evolution

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,000
and we all have to get our Self Realization.

68
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,760
And yet it seems too simple, it seems too easy,

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,360
it seems too much something which cannot happen

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,760
in such a beautiful simple way.

71
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,120
And yet that's precisely what it is.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,160
So many people are looking for a complex explanation

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920
of Self-Realization.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,280
So many people are looking in books

75
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,680
to find out how you get it.

76
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,040
Others are going to gurus,

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,840
others are seeking it in the highways and byways of various forms of

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,480
perhaps even area of fringed seeking such as parapsychology

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
and ESP and clairvoyance and a hundred other

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,920
isms and methods so called as spiritual seeking.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,920
And yet it's so simple.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,760
What happens is that the subtle energy within us

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,160
which lies in that triangular bone

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,200
that is at the base of the chart and which is in fact

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,680
our sacrum at the base of the spine,

86
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,240
that subtle energy has to rise and when it rises

87
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,800
it passes through each of the centers

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,480
that are shown graphically on the chart

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,760
and finally pierces through this chakra at the top of the head,

90
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,680
and you begin to feel on your hands, the cool vibrations.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
You begin to feel those same cool vibrations

92
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,680
coming from the top of the head,

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,160
you begin to become one with God.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
You become a complete personality, you become integrated.

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,760
So what is this happening and how does it happen so simply?

96
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,880
It's almost as if,

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,280
we with our Western,

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,680
rather torturous minds, want a complex explanation.

99
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,600
So, we go to complex disciplines, we read complex books,

100
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,040
we do all sorts of exercises,

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,400
we strive, we pray, we do so many things which

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,880
attain very, very little in the sense of real achievement.

103
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,680
And so, we have to get it.

104
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,680
And before us is a person who is an enlightened being

105
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,880
and She is one who not only promises to give it,

106
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,880
not only talks about the process of Self Realization,

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,680
not only brings you to the logical conclusion that

108
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
you have to achieve something higher,

109
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,880
but She can actually do the job.

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,680
She can actually give you the experience of Self Realization

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,440
and you can begin to feel it

112
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,880
as those same cool vibrations that I spoke about.

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,800
You begin to feel the cool vibrations that were referred to

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,880
by the Lord Jesus Christ as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit.

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,400
You begin to feel

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,880
the cool vibrations that Mohammad referred to as the Ruh,

117
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,920
that the Hindu teachers referred to as the chaitanya.

118
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,760
You begin to feel it. Not only do you feel it on your hands but

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,240
you feel it emitting from the top of the head,

120
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,200
from this center here.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,200
And so, logically

122
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,800
and within the sensitivity

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
and consciously within your central nervous system

124
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,800
you begin to perceive the experience of Self Realization.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,800
The Kundalini rises, it ignites the flame of the Spirit which lies

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,880
dormant in the heart, just the witness,

127
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,240
and you become connected to Almighty God.

128
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,600
You become one with the All-Pervading power of God.

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,680
When this brain of Divinity, which lies within each one of us

130
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,880
which is only just a reflection of Almighty God within us,

131
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,680
actually unites with Almighty God

132
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,280
in a very real way.

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,200
This is what happens, when Self-Realization takes place

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,240
and after it happens you get your own powers.

135
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,920
You become your own guru.

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,880
You don't slavishly have to follow anything.

137
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,400
You don't have to read any more books.

138
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,160
You can become quite selective about the type of food you eat

139
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,880
and the type of exercises you do.

140
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,320
You choose according to the type of temperament you are,

141
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,400
that type of food, or activity, or

142
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
exercise or whatever it is, which is

143
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,880
particularly suitable to your tendency

144
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,560
and which will bring you into that balance,

145
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,200
which Self Realization expresses.

146
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,680
And so, if before us, is sitting one who can do the job,

147
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,320
and all we have to do is simply hold our hands up to Her,

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
She must be somebody rather special,

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,160
especially if it happens so simply.

150
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Our logical mind or perhaps even I should say, our rational mind

151
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,800
will question it.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,160
It will ask all sorts of complicated questions.

153
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,480
It will ask whether She is real,

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,240
it will ask whether the experience that you are feeling is

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,680
perhaps not the air conditioning

156
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,320
I just hear that it seems to gone off,

157
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,880
all sorts of things,

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,960
coming to our rational mind and we put barriers in the place.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,080
What actually happens at that moment is

160
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,920
the Kundalini that rises through the central channel

161
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,880
gets blocked at this point,

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,520
where as you can probably see the two left and the right channels

163
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,960
create what we call our ego and our super ego

164
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,720
what psychologists have often called

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
the intuitive mind and the mechanical mind

166
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,880
or which Freud referred to, when he was talking about the id

167
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,880
being the super ego.

168
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,080
Not that Freud was an expert on this

169
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
He dealt with one side only and in fact

170
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,280
in our opinion has done a lot of harm.

171
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,360
So, the Kundalini rises to this point

172
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,360
and these two balloons actually block the rising of the Kundalini

173
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,960
when, in fact, we use rational methods to reach God.

174
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,880
So we have to go a step further.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,360
We have to say I have not reached it rationally,

176
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,680
I have not reached it by my striving,

177
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,360
I am a seeker, I love God,

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
I want the ultimate, I want that union with God,

179
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
so how do I get it?

180
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,720
So if there is somebody who is an enlightened light

181
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
and if that principle of the candle,

182
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,800
of one light enlightening another is true,

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,120
then, this can happen to you tonight.

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,800
And it does happen to thousands all over the world.

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,680
There are Sahaja Yogis

186
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,760
all over the world who are growing

187
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,280
in the awareness within themselves of the nature of their spirit

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,280
who are Realized souls but who are attaining their ultimate,

189
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,960
who are finding that their health

190
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,760
both mental and physical is improving,

191
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,920
who is finding a great deal more joy in their life,

192
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,680
who are finding that they overcome the stresses

193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,480
and strains of modern living

194
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,720
and who themselves become a powerhouse of that dynamic force,

195
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,120
which thinks and loves and coordinates

196
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,160
and does all of those things which,

197
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,200
in our imagination, we see as the job of God.

198
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,680
You develop your own powers,

199
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,280
you don't slavishly follow any guru.

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,080
Mother is only here to enlighten that which is your own

201
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,080
and so, when She does the job,

202
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,320
you become a complete personality,

203
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,680
you can give Realization to others,

204
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
you become very dynamic

205
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,800
and it works out in a very, very wonderful way

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
that so many people are transformed.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,520
What you were yesterday, what you were last year

208
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,040
is not what you are today.

209
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,400
After Realization you can do something about

210
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
the complications of modern living.

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,000
You can actually see the transformation in yourself and others

212
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,680
and you begin to enjoy the beauty of the Spirit.

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to again introduce

214
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,400
to some of you but to many for the first time,

215
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,880
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

216
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
But before

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,480
we come to right conclusion

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,040
about our seeking

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,200
we have to understand

221
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,880
that truth is not a mental action.

222
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,680
If your mind says that this is this, it need not be that.

223
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,040
It is our everyday experience in life,

224
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,680
that mentally when we try to establish something

225
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,040
we find after some time

226
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,880
that we have not been absolutely correct about it.

227
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,120
Whatever is known to us is already there

228
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
but whatever is unknown,

229
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,960
even about that, if you have pre-conceived ideas

230
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,400
that this is the unknown, this is God, this is Spirit,

231
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,880
then, it could be that you are very much away from the truth.

232
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,880
But scientifically if you have to approach any subject

233
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,960
you have to keep your mind absolutely clean and open.

234
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,040
That it has been said by many great saints,

235
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,160
many great gurus, that we are to be born again

236
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,280
and that we are the Spirit.

237
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,520
Are we to believe in them or not?

238
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Perhaps we should reach at least this conclusion,

239
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,680
that they did not take any money from anyone

240
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,000
and they could not have been fake people.

241
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,760
They did not do it for money sake.

242
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,120
So, if we have to be born again,

243
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,000
to reach the right conclusion

244
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,920
we should know what should happen to us.

245
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,040
For example, if you certify that "I am a born again"

246
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,120
then it is misleading.

247
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,960
Supposing I self certify Myself

248
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,760
that I am the Prime Minister of Australia. do I become?

249
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,880
I have to become.

250
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,600
So just by taking a certificate we are cheating ourselves

251
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,040
and avoiding the opportunity to be born again.

252
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,680
So to be honest is the first

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,000
way we can really be the seekers of truth.

254
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,680
If you are not honest and if you have preconceived ideas

255
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,000
you want to stick to it, then I would say it is rather difficult.

256
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,680
But logically we should come to a point where we should understand

257
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,960
that what should happen, when we receive the truth,

258
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,800
in our evolutionary process what has happened to us.

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,280
Actually, our awareness has been enlightened in new dimensions

260
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,680
as we grew up in our evolution.

261
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
An animal does not understand filth and dirt.

262
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
You can take a horse through any dirty lane

263
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,680
but a human being is very sensitive, he has to close his nose

264
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,880
or sometimes he even refuses to go through that.

265
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,720
So, in our awareness something has to happen

266
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,560
and that is not some sort of an abnormal thing.

267
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,800
Like some people, I was told, have written books

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
that you have to become mad to be evolved.

269
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I mean in what evolutionary stage did it happen?

270
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,800
Did the fishes became mad

271
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,880
to become the higher animals?

272
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,520
When did it happen that you had to become mad to evolve?

273
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,680
Is a wrong idea that people give,

274
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,200
because they can only make you mad, nothing else.

275
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,680
And you like it, because one way they pamper your ego by saying

276
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
that you can pay for them and secondly

277
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,400
they also give you a feeling that you are something different.

278
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,680
To be something different is not to be evolved.

279
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,680
We have so many mad people in this world,

280
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,360
we have so many epileptic people, we have so many people who jump

281
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,480
all over the places. There's nothing great about it.

282
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
Whatever you can do easily is to jump

283
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,120
or to shout or to scream or to misbehave.

284
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,520
All these things are very easy for human-beings to do.

285
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,680
But if something has to happen from the Divine

286
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,680
and if it is a living process,

287
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,880
then something should happen within us, which is not in our reach,

288
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,360
which is the, something that is beyond the human reach.

289
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
That has to be this Divine thing.

290
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,360
So we must understand that in our seeking

291
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,520
what we have to seek is a higher dimension to our awareness.

292
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,680
In that dimension you have to become something.

293
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,680
Like you have become a human being,

294
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,040
you are no more a monkey, you are a human being now.

295
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
In the same way you have to become something.

296
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,400
In Sanskrit language, a brahmin, a person who is a realized soul,

297
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,160
the one who knows the Brahma, the All Pervading power,

298
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
is called as dwijaha, means born again.

299
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,400
And also a bird is called as dwijaha.

300
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,240
A bird is first born as an egg

301
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,960
and then it is born as a bird.

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,000
There's complete transformation.

303
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,680
You don't have to certify a bird that it is no more an egg

304
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,080
it just becomes, you see it's true that it becomes.

305
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,240
So those who are honest and those who are really seeking

306
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,800
must know that you have to become something.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,360
It's not just that you become mad

308
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,880
or you become like some sort of a funny, freaky fellow,

309
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,680
but you become really something that is in your awareness.

310
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Now if you have to go to science we'll find out

311
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,760
that Jung, who was a realized soul, who got Realization much later,

312
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,680
and then he defied Freud,

313
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,520
has clearly said that if a human being evolves,

314
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:47,000
he'll have to become collectively conscious,

315
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,360
his consciousness becomes collectively aware.

316
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,680
Meaning that you should feel others

317
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
within yourself on your finger tips.

318
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,400
Mohammad Sahab has said,

319
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,880
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak".

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,080
Your hands have to speak.

321
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,320
Now the hands have no tongues to speak, so what happens?

322
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,040
It is accepted in the medical science

323
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,880
that the sympathetic

324
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,880
nervous system is expressed in your seven centers,

325
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,040
on your fingers but they don't know which are where and how it is.

326
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
They, they cannot quote it and they are honest about it.

327
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,960
But they say there is some sympathetic connection

328
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,760
with the fingertips.

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,320
So in your awareness it has to happen

330
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,120
by which you have to be more alert,

331
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,520
more normal, more dynamic,

332
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,880
more beautiful, more loving, more understanding.

333
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,880
So something has to happen to your central nervous-system.

334
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,280
It must be apparent that you are feeling something more

335
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,880
in your central nervous system.

336
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,680
Now what people are enamored is that

337
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,920
if they see some people dancing madly, they feel enamored.

338
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:27,880
Is a sign that you have not been able to understand.

339
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,800
We have seen Christ,

340
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,040
we have seen Buddha, Mahavira,

341
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,400
Kabira, Nanaka, we had Laotse

342
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,840
and so many others.

343
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Did they behave like this? Did they become mad?

344
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,000
We have got Moses. Did he become mad anytime?

345
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,120
Was he mad anytime, behaving like a mad person?

346
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,880
All these new theories have started, I think, fifty years back

347
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,360
or about sixty years back, that

348
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,000
people believe in these new theories and they have forgotten all the

349
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,400
traditional things that have come to us, our heritage.

350
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,680
And we depend more on these non-nonsensical things

351
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,920
which has no moorings at all,

352
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
because the people who are supposed to be

353
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,400
the founders of all the religions have never behaved like this

354
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,240
and why this new type of thing that has started

355
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,680
that people are behaving in this manner

356
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,320
and accepting it to be a very normal thing.

357
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,080
So all the seekers must know that you have to become the Spirit

358
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,760
means you must feel your own powers.

359
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,880
It is not that you feel the powers of another person,

360
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,920
now he is a person who brings out some diamonds for you. So what?

361
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,680
Logically you reach a conclusion

362
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,680
do you want diamonds or do you want your Spirit?

363
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
You can buy them in the market.

364
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,800
Why do you need a guru to do that kind of a job?

365
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,680
There must be some jugglery.

366
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
All days of these spiritual juggleries are on

367
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:10,360
and when I came here from Perth onward, Melbourne, Adelaide and here

368
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,880
everywhere all the people of the media have been asking Me

369
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,880
that why these gurus have come from India

370
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,680
and they have ruined us like this. They have so many Rolls Royces

371
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,800
and they have things and that and that.

372
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,680
I said, thank God now at least you are realizing.

373
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,040
But I went to America and told them long time back

374
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,480
that these people are going to come and be careful about them.

375
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,200
Has been already told about it but people did not want to follow it.

376
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,120
They thought that it is better

377
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,680
that you accept a guru, live with him

378
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,280
and that when he goes to Heaven means Hell actually,

379
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,320
you will be there.

380
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,880
Now, I'm very happy that an awareness is coming to the seekers that

381
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,880
lot of them are realizing that they have not found the truth.

382
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,000
If you are reaching that conclusion

383
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,800
that you have to find the truth within yourself

384
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,960
then, Sahaja Yoga will work much wonders.

385
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:18,120
Now, our evolutionary process has not been anything which is dead.

386
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,000
It is a living process.

387
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,920
There is a force within us which brings forth our evolution.

388
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,120
And living process cannot be activated by mental activity.

389
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,680
For example, if you put a seed in the Mother Earth

390
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,680
it sprouts by itself. By saying that, "you better sprout now"

391
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,680
or by saying that "it has sprouted"

392
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,680
you'll have just mental satisfaction

393
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,760
of creating an imaginary image, but actually it has to happen.

394
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,320
The happening has to take place and this happening

395
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,680
is built within you, that has to happen within your being

396
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,680
and is already you are destined for it.

397
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,040
As he has told you that lies this

398
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,280
triangular bone which is very inconspicuous,

399
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,800
you can't even see that. I think it is drawn very small.

400
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,880
We should really enlarge it and show.

401
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,840
That is the triangular bone within us, which contains this force,

402
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,680
called as the Kundalini.

403
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,000
Now regarding Kundalini you must have read many books also.

404
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,080
In India, I saw some books, I was amazed,

405
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,920
written by mostly foreigners. Such big books and they didn’t know

406
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,760
where the Kundalini was, in the stomach or in the nose.

407
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,360
Such confused people need not have written.

408
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,120
If you are confused, better not talk about it.

409
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,160
You see, if you are confused about something

410
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,080
what's the use of talking that "this was the confusion,

411
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,680
I got a shock and I got a heat" and all this? Then why do you talk?

412
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,800
You don't know anything, you have no authority

413
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
so you have no business to talk about it.

414
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
That means you are naive or you have been,

415
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,680
just been absolutely a person

416
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,120
who is uneducated about it.

417
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,480
Why should you talk when you are not in authority?

418
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,400
Not only talk but write.

419
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,920
And books after books have been written by people

420
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,680
who have no authority to write these books.

421
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
And that's how they have created another myth,

422
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,600
that Kundalini awakening

423
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,200
is the most dangerous thing and one should not do.

424
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,280
Now, imagine, what a mistake it is!

425
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,920
Who is the photographer?

426
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,200
It's all right. So what is the,

427
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,280
what is the advantage

428
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,680
in this kind of spreading news that Kundalini awakening,

429
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,080
which is the epitome of your evolution,

430
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,360
which is what human beings have to achieve in their life

431
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,520
that's the aim of their life to be the Spirit

432
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,880
and Kundalini is the only way it happens,

433
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,680
so why should people talk like this

434
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,360
and say it is dangerous to have the Kundalini awakened?

435
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,320
Because, why they are doing it?

436
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,880
Because they are under some anti-God activity.

437
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,680
Because they are not with God.

438
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,040
There's some sort of a sinister,

439
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,080
satanic force, which is telling these things to people

440
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,920
that you should not have your Kundalini awakened.

441
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
Imagine it is like

442
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,800
saying that you should not enter into the Kingdom of God.

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,880
If that is the only way if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God

444
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,960
why should you frighten people about it?

445
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,720
There's nothing frightening about Kundalini awakening,

446
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,760
I can assure you. I've had, as you know,

447
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
I've been working for years together

448
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,360
and so many people have got Realization,

449
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,320
en-mass, and nobody has got any problems like that.

450
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,680
Sometimes of course you feel little heat in the body, sometimes,

451
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,840
do feel little heat in the body,

452
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
sometimes you feel a little shaking in the body,

453
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,040
if there is a problem in the body,

454
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,680
if your nerves are tensed and anything.

455
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,680
The Kundalini, when She rises, She little bit shakes you

456
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,280
but it settles down. Settles you down completely

457
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,120
and you feel absolutely blissful and peaceful.

458
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,480
No problem is created I have seen so far

459
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,760
which can be called anywhere near danger.

460
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,400
On the contrary when Kundalini rises,

461
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,800
She gives so many by-products to begin with.

462
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,200
Of course She is the power of pure desire within you.

463
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,280
The only desire that is pure in human beings is

464
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,240
to be one with the Divine.

465
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,320
All other desires are not pure, because they do not give pure joy.

466
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,400
You think of anything, you want to, say, have a car.

467
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,200
All right. Good. Work for it, try your level best to achieve that.

468
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,680
Then you have the car then you want to have something else.

469
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,680
If that was your pure desire it would have given you

470
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,240
complete joy and satisfaction. It is not so.

471
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,240
So matter is making you just run from one to another

472
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,680
but doesn't give you joy. So the pure desire in a human being

473
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,360
is this great desire to be one with the Divine.

474
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,520
If you do not accept it today you will come tomorrow.

475
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,280
You will have to take it because nothing is going to satisfy you

476
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,000
unless and until you receive the truth,

477
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,760
you become one with the Divine.

478
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,960
People may, I've seen people deny it for the time being,

479
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,160
"I'm not ready". That's another style is, "I'm not ready"

480
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,280
and all sorts of things people say.

481
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,440
But I say "Let Me decide".

482
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,240
Why are you worried? Let Me decide if you are ready or not,

483
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,760
what is the problem is, it can be worked out.

484
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,120
I have really worked for years together to know all the permutations

485
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,680
and combinations and the problems and the barriers you have.

486
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,680
And it is not going to take any time for you. It's very simple

487
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,160
it's a living process, it is not going to trouble you.

488
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,200
Why should you have fright about it?

489
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,080
So this is one side of Kundalini awakening.

490
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,680
The other side is, where people think that

491
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,320
it can be done by themselves. It cannot be done by yourself.

492
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,280
Somebody has to do it for you

493
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,400
and then once you get it you can do it for others.

494
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,680
Now for example a candle which is enlightened

495
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,160
can only enlighten another candle.

496
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,000
By itself a candle cannot enlighten.

497
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,040
But for that you have to have a real person.

498
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,480
A person who knows everything about the Kundalini,

499
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,440
one who can awaken your Kundalini

500
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,320
and not a person who is already shocked by Kundalini

501
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,680
or who just talks about Kundalini

502
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,680
or he makes people jump all over the places.

503
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,680
There was a guru in India who used to give Kundalini awakening

504
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,720
and where this Dr. Warren went first of all

505
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,120
and they all were jumping and saying ha ha, hoo hoo, hee hee, hey

506
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,200
and he got such a fright seeing them

507
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
and he thought "It's a lunatic asylum here"

508
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,760
and he ran away from that place and came to Me and he said,

509
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,680
'Mother don't give Me awakening because I am frightened of it'.

510
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,400
I said that's not awakening.

511
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,200
That's not. That is hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis

512
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,680
and that hypnosis will create such problems. That's not Kundalini.

513
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,680
She's your Mother

514
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,480
and She's waiting for days together

515
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,480
for ages together, many lives She has waited

516
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,120
for this great opportunity to give you your second birth.

517
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,320
But so far you have not allowed Her to do Her work

518
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,680
because mentally you are equipped with all books in your head

519
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,680
or all gurus in your head or all kinds of ideas in your head,

520
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,320
and She, poor thing, is waiting for that

521
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,720
to manifest your second birth.

522
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,760
And that is a big problem how to make people understand

523
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,160
that by mental activity you cannot raise the Kundalini.

524
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,080
I may give you lectures after lectures,

525
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,080
not necessary that your Kundalini will rise.

526
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,280
But it will rise when I pay attention to it.

527
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,680
And if you get your Realization

528
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,440
you can also make it rise through your attention.

529
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,800
That is called as through the power of chitta, chitta shakti.

530
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,840
But you must have your chitta shakti enlightened.

531
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,960
If you are not an enlightened person you cannot do it.

532
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Can you do it by paying attention to

533
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,960
somebody raising up the Kundalini?

534
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,960
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini in many people,

535
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,000
those who have got problems in their centers,

536
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,280
like the second and the third center.

537
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,120
You can see it very clearly what happens

538
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,200
and you can see it pulsating just like a heart,

539
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,160
the bone pulsating like heart.

540
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,840
You'll be amazed to see that this bone which is,

541
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,680
looks such a stiff thing, is pulsating.

542
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,320
You can even see, say,

543
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,400
see the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eye,

544
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
but if you have a stethoscope

545
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,920
you can hear the lap tap, lap tap going up.

546
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,080
This is called as Anahata, means without percussion,

547
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,680
the sound without percussion.

548
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,240
And you can feel it on top of your head, also the same thing rising,

549
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,200
which Kabira has said that on the

550
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,480
shunya shikhara, means on the silent

551
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,360
peak of your brain you start first feeling the Anahata,

552
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,760
means the sound of lap tap, lap tap that you hear in your heart

553
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,080
you start feeling it here.

554
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,680
And when it press that area

555
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
the fontanel bone area which is called as taalu

556
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,680
you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

557
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,200
Now this you cannot do.

558
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,960
You can jump, dance, become mad, take drugs, take alcohols,

559
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,280
grow your beard or cut it off or do anything that you want to do

560
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,720
but you cannot make the cool breeze come out of your head.

561
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,880
And that is what is the proof

562
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,880
that it is a living process that does this.

563
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,080
Unless and until this happens to you

564
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,320
you try everything else there's going to be a big problem.

565
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,360
As I was telling today to the people from television,

566
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,680
he very sincerely asked "What's the problem with us?"

567
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,080
with Indians, with Australians, when You say they are naive?

568
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,040
I said they are naive because they don't know what to seek.

569
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,680
That's one point is. They don't know what they should ask for,

570
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,680
what should happen to them. And they are attacked by people

571
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,200
who are here just to make money, it's money making proposition.

572
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,600
Imagine people have made

573
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,840
millions and millions of pounds through you people.

574
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,040
It's such a multimillion big enterprise and is done on that level

575
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,880
and you people are enamored by these things because you,

576
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,200
it appeals to your brain, somehow or the other, I don't know why

577
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,280
because it appeals to your ego perhaps.

578
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,720
The lady asked Me, that "If it is so simple, Mother,

579
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,320
then why is it people don't take to simple things?"

580
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,120
Now, see, today I came first of all here at 7 o'clock

581
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
and they said there are very few people.

582
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,920
So I went round and I came back.

583
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,880
I said that's the trouble, they don't want anything simple.

584
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,240
But whatever is living is so simple you cannot explain it mentally.

585
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,840
You put, as I said a seed into the Mother Earth.

586
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,080
How it sprouts, how a flower becomes a fruit,

587
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,680
all these things you cannot explain mentally.

588
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,360
It's a living process done by the All Pervading power

589
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,840
which is the love of God,

590
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,480
and that activates and works it out and actualizes,

591
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,560
which you cannot by your mental process understand

592
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,320
nor can you do it. You can't transform one flower into fruit.

593
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
So this is what, one has to understand

594
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,880
that it has to be a living process within us

595
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,560
and the living process is spontaneous that's why we say Sahaja.

596
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,440
'Saha' means with and and 'ja' means born.

597
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,680
Is born with you, is spontaneous.

598
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,680
Like your breathing is born with you,

599
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,200
like your pulsation is born with you,

600
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,360
like everything that is born with you, you take it for granted.

601
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,360
It exists. In the same way this Kundalini is born with you.

602
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,880
And this awakening is also your birthright.

603
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,880
As a human being you have a right to have this awakening within you,

604
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,840
and you should have it and you must seek that.

605
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,480
But, because of no education on this point, perhaps,

606
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,280
traditionally we are not educated to understand.

607
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
Christ came on this earth.

608
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,680
When He wanted to explain all these things He had to go away.

609
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,480
And He lived only for four years to talk to people.

610
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,000
In that four years the way people behave

611
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,400
and the way they never accepted Him,

612
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,400
it was impossible to talk to you about Kundalini.

613
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
But in the Bible it is written

614
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
that "I will appear before you like tongues"

615
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,680
even in all the Toras it is written that "I'll appear before you

616
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,720
like flames of tongues". Now what are these flames?

617
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,880
These are the chakras which are within us.

618
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,680
When you see them they look like that, the flames.

619
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,680
You can see them clearly.

620
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
But it is not the seeing that is important, it is being.

621
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,240
People think that if you see the light, now you become the light.

622
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,840
If you see the light, do you become the light? It's simple.

623
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,280
Simple thing you can understand, you do not become a light

624
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,680
if you see the light. You have to become the light.

625
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,840
And when you become the light what happens?

626
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,880
That you act like the light. Your power acts like a light.

627
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,080
When you are there, people can see how to walk.

628
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,400
They know how to understand the difference

629
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,480
between a carpet and a chair and a human being.

630
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,440
The discrimination is there.

631
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,000
When there is light you discriminate and you start understanding

632
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,160
that the truth is this and this is untruth.

633
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,240
So when the Kundalini rises through your fontanel bone area

634
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
the first blessing you get is of good health.

635
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,120
That's the minimum that should happen, but is a by product.

636
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,120
But I don't want to emphasize more on good health

637
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,280
because tomorrow we'll get all the hospitals dropping on My head.

638
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,680
That's what I don't want. You have to be first the Spirit.

639
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,680
and you have to be the doctors and you yourself can treat

640
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,760
your body as well as the body of others.

641
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,680
This is the minimum that should happen

642
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,800
that you become a healthy person.

643
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Now what does that?

644
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,840
Within us lies a power, which is evolutionary power,

645
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,680
in the center, and it is the power

646
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,480
which we call as

647
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,440
the power of Mahalakshmi,

648
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,160
is the power by which we sustain

649
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,080
our own character, by which we become human beings.

650
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,240
From Carbon where it is four valencies

651
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,240
as human beings we develop ten valencies.

652
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,880
We become

653
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,760
eligible for our ascent through this power to begin with,

654
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,080
because this is the power that gives us balance.

655
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,040
In the gross it expresses itself as parasympathetic nervous system.

656
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,360
Now what is parasympathetic nervous system?

657
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,080
Is that it gives a balance to your sympathetic nervous system.

658
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,080
Now sympathetic nervous system is the gross expression

659
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,800
of the two other powers which are around us

660
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,680
one is the power of desire and another is the power of action.

661
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,280
These sympathetic nervous systems

662
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,120
come into play when we want to use them.

663
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,520
For example if you want to run fast.

664
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,920
So, when you are running fast these two powers come into power

665
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,680
that they give us the force to run fast.

666
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,320
But what is the thing that brings it back to normal,

667
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,960
is the central power that brings it to the normal

668
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,040
or gives it a balance. So, this balancing force

669
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,560
is the one that is responsible for your ascent.

670
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,800
If you are not yet balanced, the same force will first balance you.

671
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Because of imbalances so many diseases are caused.

672
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,680
There's no end to it. Apart from that,

673
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,680
those people who go to extremes to the left and to the right

674
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,560
also can develop horrible diseases.

675
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
Those who go to the left side

676
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,680
develop mostly the psychosomatic diseases like cancer,

677
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,240
like all myelitis and all these incurable diseases.

678
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,040
And imbalances, people develop say blood pressures and

679
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,040
diabetes and all these problems of the organs of the stomach.

680
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,760
And the people who are too much right sided,

681
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,160
who are too much speedy,

682
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,680
who are thinking of the future all the time,

683
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,120
they develop problems of the heart

684
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,520
and also the problems of the physical side.

685
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,320
Those who indulge into too much physical exercises and all that

686
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,440
also develop the problems of the physical side.

687
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,680
So it is all our doing that we get sick, mostly,

688
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,240
or maybe of our parents.

689
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,800
For example somebody asked Me

690
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,240
that how is it Mother that leukemia is caused in the people

691
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,680
who, children also, they are born with it.

692
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,880
I said the mother must be a very speedy woman.

693
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,960
If the mother is speedy, hectic,

694
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,720
her spleen is working in a hectic way she sets in, in motion

695
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,400
the same kind of a spleen the child should have.

696
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,760
And if that happens, a child develops a kind of a spleen

697
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,720
which is hectic and starts producing RBCs

698
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,680
which are not rhythmic and not in proper shape,

699
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,680
and these are vulnerable to cancer and things like leukemia.

700
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,680
Because at this stage some things triggers it

701
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,520
and that triggering takes place

702
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,680
because of the extreme behavior of a personality,

703
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,440
which I'll explain to you tomorrow.

704
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,880
But in any case, physically you feel fit, mentally you feel fit.

705
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,880
Mentally, because your extreme behavior disappears.

706
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,880
Mostly we take to habits.

707
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,000
Any habit we take to is, the reason is

708
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,920
because we get bored, I think, in life,

709
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,880
or we are fed up or we are very unhappy,

710
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,080
or we are disturbed about something, or we are shocked.

711
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,680
Under these circumstances we'll take to it.

712
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,080
But supposing the reverse happens, that you feel settled,

713
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,360
you feel blissful, you feel happy, you feel cheerful,

714
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,080
you feel on top of the world, naturally everything drops out.

715
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,520
When you have got

716
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,240
the highest you don't want to indulge into all these things,

717
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,680
which are sensational for the time being,

718
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,200
work out for a short period,

719
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,680
but you start enjoying that is what is eternal within you,

720
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,080
flowing all the time. Stress and all that also disappears,

721
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,880
because supposing, I give an example always, of a car

722
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,760
which is about to finish its petrol.

723
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Everybody is in a stress, the car as well as the driver

724
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,200
is worried that the petrol is going to finish.

725
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,240
But supposing by some chance you are connected to the mains

726
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,880
and all the time the energy is flowing into you

727
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,680
then, then you have no worry,

728
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,960
you have no worry and just you get over all these things.

729
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,680
People have a very great,

730
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,280
I should [say], impetus or we can say all the time

731
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,080
a kind of a coaxing from all sensational practices of the society.

732
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,680
And this can quite upset us,

733
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,680
all the time, the way we are all the time

734
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,680
stimulated by these sensations.

735
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,680
Now with the Realization, what happens,

736
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
the Spirit doesn't take note of all these stimulus,

737
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,960
nothing of the kind. It is not bothered about these things.

738
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,280
It is just witnessing the whole play as a drama and a joke

739
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,680
and it doesn't take anything into record

740
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,480
and doesn't react to it, as the human beings do.

741
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,840
And that's how the stress drops, drops out.

742
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,680
On the contrary I have met some people who have been doing

743
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
all kinds of things, their hands were going like this

744
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,320
and the feet were going like, all sorts of contortions

745
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,200
and I said "Why are you doing it?" And they said

746
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,960
"We have been to a guru and he said <your stress is coming out>".

747
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,680
Now if the stress is coming out

748
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,800
and if this is the stateof the stress,

749
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,880
when are you going to end this up?

750
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,680
It is not possible, you must understand. You see, what I feel,

751
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,040
when I talk about these things, people just leave Me

752
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,880
and go away because they get angry. But I'm for you,

753
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,360
I'm, for your good I'm saying.

754
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,160
Just understand that how can stress get out

755
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,760
by this kind of a nonsensical thing happen to you.

756
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,040
You are getting mad. This is not the way the stress has to get out.

757
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,680
But you have to get over the stress.

758
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,160
And that is a very simple thing to understand

759
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,680
that if you are standing in the water,

760
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,680
the waves are coming to you,

761
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,080
coming and going, and you are afraid of the waves.

762
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,880
But supposing by any chance,

763
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,400
the state becomes that you become seated in a boat,

764
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,360
somehow or the other, you rise up to that point

765
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,680
that you are in a boat, then you enjoy the same waves from there

766
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,680
and you don't mind any kind of thing.

767
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,120
And this is the state one has to achieve.

768
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,440
Unless and until you achieve that state, all your guru,

769
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,760
all your money is of no value, nothing of the kind.

770
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,160
But this should not upset you, because many people also take a view

771
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,880
that "we have paid for it so we better go through it".

772
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,040
I mean if you have paid for the poison, will you go through it?

773
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,680
Is a simple thing like that. Because you have paid for it

774
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,800
better not go through it because it's dangerous.

775
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,680
You must see what's happening

776
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,040
to the people who are going to these gurus,

777
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,320
or to these cults, or to these other things like

778
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,680
clairvoyance and all that. What is happening to them?

779
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,400
Are they, are they transforming?

780
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,680
Are they getting any of their powers?

781
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Have they become peaceful people? Have they finished their seeking?

782
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,040
They think that they have done it?

783
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,040
if not, then no use going to a place like that.

784
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,440
But human mind I don't understand sometimes.

785
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,280
Like they see a person coming out of the pub, falling on the,

786
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,760
in the dirty lane and still they're walking to the same pub.

787
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,000
So I can't understand why people do all these things,

788
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,680
but mainly we have to know that one day will come

789
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,280
when we'll face ourselves, and that time we'll ask a question,

790
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,680
that why did I not use my wisdom to understand?

791
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,280
That these are not the things I was asking for.

792
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,880
What I was asking was the ultimate, the truth.

793
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,040
Those who talk about love of God, power of God, is very easy

794
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,680
because you see you can read any book and start talking.

795
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,080
"There is power of God and power of love" and all that.

796
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,440
But it must act. If you talk of compassion it must act.

797
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,040
It is not just I say that I'm, I'm compassion

798
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,160
embodiment of compassion, so what?

799
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
You may be a monument of compassion.

800
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,240
I can gather some money from you people and start a hospital

801
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,560
and say I have treated so many people and

802
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,800
you give Me a big prize or something like that for, is nothing.

803
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,920
That's not the way the compassion acts.

804
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,400
The compassion acts in the same way as the sunshine acts.

805
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,560
If you are near such a person, you remember,

806
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,360
that somebody touched Christ and something went into that person.

807
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,400
Christ said, "Somebody has touched Me who's sick,"

808
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,880
and the person got cured.

809
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,680
The compassion must act otherwise it has no meaning, it just talks

810
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,680
and advertises that you are the love power and all that.

811
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,040
It's not so. Something has to happen.

812
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,160
That is also not madness

813
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:26,960
or any kind of a crackpot behavior

814
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,680
but by which you get your transformation

815
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,400
and that's what you should ask for, for the reality

816
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,480
and not for unreal and in reality

817
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,240
you'll be amazed you will see where you stand

818
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,040
as far as you are concerned and others are concerned.

819
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,320
What is the relative position?

820
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,880
That you are the part and parcel of the whole.

821
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,200
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of the whole.

822
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,200
And when that happens, there is no compassion that speaks,

823
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,080
because supposing this finger is paining,

824
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,160
automatically I press this finger.

825
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,680
I just press it because it ,

826
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,680
it is paining and I just feel it because it's Me,

827
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,680
it's Me there, so I just do it.

828
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,560
So that's how the compassion acts.

829
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,200
It doesn't think it is doing any obligation to anyone

830
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,680
that this finger should pay anything to Me.

831
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,080
It's My finger, it's Myself.

832
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,200
How can I not touch it and put it right?

833
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,800
In the same way it happens

834
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,880
that you become part and parcel of the whole.

835
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,080
And when you become that, you just act

836
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,960
as a part of that whole with all its powers.

837
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,560
And that should happen to all of you who are seekers.

838
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,680
Normally Sahaja Yoga is better for people

839
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,320
who are not extremes by nature,

840
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,840
who are central people. That's very good.

841
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,360
It acts very well on them and helps them immensely.

842
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,680
Also those who are in the extremes are also drawn in the center,

843
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,800
because Kundalini is a movement in the central path,

844
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,760
and when you are paying attention to Me

845
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,520
and I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

846
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,720
But when Kundalini rises, She sucks in your attention inside.

847
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,880
Like an incident or a happening within and then, the attention,

848
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,680
even if it is on the extremes, is sucked inside

849
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,000
and when it is sucked in, it just rises.

850
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,320
One must know that lots of things happen when it rises.

851
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,680
It just doesn't rise, just like a primule rising up,

852
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,880
but it, lots of things happen within your body.

853
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,480
Lots of centers go into different kind

854
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,720
of bandhans and all that. It happens.

855
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,280
As a car starts, lot of things happen in the inside machinery.

856
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,680
In the same way when the Kundalini starts rising

857
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,480
lots of things happen inside but very smoothly

858
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,080
because you are fantastically,

859
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,680
beautifully and delicately made, with great care.

860
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,680
It's not easy to destroy Kundalini. It's not easy.

861
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,880
But I have seen some people have got very sick Kundalini.

862
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,680
Some people have bleeding Kundalini, I have seen.

863
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,520
And of course, if they are devils,

864
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,200
they may not have Kundalini at all.

865
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,680
But it is not easy to destroy this bone also.

866
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,120
If you burn the body of a human being,

867
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,880
this bone is the last to be burnt

868
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,400
and requires a very high temperature to burn it.

869
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,680
That's why people call it a sacred bone. But when I went to Greece,

870
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,040
when I asked people "Why did you call it sacrum?",

871
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,160
they said, "Because we had a report with a

872
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,200
Indo Aryan group, much before Alexander and went there

873
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,840
and they told us that this is a sacred bone".

874
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,280
And we found out that when you burn the body

875
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,480
this bone remains still there.

876
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,520
So we thought must be something sacred about it.

877
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,280
Now, tomorrow, day after, and after that,

878
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,400
we are going to have three more programs.

879
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,960
Today, in a general way, I have spoken to you because

880
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,680
they said "Just give introduction to Sahaja Yoga,

881
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,920
what is Sahaja Yoga is",

882
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,680
and that's how I told you that you cannot pay for it

883
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,920
it is effortless, it is spontaneous,

884
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,840
it's a living process and through the grace of God it works out.

885
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,800
And by this happening you get your transformation.

886
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,840
You become something else than what you are, in your awareness.

887
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,120
You become a more powerful person

888
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,120
a dynamic person, you start feeling another person.

889
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,680
It's a fact. You can ask, somebody has come now

890
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,360
all the way from Perth, and when he came to Me

891
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,680
he was in a big problem because he had been to gurus, this thing,

892
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,880
and he, he realized that he's made a mistake

893
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,680
but nothing could rectify it.

894
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,040
But now he's rectified and he could feel this cool breeze,

895
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,760
actually on his head and all over.

896
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,320
So, this is the thing one has to understand, that

897
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,400
you must honestly ask for the truth,

898
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,880
and not for something that is being told to you before.

899
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,680
This is what it is, should happen to you,

900
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,680
that has never happened before, and cannot happen

901
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,400
through human effort. So, tomorrow,

902
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,160
day after and after that, we have three more days.

903
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,800
One day I will talk about chakras,

904
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,520
tomorrow, and then about these three powers.

905
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,560
And last day I'll tell you what is to be done after Self Realization

906
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,720
how to keep it up, how your Spirit is your guru,

907
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,880
and how he teaches through your vibratory awareness,

908
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,520
how you understand what is right and what is wrong.

909
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,000
I think that is how we'll space it out and we'll work it out.

910
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,320
But today we should try

911
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,280
to have the session of Self Realization also.

912
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,680
It might be, might work out very well. May God bless you!

913
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,120
If you have any questions

914
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,360
I would like to have the questions for first day,

915
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,120
is important, if you have any sensible questions.

916
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,920
But I, I don't know.

917
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,960
Some people say "In this book it is written,

918
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,320
in that book it is written", or "This one says like that".

919
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,360
Please don't do that, because all these books have given you nothing

920
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,920
so better forget about them.

921
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,840
Any questions? Yes.

922
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,760
[unclear]

923
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,880
[unclear]

924
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,080
[unclear]

925
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,960
He is, doesn't really understand,

926
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,720
the what you were saying about Kundalini

927
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,200
and he's a little unclear about the action and how it works

928
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,320
and how it manifests.

929
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,000
I understand that, because it's a very complicated thing.

930
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,880
It's a big mechanism. See, now supposing you come in this room

931
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,920
and I'll tell you one thing, that if you want to put on the light,

932
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,760
just press a button.

933
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,680
While you can say, "Mother, I don't understand this, how can it be,

934
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,840
if I press the button it will work out".

935
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,680
So, I'll have to explain to you the history of all this mechanism,

936
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,760
and how the electricity has come here and how it works

937
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:02,680
and how we have brought,

938
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,800
brought it here, all those things I'll have to explain.

939
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,360
But it's a headache.

940
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,280
So first why not have the light and then I'll tell you everything?

941
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,680
You will know each and everything about Kundalini

942
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,520
because in a small lecture like this, where I have to cover

943
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,480
so many points, you see, not easy to tell you all about it.

944
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,680
But you will know each and everything about Kundalini,

945
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,080
yourself you will be able to raise the Kundalini,

946
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,080
you'll be able to give Realization to people and understand it

947
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,520
as if it is your own thing.

948
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,960
So what I'm saying, is better to have the enlightenment first

949
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,880
and then we can understand it mentally.

950
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,120
All right? Thank you.

951
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,680
Yes?

952
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Why is it some people's heart open out easily and others don't?

953
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,880
Why is it that some people's hearts open easily and others don't?

954
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,360
You see, some have good brains and some have good hearts.

955
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,880
What can we do about it?

956
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,720
It's all your doing.

957
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,840
All right, is there any question?

958
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,120
Yes, please.

959
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,080
Mataji, it says in Your literature that You are going

960
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,680
to spark a transformation on this earth.

961
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,840
and among the literature that I've read lately [unclear] it says,

962
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,680
"Finnaly there is someone here to be [unclear]

963
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,880
What is it?

964
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,880
and You are the first and there we find You have been granting

965
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,120
Self Realization and I wonder if You have knowledge that there are

966
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,880
other people, living now, who have been grating this Realization.

967
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,960
O.k., just hold.

968
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,880
What is it?

969
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,120
In the literature it speaks of sparking a transformation

970
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,880
and phases like that.

971
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,520
This implies that You can do the job? He is asking whether

972
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,680
there are others who can do the job,

973
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,400
of doing this, of achieving this result?

974
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,680
Now I must say, I must confess, I haven't met any who does en-masse,

975
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,040
I haven't met. I mean, I wish I could meet someone

976
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,400
because I would like to retire now. I'm sixty years of age,

977
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,360
so I better retire now, isn't it?

978
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,160
But the trouble is, I haven't met anyone so far,

979
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,280
who can give a en-masse Realization.

980
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,880
Also My disciples, can give Realization to people,

981
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,800
but not en-masse, they have to use My photograph or something.

982
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,160
So, if you know of anyone, I'll be very happy to know someone

983
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,480
but I haven't met any. So, I don't claim I'm the only one,

984
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,080
could be many, but I haven't met anyone, I'm sorry to say.

985
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,880
I'm thinking of people like Muktananda and Maharishi.

986
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,040
You must go, that's, that's the ashram he has been to, I was saying.

987
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,280
That's the ashram he has been to.

988
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,840
Y - And also Maharishi.
Dr. Warren - And Maharishi he is saying.

989
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,000
We have patients from there, epilepsy, I'll show you, you meet them.

990
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,120
They are epileptic patients who are coming to Me.

991
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,680
He has made sixty, six thousand crores of rupees.

992
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,440
Crores. It's in billions and billions of money.

993
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,200
You must meet the people who have suffered from there.

994
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,360
If you think so, it's all right.

995
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,680
You can go to them, but then don't come back to Me,

996
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,400
that's the only thing is, because

997
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,320
I know they end up with epilepsy, penniless

998
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,080
and all kinds of problems are there.

999
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,120
Muktananda, recently I heard in Delhi

1000
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,880
that his two disciples are now fighting

1001
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,680
for the seat and third lady has now got over

1002
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,280
but there's a problem of

1003
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,400
diamonds worth thirty-four million rupees,

1004
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,880
of diamonds they are fighting among themselves.

1005
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,000
This is all right. I'll do it. You see, if you move,

1006
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,280
all the people start looking at you. Please don't come.

1007
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:55,200
Yes. All right? Thank you.

1008
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,800
So, that's not the way. You should see the result on people.

1009
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,880
That's the thing, on yourself.

1010
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,720
You see, they have lot of money, they have made lot of money

1011
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,760
and they can propagate whatever they like

1012
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,880
but you must see what you get yourself, is the point.

1013
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,680
Mataji I'm very grateful that You pointed out

1014
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,960
that the individual mind can't be trusted.

1015
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,760
On the other hand the collective mind can be,

1016
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,680
and I'd like to thank You for that.

1017
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,960
And by the way I'm the gentleman that Mataji [corrected].

1018
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,680
I came from Perth

1019
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,040
and on the sixth occasion tried to feel

1020
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,920
the breeze on the top of my head, I really didn't. Disgusted by,

1021
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,200
I've also been to Krishnamurti in England.

1022
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,400
And he's been to all of them.

1023
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,920
And not to mention, not to mention [unclear] this to this night.

1024
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,680
And on the second occasion in Perth I did feel the breeze

1025
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,880
on the top of the head, so...

1026
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,720
Thank you. I was so happy to see him here

1027
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,240
because once, when I met him, he's such a great seeker, you see,

1028
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,480
really tears came into My eyes. I said look at this one

1029
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,680
he's such a great seeker and I don't know what has happened to him.

1030
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,280
And today I find him here. I'm so very happy, you don't know.

1031
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,680
It's such a great thing, because you are seeking the truth.

1032
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,400
You are My children I feel.

1033
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,120
The way you are mislaid is something so painful, you can't imagine.

1034
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,680
It's very painful.

1035
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,680
Yes, please.

1036
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,680
Mataji, what [do You think] of the aboriginals' life from Australia?

1037
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,680
You see, the only problem with aboriginals' [rights],

1038
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,800
[unclear]

1039
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,680
You just tell Me.

1040
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,400
He's, he's concerned about the aboriginal problem and

1041
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,680
No, they all can get Realization very fast,

1042
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,840
much faster than you people can.

1043
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,320
I've given Realization to some of aboriginal people

1044
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,400
because they are very simple people you know.

1045
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,160
They are extremely simple, good people,

1046
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,680
they get Realization in no time. You just don't worry,

1047
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,280
I'm going to look after them very well.

1048
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,640
May God bless you, you are concerned about them,

1049
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,400
I'm very happy to know. Yes.

1050
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,960
Shall we have it?

1051
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,880
Now is there any one else?

1052
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,800
Now one thing is, you should not in any way feel diffident.

1053
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,200
That's one thing is very important.

1054
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,080
As I said that you are all children of God.

1055
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:38,760
As William Blake has said that

1056
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,400
man of God will become prophet, they'll become prophets,

1057
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,400
and they will have powers to make other prophets.

1058
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,120
The time has come, that's what is the time.

1059
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,720
So, don't feel diffident about anything,

1060
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,680
by no means, nor you should feel guilty.

1061
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,680
That's a very big disease in the West,

1062
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,200
to feel guilty for nothing at all.

1063
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,880
God is great love so please, don't feel guilty.

1064
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,040
These two first conditions has to be there,

1065
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,280
that you are not to feel guilty, upset. Be cheerful

1066
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,800
that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God, that's your right.

1067
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,680
As seekers of truth you have greatest right

1068
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,680
than anybody else has.

1069
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,200
So please don't feel guilty

1070
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,680
for whatever you have done. Is finished now.

1071
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,200
Now is not what you have done,

1072
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,200
but what you are going to be. So may God bless you!

1073
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,400
Let us have the

1074
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,000
session of Self Realization, for which

1075
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,800
simple things you have to do, is to take out your shoes.

1076
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,040
It's a very simple thing that one should take out one's shoes.

1077
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,680
It's good because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

1078
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,920
by taking out the shoes.

1079
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,680
Now put both your feet

1080
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,320
on the Mother Earth, parallel,

1081
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,280
and put both the hands towards Me, like this,

1082
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:34,360
or on your lap. Be comfortable,

1083
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,920
that's the main point, is you have to be comfortable.

1084
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,880
If there's any thing tight on your waist or anything,

1085
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,880
please try to loosen it.

1086
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,880
Put your both the hands straight

1087
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,680
and close your eyes. Please close your eyes.

1088
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,280
You are not to open your eyes till I tell you.

1089
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,680
Because when the Kundalini rises above this Agnya Chakra,

1090
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,960
your eyes, if they are not closed, will stop at that point.

1091
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,120
It will be nice if you can take out your spectacles also

1092
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,920
because eye-sight is very much benefited

1093
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:20,160
by Kundalini rising.

1094
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,080
So just put both your hands towards Me, very comfortably,

1095
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,520
and don't worry if you are thinking

1096
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,800
or your mind is going here and there. Do not try to concentrate.

1097
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,400
It will just work out, by itself.

1098
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,680
You don't have to do anything. it's all within you,

1099
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,680
it will just work out.

1100
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,120
When I will tell you what is to be done, when I find

1101
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,920
there's a problem in a particular chakra in the collective way,

1102
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,240
then I will tell you and that's how you should follow.

1103
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,400
But just now, for the time being,

1104
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,040
you just sit with both the hands on your lap,

1105
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,040
fingers towards Me and close your eyes please.

1106
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,680
Have full faith in yourself, first of all,

1107
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,320
that you are the children of God

1108
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:08,560
and that He is your Father who is waiting for you.

1109
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,200
He's anxious that you should enter into His Kingdom

1110
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,040
so that He bestows all the beauty and bounties.

1111
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,880
Now, your right hand is the hand of action,

1112
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,960
and left hand is the hand of your desire.

1113
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,120
Your desire is to be the Spirit.

1114
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,320
So put your left hand where it is

1115
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,680
in a proper way, in a comfortable way.

1116
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,600
You don't have to move the left hand, because the desire is there

1117
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,240
but action has to take place through the right hand.

1118
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,200
Now, keep the left hand as it is

1119
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,880
and the right hand, you put it on your heart to begin with.

1120
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,680
On your heart, on the left hand side, please,

1121
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,040
and with a very humble feeling

1122
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,240
ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

1123
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,960
Ask this question three times please, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

1124
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,360
Now put the same hand, down on the stomach, on the left hand side.

1125
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,400
We have to work only on the left side, with the right hand.

1126
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,680
Press there with your finger

1127
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,120
and just say with full confidence,

1128
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:17,240
"Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru."

1129
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:38,880
This is to awaken your own principle of guru.

1130
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,680
If you have believed in all gurus, forget it for the time being.

1131
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,360
First you become your own guru, then you will know

1132
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,800
whether your guru is true or not.

1133
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,880
You have to say this ten times, that,

1134
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:10,400
"Mother, I am my own guru", with full confidence.

1135
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,160
On the Kundalini itself.

1136
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,760
Now, raise this hand higher again, onto the heart.

1137
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,720
Now with full confidence and humility

1138
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,720
you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1139
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,200
Why these times I am saying? Because of the different plexuses,

1140
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,800
the number of plexuses, you have on these centers.

1141
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,960
Twelve times please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

1142
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,160
Heart.

1143
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:06,600
Now, the same hand you have to raise higher

1144
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,680
onto the left side of your neck. This is another center

1145
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,880
which is called as Vishuddhi center.

1146
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,640
Here you have to say, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

1147
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:22,360
This is to be said sixteen times as a punishment for feeling guilty.

1148
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,040
You have to be cheerful and not to be upset about anything.

1149
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,640
Just say, "Mother, I am not guilty", just say that,

1150
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,320
"for doing anything". Because you are seekers of God,

1151
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,720
and if you have done any mistakes, it is done of your [ignorance],

1152
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,640
none of your mistakes.

1153
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,160
It's just done, because you did not know what was to be done.

1154
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,800
So just first of all forgive yourself and...

1155
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,680
Now put the same hand on your forehead across,

1156
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,880
on your forehead across.

1157
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:35,160
Now say one thing, which is very simple,

1158
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,400
"Mother, I forgive everyone". Say it from your heart, everyone.

1159
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,680
Some might think that it is difficult to forgive, but it is a myth.

1160
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,920
By not forgiving you are doing no harm to the other person,

1161
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,240
you are just harming yourself.

1162
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,000
So just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

1163
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,880
Unless and until you forgive others, why should God forgive you?

1164
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,360
Just say it with full heart. Put your hand on your forehead,

1165
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,240
comfortably, and say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

1166
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,760
From your heart, just forgive everything.

1167
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,600
You'll find your load and stress will all go away.

1168
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,600
This is a mantra for that center.

1169
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,680
Now raise your hand on top of your head

1170
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:53,040
and just press in the center, in the fontanel bone area.

1171
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,120
At this point, I cannot go further.

1172
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,480
You have to give Me a consent.

1173
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,760
You have to ask for your Realization

1174
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,880
because you are free to choose.

1175
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,720
With your heart you should say, "Mother,

1176
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,800
please give me Realization". Just ask for it.

1177
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,680
Seven times, and slowly raise your hand

1178
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,560
and see if there's a breeze, cool breeze coming in.

1179
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,560
First, you might feel the heat coming out.

1180
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,880
Raise it higher, about four inches maybe.

1181
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,520
Just see if there is... You can move your hand and see.

1182
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,640
You can put another hand on top of your head

1183
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,840
and the right hand down, the same way as the left hand was.

1184
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,400
So you can change your hand

1185
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,560
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

1186
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,400
Gives some shock.

1187
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,200
This gives a shock in.

1188
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,080
Just try to see if there's a cool breeze.

1189
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:27,080
Again. Raise your hand one by one.

1190
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:42,000
Good! Those who are feeling, please raise your hands.

1191
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,120
Great! So many of you.

1192
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,680
Now you can open your eyes and raise your hands,

1193
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,120
both the hands like this. Let's see.

1194
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,680
And ask the question, "Mother, is this the Brahma shakti?"

1195
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,840
"Is this the power of God, that is all-pervading love?"

1196
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,960
"Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask a question.

1197
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,760
It's a sensation in the fingers you feel first

1198
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,000
and a kind of cool breeze all around.

1199
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,160
Now bring your hands down and see if it is coming

1200
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,720
in your hands as well.

1201
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,240
You'll feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful.

1202
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,880
Better.

1203
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,880
Good?

1204
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,280
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

1205
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,120
It's better.

1206
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,920
Now I will teach you how to raise your own Kundalini,

1207
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,640
if you can open your eyes.

1208
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,040
This will even help you to feel it more, if you have not felt

1209
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,520
because it's a very subtle, sukshma,

1210
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,080
and you, we are from a gross awareness going

1211
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,840
to the sukshma's awareness, to the subtle awareness.

1212
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,360
It is rather difficult in the beginning to conceive it,

1213
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,680
because you cannot conceive it mentally, you have to feel it.

1214
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,360
And unless and until you have felt it you should not

1215
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,640
say that you have felt it, but try to understand that it is there.

1216
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,960
It is there.

1217
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,000
Now let us see how you can all raise your own Kundalini.

1218
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,360
You don't have to go to any guru to do it. Yourself can do it.

1219
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,880
Put your left hand in front of your Kundalini,

1220
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,240
just while you are sitting, just in front, little further,

1221
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,760
because you have to move the other hand like this.

1222
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,680
You have to move the other hand which is the power of action,

1223
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,360
up, front, below, backwards.

1224
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,680
Up, front, below, backwards. Like that you have to move.

1225
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,400
So you have to start raising it now from that point.

1226
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:32,600
Let's start moving it

1227
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,840
up, front, below, backwards.

1228
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,280
Start moving it, trying to raise this hand.

1229
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,200
Bring it up higher, higher, higher, higher.

1230
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,680
Now put up your hands absolutely and give it a big twist there.

1231
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,720
Twist and now tie it up.

1232
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,320
Let's do it once more, again.

1233
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,160
We have to do it three times, for three powers. Now again tie it.

1234
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,880
If you don't try it and if you fail,

1235
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,200
then you should not blame Me for that.

1236
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,360
Again try it. Worth trying and finding out if it is true or not.

1237
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,960
Come along let's have it again.

1238
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:20,960
This time we have to give three twists and three knots.

1239
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:27,240
Now give one twist, one, another twist,

1240
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,960
the third one and knot it out.

1241
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:35,240
Now see your hands.

1242
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,560
Working out?

1243
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,360
Some people are getting more in the left, some more on the right.

1244
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:59,520
How to correct it, also one should know.

1245
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,680
Those who are getting more on the left and less on the right,

1246
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:09,040
should put right hand towards Me like this

1247
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,560
The one which is less should be towards Me,

1248
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,360
and the left hand on the stomach.

1249
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,400
If the right hand is getting less,

1250
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,400
then put the right hand towards Me and the left hand in the stomach

1251
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,880
means something wrong with your guru principle

1252
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,600
or maybe with your liver or kidney

1253
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,680
or anything like that, stomach part.

1254
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,480
Those who are getting

1255
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:45,680
less on the left hand side or not at all on the left hand side

1256
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:49,880
should put left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

1257
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,400
Is only thing you should know how to understand your own machine,

1258
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,040
Left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

1259
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,160
Those people who are getting less on the left hand side

1260
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,120
should put the left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

1261
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:14,960
So many are still feeling guilty. Please don't feel guilty.

1262
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,080
Still feeling guilty I can catch on the left Vishuddhi,

1263
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:19,680
means feeling guilty for nothing at all.

1264
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,280
Why are you feeling guilty for anything?

1265
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,760
We have to talk about the present and not about the past

1266
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,840
because past doesn't exist.

1267
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,920
Better!

1268
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,200
Now put both the hands and see how it works out.

1269
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,880
Watch Me without thinking, just without thinking.

1270
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,000
It's feeling it?

1271
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,360
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the hand

1272
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:26,560
or in the head, raise your hands please, again.

1273
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,880
You all didn't feel at all, anyway?

1274
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,120
None of you?

1275
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,600
All right.

1276
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,280
It's good, lots of people have felt it.

1277
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,600
Say it again. Say again, they got confused.

1278
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,880
Yes. Those who have felt the cool breeze in the hand

1279
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,000
or on the head, please raise your hands.

1280
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,680
All right!

1281
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,880
Now those who have not felt, can also feel it.

1282
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,000
Nothing to be desperate or unhappy.

1283
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:09,120
Maybe something wrong with you physically, mentally,

1284
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,560
maybe something wrong somewhere which can be found out.

1285
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,520
It's not difficult to find out. It's very simple.

1286
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:21,720
So, tomorrow if you can come again,

1287
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,040
I'll work it out for you, very nicely,

1288
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,240
and also for people who have felt it,

1289
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,640
they should understand that it is to be retained.

1290
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,480
You cannot think about it. By thinking you did not get it,

1291
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:38,560
it just happened. So to retain it, what is to be done?

1292
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,720
You can take from them the books.

1293
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:43,600
Those who have got it, can take the books from them,

1294
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,080
and can work it out tonight.

1295
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,600
But don't read the book, otherwise you will again start thinking.

1296
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,680
It's better not to read much about things and

1297
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,640
as long as you do not think about it.

1298
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,680
Just give peace to your head, which has been thinking all the while.

1299
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,000
So allow it to rest for a while.

1300
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,080
Those who haven't felt it can go at the back and some people

1301
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,080
who can work on them can find out.

1302
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:13,000
Tomorrow I'll personally see you, each one of you

1303
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,360
and we'll work it out, in a better way.

1304
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,080
We have to establish it, fully. Tomorrow I'll come down

1305
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,280
and see all of you, one by one. May God bless you!

1306
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,880
But those who want, can go at the back, please.

1307
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,640
They are there, they'll just look, see,

1308
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:31,400
tell you what's the problem is. All right? It's very simple.

1309
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,320
Vishuddhi.

1310
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,080
I hope tomorrow you bring some more friends of yours,

1311
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,280
to tell them, telephone to them, that they should come to reality.

1312
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,520
Thank you very much.

1313
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,760
As well as the program is over the next three days,

1314
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,200
there will be a workshop on Sunday,

1315
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,160
in which you'll be able to meet Mataji again,

1316
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,680
and where we'll get down to the practical details of

1317
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,440
developing your Self Realization.

1318
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,080
Tomorrow night and each night, we'll give you the

1319
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,200
address of that workshop where you'll be able to meet Mataji and

1320
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:13,520
where She will work on individual problems,

1321
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,000
where you'll be able to discuss with Her those problems,

1322
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,200
and where you'll be able to learn more about

1323
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,760
developing your Self Realization.

1324
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,920
So even if you haven't felt it tonight, don't,

1325
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,160
as She said, be desperate about it.

1326
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,480
We, we switched the air conditioning off, so that

1327
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,000
you could be honest about it, because so many people get confused.

1328
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,320
It is, again She says, "Don't be desperate,

1329
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,320
don't be anxious that it didn't happen.

1330
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,400
It doesn't mean that you are not a spiritual person.

1331
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,600
Maybe the perception is a little bit dulled..

1332
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,240
S.M.: Don't doubt yourself, that's the thing.

1333
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:52,960
so keep the Sunday at 10 o'clock open please.

1334
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,240
We'll have lunch together

1335
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,680
and we'll work it out during that day.

1336
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,960
Inside the booklet that you'll get

1337
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:04,400
it is the address of the center, where we have in Sydney.

1338
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,600
And after the programs are over, you want,

1339
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,840
you must feel free at any time to come to the center and to

1340
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,600
learn more about Sahaja Yoga,

1341
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,600
to develop it, to work out how it...

1342
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
S.M.: All about Kundalini.

1343
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,840
how the Kundalini works it out, how it clears the chakras,

1344
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,000
how you can give awakening to others.

1345
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,200
As Mother said, you have to become an expert.

1346
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,840
Thank you very much. For those people that want to talk to a few

1347
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,200
of the Sahaja Yogis at the back, they'll be there.

1348
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,520
If you didn't feel it, if you want somebody to try and work on you

1349
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:39,520
by all means do so. But tomorrow night as Mother said

1350
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,520
She'll do the job on each and everyone of you.

1351
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,520
She'll walk around and from one to the other, She'll work it out.

1352
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,600
Thank you very much and good night!

1353
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,040
Just one other small point, so that we keep in touch with you,

1354
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:53,040
and let you know when the further programs are going to be held,

1355
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
would you mind, on a small card at the back,

1356
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,600
giving your name and address and telephone number?

1357
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,680
Just write it on the card so that we can keep in touch with you

1358
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,840
and let you know where and when the programs will be, so that

1359
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,560
you can keep in touch, so that we can keep in touch with you.

1360
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,800
Is it, they all go these cards at the back.

1361
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,840
Just scribble your name and address

1362
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,840
and telephone number, and we'll give you a ring once we determine

1363
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,640
on which evenings we'll be having programs and so on.

1364
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,400
At the back of the room, please.

1365
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,560
[unclear] Kundalini within you. All right?

1366
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,680
You take out your shoes and apart put it there.

1367
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,960
You see, just, it's all right.
