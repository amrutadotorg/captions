00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.840
unfortunately or fortunately you are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.240
born in these modern times and in these

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.330
modern times as you know it's a very

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.060
chaotic condition in these chaotic

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.640
conditions you don't know what is right

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.119
and what is wrong and there are all

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.780
kinds of attractions which can take of

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.679
your attention and reduce the energy of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.679
your attention

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.250
it is possible more for the people who

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.250
are very right-sided also the left-sided

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.980
people can be very much affected the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.640
right-sided people as you know go up to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.120
a point and become extremely dry

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.110
self-opinionated and address all their

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.590
attention is in aggression while the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:37.670
people who are on the left side are

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:41.930
indulging too much into their own both

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.470
sides can tear away your attention which

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.070
is the most important it is the most

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.400
valuable thing is your attention but the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:58.070
attention cannot be controlled by a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.859
person who doesn't have a weak mind or a

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.290
weak heart

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:06.260
in every field of life where there it is

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.980
political economic or any field of life

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.930
in which human beings are living there

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.329
is a very subtle problem which people

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.959
don't understand now if I say that there

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.880
is spirit within us which shines in our

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.900
heart

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:34.860
you need not believe need not

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:38.799
but our attention is not on the spirit

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.019
they call it at Mojave mook our

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:47.200
attention is outside at this stage at

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.180
the human awareness our attention is

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:56.519
outside outside in various things now

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:02.650
where should our attention go to evolve

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:08.489
for what to achieve what the firstly our

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.489
attention has now go towards our spirit

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:17.739
towards spiritual understanding so what

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.530
have you

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.150
first of all by God's grace as I told

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.039
you

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.150
you all are realized people so your

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:31.060
ascent is made in the center which is a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.560
very very difficult thing absolutely

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:39.639
difficult notice but you should learn to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.310
keep in the center but how to keep the

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:46.380
attention is in the center is the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.280
problem for many people who are still

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.280
not above themselves

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:03.820
now when you meditate try to meditate in

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.650
a sustained way

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:12.910
first of all sustained then you find

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:19.290
that you are getting into the state of

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:22.480
Samadhi means at a state where you start

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.930
feeling the joy and the Bliss of God's

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.340
blessings and then you start saying for

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:34.810
God what a blessing what a blessing and

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:45.360
what a bliss once you have reached a

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:45.360
state then you have to realize Who am I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:06:04.770
who are what are you are the spent after

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:09.780
establishing your sustained attention on

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:12.980
the spirit you will develop a state

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:17.870
where you will be in a complete state of

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.870
witnessing with joy

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:39.970
[Music]

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:50.820
you say something about maintaining our

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.820
attention to that stage that it should

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.750
customers asked a very practical

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.070
question is true that to keep the

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.580
attention where it should be you see for

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:12.940
everything you have to do some exercise

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.940
a bath not before realization after them

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:20.750
the best way is to learn how to watch

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:22.850
yourself just start sitting here just

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:27.460
put yourself into a position for where

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.460
you watch yourself now what am i doing

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.080
this is the bass this is the study apart

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.900
from mantras apart from anything the

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:46.500
abuse is the practice practice of

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:48.720
becoming a witness and the witness is

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.490
the spirit state their attention will

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.080
not go i mean you will see everything is

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:57.990
that attention will be inside try to

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.750
practice this a my business now say some

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.480
people say oh I had a horrible time

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.090
whether this happened that happened see

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.510
you are not a witness how can you have a

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.980
horrible time if you are the spirit you

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.590
only have a horrible time when you are

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:16.050
not the spirit if you can wash the whole

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.180
thing as a drama that is played then you

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.040
are not having a horrible time but this

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:25.790
outside of you is having horrible time

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:29.940
with your watch that's how the attention

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:33.570
can be fixed very well if you practice

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.969
of the Asura practice all the time to be

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:40.680
witness say you go up out you see

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:44.039
something just try see it not to think

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.070
about it be a witness of the world the

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:49.590
joy will be complete and also you will

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:51.300
become absolutely peaceful your

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.270
attention will be completely enlightened

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.290
and then the inspiration you will get me

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.290
the tremendous

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:16.029
oh we test is very different from paying

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.570
attention paying attention is a

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:23.230
deliberate thing you deliberately pay

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:25.360
attention see to something as I'm

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.100
talking you may not be realized you may

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:32.800
be realized you can pay attention to me

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:35.829
but witnessing is a state say I'll

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.720
submit myself what happens if there's a

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:40.390
problem or there's some calamity

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.800
something suddenly I find and we're

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:48.269
testing the whole thing like a drama

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:48.269
it's a state but you can develop it
