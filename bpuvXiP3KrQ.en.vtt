WEBVTT

00:00:03.426 --> 00:00:12.696
Yes, first of all one thing must be understood,
that the people who have come here from
Mumbai and Delhi are not guests.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:18.355
The guests are the people who
have come from outside. The
buses have come with their money.

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:22.711
You are not giving even a single
penny for that. Not even a penny.

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.491
The buses are theirs. You people just
captured the buses and came here.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.226
Left the buses here. Those people are
standing stranded on the road.

00:00:30.299 --> 00:00:34.889
Instead of caring for those people,
you reached here comfortably.

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:39.559
Came back and are sitting comfortably and
half the people are sitting on the road
- the buses are rotting here.

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:47.222
You people have not come here as guests,
please pay attention. Change these
habits of yours.

00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:53.358
You have come here to serve and these
people who have come from outside are guests.

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:58.877
You board any bus you want,
as if you have hired the bus.

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:03.865
Last time I paid forty-five thousand
rupees for you people to get on the bus.

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:12.142
It is better that you all come on foot.
And if not, then one thing can be done
that there is just one bus for you.

00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:16.020
You people come out at any time;
There is no time for you, nothing.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.360
Only one bus will come and that
bus will come twice.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.639
You will be allowed to sit in that
bus only, you cannot sit in any
other bus. Have you understood?

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:31.637
You sat down comfortably and all
others are standing there stranded
- is this a good thing?

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:34.887
These are their buses, they have given
so much money, that's why we have
buses today.

00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:37.384
Because of them Sahaja Yoga
is going on today.

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:46.124
Now you will give all the buses [UNCLEAR].
The number of one of those buses
will be told here.

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:49.397
And no Indian person will sit
in any other bus.

00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:56.162
There is a bus for you, and it will
go, come, go, come, and if you
are not ready, then come on foot.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:05.755
Here you can't just arrange a bus
for 24 hours. Although we have made
arrangements for it - that's okay.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:13.098
But this doesn't mean that whatever time
you want you get up at your convenience,
just like a king - take their buses and come.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:15.649
It's just as if you snatched somebody's
vehicle and came by it.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.730
Now there is only one bus for you.
It will go there and come back.

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:30.682
Now in the morning you people have to
- these people wake up early in the morning
and meditate. Learn something from them.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:37.754
One should learn from them their
ways and methods and how much
discipline they have.

00:02:39.164 --> 00:02:43.144
The second thing is that they look
after your comfort, not their own.

00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:54.455
We have booked one bus for you, that's it.
We cannot give you more than that.
Who will pay for it?

00:02:56.108 --> 00:03:00.618
We will tell you the number of one bus.
That bus will go and come back.

00:03:00.618 --> 00:03:05.183
Otherwise you can come on foot, what's the
problem? Walk a little, it's good for health.

00:03:05.817 --> 00:03:13.697
The bus will come in the morning.
In the morning time we want you to be there.

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:20.131
You can bathe and get ready there and
breakfast will be served to you there only.

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:27.772
Or if you want, come here on a single bus
- you are not many people.

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:32.891
You are only 110 people;
you can come in two buses.

00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.540
Once the bus will go, will come back,
then you will go and then come back,
but do not touch the rest of the buses.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.073
- I will have to pay for all that. Will
you people give me forty-five thousand rupees?

00:03:44.127 --> 00:03:48.937
Who told you to sit on these buses?
You boarded whichever bus and came here.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:52.427
There should be some rules and regulations.
Should ask, 'Which bus should we take
and which we should not take?'

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.561
Now please be kind. The bus which
is for you, you only

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.809
board that bus in the morning
come here and your breakfast...

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:08.235
[MARATHI]

00:04:08.235 --> 00:04:14.363
your breakfast will be served there
but you don't need to live like a lord.

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:18.373
Get up early in the morning, take a bath,
do meditation and after meditation

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:21.889
the breakfast will be served there.
You will get the breakfast there
at half past eight.

00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:26.988
After having your breakfast there from
8:30 to 9:30 and there is a bus

00:04:26.988 --> 00:04:30.458
and if you cannot come by that bus,
then please come on foot.

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:43.454
People from Bombay, people from Poona,
and people from Delhi - people from
Poona and Bombay are living in Malgun

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:49.561
It's accepted that you people are living there.
But that doesn't mean that you can take
their buses and easily come here.

00:04:50.147 --> 00:04:54.307
Should ask, "Which bus is ours, by
which bus will we come?" First thing.

00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:59.931
Secondly, at what time should we come?
Right now all those people are stranded,

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.460
sitting there for four hours,
nobody has even asked whether
those people have come or not.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.353
Those people have been standing there
for four hours. You sat down, you
are not concerned about anyone.

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:17.675
Came here and settled down comfortably.
You people are not guests here.
This is your country, Hindustan.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:27.990
People have come here from outside. You are
in India, and while being in India you are still
on the shores, have not become the ocean.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.039
You understood it, right? Please be kind, I
feel very sad thinking that these poor people
have been stranded there for four hours.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.008
You people first, 'Let's rush in fast,
let's move quickly.'

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:45.276
They are saying that, 'Everyone entered
beforehand, wildly, what could we do?

00:05:45.284 --> 00:05:51.834
We are Sahaja Yogis; we are not
those beggars on the street.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.220
There should be some or the other
rules and regulations.

00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:59.166
Now, please, you people are not
going to get on to anybody's bus
- there's just one bus for you.

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:05.942
What is the number of your bus from here?
The number of one bus [MARATHI]

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:10.087
Firstly, we have come to such a
place where we don't get anything.

00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:14.877
Neither any food and drinks nor anything else.
All these things are coming from Kolhapur.

00:06:14.877 --> 00:06:20.709
We have come here because this
is a journey for us - we have
come to the region.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:25.421
And in this place we are not guests
- these people are guests.

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:31.686
Otherwise too, I notice/see that all the Delhi and
Mumbai people will sit in the front and
these people are sitting at the back.

00:06:31.686 --> 00:06:37.187
Is this any way to behave with the guests?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:44.539
First of all we will sit down.
We will eat first, they will eat later
- is this any way to do it?

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:49.885
We people are famous in the world
for our hospitality and our manners,

00:06:49.885 --> 00:06:55.173
we are known in the world for this,
but why do we behave otherwise
as soon as we come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:06:55.676 --> 00:07:01.476
Tomorrow onwards, you people are not
going to attack them absolutely in any way.

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:05.610
And neither are you going to enter their
buses; Only one bus is there for you.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.447
You come by that otherwise I don't
have that much money to give them.

00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:21.381
[Mr. Nigam, Mr. Nigam] There is a lot
to learn - you have come here to learn

00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:27.781
We have not come to save our lives.
What is the harm in walking for
young people?

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:32.159
What harm will it do if we walk a little?
You people have so many tantrums.

00:07:32.159 --> 00:07:36.810
It's heard that it takes four-four
hours for men and women to get ready.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:47.245
Mr. Nigam, you should keep one bus.
There is only one bus for you.
Everyone should come and go by that bus.

00:07:47.245 --> 00:07:50.624
Otherwise, if we want, we can keep you
all somewhere else, it will be better.

00:07:50.624 --> 00:07:55.317
Now tomorrow, we are thinking of shifting
you people somewhere else, so that you
don't face this problem.

00:07:55.317 --> 00:08:00.901
Leave their buses for them. These have
come and are lying here - they have
been sitting on the road for four hours.

00:08:01.072 --> 00:08:07.252
This is not a good thing. Those poor people
give the money. It is on the basis of their money
that Sahaja Yoga is running today - you know that.

00:08:11.702 --> 00:08:17.042
And these people were telling that,
'All of them pushed each other and sat
in the front - we didn't get any space.'

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:21.841
And came here and stopped the buses,
didn't even think whether the buses went
back or not - those people are standing there.

00:08:22.122 --> 00:08:30.502
Yes, you see all the buses are standing here.
Everyone came and sat comfortably here -
Delhi people, Mumbai people, Poona people.

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:39.739
I feel sad that these poor people have come
from such a long distance, they have been
travelling for a whole month, have suffered a lot.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.960
Comfort-loving is not a characteristic
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:50.521
A person who likes comfort cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:55.599
Then they will tell that when we
came, we had trouble for so long,
then this happened.

00:08:55.599 --> 00:08:57.873
A person who faces uneasiness is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:58.312 --> 00:09:06.742
In Sahaja Yoga there is the joy of the
Spirit, its comfort, its happiness.
There should be no discomfort for it,

00:09:06.742 --> 00:09:10.274
there should be no trouble; one
should remain immersed in its bliss.

00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.731
And if still one is looking for comfort here -
I heard there are big fights going on

00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:18.317
who will stay in the dormitory, who
will stay where, who will stay where
- this is a wrong thing.

00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:25.953
At least if there are elderly people
among those who are now in the tents,
it is okay; let them go to the dormitory,
the rest of you keep staying there.

00:09:25.953 --> 00:09:34.250
If your body troubles you, then settle it.
You'll have to make it understand.

00:09:35.448 --> 00:09:42.358
I'm not asking you to go to the Himalayas
and stand there in the cold air,
on one leg, without clothes.

00:09:42.358 --> 00:09:51.113
This is not the case. But useless pampering
of the body cannot and should not happen in
Sahaja Yoga. There is no such problem.

00:09:51.113 --> 00:10:00.859
If you go to any other place, go to Shanno Devi,
go to any other place, you have to climb
seven-seven miles - for that it's fine.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:07.175
There won't be any problem if
you exert your body a little.

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:12.614
And it's not a matter of great effort also;
A nice cool breeze is blowing - can come here
walking leisurely.

00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:18.635
And there is no need to do so much
preparation and dressing up so much.

00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:23.990
There is no puja today, nothing, can't
understand. They are saying that no
person comes on time.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:32.494
The bus people are standing there. Not even one
is boarding the bus right now - this is wrong.
Collectivity is less, that's why this happens.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:40.410
Now for you, you said, "We want to
come on the first," we said,
"Okay, please come, most welcome."

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.425
Now this doesn't mean that you are coming
here as guests. If you have come on the
first, then you make the arrangements.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:49.332
See what's going on, what's not
- how can you help?

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:56.717
These people have given much,
much more money than you people.

00:10:57.795 --> 00:11:03.505
And this time around Rs 8 lakhs
will be saved.

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:13.747
Every year we have benefited from their money.
I am not saying that money is everything,

00:11:13.747 --> 00:11:18.292
but they are guests. If tomorrow you
go to their country, then they
will never do this.

00:11:19.722 --> 00:11:28.092
They will first make arrangements for you.
Everyone rushed in and came.

00:11:30.927 --> 00:11:38.997
Tomorrow morning, all of you should wake up
early and go into meditation by eight o'clock.

00:11:39.071 --> 00:11:46.881
After meditation from eight to nine
[MARATHI]

00:11:46.889 --> 00:11:54.679
you will get breakfast there at nine o'clock.
Now it is not like if one person is
sitting then two others are not sitting.

00:11:54.679 --> 00:12:00.544
Someone who does not come there at
nine o'clock, will not get breakfast.
Breakfast will go from here to there.

00:12:00.544 --> 00:12:04.683
After that you all please come
here by 10 o'clock.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:12.439
You have time from nine to ten, you can
have your breakfast by then, after doing
everything by ten o'clock you're here.

00:12:12.439 --> 00:12:17.660
Leave from there, there is a bus for
you, that same bus will come,
you can reach here by that bus.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:22.274
Then we will return that bus, then
you can come here (again) by that bus.

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:29.952
In this way you can come and go by the
same bus. We cannot pay for six buses.

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:38.492
Another thing is that if a driver has
to work for more than eleven hours,
double the money has to be paid.

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:50.682
From tomorrow the program will start
here from 11 o'clock. Everyone
should reach here by 11 o'clock.

00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:58.685
There will be a program here from 11 am to 1 pm.
Whatever we do in it, whether we give
speeches or do anything, will do.

00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:04.274
The program will start properly from tomorrow.
And after that you don't need to go.

00:13:04.274 --> 00:13:10.415
You may eat here and lie down here as well if you
wish. You may have tea etc. and then leave.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.940
After having tea, you go there, get ready
in the evening time and after that

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:27.060
you should leave from there around
six o'clock, by six or half past six.

00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:38.158
So here your program will start from
six o'clock - six, seven, eight o'clock.

00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:48.569
And after that, till nine-nine thirty, maybe
till ten o'clock, after you have had your
meals, there will be a two-hour music program.

00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:55.639
This sort of arrangement is there
- or six, seven, eight
[MARATHI]

00:13:55.639 --> 00:14:00.309
[MARATHI]

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:11.511
This is how it can be done. At the
most it will take half an hour
to walk from here to there.

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:15.026
But now we have got used to the chairs
- we can't walk that much.

00:14:16.938 --> 00:14:21.198
Anyways, I'm not asking you to walk
but at least understand this,

00:14:21.198 --> 00:14:25.338
that if you sit in every bus, My
condition will become worse.

00:14:25.338 --> 00:14:28.629
Last time you did the same thing
and put me in a lot of trouble.

00:14:30.232 --> 00:14:35.022
[MARATHI]

00:14:37.321 --> 00:14:45.281
[MARATHI]

00:14:45.366 --> 00:14:54.006
[MARATHI] 7965

00:14:54.006 --> 00:15:01.373
Okay, the number of the vehicle is 7965;
The driver's number is, Mr. Patil.

00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:07.686
[MARATHI]

00:15:07.686 --> 00:15:13.306
[MARATHI]

00:15:13.306 --> 00:15:19.511
[MARATHI]

00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:27.184
[MARATHI]

00:15:27.184 --> 00:15:34.498
[MARATHI]

00:15:34.498 --> 00:15:41.539
[MARATHI]

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:48.966
[MARATHI]

00:15:49.486 --> 00:15:56.224
[MARATHI]

00:15:56.224 --> 00:16:07.704
[MARATHI]

00:16:08.743 --> 00:16:16.803
[MARATHI]

00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:19.838
And they say this to them, and
when I said they started dicussing.

00:16:22.904 --> 00:16:25.624
[MARATHI]

00:16:26.059 --> 00:16:30.279
Now I must not be displeased -
we must keep the Goddess pleased.

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:35.206
Should be kept pleased and is pleased
when austerity comes in a person.

00:16:36.619 --> 00:16:42.459
Comfort loving people cannot do Sahaja
Yoga. They can fight, can argue,

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:47.262
can talk nonsense, can say all
kinds of scandalous/odious things,

00:16:47.337 --> 00:16:52.317
but comfort-loving people cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:55.719 --> 00:16:59.819
You people should stay here once you come here.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:05.758
Stay here after having your meals if
you want to have tea, because who
will now run with the tea for you?

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:13.013
[MARATHI]

00:17:13.013 --> 00:17:21.400
Yes, so they are saying that after having
food here, there is a bus which will take you,
the same bus will then take the other party

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:28.315
and they will send tea along with it, then
you have tea there and after having tea,
you all come back by the same bus.

00:17:28.315 --> 00:17:36.674
And it's My instruction, that any person who
is an Indian, must travel by the same bus.

00:17:36.674 --> 00:17:43.279
Otherwise these people will report tomorrow
and a lot of money will have to be paid.
These bus people are also yours.

00:17:44.312 --> 00:17:51.132
And this is your government and your own
expenditure. I am told of such huge
expenditures, what can I do?

00:17:51.132 --> 00:17:56.884
Have you understood? So now please be
kind, you do not have the right to sit
in any bus you want to according to your wish.

00:17:56.884 --> 00:18:00.508
Just one bus has been arranged for you;
Whatever will be its cost, we will pay it.

00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:05.635
If you don't want to give then don't give.
Just one - have you understood?

00:18:05.635 --> 00:18:11.121
There's no need to take a single rupee
from them - it's useless.
We will settle those accounts.

00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:16.989
But those who do not come in the bus
will remain there. Please do not
come by someone else's bus.

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:24.313
If even one person sits in another bus,
I will have to pay a lot for it.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.990
So please be kind to Me. This happened last
time, and it's happening this time too.

00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:36.574
Those who are elderly should shift to
dormitories, wherever they have to go

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:44.934
And those who are coming will also stay in
the dormitory. A bus will be over there for you.
You can come and go by that - one bus is enough.

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:51.150
In Delhi too you people stand in queues
for hours. Has Lordship come in here?

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.000
Well, [UNCLEAR- ANY?] whatever it is.
Today did not start off well,
I'm feeling very sad.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.848
Poor people have been standing there for four hours.
You did not let anyone come and brought the bus
here and left it - it's a matter of great sadness.

00:19:03.848 --> 00:19:06.896
So now ask for forgiveness in your
heart and say,

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:12.690
"Mother, I will not do such a thing next
time onwards. A very wrong thing
has happened and feel very sorry."

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.320
Now I will tell you about the next
programmes, which you should listen to.

00:19:20.766 --> 00:19:26.266
In the next program, our program
will be as I told you.

00:19:26.266 --> 00:19:31.268
That there will be meditation after
waking up in the morning,
then you come here by 11 o'clock,

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:37.965
You reach here after having breakfast etc
and stay here till lunch time.

00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:43.725
After that go back, take some rest,
then drink tea and after having tea etc

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:49.712
and again, while coming here in
the evening, remember that you have
to reach here by six o'clock.

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:54.423
So the bus will come there, come by
the first bus at six o'clock,
then come by the second bus,

00:19:54.423 --> 00:19:57.627
and then we'll start the program
here from six,six-thirty.

00:19:57.627 --> 00:20:02.577
Otherwise it doesn't take much time;
it's just that you people don't
care about them.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:07.349
Should care for them, should ask,
'Did you have any tea etc or not?'

00:20:09.063 --> 00:20:17.513
And from tomorrow the program will be in
this manner. Tomorrow is not the 4th,
it is the 3rd - tomorrow is the 3rd.

00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:23.727
More people are coming on the 3rd.
And the people who have to shift on the 3rd

00:20:23.727 --> 00:20:29.885
will be shifted and your tents
will also be brought here and set up.

00:20:29.885 --> 00:20:39.786
So it would be better if tomorrow you all
stay there only after tea, after breakfast.

00:20:39.934 --> 00:20:46.404
And your - because your tents are going
to be moved from there. And your stuff -

00:20:46.404 --> 00:20:51.120
Now like when these foreigners came,
they picked up all their stuff
and brought it with them.

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:56.407
Had to call a tempo for you people because
you never carry things by your hands.

00:20:56.577 --> 00:21:01.487
Have never done till date, we are not coolies.
Everyone is a Prime Minister here.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:09.450
So for that too, you people put your
luggage in the same bus and bring it here.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.668
The tents will be pitched here; The tents
will be taken down/dismantled tomorrow morning.

00:21:13.668 --> 00:21:18.309
When you go for meditation, before that the
tents will be dismantled and set up here,

00:21:18.309 --> 00:21:23.088
so that you will have the convenience of
bathrooms and all the arrangements will be made.

00:21:23.088 --> 00:21:26.374
So after having your meal here
you go and stay there.

00:21:26.374 --> 00:21:34.994
Now whatever your luggage is, that luggage
you have to take it to those tents,
before you go to eat.

00:21:35.675 --> 00:21:43.855
So for tomorrow morning's program you people
should have a program that you shift your
arrangements from there to the tents.

00:21:46.411 --> 00:21:50.611
So as soon as you wake up tomorrow
morning, you will have one task that

00:21:50.611 --> 00:21:53.042
- these people may do whatever they like,
because they are stationed there only -

00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:57.345
Pack up all your stuff, get everything
in order, and be prepared,

00:21:57.345 --> 00:22:00.948
tomorrow the tents will be dismantled
and the tents will be set up here.

00:22:00.948 --> 00:22:04.793
And your arrangement will be made here,
where there are plenty of bathrooms

00:22:04.793 --> 00:22:09.387
You won't have trouble; you just have
to pick up your luggage and bring it here.

00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:19.085
Those people, you can lift up,
these people cannot. Okay, raise
your hands who all can lift up.

00:22:20.161 --> 00:22:25.961
Just two men and no one else?
What about women, won't women pick up?

00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:33.952
Come on, pick it up and bring it. There is
no arrangement here. There is no other
arrangement for lifting the luggage,
so what should we do?

00:22:38.582 --> 00:22:41.642
[MARATHI]

00:22:43.247 --> 00:22:48.967
Okay, a tempo will come. A tempo will
come for those who cannot lift it at all.

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:51.719
As such foreigners will also help you.

00:22:51.729 --> 00:22:57.429
We have to request all the people, who
have come here all the way from
all other countries, for one thing,

00:22:57.429 --> 00:23:02.517
I'm sorry that, you see, there has been
no proper direction to these people

00:23:02.517 --> 00:23:07.187
and they occupied all the buses and
so many foreigners were left behind.

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:12.797
There are five buses for the foreigners,
only one bus, five....
