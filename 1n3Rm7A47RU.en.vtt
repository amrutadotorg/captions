00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:04.301
Professor Voronov’s talk and Shri Mataji’s acceptance of the award, Turkey, 1994

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.658
Simultaneous translation of professor Voronov from a Russian Sahaja Yogi.

00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:07.272
Actually, the direction of religion and science.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.815
Morality and knowledge, these are two things which

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.101
make the whole world think award.

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:47.744
There are wars now on the planet and civil wars,

00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:50.279
the blood of human beings is shed.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:53.401
And during this period, our holy Mother

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.435
raised quite different questions of love and peace.

00:04:10.262 --> 00:04:14.833
Our scientist, by my initiative,

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:19.823
unanimously elected our holy Mother, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:22.730
an honorary member of our Academy.

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:17.001
The last time, in Moscow,

00:05:17.026 --> 00:05:20.575
we hand it over to our holy Mother a diploma

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.625
made by Sahaja Yogis, loving Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:27.725
Now, this is a diploma of the Government of Russia.

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.886
I would like to say a few words about what is actually this Academy, and who is a member of it.

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:30.471
There are members, among the members we have painters, scientists,

00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:34.499
musicians of different directions.

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:42.687
But we have also honorary members of our Academy,

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:45.139
but they are very few in number.

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.069
One is Antonio Juan Samaranch

00:06:53.086 --> 00:06:54.086
who is the president of the Olympic Committee of the world.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.703
Two or three Ministers who, in their own countries,

00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:10.095
liquidated the illiteracy in the population of their country.

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:35.456
Shri Mataji is the only lady on the world

00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:39.301
who has been elected an honorary member of this Academy.

00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:01.076
I have to say a lot.

00:08:01.093 --> 00:08:06.867
I know that here we have the best representatives of the nations of the world.

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:10.576
But there are some exceptions.

00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:30.503
We have to put our love first to our self-perfection, self-cognition,

00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:34.981
to put our, first, the love to our countries.

00:08:50.424 --> 00:08:53.782
We need that only to do helping that victorious

00:08:53.809 --> 00:08:58.779
victorious ideals of our holy Mother should not have any hindrance at all

00:08:58.787 --> 00:09:01.980
into that, we should self-perfect ourselves.

00:09:05.636 --> 00:09:09.598
Yes, we do have something negative besides the positive things.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.072
For example, me and also our Sahaja Yogis from Turkey,

00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:26.187
they can see how the pieces of bread are spread on the floor.

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:31.096
It’s very bad, I consider it very bad.

00:09:35.818 --> 00:09:39.875
My daughter by name Svetlana, she is also Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.720
she said,

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:54.281
“I’ve been living for a long time among the Muslims and I know their attitude towards bread.

00:10:02.983 --> 00:10:05.769
If a piece of bread has been falling on earth,

00:10:05.794 --> 00:10:07.759
then they pick it up, they kiss it and put

00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:11.669
it somewhere for the birds to pick it up”.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.025
We also have to feel respect

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.282
to the laborious people who are producing this bread, to peasants.

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:51.131
I address to all the Sahaja Yogis who are working in the press media,

00:10:51.156 --> 00:10:54.838
who are journalists: we need to disseminate

00:10:54.863 --> 00:11:00.327
the ideas of our holy Mother everywhere, on press, television and magazines.

00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:10.887
If we do so and behave properly, we can be a real example,

00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:14.406
we can make real examples for the nations of the whole world.

00:11:23.387 --> 00:11:27.110
But maybe, today, they started to call Sahaja Yogis

00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:29.702
who were not perhaps quite satisfied with it.

00:11:29.727 --> 00:11:31.860
Still, we have to make it better.

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:42.321
Taking into account an energetic activity of Shri Mataji,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:09.264
it gives us an idea to propose to elect Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:13.387
a laureate of the Noble Price winner for peace.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.005
For that purpose, we have to work hard in our own countries

00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:13.364
for Shri Mataji’s ideas to be really realized,

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:18.885
understood beyond the level of consciousness.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.941
To reach that level for the Noble Price,

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:52.447
we need to make an example, we need to make the society,

00:13:52.456 --> 00:13:57.292
the publicity, press, to realize the ideas of Shri Mataji,

00:13:57.317 --> 00:14:01.082
how beneficial they are for the whole humanity.

00:14:15.275 --> 00:14:17.863
In Petroski Academy of Arts and Science,

00:14:17.888 --> 00:14:20.199
we have many outstanding people and perhaps

00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:24.869
we shall publish a special article for that in Nirmala Yoga magazine.

00:14:30.967 --> 00:14:34.893
But, with all my heart and in the name of all members of

00:14:34.918 --> 00:14:37.066
the Academy of Arts and Science,

00:14:45.512 --> 00:14:49.172
I would like to make a sort of present to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:14:49.197 --> 00:14:55.400
This is a reproduction of Dona Latte,

00:14:55.416 --> 00:15:02.414
it’s a – [aside] sorry, sorry, no, no, Mona Lisa is different.

00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:05.202
It’s Dona Latte,

00:15:06.274 --> 00:15:08.474
Madonna, from Leonardo Da Vinci,

00:15:08.895 --> 00:15:11.842
which you can find in State Hermitage by Leonardo.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.317
(Madonna del Latte) It’s different.

00:15:25.226 --> 00:15:27.083
And the last.

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:39.330
We have really to watch our own behaviour, not to do any negative things.

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:46.530
For our compatriots in all our countries would say

00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:59.752
that, “Sahaja Yogi is really the best representative of humanity in all the countries”.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.440
That is our purpose.

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:41.028
I don't know, but

00:16:41.053 --> 00:16:43.678
how to say

00:16:43.703 --> 00:16:51.610
as to the Russian scholars and scientists.

00:16:51.635 --> 00:16:58.444
Scientists are amoral people because science is immoral.

00:16:58.469 --> 00:17:05.445
But I was surprised that in Leningrad [St Petersburg],

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:11.145
thanks to professor, we had about two thousand scientists –

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.356
I don’t know, ten thousand probably –

00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:20.406
who honoured Me so much.

00:17:20.431 --> 00:17:27.629
And I told about one centre only there, that is Swadishthan.

00:17:27.654 --> 00:17:33.986
How Swadishthan they are ruing your life.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:41.319
And they were listening to Me, absolutely, with the right attention.

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.637
All right.

00:17:43.662 --> 00:17:49.135
Very surprisingly, I’ve never seen such scientists,

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:52.568
because they cannot see something beyond science

00:17:52.577 --> 00:17:55.888
and Sahaja Yoga is meta science,

00:17:55.905 --> 00:17:58.518
it is beyond science.

00:17:58.543 --> 00:18:01.053
And when I told them how so many diseases

00:18:01.078 --> 00:18:03.675
are caused by one centre,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.742
they were really amazed at it.

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:10.285
But they were open, open-minded people

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:15.174
and a scientist means an open-minded person.

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:21.404
I was amazed also, the way they gave Me awards.

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:24.869
The first award when they gave Me,

00:18:24.893 --> 00:18:26.792
I said, “What is this?

00:18:26.817 --> 00:18:30.787
I’m the tenth member of such an old university where

00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:34.388
very, very great scientists have got this award.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:40.742
So, how can you give Me such a honour?”

00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:46.245
So, professor Voronov told Me that, “Mother

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.863
these scientists have only worked with matter.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.232
But you have worked with human beings and transformed them”.

00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:59.032
I was surprised the way he saw the point.

00:18:59.057 --> 00:19:02.385
It’s not easy to see this point

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:08.741
that transformation of human beings is most important today.

00:19:08.766 --> 00:19:12.373
If I have achieved it, it’s nothing great, I think,

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:15.350
because I knew how to do it. So, it’s nothing great.

00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:19.394
But I really feel very proud of you

00:19:19.397 --> 00:19:22.097
that you have achieved it. I have not achieved anything.

00:19:22.105 --> 00:19:23.948
I was born like this.

00:19:23.982 --> 00:19:25.949
But you have achieved it.

00:19:25.974 --> 00:19:29.166
So many nations here sitting,

00:19:29.191 --> 00:19:35.895
enjoying the same beautiful feeling of your Spirit.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:41.705
And they are from different nations, different places, different religions,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.963
and genuinely they are feeling the joy of their Spirit.

00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:51.652
And this is something, was my dream and vision.

00:19:51.677 --> 00:19:56.538
But I never thought of Noble Price or anything like that.

00:19:56.563 --> 00:20:03.466
Because, my husband has got all kind of prizes

00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:06.930
and he always, says, “All due to my wife”.

00:20:06.955 --> 00:20:11.029
But what I really treasure is this,

00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:14.786
that in a great country like Russia where

00:20:14.788 --> 00:20:18.805
science has reached its heights,

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.953
that they should accept Me

00:20:20.977 --> 00:20:24.121
as a great scientist and academician,

00:20:24.146 --> 00:20:26.959
is something really very remarkable,

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:29.921
though I don’t know if I deserve it or not.

00:20:29.946 --> 00:20:32.163
But that’s what they feel about it.

00:20:32.188 --> 00:20:35.023
Professor Voronov: There’s no doubt about it.

00:20:41.217 --> 00:20:46.376
Moreover, all the false gurus are banned in Russia.

00:20:46.401 --> 00:20:51.443
But I was surprised also that they did not ban us.

00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:54.640
Apart from that, the patriarch,

00:20:54.665 --> 00:20:59.723
who is like a pope of Leningrad of the white order,

00:20:59.748 --> 00:21:02.489
he himself invited me to be there.

00:21:02.514 --> 00:21:06.596
So, we are entering into the realm of religion also.

00:21:06.621 --> 00:21:09.479
It’s something – not only science,

00:21:09.504 --> 00:21:12.174
but also religion which is,

00:21:12.199 --> 00:21:15.334
which has to open eyes and see

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:17.688
what have they missed,

00:21:17.697 --> 00:21:21.294
all the promises that the Prophets gave,

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.901
that the incarnations gave are to be fulfilled.

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:27.856
If they can just see this point,

00:21:27.858 --> 00:21:30.986
it will be so great. I was surprised also

00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:37.676
that patriarch himself invites Me to this conference.

00:21:37.701 --> 00:21:41.434
So, two great things, I feel,

00:21:41.459 --> 00:21:47.061
that not only in science but also in religion,

00:21:47.086 --> 00:21:53.528
Sahaja Yoga is entering and will remove the darkness of ignorance.

00:21:54.141 --> 00:21:59.520
Another thing I must tell you that when I went to Brasilia

00:21:59.545 --> 00:22:04.770
which is the capital of Brazil, the Mayor of Brasilia

00:22:04.786 --> 00:22:09.545
came to receive Me and he gave Me the keys of Brasilia

00:22:09.569 --> 00:22:15.281
saying, “Mother, please look after Brazil”. I was really amazed.

00:22:15.306 --> 00:22:19.587
So, on the political side also, if we start entering into,

00:22:19.612 --> 00:22:22.322
our problems should be solved.

00:22:22.347 --> 00:22:24.467
We should have no problems,

00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:27.897
we should have no quarrels, no fights, nothing.

00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:32.856
But let us live with happiness and joy.

00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:35.861
I’m sure with this [award],

00:22:35.878 --> 00:22:39.926
I can see that vision coming through.

00:22:39.951 --> 00:22:42.961
This vision of mine

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:48.416
of seeing the whole world in peace and joy enjoying themselves.

00:22:48.441 --> 00:22:52.138
All of you, as he said, have to help Me,

00:22:52.154 --> 00:22:56.460
have to come up as real great Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:56.485 --> 00:22:58.576
I don’t know Sir, how to thank you very much

00:22:58.584 --> 00:23:00.331
because I have no words.

00:23:00.356 --> 00:23:03.721
But he has been meeting Me for three, four years and

00:23:03.746 --> 00:23:06.482
I was surprised, he is such a learned man,

00:23:06.507 --> 00:23:09.450
such an educated person,

00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:14.549
and how he could see the subtle side of life!

00:23:14.574 --> 00:23:18.244
And that they discussed about morality!

00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:21.987
All the time, all the subject was that of morality.

00:23:22.012 --> 00:23:26.129
There was a gentleman who was a surgeon  who is –

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:27.844
How old is he? Eighty years.

00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:29.726
Sahaja Yogi: Ninety-three.

00:23:29.751 --> 00:23:31.337
Sahaja Yogi: Ninety-three.

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.230
Very old,

00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:35.914
but he is still doing operations.

00:23:35.939 --> 00:23:37.336
He is still doing operations

00:23:37.361 --> 00:23:41.119
and he is the one who wrote against alcohol.

00:23:41.144 --> 00:23:43.003
And I was really surprised.

00:23:43.013 --> 00:23:44.224
Professor Voronov:  Fyodor Uglov.

00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:46.227
Professor Voronov: Academician Uglov.

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.909
He wrote a book against alcohol

00:23:52.934 --> 00:23:57.162
in a country where Vodka is so common.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:59.001
But just imagine!

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:04.063
And these people listen to their elders.

00:24:04.238 --> 00:24:06.383
They are not like Western people

00:24:06.408 --> 00:24:08.225
who do not care for their elders.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.330
They listen to their elders who are very wise.

00:24:11.355 --> 00:24:14.604
One day, I’m sure, Russia will be

00:24:14.615 --> 00:24:22.195
one of the most important religious country.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.195
It will have such a big name one day

00:24:25.203 --> 00:24:29.572
because they have taken to truth and not to some nonsensical things.

00:24:29.588 --> 00:24:33.021
And I am sure this will prove to the whole world

00:24:33.046 --> 00:24:36.382
that truth is what we should ask for.

00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:38.835
We should not get

00:24:38.853 --> 00:24:41.966
in anyway dominated by untruth

00:24:41.975 --> 00:24:47.512
because untruth will never bring joy or peace.

00:24:49.142 --> 00:24:53.073
Actually, I am overwhelmed by what he has said

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.712
and I’m happy he has made you so happy also

00:24:56.737 --> 00:24:59.532
by saying these beautiful things about Me.

00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:02.893
But I must tell you, I’m a very humble housewife.

00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.210
That’s all I am.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:10.290
But if you think I’m more than that, I’m not going to challenge it.

00:25:10.322 --> 00:25:16.068
Now we have to thank the Turkish people, the French people,

00:25:16.093 --> 00:25:19.689
for organizing this beautiful program

00:25:19.698 --> 00:25:23.599
and these weddings, despite all the problems.

00:25:23.615 --> 00:25:27.578
And also, to every way,

00:25:27.603 --> 00:25:31.923
work so hard because there were only forty Sahaja Yogis in Turkey

00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:35.063
and they have done such a dedicated work.

00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:38.106
And so capable they are!

00:25:38.123 --> 00:25:42.969
I’m amazed to see this kind of industrious,

00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:49.331
I should say, or very hard-working people, very hard working.

00:25:49.356 --> 00:25:54.107
And all the problems are solved here,

00:25:54.132 --> 00:25:56.911
they say, “Mother, you have solved all of the problems.”

00:25:56.936 --> 00:26:01.423
Now I would say the marriages have been done very gracefully.

00:26:01.448 --> 00:26:05.277
Now, don’t spoil your marriages and create problems for Me.

00:26:05.286 --> 00:26:09.488
That’s all I want to know that you’ll have very nice children,

00:26:09.511 --> 00:26:13.905
and that you create a society and help the society

00:26:13.907 --> 00:26:18.226
of great peacemakers.

00:26:18.435 --> 00:26:19.937
Thank you very much.

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:20.945
Thank you
