00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:15.176
What is Sahajyog?

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.000
Sahajyog!

00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:25.630
'Saha' means with you and 'ja 'means born.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:38.780
'Yog' means your attention's union with

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:45.732
God 's power of love that is spread all around.

00:00:45.763 --> 00:00:49.299
This occurance itself is called 'yog'.

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:55.881
This is the birth right of every human being.

00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:06.143
To get it , as the other meaning of 'Sahaj" is easy, spontanious.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.291
For this, there is proper arrangement within us.

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:18.486
There is nobody within whom there is no such arrangement

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.010
means within your triangular bone

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:25.334
which is called 'Sacrum' in English language

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.567
It means that Greeks knew that

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:43.390
the traingular bone is sacred, means it is pure.

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:47.034
That is why its name is 'Sacrum' since eternity.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:52.561
Now this bone

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:54.331
In this traingular bone

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.934
three and half circles

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.192
the power that is inherent in it, is called Kundalini in Sanskrit.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.130
Within us God has bestowed three more powers too.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:27.644
One of those powers is that we desire.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.017
Our power of desire, our everyday work of the power of desire.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.751
And another is our power of action.

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:41.920
This nourishes our sympathetic nervous system.

00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:48.985
Its nourishment depends upon these two chakras.

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:55.336
First power, with the help of which we desire

00:02:55.361 --> 00:03:04.180
the channel through which that power is broadcasted

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:07.725
is called Ida Nadi.

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.921
And the other power that gets activated

00:03:12.946 --> 00:03:15.655
they do the work for the desire they have

00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:21.257
with their existence and their body

00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:26.197
that power which we can say is

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.254
our right sympathetic nervous system.

00:03:30.357 --> 00:03:33.700
But its name is Pingala Nadi.

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:36.673
In this way , there are two channels within us.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:39.980
Ida and Pingla Nadi.

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.300
Apart from these there is third channel within us.

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:47.000
This is called Sushumna, which is in the center

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.171
is called MADHYA MARG.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:55.129
Both these powers come from left and right and join like this.

00:03:55.154 --> 00:03:57.645
And in the center a chakra is made

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.728
(Showing with HER hands)

00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:05.307
within the central chakras

00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:15.709
our physical, mental, intellectual, cultural

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:24.098
even our spiritual, all progress is settled.

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.495
When these chakras

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:36.553
get damaged on some account, or their power recedes and is destroyed

00:04:36.622 --> 00:04:40.354
then we face so many types of degeneration,

00:04:40.688 --> 00:04:46.346
physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual.

00:04:48.905 --> 00:04:53.141
This which is built within us is like

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:56.932
a great subtle TANTRA (mechanism).

00:04:56.957 --> 00:05:00.301
but the difference between Tantricks and us is that

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:06.816
Tantricks don't know anything about this mechanism and falsely

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.783
they say that they are Tantricks and say 'we do this , we do that'.

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:17.596
But mostly Tantricks use Bhoot Vidya.

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.709
And they messmerize people with that Bhoot Vidya

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:26.025
The same vidya (Knowkedge)

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.487
that we call Pret Vidya, Mashan Vidya etc., there are so many names.

00:05:32.934 --> 00:05:37.116
Now the powers that are within us

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.953
apart from that there is fourth power within us.

00:05:42.017 --> 00:05:48.425
Till we were not human beings, this fourth power did not evolve.

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:53.883
Till then these three powers were implemented

00:05:53.967 --> 00:06:00.806
and whatever our progress was going on

00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:03.384
we should say that in our evolution

00:06:03.955 --> 00:06:11.379
was fully going on  with the help of these three powers.

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:16.343
For example, first power is 'power of desire'

00:06:16.486 --> 00:06:18.429
second is 'power of action'.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.736
And the third power is which we can say

00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:25.323
is the cordination of the two

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.463
or balance or we can say is the middle path.

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:37.796
By and by, a human being has reached this state

00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:44.299
that he in this Kaliyuga is in hassle.

00:06:45.664 --> 00:06:52.569
Sometimes he follows a wrong path, acts wrongly

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:57.396
and in a way destroys himself completely.

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:01.263
Secondly, he behaves in such a manner

00:07:01.288 --> 00:07:04.826
that he becomes very wicked, is full of ego

00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.464
and is very agressive with the people.

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:08.386
Its example is

00:07:08.474 --> 00:07:15.387
let us try to understand that by following both the paths

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:20.866
we feel that we are progressing.

00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:27.300
What is wrong with this, it is good, it is freedom for us.

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:31.556
But it is different to know the TANTRA Of (SAV)

00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:35.930
We are talking here about TANTRA of (SAV)

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:39.212
First of all, it should be understood

00:07:39.696 --> 00:07:45.847
that if we knew only truth, knew absolute truth

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:47.744
there would have been no disputes of the present.

00:07:48.848 --> 00:07:52.262
So, something else should be within us

00:07:52.287 --> 00:07:57.881
and because of which we will come to know that

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:00.353
which is only'Truth'.

00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:06.287
After knowing all this, they will accept one thing

00:08:06.477 --> 00:08:11.626
because within them they have felt only ' Truth.'

00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:15.292
Now for awakening the kundalini

00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:20.315
for the last so many years Nagpanthis did a lot of work.

00:08:21.982 --> 00:08:27.209
In this work of Nagpanthis, there was a system, a tradition

00:08:27.234 --> 00:08:32.284
that one guru would awaken only one disciple.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.707
and would work only for one disciple

00:08:35.303 --> 00:08:38.923
And sometimes these disciples would follow the wrong path

00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:42.509
and would not follow their advice.

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:49.338
According to ME, in the twelfth century

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:54.653
for the first time, Gyaneshwar ji wrote about kundalini

00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:59.090
in his commentary about Geeta.

00:08:59.328 --> 00:09:04.940
In sixth chapter, has openly said

00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:07.050
as we should say, keeping in mind the conditions of that age

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.917
had openly said in that period.

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:11.547
when religious practitioners said

00:09:11.572 --> 00:09:14.491
it has not been prooved and so don't read it.

00:09:14.535 --> 00:09:18.700
Before that Markandey Swamy, Adi Shankaracharya

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:20.170
who had come in sixth century

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.551
told about Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:26.355
But common man didn't know him.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.384
Secondly, which means that

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:29.646
when only one person will work with one disciple

00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.409
it would spread among the ordinary people.

00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:37.428
After that there were many religions in the world.

00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:44.467
and spread also too much.

00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:49.535
But without Kundalini awakening, no dharma gets success

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:54.801
because whatever dharma a human being does, that is just external.

00:09:55.698 --> 00:09:57.662
Every type of equipment

00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:01.971
every type of, we should say

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:05.688
which results in too much ritualism

00:10:05.982 --> 00:10:07.945
and because of that ritualism,

00:10:08.287 --> 00:10:12.997
a human being does not get benefitted in anyway from religion.

00:10:13.552 --> 00:10:15.661
That is why we find that now a days

00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:18.496
a human being has some assumtions about dharma.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.640
One will say i am Christian, another will say i am Muslim.

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.155
Now, Christian and Muslim religions are very rigid.

00:10:26.853 --> 00:10:30.154
Because in Christian religion, Christ has written

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:37.537
that if your one eye does any wrong act, take it out

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:41.944
and if your one hand does a wrong act break it, cut it.

00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:45.941
But I have not seen anyone doing so among Christians.

00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:47.983
And Muslim religion is even more rigid than that.

00:10:48.774 --> 00:10:53.848
They have put such restrictions even on women.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.442
That those who are not ordinary human beings.

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:05.601
They were, as if highly proficient for some God's angles.

00:11:05.626 --> 00:11:10.366
The restrictions they had told about religion

00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:13.324
only they can do and nobody else.

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:19.998
Then what it led to, was that within a human being

00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:22.688
hypocricy evolved, a religious hypocrisy.

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:27.231
To awaken dharma inside, kundalini should be awakened.

00:11:27.568 --> 00:11:31.404
It means that when dharma awakens within a human being

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:32.996
he becomes dharmic.

00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:34.531
He doesn't have to be told.

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:38.394
The reason is that when kundalini awakens

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:45.122
your spirit comes into your attention.

00:11:45.694 --> 00:11:52.381
In the same way, a human being does what is joy giving for him

00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:55.470
is nutritous, is constructive for him

00:11:55.899 --> 00:12:04.333
and whatever is destructible, is destrucive, (is given up).

00:12:04.452 --> 00:12:09.248
Until the light of his spirit doesn't get awakened

00:12:09.273 --> 00:12:11.720
they do all wrong acts.

00:12:11.745 --> 00:12:13.284
It is not his fault.

00:12:13.309 --> 00:12:16.048
If anyone walks or falls down in dark

00:12:16.178 --> 00:12:18.204
he should not be blamed.

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:21.016
In the same way

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:24.192
within you, you should analyse first.

00:12:24.217 --> 00:12:25.867
You might say that we belong to this religion

00:12:25.892 --> 00:12:27.541
we belong to that religion

00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:32.540
and you are fighting on that account, that is wrong.

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:41.871
All religions were beautiful flowers of one spiritual tree

00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:43.205
which were plucked.

00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:46.021
and after plucking say this is our flower, this is our flower

00:12:46.046 --> 00:12:47.448
and so are fighting among themselves.

00:12:47.473 --> 00:12:50.917
How can you fight in the name of God?

00:12:51.346 --> 00:12:55.913
Because God is the giver of love, He is compassionate.

00:12:57.112 --> 00:13:02.477
God who is the ocean of love, people fight in His name.

00:13:02.842 --> 00:13:04.510
It is not possibe.

00:13:04.535 --> 00:13:06.787
Because they haven't known God as yet

00:13:06.812 --> 00:13:08.946
haven't acquired His power as yet.

00:13:09.636 --> 00:13:14.386
I have seen in Sahajyoga that

00:13:16.132 --> 00:13:19.345
thousands of people together

00:13:20.909 --> 00:13:28.366
get this power.

00:13:31.514 --> 00:13:33.299
It is very surprising.

00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:37.231
First of all, when I started this work

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.520
only with one woman started and after that

00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.508
and twelve people got self realization.

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:55.180
When experience takes place

00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:01.509
this all pervading power,

00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:10.392
this creation full of vibrations, is cool and very comforting power

00:14:10.434 --> 00:14:14.490
which you on your fingers

00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:22.295
can see, can know and feel.

00:14:22.402 --> 00:14:27.436
and even on your palm.

00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:33.355
Like this when Kundalini pierces six chakras

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:38.455
and comes out of Bramharandra

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.546
then its connection

00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:43.967
its oneness with all around Divine power of love takes place.

00:14:46.613 --> 00:14:49.386
Till you are not connected

00:14:50.124 --> 00:14:58.193
how can you know what is God's power of love.

00:14:58.218 --> 00:15:05.888
Now the time has come, there is something special

00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:10.660
that so many people are in search of God are, in search of truth.

00:15:10.787 --> 00:15:12.358
It has never been before.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:18.567
and in that search when they experience it

00:15:19.913 --> 00:15:25.076
and when they look at themselves, they are surprised

00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:30.969
that i was such a drunkard yesterday, was doing this, was doing that

00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:35.124
and all this of mine, whatever

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:44.347
was like an obligation, how did it drop off suddenly.

00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:48.158
Means what was it that was left behind.

00:15:48.183 --> 00:15:53.201
By and by, with this power, with the power of the spirit

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:59.140
you see , you yourself are very powerful.

00:16:00.196 --> 00:16:03.627
and you see that with this power of the spirit

00:16:03.652 --> 00:16:06.498
you can give light to others too.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.710
I have seen that many people had stage fright

00:16:13.314 --> 00:16:15.371
have now become great orators.

00:16:15.396 --> 00:16:19.236
Those who didn't know how to write poetry, started writing poems.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:23.801
Very great

00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:30.415
singers, musicians, and many artists have reached great heights.

00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:36.274
This I am telling you only about power of creativity.

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:39.851
But there are many powers within us, we are unaware of

00:16:39.876 --> 00:16:40.939
and these execute

00:16:40.964 --> 00:16:44.153
after getting enlightened in the light of the spirit.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.371
We don't know ourselves.

00:16:47.396 --> 00:16:51.661
Actually we say this is my hand, this is my nose, this is my head

00:16:51.686 --> 00:16:56.271
this is my wisdom and this is my thought.

00:16:56.296 --> 00:16:59.903
This 'mine, mine' that we say, who is this?

00:17:02.411 --> 00:17:06.275
If it is asked, ' who am i' ? we don't have (any answer to it).

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:14.226
But you (INAUDIBLE)

00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:18.752
and piercing the Bramharandra

00:17:18.777 --> 00:17:24.529
this all over spread Divine power is available to you.

00:17:24.568 --> 00:17:28.688
Even the spirit settled in your heart

00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:31.473
gets enlightened in your attention.

00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:38.990
Then you understand that i am not this body, wisdom, mind, ego.

00:17:39.015 --> 00:17:42.707
I myself am pure spirit.

00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:50.390
A very great secret, which remained hidden

00:17:50.415 --> 00:17:51.655
gets exposed in front of you.

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.070
You don't know that you are the spirit.

00:17:56.095 --> 00:18:00.333
But when it takes place, its knowledge comes to you.

00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:02.419
Now this word 'BODH' (knowledge) is very important.

00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:05.200
This is Sanskrit word 'BODH'.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.923
From ' Bodh' originated ' Buddh'.

00:18:06.948 --> 00:18:17.054
Means that on your central nervous system, you can feel this power.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:23.331
You can feel this power on your chakras.

00:18:23.771 --> 00:18:27.689
You can feel other's chakras too on this

00:18:27.714 --> 00:18:32.371
If you can correct your chakras, you can do other's too.

00:18:32.697 --> 00:18:34.669
While sitting here, you can even know about

00:18:34.694 --> 00:18:39.354
the chakras of one who has died or is living in some foreign land.

00:18:39.907 --> 00:18:42.307
Everybody gets knowledge about chakras.

00:18:42.332 --> 00:18:44.071
You on your fingers

00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:49.130
can know about the problem a person is suffering from.

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:52.531
Everybody will say the same thing.

00:18:52.556 --> 00:18:55.686
There is no discussion about it, no quarrel

00:18:55.711 --> 00:18:58.816
because you have only truth.

00:18:58.841 --> 00:19:01.521
And after knowing this

00:19:01.546 --> 00:19:04.515
many people, one such person had come to tell ME today only

00:19:04.738 --> 00:19:07.777
that his cancer got cured.

00:19:09.182 --> 00:19:12.392
And I asked him, "what did you do?"

00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:20.824
" Mother I did a little bit of Sahajyoga treatment of Cancer

00:19:20.991 --> 00:19:22.198
then I was alright.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.560
And everybody had told me that you will die

00:19:25.663 --> 00:19:28.232
but i am completely cured.

00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:34.413
But in this  ( INAUDIBLE)

00:19:35.068 --> 00:19:39.578
and another quality is that you know it.

00:19:39.603 --> 00:19:41.038
You know everything.

00:19:41.063 --> 00:19:45.759
In Sahajyoga, there is no secret knowledge.

00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.004
You know everything about Sahajyoga.

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:51.885
Whatever you want to know, you know.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:57.659
First thing about truth is that you are pure Spirit.

00:19:58.056 --> 00:20:04.702
Another truth is that all around us is an invisible subtle power.

00:20:05.012 --> 00:20:08.337
It is God's love that activates.

00:20:08.362 --> 00:20:10.488
Now we may call that by any name.

00:20:10.513 --> 00:20:12.528
It is called 'Rooh' in Koran

00:20:12.913 --> 00:20:18.339
In Bible it is called ' Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost'.

00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:21.550
And you go through any religion

00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:26.032
Chaitanya and Param Chatanya etc.,

00:20:26.057 --> 00:20:28.541
many other things have been mentioned in our Shastras.

00:20:30.105 --> 00:20:34.047
And if You go through Patanjali yoga

00:20:34.072 --> 00:20:37.183
it is called Ritambara Pragya'

00:20:38.224 --> 00:20:41.449
which changes seasons, which makes the flowers to bloom

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:46.134
and whatever the system of living work channel is there

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.351
everything that takes place, is this power.

00:20:49.376 --> 00:20:52.419
You are at one with that power

00:20:52.554 --> 00:20:55.110
and it works inside your being.

00:20:55.779 --> 00:20:58.692
After that you start changing.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.168
You life gets balanced

00:21:01.446 --> 00:21:07.722
and you know everything on your finger tips, what is your problem.

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:09.983
For example, people will come and tell ME

00:21:10.008 --> 00:21:11.438
" Mother my Agnya is catching."

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.722
It means that we are getting ego and please take it out.

00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:19.197
But will anyone say," I have ego"?

00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:20.301
Nobody will say!

00:21:21.197 --> 00:21:25.021
But when this state comes, a human being introspects himself.

00:21:25.046 --> 00:21:29.391
What problem i have, like that

00:21:29.716 --> 00:21:32.794
and when this takes place, then in collectivity

00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:37.869
in collectivity a lot of work is done.

00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:41.932
In collectivity it so happens that

00:21:42.298 --> 00:21:45.912
a new cycle starts.

00:21:46.302 --> 00:21:50.252
Now the people in Russia too are self realised

00:21:50.277 --> 00:21:54.280
In England too there are, in Japan too, they are everywhere.

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:58.318
and they all know one thing about themselves and about others

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.625
what is their problem and what problem we have.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.270
and how it should be done.

00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:07.158
All of them speak one language and that is of chakras

00:22:07.183 --> 00:22:11.366
and in this way I can see a new era in front of ME.

00:22:11.391 --> 00:22:14.089
And now you cannot pay any money for this.

00:22:14.114 --> 00:22:16.378
It is worth understanding that

00:22:16.403 --> 00:22:19.496
for any living work we canno pay any money.

00:22:19.522 --> 00:22:25.763
if there is a seed, if we put it into soil

00:22:25.784 --> 00:22:28.972
we do not pay any money to the soil.

00:22:28.997 --> 00:22:31.678
In the same way , it is a living work

00:22:31.954 --> 00:22:36.097
and for this living work, you don't have to pay anything

00:22:36.122 --> 00:22:37.554
and if anyone asks for money

00:22:37.579 --> 00:22:40.032
first of all try to understand that it is fraud.

00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:45.698
In this I will say

00:22:45.723 --> 00:22:47.671
that today we are human beings

00:22:47.758 --> 00:22:49.512
for that whom did we pay any money?

00:22:49.945 --> 00:22:57.893
So if we come from spiritual form, to whom have we to pay for that?

00:22:58.672 --> 00:23:03.150
Yes it is correct that if you are booking a hall, pay money for that

00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:05.512
or pay money for such a thing.

00:23:05.537 --> 00:23:09.604
But if you want for all this work, no money for that.

00:23:09.629 --> 00:23:11.802
But if a human being understands only this much

00:23:11.827 --> 00:23:14.671
that it has no connection with money

00:23:14.696 --> 00:23:18.874
and God doesn't know what is money or bank.

00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:22.193
And when you understand this thing

00:23:22.218 --> 00:23:26.208
mostly the wrong gurus who have evolved these days

00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:27.442
they will be disposed off.

00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:32.275
Now in religions also, religion is money oriented

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:36.442
Either he is power oriented

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:39.057
or he is money oriented

00:23:39.082 --> 00:23:41.128
for everything you put so much money

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.330
that we will write a letter to God and HE will set right everything.

00:23:45.355 --> 00:23:50.741
In this way we, at a very low level, talk in the name of God.

00:23:51.995 --> 00:23:54.608
I am so happy that today people

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:57.496
were blessed and got relaxed.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:02.496
About Sahajyoga, if you want to understand

00:24:02.521 --> 00:24:04.319
you have to experience it

00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:08.799
If you have not experienced it

00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:10.625
just make you understand like that

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.406
may be you will think that SHE is talking just miraculously.

00:24:14.946 --> 00:24:17.101
Don't know if it is true or not.

00:24:17.126 --> 00:24:19.478
So first of all it should be experienced.

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:20.692
This is very important.

00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:22.553
After experiencing it

00:24:22.735 --> 00:24:27.307
like a sprouted seed, it grows slowly

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:33.659
in the same way, a Sahajyogi becomes a saint of a very high quality.

00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:40.483
And their methodology is so pure and beautiful

00:24:40.508 --> 00:24:43.331
that after watching them more people join Sahajyoga.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.990
Their life is full of love and enjoyment.

00:24:49.015 --> 00:24:52.983
With that too people think that they have not seen anything like that

00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:58.331
There is no problem, no confusion of any type

00:24:58.356 --> 00:25:03.546
and the greatest thing is that the character of Sahajyogis

00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:13.344
and specially, special character, with great morality gets nourished.

00:25:13.369 --> 00:25:18.183
I have seen foreigners who take drugs

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:22.917
if they get realisation today, they give up drugs only next day.

00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.203
And their eye which would move here and there

00:25:26.228 --> 00:25:29.092
would absolutely get innocent.

00:25:29.465 --> 00:25:32.766
Very beautiful! Full of innocense!

00:25:32.917 --> 00:25:36.847
In this way, if a human being knows himself

00:25:36.872 --> 00:25:44.985
it is a very beautiful grateful and a special thing God has created

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.488
So, I have to tell everybody that you get your realisation first.

00:25:50.513 --> 00:25:52.592
There is no need even to trust ME.

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:55.938
It is quite possible that I too may put you into wrong concepts.

00:25:55.963 --> 00:25:59.334
So, first you get your realisation and after that understand it.

00:25:59.597 --> 00:26:04.532
Because due to superstitions also there has been a great loss to us.

00:26:04.557 --> 00:26:09.855
I don't want that you should trust on ME blindfoldedly.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.062
Now the obstacles that we face are like this

00:26:13.087 --> 00:26:18.747
that if anyone is extremely foolish, then we can't do anything.

00:26:19.438 --> 00:26:21.725
Sahajyoga is not for the fools.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:26.738
Next if anyone is very head strong and tends to do his own way

00:26:27.143 --> 00:26:30.701
his kundalini too will not awaken.

00:26:30.726 --> 00:26:35.172
Thirdly, those who are great sinners and very wicked

00:26:35.197 --> 00:26:36.653
their kundalini too does not awaken.

00:26:36.852 --> 00:26:40.704
If you say," Mother please give realisation to Hitler". I can't give.

00:26:42.966 --> 00:26:47.890
There are such people too who have gone to wrong gurus

00:26:47.915 --> 00:26:49.222
they have been influenced by them

00:26:49.247 --> 00:26:52.829
there will be a little difficulty in giving them realisation.

00:26:52.854 --> 00:26:56.673
For example some people are such that

00:26:56.698 --> 00:27:01.557
they are attatched to something, to some dharma, to this, to that.

00:27:02.495 --> 00:27:07.998
If you really want independence

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.321
then first awaken the mechanism of self.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:13.095
When that is done

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.641
for that there is no worry, you will understand everything.

00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:19.018
But it is important

00:27:19.249 --> 00:27:23.249
that your spirit should first come to your attention.

00:27:23.879 --> 00:27:26.165
There are many advantages of Sahajyoga.

00:27:27.188 --> 00:27:32.356
Some of these I can tell today.

00:27:32.396 --> 00:27:36.812
Because, it has so many advantages and everytime

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.551
for example, I come across some people telling ME

00:27:39.576 --> 00:27:41.692
i have been benefitted in this way, in that way.

00:27:41.717 --> 00:27:46.721
But if we classify it

00:27:46.746 --> 00:27:49.732
the first and greatest advantage of it is

00:27:49.757 --> 00:27:52.742
that you will get your health benefits.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:01.141
because when your chakras get weakened

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:10.493
whichever chakra gets like that

00:28:10.518 --> 00:28:14.252
that part of the body gets effected by some disease

00:28:15.337 --> 00:28:21.659
It is difficult to make you understand particularly about that

00:28:21.882 --> 00:28:27.364
but in Delhi University

00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:33.184
four doctors  were honoured  M.D for Sahajyoga.

00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:36.622
They had worked on four topics

00:28:36.647 --> 00:28:42.383
and all the four topics are such that

00:28:42.408 --> 00:28:45.583
that we cannot cure diseases.

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:47.005
For example Asthma.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.548
Asthma can be cured by Sahajyoga.

00:28:53.184 --> 00:28:58.242
Now if we talk about it extensively

00:28:59.322 --> 00:29:05.646
that when we think too much.

00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:11.946
Just now we think about our future

00:29:13.061 --> 00:29:15.489
then we plan a lot.

00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:20.274
So, our power of our right side

00:29:22.053 --> 00:29:26.901
it works in a more special way.

00:29:26.926 --> 00:29:35.341
One is that, our liver and your pancreas

00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:40.575
your spleen and intestines.

00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:46.645
To all these only one chakra gives energy and that is Swadishthan.

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:50.647
But when you think

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:59.222
it gives enrgy even to the grey cells of our brain.

00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:05.829
When you think more than your need, and get worried

00:30:05.854 --> 00:30:07.874
you are futuristic.

00:30:08.711 --> 00:30:13.648
So the energy that we have in this chakra gets utilized in that.

00:30:14.743 --> 00:30:17.565
The grey cells of your brain go on changing

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.232
your liver is out of order

00:30:19.257 --> 00:30:24.903
your Pancrease, your spleen and your intestines are out of order.

00:30:26.006 --> 00:30:37.482
Now, liver's this work that the poison that is inside your being

00:30:37.507 --> 00:30:42.756
it takes out of one's body in the form of heat.

00:30:43.653 --> 00:30:50.463
For example, the blood that goes to liver

00:30:51.572 --> 00:30:56.798
the heat is sucked byit (liver).

00:30:56.823 --> 00:30:57.938
It is a very great task.

00:30:59.001 --> 00:31:03.000
If liver doesn't work, gets weak

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:06.740
this heat moves upwards.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.191
When it starts moving upwards

00:31:10.216 --> 00:31:14.090
we say that inside us there is a chakra which is Right Heart

00:31:15.476 --> 00:31:20.588
which manages our lungs.

00:31:21.811 --> 00:31:26.345
When this chakra gets heat

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.709
that causes Asthma in us.

00:31:32.154 --> 00:31:38.001
Now when this heat

00:31:38.026 --> 00:31:42.684
reaches pancrease, it causes Diabetese.

00:31:42.709 --> 00:31:45.872
Diabetese often occurs to those

00:31:45.897 --> 00:31:49.619
who are futuristic, those who plan with paper and pen.

00:31:49.901 --> 00:31:52.031
Poor people do not get diabetese

00:31:52.056 --> 00:31:55.544
because they are not bothered about future.

00:31:55.569 --> 00:32:00.164
Today they eat food, sleep, next day get up and go to work.

00:32:00.323 --> 00:32:05.096
They may take sugar four to five spoons, it hardly matters.

00:32:05.121 --> 00:32:08.785
This disease attacks

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.730
those who take too much help of their wisdom

00:32:12.755 --> 00:32:16.364
and those who are futuristic.

00:32:17.877 --> 00:32:23.073
Then a very serious disease attacks your spleen.

00:32:23.398 --> 00:32:29.347
The job of spleen is that it controls your speedometer.

00:32:30.536 --> 00:32:36.983
The work that you are doing, you do it rhythmically

00:32:37.064 --> 00:32:41.337
or you get up in the morning, you rush, take smething

00:32:41.362 --> 00:32:42.761
and then drive the car

00:32:42.786 --> 00:32:46.329
and then on the way read the news or something

00:32:46.354 --> 00:32:48.357
the brain gets all the more out of order

00:32:48.382 --> 00:32:51.238
then went to office , there also got rebuked.

00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:55.648
This spedometer doesn't understand

00:32:55.673 --> 00:32:57.493
what has happened to this man?

00:32:57.565 --> 00:32:58.565
He becomes mad.

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:01.561
When the spleen goes out of order,

00:33:01.586 --> 00:33:05.138
at that stage if he gets any shock or is affected

00:33:05.442 --> 00:33:09.373
he gets diseases like blood cancer and lukemia.

00:33:09.961 --> 00:33:12.456
And that too many people in Sahajyoga have got.

00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:16.252
Then it efects your kidney.

00:33:17.207 --> 00:33:22.719
So the kidney also shrivels (shrinks) by this heat.

00:33:22.744 --> 00:33:27.643
Because of that the urine gets blocked.

00:33:27.668 --> 00:33:33.389
They put you on Dialysis and you become bankrupt

00:33:33.414 --> 00:33:36.361
and you have to die surely.

00:33:37.237 --> 00:33:42.439
Then after that it effects your intestines

00:33:42.542 --> 00:33:49.309
you cannot digest your food and you have constipation.

00:33:50.525 --> 00:33:56.042
Sometimes it takes a very serious turn

00:33:56.836 --> 00:33:59.022
and then I told you about lungs also.

00:33:59.047 --> 00:34:02.519
But when there is a child

00:34:02.544 --> 00:34:10.680
there is a young boy of eighteen / nineteen years old, drinks

00:34:10.705 --> 00:34:18.245
heat on account of that causes massive heart attack to him.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.430
His life cannot be saved.

00:34:24.455 --> 00:34:27.867
That is why it is said, that if somebody gets massive heart attack

00:34:27.892 --> 00:34:29.022
his life cannot be saved.

00:34:29.047 --> 00:34:30.543
There will be complete end of his life.

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:39.133
Then about this heat I have to say that

00:34:39.158 --> 00:34:44.944
if a human being goes on like this , his heart can also be effected.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.538
Anytime he can have a massive heart attack in his life time.

00:34:50.009 --> 00:34:51.846
That also causes death.

00:34:51.871 --> 00:34:54.509
Thirdly, he can have paralysis.

00:34:54.534 --> 00:34:56.943
His right side will be paralysed.

00:34:56.968 --> 00:35:03.820
It means that nature too teaches us balancing.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.539
If we use our right side too much

00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:08.875
our right side will be constricted.

00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:14.109
if the right side is constricted, you cannot do any work.

00:35:14.649 --> 00:35:17.783
This I have told you only about one chakra.

00:35:18.196 --> 00:35:22.063
You can understand that it causes so many diseases.

00:35:22.088 --> 00:35:25.405
And inside our being there are seven chakras.

00:35:26.294 --> 00:35:28.317
kundalini pierces six chakras

00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:39.823
and if your six chakras get alright

00:35:40.427 --> 00:35:45.382
your health will be perfectly alright.

00:35:46.304 --> 00:35:49.212
Then you will have no problem.

00:35:49.237 --> 00:35:53.537
With the help of this, cancer and many other diseases have been cured

00:35:53.597 --> 00:35:54.597
and can be cured.

00:35:54.947 --> 00:35:58.250
But first of all there should be self realisation.

00:35:58.275 --> 00:36:02.042
And it is not necessary that you should collect all the sick people.

00:36:02.067 --> 00:36:05.852
For example, if we cure one, they get ten more to be cured

00:36:05.877 --> 00:36:09.693
and those who get sick, mostly I have noticed that by curing them

00:36:09.718 --> 00:36:14.814
out of them five to ten percent take to Sahajyoga.

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:18.541
Rest of them get cured and go, they get back their diseases

00:36:18.566 --> 00:36:20.293
Get their heart disease again.

00:36:20.318 --> 00:36:22.793
Those who settle down in Sahajyoga

00:36:22.818 --> 00:36:24.837
sensibly

00:36:25.217 --> 00:36:31.931
they are completely healthy.

00:36:35.007 --> 00:36:37.046
Now the second benifit is that

00:36:38.272 --> 00:36:40.971
that peace settles in your heart.

00:36:44.399 --> 00:36:47.244
We are always thinking

00:36:47.269 --> 00:36:49.122
about our future

00:36:49.147 --> 00:36:54.810
or we think about the past

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.671
and we jump on these thoughts

00:36:57.696 --> 00:37:00.774
that which is present we cannot remain stationed.

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.663
But one thought comes and falls down

00:37:05.688 --> 00:37:09.230
second thought rises and comes down.

00:37:09.255 --> 00:37:12.530
In this way there is a chain of thoughts

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.296
and between these

00:37:14.321 --> 00:37:18.370
there is a little space which is called VILAMBH (pause)

00:37:18.395 --> 00:37:23.329
that is present but there out attention doesn't stick

00:37:23.354 --> 00:37:26.685
With the awakening of Kundalini, these thoughts disperse

00:37:27.178 --> 00:37:30.221
and gets elongated

00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:36.098
and the space in between, that is our present.

00:37:36.797 --> 00:37:42.359
and the present only is that is truth.

00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:50.841
Rest,  past is over and the future is not there.

00:37:50.866 --> 00:37:52.801
In the present you settle down.

00:37:52.826 --> 00:37:55.514
When you settle in the present,

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.041
total peace settles inside your being.

00:37:58.066 --> 00:38:02.122
In the same way, For example

00:38:02.308 --> 00:38:05.144
you are standing in water and the waves are rising

00:38:05.319 --> 00:38:08.533
you don't know swimming and you become nervous.

00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:11.552
But if you come into the boat, you see the waves too.

00:38:12.334 --> 00:38:16.298
But if you know swimming, you can jump and save them too.

00:38:16.401 --> 00:38:21.065
Those who don't know swimming and are sinking

00:38:21.373 --> 00:38:23.702
Just the same happens in Sahajyoga.

00:38:23.727 --> 00:38:28.270
First, people attain that state

00:38:28.295 --> 00:38:30.957
which is called thoughtless awareness

00:38:31.116 --> 00:38:39.904
means without any thought

00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:43.356
which is called 'Nirvichaar Samadhi'.

00:38:43.381 --> 00:38:45.131
This is the first state.

00:38:45.156 --> 00:38:50.453
and after that the state which comes

00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:52.767
is called 'Nirvikalp Samadhi'.

00:38:53.189 --> 00:38:55.074
Means that no doubt remains

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:59.545
about one's own self, about Sahajyoga and about one's powers.

00:39:00.141 --> 00:39:04.283
Such a person has full confidence, what is Sahajyoga?

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.291
and then he does the work of Sahajyoga.

00:39:08.316 --> 00:39:13.810
This state has come to many for the first time.

00:39:13.835 --> 00:39:16.684
and some take time

00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:20.053
and by getting Nirvichaar samadhi

00:39:20.498 --> 00:39:23.495
you become absolutely peaceful.

00:39:24.465 --> 00:39:29.087
This is the state of your inner peace that we have to get.

00:39:29.421 --> 00:39:34.771
With the help of this, our past thoughts and violence

00:39:34.796 --> 00:39:38.224
and our tendendency to destroy others gets over.

00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:43.474
Because the peace that is settled within us

00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:53.081
we experience with a great joy and ease.

00:39:53.502 --> 00:39:59.347
Then we don't like to hate anyone to criticize anyone

00:39:59.372 --> 00:40:02.947
to be egoistic.

00:40:02.972 --> 00:40:10.941
We don't have any greed for any thing.

00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:13.707
All this greed is over.

00:40:13.732 --> 00:40:22.904
And a human being peacefully witnesses the whole world

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:29.192
And in this witness state he thinks it was all like a drama.

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.426
I came out of it.

00:40:31.286 --> 00:40:35.353
Now i am not in this traffic. I am sitting outside on a mountain.

00:40:35.798 --> 00:40:38.666
He moves away from it.

00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:43.395
The questions that he has are over very easily

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.334
because he has come out of it.

00:40:46.359 --> 00:40:53.722
And apart from that, this supreme power of love becomes active.

00:40:54.175 --> 00:40:55.175
Questions are over.

00:40:57.452 --> 00:41:02.677
Another great advantage that your subtle powers

00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:05.520
the power of creativity gets awakened

00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:07.159
Every type of creative power

00:41:07.184 --> 00:41:09.880
I have seen, got awakened in such people

00:41:09.951 --> 00:41:14.589
where there was no hope that they will do some such creative work.

00:41:16.089 --> 00:41:23.378
Third thing is that, because of your mental peace

00:41:24.202 --> 00:41:26.918
you give mental peace to others too.

00:41:27.427 --> 00:41:30.816
Wherever such a person exists, there peace prevails.

00:41:31.539 --> 00:41:34.725
Only by giving award, nobody gets peace.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.380
By telling that somebody is messenger of peace

00:41:37.405 --> 00:41:38.626
there cannot be peace.

00:41:38.785 --> 00:41:40.610
Peace is within our being.

00:41:40.888 --> 00:41:44.530
And when such peace establishes within us

00:41:44.594 --> 00:41:46.876
we become totally fearless.

00:41:46.901 --> 00:41:51.344
As Kabira has said, "I will sing NIRBHAY, NIRGUN GAUNGA MAI."

00:41:51.822 --> 00:41:53.826
So fear goes off.

00:41:53.921 --> 00:41:59.509
Such a person leads a fearless and truthful life.

00:41:59.534 --> 00:42:02.092
Christ's case is very interesting.

00:42:02.362 --> 00:42:04.927
Mary Magdalene was a prostitute.

00:42:04.952 --> 00:42:06.641
Every body stoned her.

00:42:06.666 --> 00:42:08.074
After stones were thrown at her

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:09.903
when she came to the edge of the village

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.523
Christ went and stood and picked up a stone

00:42:14.548 --> 00:42:18.213
and said that the stones which all of you are throwing

00:42:18.306 --> 00:42:22.083
out of them, the person who has never committed any sin

00:42:22.108 --> 00:42:23.266
hit stones at ME.

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:24.579
It was such a  courageous act.

00:42:25.778 --> 00:42:28.261
Everybody put their stones on to the ground.

00:42:29.051 --> 00:42:31.240
And then to that Mary Magdalene

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:34.032
He changed her life

00:42:34.057 --> 00:42:39.504
gave her a very great a powerful state of yoga.

00:42:39.529 --> 00:42:48.704
So, it is proved that you in a way in the light of your spirit

00:42:50.196 --> 00:42:55.493
get completely, an inner security.

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:57.011
It is a very great job.

00:42:57.982 --> 00:43:04.360
Now because of that many people get breast cancer or other diseases

00:43:06.355 --> 00:43:09.581
Thirdly many people who didn't know how to sing, started singing.

00:43:09.606 --> 00:43:11.514
Many people who were scared of delivering a speech

00:43:11.539 --> 00:43:12.961
started giving speeches.

00:43:14.106 --> 00:43:19.300
And for example, you pay your attention towards others

00:43:19.325 --> 00:43:24.709
as to what are the good attributes in them.

00:43:24.734 --> 00:43:27.876
And pay attention to what bad quality they have in their ownself.

00:43:28.032 --> 00:43:30.976
For example, when you are away from yourself, you ask.

00:43:30.996 --> 00:43:33.860
Then you see what is wrong with your society.

00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:36.405
Then you see what is wrong with your country

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.777
Before this, if we tell somebody

00:43:37.802 --> 00:43:39.465
that there is something wrong with your society

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.902
they will run to kill us.

00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:44.746
Now they think that this is wrong, let us get rid of it.

00:43:45.033 --> 00:43:49.886
In this way, purity of one's own life

00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:54.182
One who is such a great human being

00:43:54.222 --> 00:44:00.471
he purifies all his own society and his country.

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:04.150
He doesn't think, Why should he do?

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:06.456
Why should he do this clearing?

00:44:06.481 --> 00:44:08.981
I have got it and am sitting comfortably.

00:44:09.006 --> 00:44:12.620
I have got it and I shall now enjoy it.

00:44:12.763 --> 00:44:13.996
It is not like this.

00:44:14.021 --> 00:44:17.181
Such a person has got such a desire from his inner self

00:44:17.206 --> 00:44:19.052
because he becomes compassionate.

00:44:19.596 --> 00:44:22.481
I have got it, why not to give it to others.

00:44:22.506 --> 00:44:26.420
And because of that they work so hard that I am surprised

00:44:26.698 --> 00:44:30.820
In this way , those who became Sahajyogis helped ME.

00:44:31.416 --> 00:44:32.947
I cannot explain this.

00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:43.665
Another thing is that with the help of Sahajyoga our wisdom

00:44:45.587 --> 00:44:54.251
what we think that we are very intelligent

00:44:54.744 --> 00:44:57.184
Wisdom becomes balanced

00:44:57.209 --> 00:45:01.588
and you get Divine discretion.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.595
You know who is right and who is not

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.358
how much you must say, how much you must tell

00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:08.831
what should you say

00:45:09.347 --> 00:45:16.210
and whatever you do, its effect will be deep and wide spread.

00:45:16.907 --> 00:45:23.307
Somebody's gravity, individuality, for example I say

00:45:23.434 --> 00:45:29.465
universe, collectivity and to know oneself.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:34.710
And in this collectivity, he is a part of this universe.

00:45:34.735 --> 00:45:38.380
Then he understands what is this creation

00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:43.266
what is this mountain and what is this stream, what is this sea.

00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:50.944
After looking at it, he gets a spiritual feeling about it.

00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:57.267
And it can solve your ecological problems too.

00:45:57.292 --> 00:46:02.510
For example a human being uses such things which are man made

00:46:02.535 --> 00:46:04.618
which cleans this environment.

00:46:04.643 --> 00:46:06.555
There is no need to say

00:46:08.801 --> 00:46:11.494
and I found that people got their children (to ME)

00:46:11.653 --> 00:46:16.400
They are very dull, they don't study at all and like that.

00:46:16.425 --> 00:46:20.537
Those boys stood first. Not only this, they got scholarship.

00:46:20.967 --> 00:46:28.407
It sharpens your wisdom and along with that you get lot of wisdom

00:46:29.969 --> 00:46:31.708
I have seen children, they go to school

00:46:31.733 --> 00:46:33.123
till are not set in ( Sahajyoga)

00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:37.234
I don't like to eat this, I want that, do this , do that.

00:46:37.988 --> 00:46:40.796
After staying there for one year

00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:44.311
these children become so sensible

00:46:44.658 --> 00:46:45.918
so much sensible that

00:46:45.943 --> 00:46:49.172
parents are surprised what has happened to the children.

00:46:49.256 --> 00:46:50.086
We won't insist for anything.

00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:52.304
If there is a good television anywhere, we won't watch.

00:46:52.574 --> 00:46:54.643
We won't go anywhere, we will stay at home

00:46:54.668 --> 00:46:55.967
we will eat home made food.

00:46:56.593 --> 00:46:57.831
Oh! Say something!

00:46:57.856 --> 00:46:59.332
No we don't want anything.

00:46:59.357 --> 00:47:01.514
Ok! Let us watch flowers in the lawn.

00:47:01.704 --> 00:47:05.708
Either we can go to some cloth museum

00:47:05.733 --> 00:47:07.914
or to some zoo

00:47:08.054 --> 00:47:11.498
In this way children's temper changes

00:47:11.808 --> 00:47:16.049
and children respect everyone in an orderly manner.

00:47:16.588 --> 00:47:21.249
The greatest thing is that we don't respect anything now a days.

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:23.396
we don't respect our land

00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:27.379
because she is our mother, we don't respect Sun

00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:29.335
and the greatest thing is that

00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:33.335
we don't respect our parents, nor our culture.

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:36.881
Then we get awakened in Sahaj culture.

00:47:37.136 --> 00:47:39.842
It is a great new thing.

00:47:40.176 --> 00:47:42.377
In that a human being becomes moral.

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.385
He happens to be like that. We don't have to tell him.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:48.072
I don't tell anyone to be moral.

00:47:48.097 --> 00:47:49.871
He becomes absolutely moral.

00:47:49.896 --> 00:47:51.716
I have seen that those who use abusive language,

00:47:51.741 --> 00:47:53.496
get rid of the abusive words.

00:47:53.521 --> 00:47:56.161
Those who drink, give it up.

00:47:56.256 --> 00:48:01.119
Every type of immorality that we see in Kaliyuga, comes to end.

00:48:03.116 --> 00:48:08.026
This great benefit that is going to be in our society

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.023
can be with the help of Sahaj yoga.

00:48:10.048 --> 00:48:12.737
It cannot be by giving lectures.

00:48:13.174 --> 00:48:14.785
If you give lectures

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:19.830
morality cannot get awakened.

00:48:19.998 --> 00:48:23.660
The same thing I have seen with respect to religions.

00:48:23.685 --> 00:48:27.712
If you say in any religion that you do whatever you want to do

00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:29.958
have freedom like Christians.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.382
That has not allowed them to be moral.

00:48:33.435 --> 00:48:35.180
The other religions were like this

00:48:35.205 --> 00:48:36.894
don't do this , don't do that

00:48:36.919 --> 00:48:38.819
not to do like this, not to do like that.

00:48:38.994 --> 00:48:41.148
They are all the more immoral.

00:48:41.942 --> 00:48:43.711
They want to come stealthily.

00:48:44.247 --> 00:48:47.558
That morality awakens within

00:48:48.177 --> 00:48:51.562
and such a great moral society is created.

00:48:51.587 --> 00:48:53.910
Such people do not tell a lie.

00:48:54.347 --> 00:48:57.335
Such people do not grab money.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.358
Such people do not trouble anyone.

00:49:00.446 --> 00:49:03.251
Don't talk against anyone.

00:49:03.276 --> 00:49:06.608
Every time they think how to give them comfort.

00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:13.433
How to make them to get rid of their bad habits.

00:49:14.219 --> 00:49:17.450
All the time compassion flows on like this.

00:49:17.475 --> 00:49:22.121
And I didn't see many people, they got perfectly alright.

00:49:22.637 --> 00:49:24.152
This is the hard work of Sahajyogis

00:49:24.177 --> 00:49:25.648
because of which all this happened.

00:49:28.093 --> 00:49:34.302
It is this morality coming within us, we should say

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:39.314
that keeps the society organised.

00:49:39.838 --> 00:49:41.814
That disciplines the children

00:49:41.839 --> 00:49:47.398
The greatest thing is that your health improves.

00:49:47.423 --> 00:49:52.291
In the modern times if you see how many diseases are there

00:49:52.316 --> 00:49:55.116
these are mostly because of immorality.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.024
Now secondly, we should think

00:49:59.049 --> 00:50:01.348
that with respect to religion

00:50:02.325 --> 00:50:07.260
We should right now give preference to this

00:50:07.285 --> 00:50:11.495
that all the religions are dependant on spiritualism.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:13.743
Whichever religion it is

00:50:13.768 --> 00:50:17.521
whether it is Christian religion or Muslim religion

00:50:17.546 --> 00:50:19.520
Their predecessors

00:50:19.545 --> 00:50:23.060
nowhere they said that their religion is a separate religion.

00:50:23.085 --> 00:50:27.078
Now Muhammad Sahab never said

00:50:27.103 --> 00:50:30.402
that this religion is a separate one. He simply talked about Moses

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:35.329
talked about Ibraham, talked about Jesus (NOT CLEAR).

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.281
Talked about everyone

00:50:36.322 --> 00:50:39.075
Then He said that lacks of people are reborn.

00:50:39.425 --> 00:50:40.667
(INAUDIBLE)

00:50:40.692 --> 00:50:43.576
He also said that

00:50:45.484 --> 00:50:49.860
When twelfth (INAUDIBLE)

00:50:52.361 --> 00:50:58.483
then that will take you to the road of ascent

00:50:58.967 --> 00:51:01.201
He called that kiyama.

00:51:01.226 --> 00:51:03.714
So He said this about future.

00:51:03.739 --> 00:51:05.264
Like that Jesus Christ.

00:51:06.634 --> 00:51:11.570
HE also talked about Moses, Abraham and about all others

00:51:11.595 --> 00:51:13.455
And when HE was hanging on the cross

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:15.368
HE had said,"Behold the Mother."

00:51:15.393 --> 00:51:17.368
HE talked about Mother

00:51:18.051 --> 00:51:20.483
He also did not make any such religion that

00:51:20.508 --> 00:51:22.914
it is My religion different from Other's religion.

00:51:22.939 --> 00:51:23.942
Showed like this

00:51:23.967 --> 00:51:26.974
that one after the other Dharmas were there in the world.

00:51:28.807 --> 00:51:31.255
But even then people separated the religions.

00:51:31.985 --> 00:51:33.882
This is not the reality

00:51:34.963 --> 00:51:39.351
The essence of every religion is just one.

00:51:39.673 --> 00:51:44.458
The aim is just one that your rebirth should take place

00:51:44.625 --> 00:51:48.795
and your spirit should get enlightened.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:52.483
This is the essence of it.

00:51:52.508 --> 00:51:56.407
I would like to say that those who talk about secularism

00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:59.049
they should follow Gandhiji's secularism.

00:52:00.557 --> 00:52:03.373
Gandhiji from the beginning

00:52:03.398 --> 00:52:06.278
the mantras that he has written in his Bhajnawali

00:52:06.904 --> 00:52:09.757
they are all about Kundalini.

00:52:09.782 --> 00:52:16.359
First he talked about heart because He said in heart

00:52:16.384 --> 00:52:19.133
(NOT CLEAR)

00:52:19.158 --> 00:52:21.768
that which is felt inside my heart

00:52:21.793 --> 00:52:24.117
is ATMA TATVA..............

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:27.231
after that from Shree Ganesha

00:52:27.256 --> 00:52:30.750
those who are separate dieties in different chakras

00:52:30.815 --> 00:52:34.429
one after the other starts the names of all Gods

00:52:35.191 --> 00:52:38.846
Along with this HE talked about kuran

00:52:38.871 --> 00:52:43.424
Then talked about Buddha's "Buddham Sharnam Gachchami" etc.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:47.463
Next Lord's prayer of Christians

00:52:47.488 --> 00:52:49.618
spread even of Mahavira

00:52:49.643 --> 00:52:53.083
and all the people whether he may be a Muslim, Hindu or a Christian

00:52:53.108 --> 00:52:58.137
who lived in their Ashram and would come there

00:52:58.162 --> 00:53:00.681
Everyone respected all of these

00:53:00.706 --> 00:53:06.495
would recite the name of all of these and worship them.

00:53:07.709 --> 00:53:11.390
Now it is that the meaning of secularism is

00:53:11.533 --> 00:53:12.663
I can't understand.

00:53:12.688 --> 00:53:16.017
Because somewhere some dharma, at other places the other dharma.

00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:18.138
We think that in foreign countries, there is secularism

00:53:18.163 --> 00:53:19.520
It is not so at all.

00:53:19.545 --> 00:53:23.865
In France it is absolutely, they say

00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:30.869
France is the eldest daughter of our Catholic Church

00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:33.793
Some where there are Catholic Churches

00:53:33.818 --> 00:53:35.338
and at other places there are protestants

00:53:35.537 --> 00:53:40.227
and  where there is no other religion, for example Islamic religion.

00:53:40.663 --> 00:53:43.836
All of them exist independantly.

00:53:43.861 --> 00:53:45.367
For example, a different religion of theirs

00:53:45.392 --> 00:53:46.499
a different religion of others

00:53:46.524 --> 00:53:48.558
a different religion of still others, it is not so.

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.369
Now the misunderstandings that are in our country

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:53.211
because the most imortant point is that

00:53:53.236 --> 00:53:55.007
in our house we adhere to Hindu Dharma.

00:53:55.114 --> 00:53:59.153
In Hindu Dharma it has never been talked about.

00:53:59.561 --> 00:54:01.890
First of all castiesm is not a good thing.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.171
because that which has been said in casteism

00:54:06.322 --> 00:54:08.532
for the Devi it has been said

00:54:08.557 --> 00:54:13.157
YA DEVI SARVA BHTESHU JATI RUPEN SANSTHITA

00:54:13.185 --> 00:54:18.530
Jati means your liking,your aptitude

00:54:18.633 --> 00:54:20.085
that Jati

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.280
now try to understand

00:54:21.343 --> 00:54:25.783
if you are in search of God you are a Brahmin

00:54:26.288 --> 00:54:30.886
and if you want to rule you are a KHATRIYA

00:54:30.911 --> 00:54:35.899
and if you want to do business you are a BANIYA

00:54:35.924 --> 00:54:41.808
and those who want to earn money by serving others are SHUDRAS.

00:54:41.983 --> 00:54:45.921
But this Jati was according to karmas earlier

00:54:45.946 --> 00:54:48.232
and not according to birth.

00:54:48.257 --> 00:54:53.185
Do you see anyone who says that I am in search of Bramha.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.626
I have not seen such a Bramhin.

00:54:55.313 --> 00:54:57.773
They are ruling as Brahmins.

00:54:57.828 --> 00:55:00.156
They are KHATRIYAS. They are not Brahmins.

00:55:00.641 --> 00:55:06.514
In this way I am going to give you proof of casteism

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.894
When Shri Ram went to jungle

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:15.174
Shabri , an old woman had very few teeth

00:55:15.199 --> 00:55:21.254
tasted each piece of berry gave these to Shri Ram

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:27.555
Shri Ram said: Oh! how sweet and nice these are!

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:32.656
He took berries and started eating. He said this is just Amrit!

00:55:32.885 --> 00:55:38.581
His wife said I should also get some share as I am your better half.

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:39.623
But Laxmanji was getting very angry

00:55:39.648 --> 00:55:43.638
that this old lady is touching the berries to her teeth

00:55:43.663 --> 00:55:45.080
and feeding ( SHREE RAM)

00:55:45.626 --> 00:55:49.171
(Bhini si) means SHUDRA (Low Caste)

00:55:49.196 --> 00:55:54.607
Then His wife Sitaji said: How nice these berries are!

00:55:54.632 --> 00:55:56.699
Laxmanji said: Give me too some.

00:55:56.802 --> 00:55:58.289
Why shall I give, you are getting angry?

00:55:58.527 --> 00:56:00.071
He said : Plz give me some.

00:56:00.096 --> 00:56:03.641
After taking these he said :These are just like AMRUT.

00:56:04.123 --> 00:56:07.286
This is an example of Shri Ram Chanderji

00:56:07.311 --> 00:56:11.749
that HE would not give importance to SHUDRA (caste system)etc.

00:56:11.774 --> 00:56:14.730
Then Ramayan was written by Balmiki ji

00:56:14.755 --> 00:56:17.412
who was a fisherman

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.215
and then he was a robber.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.247
and then you must be knowing his story very well

00:56:23.272 --> 00:56:24.815
how he became a saint.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.815
He asked him to write Ramayana.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.283
Didn't he get anyone else?

00:56:29.475 --> 00:56:34.282
It was to prove that a human being's caste

00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:36.885
is according to his KARMA (PROFESSION)

00:56:37.469 --> 00:56:40.056
Then have a look at Shri Krishna. He too is an unusual personality

00:56:40.372 --> 00:56:43.360
that He would go to Vidhur's house to have his simple food

00:56:43.385 --> 00:56:46.102
and He didn't take fruit at Duryodan's house.

00:56:46.229 --> 00:56:52.296
because Duryodan, whatever he considered himself was an evil person.

00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:56.486
and whose veg he would take

00:56:56.511 --> 00:56:57.903
was after all the son of a female slave.

00:56:58.863 --> 00:57:00.699
He would have his food at the house of the son of a female slave

00:57:01.041 --> 00:57:02.838
because He was a realised soul.

00:57:02.863 --> 00:57:05.137
He would take his food at Vidhur's house

00:57:05.162 --> 00:57:07.337
but He would not take at Duryodan's house

00:57:07.362 --> 00:57:09.532
and then His too

00:57:10.024 --> 00:57:12.139
and even about Krishna,

00:57:12.164 --> 00:57:14.060
who has written?

00:57:14.085 --> 00:57:17.725
Gita is a wonderful compilation.

00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:24.282
that Vyas ji, it should be said that

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:30.324
he was an illegitimate or illegal child.

00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:35.095
He wrote Shri Krishna's Gita.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:41.393
It proves they wanted to prove that caste system is useless.

00:57:41.617 --> 00:57:43.950
but we do not understand all this.

00:57:44.343 --> 00:57:48.505
Even now we talk about cast, this and that.

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.566
And whatever karma we do

00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:54.780
never think that this is our caste, we belong to this caste.

00:57:55.165 --> 00:57:58.078
It is nowhere in the world.

00:57:58.103 --> 00:58:00.006
This is the quality of our country.

00:58:00.248 --> 00:58:04.174
Now because of this casteism so many conflicts have come up.

00:58:04.301 --> 00:58:09.666
We got so many Harijans of this country married in foreign countries.

00:58:10.016 --> 00:58:11.746
People in foreign countries  don't know anything.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.568
Harijan they think, means people of Hari.

00:58:14.593 --> 00:58:17.753
They hold them in high esteem and have lot of respect for them.

00:58:17.778 --> 00:58:23.637
But still we are infested with this thought that he is a Harijan.

00:58:23.987 --> 00:58:28.996
Now they have accepted Buddh Dharma, still they are Harjans.

00:58:30.117 --> 00:58:37.762
Next, within the Dharma too there are so many disputes

00:58:38.285 --> 00:58:40.387
they will quarrel inside a mosque

00:58:40.412 --> 00:58:42.902
they will quarrell for the statue of Parsavnath.

00:58:42.927 --> 00:58:45.564
Wherever you go, Dharma means to quarrell.

00:58:45.819 --> 00:58:47.556
There will be a dispute between Shias and Sunis

00:58:47.715 --> 00:58:49.107
How can that be?

00:58:49.132 --> 00:58:52.384
If dharma is one, why your disputes?

00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:58.445
Now we should think that there is some fault in it.

00:58:58.561 --> 00:58:59.224
That in this way

00:58:59.249 --> 00:59:03.201
we are fighting in the name of Dharma, in the name of God

00:59:04.424 --> 00:59:07.292
How is it possible? It is impossible.

00:59:07.372 --> 00:59:09.784
It means that we are away from God.

00:59:10.038 --> 00:59:14.548
We are not closer to God. If a human being understands this

00:59:14.573 --> 00:59:17.446
God's work is to give love

00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:19.564
have to bring together everybody

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:21.603
have to essemble everybody in Samashti (COLLECTIVITY).

00:59:21.628 --> 00:59:23.360
All these disputes will be over.

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.058
But it cannot be with the help of wisdom

00:59:25.344 --> 00:59:27.549
The work done by wisdom

00:59:27.574 --> 00:59:31.371
goes on and on and on  from here with thoughts

00:59:31.396 --> 00:59:32.587
and then returns back.

00:59:32.612 --> 00:59:36.333
There is no truth in it. What's the basis to support it?

00:59:36.419 --> 00:59:40.074
But the thought of Atma is spread all over.

00:59:41.582 --> 00:59:43.247
Now it is going on spreading.

00:59:43.272 --> 00:59:46.641
It doesn't have any apprehension of falling down.

00:59:47.611 --> 00:59:50.632
Because of this we see that the Dharma

00:59:50.657 --> 00:59:52.765
people have made out of their minds,

00:59:52.790 --> 00:59:55.823
one should say, made a system of it

00:59:55.848 --> 00:59:58.117
and made its repurcussions.

00:59:58.156 --> 01:00:01.484
That has caused notions about Dharma

01:00:01.603 --> 01:00:03.623
and has twisted and returned back again.

01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:05.853
It is called 'Bhoomrang' in English.

01:00:05.878 --> 01:00:08.489
In this way it has mesmerrised a human being.

01:00:09.798 --> 01:00:11.849
But now they are fighting and quarrelling.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.976
It should not be so in our country.

01:00:15.155 --> 01:00:17.986
Don't know how many saints and sages must have been here

01:00:18.011 --> 01:00:22.240
and never did any saint talk like this.

01:00:23.602 --> 01:00:29.867
Some time there were Brahmins, there were Shudras too

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:32.131
and there were many types of casts as well.

01:00:32.425 --> 01:00:38.651
But one saint respects another saint  with love.

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:40.962
It can happen only when you are a real saint.

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.484
Then you will have respect towards another person

01:00:45.588 --> 01:00:47.620
then your questions will be over.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:51.985
If I will say a little bit at the end

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:56.260
in Maharashtra there was a poet named Nam Dev

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:59.148
whom Guru Nanak also recognised

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:05.090
and another  saint was a potter.

01:01:06.762 --> 01:01:09.694
Namdev went to meet him.

01:01:11.246 --> 01:01:12.599
He went to see him.

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:15.019
On seeing him, he stood up immediately.

01:01:15.044 --> 01:01:17.424
In Marathi he said

01:01:17.786 --> 01:01:20.296
NIRGUNA CHA BETI ALO SAGUNA SANGHEY

01:01:20.321 --> 01:01:23.808
I had come to see NIRGUNA in you, Chaitanya in you

01:01:23.967 --> 01:01:24.967
SAGUNA is standing in front of me.

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:28.891
One saint is saying to another saint.

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:31.971
saints have always respected saints.

01:01:31.996 --> 01:01:34.026
Among Muslims those who are Sufis

01:01:34.074 --> 01:01:40.323
Hazrat Muhammad Nizamudin Sahab, then Khusro Sahab

01:01:40.616 --> 01:01:41.921
Mouddin Sahab

01:01:41.946 --> 01:01:43.457
In this way everywhere

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.417
I have seen Sufis

01:01:48.127 --> 01:01:53.965
they are in Erussia and are in Turkey.

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:56.536
And in Turkey there were some old Sufis.

01:01:56.561 --> 01:02:03.752
They said that Shri Mataji's work is greater than that of Fatima B.

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:05.428
Now they will recognise ME.

01:02:05.453 --> 01:02:08.499
Now they are no more in this world but his disciples recognise ME.

01:02:08.524 --> 01:02:10.546
In this way, in every family

01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:13.737
such were saints and sages, in every dharma.

01:02:13.762 --> 01:02:15.416
there was no such dharma.

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.650
And they all think that

01:02:18.063 --> 01:02:25.653
all the religions are the out come of one tree of spiritualism.

01:02:26.194 --> 01:02:27.593
And they don't have this question

01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:31.033
because we are in darkness and don't know

01:02:31.058 --> 01:02:34.641
and  we quarrell in this darkness, in this ignorance.

01:02:34.666 --> 01:02:38.172
This problem  instantly gets over in Sahajyoga

01:02:38.355 --> 01:02:42.572
Not only this if the dispute of various Dharmas is over

01:02:42.819 --> 01:02:43.819
but the countries

01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:49.077
the countries which once were our enemies

01:02:49.102 --> 01:02:51.732
are friendly in Sahajyoga today.

01:02:51.979 --> 01:02:56.253
Everywhere Iranians, Pakistanis

01:02:56.278 --> 01:02:58.241
poeple have come from far off countries

01:02:58.384 --> 01:03:00.565
I am so surprised to find

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:01.701
how much they have progressed

01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:04.197
and how they have evolved to this stage.

01:03:04.428 --> 01:03:08.133
In this way what we call national integration

01:03:08.405 --> 01:03:10.813
it cannot be done by force.

01:03:11.345 --> 01:03:14.084
It cannot be done by making to understand or by giving lectures.

01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:17.271
With the help of  inner transformation, it takes place on its own.

01:03:17.507 --> 01:03:22.200
No need to say anything!
