1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:06,803
Actually Christians do not know anything about His becoming.

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:11,076
How He became Christ or what was the need

3
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:14,625
to have Christ or a son to come down.

4
00:00:14,696 --> 00:00:16,854
Why not God Himself could do the job.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,390
And this is the reason why I would request you to read

6
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:24,777
for yourself the incarnation of

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,375
Maha Vishnu by which you realize why Christ was born.

8
00:00:30,053 --> 00:00:33,914
And it is the most important incarnation

9
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:39,323
because He is the principle.

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:43,917
He is the principle of creation.

11
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:47,269
The Tattwa as they call it in Sanskrit language.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,450
He is the tattwa.

13
00:00:49,157 --> 00:00:52,349
Ganesha, who resides in the Mooladhara

14
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:58,440
gradually evolves to be Christ at this stage.

15
00:00:59,224 --> 00:01:04,963
From that red Chakra up to this Chakra He became the Christ.

16
00:01:06,865 --> 00:01:11,689
He is the principle. Now what is the principle?

17
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,490
Within us what is our principle?

18
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:20,043
Is say the Kundalini you can say?

19
00:01:21,162 --> 00:01:24,491
In this the electricity is the principle of this one is.

20
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,007
In the same way the creation,

21
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:30,667
the whole creation if you take it as such,

22
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:35,338
it is the principle and the support of this creation.

23
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:46,515
He represents, He represents the essence,

24
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,869
the essence of creation.

25
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:52,191
Like we can say we have a family,

26
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:55,138
husband and wife and the child.

27
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:59,788
Now the child is the essence of husband and wife.

28
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:05,374
He is the essence of the family, of the house.

29
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:11,256
The whole thing is sustained for him, is created for him.

30
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,861
Till they did not have the child

31
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:18,160
there was no meaning to that house,

32
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,786
no meaning to their life.

33
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,801
But when they had a child

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,118
then they had a meaning.

35
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,062
In the same way Christ is the essence,

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,820
is the tattwa itself.

37
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,802
He’s the Omkara as they call it.

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,193
He is the first sound,

39
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,097
first sound that was created AUM

40
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:40,952
when the Primordial Father and Primordial Mother separated,

41
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:42,714
They created this sound.

42
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:44,529
And He is that sound

43
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:48,090
which is filled into All-Pervading Power

44
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:52,491
and looks after and supports,

45
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,972
actually it is more the support

46
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,249
because looking after is done by the Father

47
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,627
you can say or by the Mother.

48
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:02,312
But is the support of all the universe.

49
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:10,364
And because He is just the essence, the essence never dies.

50
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:15,782
Say My essence is My Spirit,

51
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,523
it will never die.

52
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,840
The body dies or the creation will die

53
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,151
but the essence has to be there.

54
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,486
If the essence is lost then nothing could be there

55
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:31,025
that’s why He is the most important incarnation.

56
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:33,218
Because He is the support.

57
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:39,942
Now this incarnation is placed in this Agnya Chakra of ours.

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,968
Here in the center where

59
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,635
the optic nerve or optic thalamus cross each other like this.

60
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,941
In the center is a very subtle point

61
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:52,912
which moves both the sides like this and like that

62
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:58,576
and it creates two sounds Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham, Ham Ksham.

63
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,877
Ham is on the right hand side where you have seen

64
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,433
the superego is there

65
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:13,162
and Ksham is on the left hand side where the ego is.

66
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,260
Now these two sounds create

67
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,653
two kinds of vibrations.

68
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:28,344
The Ham sound creates the vibrations,

69
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,144
which make you think, “I am, I am.

70
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:34,307
Ham, I am.”

71
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,971
This comes from our existence power

72
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,082
that we know we have to live in this world,

73
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:41,577
we’re not going to die.

74
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:45,604
Any human being who tries to kill himself is abnormal.

75
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:48,769
Normally every human being,

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,794
why every animal or any living thing tries to retain its life.

77
00:04:55,158 --> 00:04:58,578
That is through this power of Ham that I am.

78
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,478
Now the superego on the left hand side

79
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:04,098
and the ego on the right hand side is Ksham.

80
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,905
But now I’ll tell you about the right hand side superego.

81
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:15,963
In this superego when you are

82
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:21,176
conditioned by so many things, then you are frightened

83
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,951
and you are worried because these experiences

84
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:30,762
make you that type of a person which has fear in the mind.

85
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:34,600
And this fear is all settled in your superego.

86
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,636
This starts from your amoeba stage you can say

87
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:40,257
and is still today is being stored there.

88
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,791
You are afraid of police, you are afraid of that,

89
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:43,920
you are afraid of this.

90
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,052
Some people are not afraid of these things

91
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,604
but are afraid of something else.

92
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,793
Because whatever have been your conditions,

93
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,796
whatever have been your experiences

94
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,860
are all put down here.

95
00:05:57,188 --> 00:05:59,905
Moreover when somebody reads the book of “Dracula”

96
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:01,586
now he’s afraid of the word Dracula

97
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:03,296
but the children who do not read

98
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:05,009
they do not know what is a Dracula is.

99
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:06,458
If you say Dracula has come they say

100
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,862
all right lets have a look at him.

101
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,687
But those children have read about Dracula,

102
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:13,068
they are literally frightened and

103
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:14,769
they say, “Oh God, Dracula is coming,

104
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,174
something terrible is going to happen.”

105
00:06:16,645 --> 00:06:18,432
So you see whatever you have read,

106
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:20,155
whatever you have gone through

107
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,029
whatever experiences you have had

108
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,562
all is in the superego.

109
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:32,844
So this superego in that this center sends message,

110
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:37,603
I am, you are, you are Ham, Ham don’t be afraid,

111
00:06:37,685 --> 00:06:39,179
don’t be afraid, you are.

112
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:43,523
So the people who come to Me, and you have seen

113
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:46,631
some people who come to Me are victims of

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,875
superego conditioning.

115
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:50,457
And these are the people,

116
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:53,514
actually at this stage only you can really discriminate

117
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:54,702
between the two types.

118
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:56,652
One who are very aggressive,

119
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:59,106
the other who are absolutely

120
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,110
we should say subordinated, frightened.

121
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:08,677
These people when they come to Me

122
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,733
I have seen, they go on crying and weeping,

123
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,986
“Mother you know this has happened that has happened,” and

124
00:07:14,106 --> 00:07:16,470
I really get tired talking to them.

125
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:19,769
And there are so many of this kind

126
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,018
that really you have to

127
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,951
pay attention to them as Sahaja Yogis

128
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:26,459
because you’ll have to deal with them, how to,

129
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,587
how to manage them and how to work it out.

130
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,320
Now at that time if a Sahaja yogi says,

131
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:35,464
now you go on saying Ham, Ham, Ham, Ham,

132
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,456
a Sahaja Yogi if he says

133
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:40,347
then the vibrations will drive out his fear.

134
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,210
Even if you are under any fear

135
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,015
and you are walking around and you feel that there’s

136
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,788
frightened, you just say Ham, Ham, Ham.

137
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:52,722
Now with this saying the vibrations will clear out

138
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,353
this side very nicely.

139
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:59,122
Apart from that, that is the way you can get help

140
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:01,359
from the Divine by saying Ham.

141
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,783
Now there are many things about Ham and Ksham but

142
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,284
as the time is you know,

143
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:09,081
so I do not want to go into great details about it.

144
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:10,708
But I would say the mantra

145
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,051
for the right hand side is Ham

146
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,401
and for the left hand side is Ksham.

147
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:19,854
The right hand side is the ego,

148
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:23,061
which is real problem, you understand that,

149
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:27,370
is a real colossal one you have to face them, I mean.

150
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:30,965
I say anything small here and there I find the whole thing

151
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:32,978
coming up onto my head like that.

152
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:36,594
So what is the solution for a colossal ego?

153
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:43,864
Colossal ego can only be conquered by forgiving others.

154
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,243
Those who have ego must learn

155
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:51,773
if they feel hurt they must say, “forgive.”

156
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,730
Then another person hurts them, say, “forgive.”

157
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:59,724
And not only forgive but ask for forgiveness.

158
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,427
Both things should be done, more asking for forgiveness.

159
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,707
You have to ask for forgiveness if you have too much of ego.

160
00:09:07,749 --> 00:09:08,938
It is very important.

161
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:12,265
Because if you have too much of ego means what?

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
That you have pampered it too much.

163
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,251
That means you have used it too much.

164
00:09:17,592 --> 00:09:19,592
You have dominated people

165
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:22,089
and that’s why you have such a lot of ego.

166
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:24,475
If you have such a lot of ego

167
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:28,155
you must all the time try to humble down in your heart.

168
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:31,048
Now in the heart resides the Spirit.

169
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:35,358
The ego, too much of ego in a person

170
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,193
always takes you away from that Spirit.

171
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,849
That’s why it is said, “Humble down in your heart.”

172
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,225
The reason is, in the heart

173
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,795
resides that part of yours which gets completely obliterated

174
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:53,286
or forgotten once you start pumping up your ego.

175
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:59,108
But ego has its limits, it ends up into stupidity and foolishness.

176
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,911
You take any person who is egoistical

177
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,120
and who’s blowing his own trumpet.

178
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,285
You will immediately know because he’ll be stupid.

179
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:13,135
Without understanding what he’s doing

180
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:15,289
he’ll be doing such stupid things

181
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,084
that you will start wondering, especially children,

182
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,024
“What’s the matter with this fellow, he is quite funny?”

183
00:10:23,194 --> 00:10:25,953
And then the stupidity you see faces the person

184
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:28,289
then he sees for himself, “Oh God!

185
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,380
how did I become so stupid?”

186
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,142
The stupidity comes to you because

187
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,452
you forget the existence of God

188
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,118
and your relationship with the whole.

189
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:42,510
You think, “I am on my own.

190
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,682
Why should I not do this?

191
00:10:45,306 --> 00:10:46,577
What is wrong in this,

192
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:48,317
what is wrong in that?

193
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:49,826
I should do these things.”

194
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:53,009
I mean in this country the way people are fighting for things.

195
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:57,639
I mean you must, anybody I mean, those so-called developing countries

196
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:01,921
can’t understand what kind of a thing happening to these people.

197
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,759
Because the other day My son-in-law Lav was reading

198
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,521
an article that people are demanding now that

199
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:12,442
the son-in-law should be allowed to marry the mother-in-law.

200
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,249
And he just couldn’t understand how can people gather together

201
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:20,027
and ask for such an absurd thing like that. She is your mother.

202
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:21,570
How can you say that way?

203
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:24,155
I mean it is something an impossibility

204
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,409
for people, normal people to think like that.

205
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:28,577
That a son-in-law

206
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:29,846
can marry the mother-in-law.

207
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:31,624
And what is there to make a law about it

208
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:34,176
and to talk about it. It’s a very difficult thing.

209
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:38,050
All kinds of stupid things we are doing in this country,

210
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,458
which really makes everybody roar with laughter.

211
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:46,997
Is because of our Mr. Ego companionship.

212
00:11:47,592 --> 00:11:51,129
It is not easy to understand how he befools us.

213
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,328
It goes on befooling us all the time

214
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,107
and then we think what’s wrong?

215
00:11:56,426 --> 00:11:58,144
An eighty-year-old man

216
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,925
running after a twenty-year-old girl.

217
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,077
And the twenty-year-old girl befooling this

218
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,035
eighty-year-old man, supposed to be a statesman this, that

219
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,831
and his statue is erected somewhere there.

220
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,618
How is it possible?

221
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:18,934
It is only the ego makes you do all these nonsensical and

222
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:19,865
stupid things.

223
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,775
Once you are in Sahaja Yoga

224
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,599
you don’t know how to control your laughter sometimes the way

225
00:12:24,768 --> 00:12:26,269
people are foolish.

226
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,964
Extremely foolish.

227
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,830
And this is what it is; it ends up in stupidity absolute stupidity.

228
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,502
I mean even if you want to write a novel

229
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,761
you won’t get such beautiful characters

230
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,254
as you could around you, when you listen to them.

231
00:12:41,281 --> 00:12:43,333
And you’re shocked, Oh God what’s this going on

232
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,166
and very embarrassing too.

233
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:51,813
Extremely embarrassing and they become so foolish

234
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:59,528
with their ego that one cannot understand how thinking man,

235
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,813
because by thinking you get your ego,

236
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,619
becomes foolish.

237
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:07,022
There is no wisdom

238
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:11,250
in a person whose ego is completely developed like that.

239
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:15,696
If somebody has an ego like that there is no wisdom in him.

240
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,674
You can see that he does not know what is wisdom.

241
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:22,059
He behaves in such an immature way.

242
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,581
He may be an elderly man, great grandfather of

243
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,957
somebody but as soon as he opens his mouth you are shocked at him.

244
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:31,053
You think from where this joker has come?

245
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,852
The maturity is completely lacking.

246
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,818
The other day somebody told Me that,

247
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:41,597
“Mother how is it our parents are so stupid and we are searching God?

248
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:47,025
And the elderly people are so foolish and we are searching God?”

249
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,946
And then I said, “No, maybe because of war

250
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:51,615
the parents are disturbed, you see”.

251
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,716
Most of the parents were disturbed during war

252
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,396
and they said, “Majority of them are like this.

253
00:13:56,975 --> 00:14:00,023
And the younger people are searching God and much wiser

254
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,099
and we don’t know how to compromise with them

255
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:03,557
because they are not searching God.

256
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:07,310
Why is it they are not searching God and we are searching God?

257
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,432
And if there are some searching, they are very few.”

258
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,087
Now I said this may be due to war but somebody said,

259
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:15,616
“Then what about America? You see,

260
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,113
in America the people didn’t face war so much,

261
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,428
the stupidity that they have is sometimes surprising.”

262
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:26,684
That is the same thing as I said,

263
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,968
is the development of ego in a human being.

264
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:35,593
Now ego is the thing that makes you think about everything.

265
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:37,537
For example, now

266
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:42,033
we have to, say go from here to Birmingham, all right.

267
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,928
So we think now how will I go?

268
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:48,058
Simple way is that I’ll take a train or I’ll

269
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,924
take a car and go away.

270
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,795
If there’s no reservation needed I will

271
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,071
just jump into the train or going by the car.

272
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,998
If the car is available I’ll go by car

273
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:57,112
or by train finished.

274
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,686
What is there to think about?

275
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:00,677
But no,

276
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,763
then we must plan it out, “I’m programmed now I have to go”.

277
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,716
You go to the station and find the train is not there

278
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,165
because there was some accident so the train is not moving.

279
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:13,637
So you are absolutely upset because

280
00:15:13,776 --> 00:15:15,697
you think that the train has gone now what to do.

281
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,935
In that upsetting you do not even remember that

282
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,797
you have a car and you have to go by the car.

283
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,255
Now that whole things upsets you because you had plans

284
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:28,325
to go by train and you had planned everything, now you

285
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,165
cannot reach there and what will happen?

286
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:34,297
Now you are sitting here and worrying about it.

287
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:37,102
As a person who is spontaneous what will you do?

288
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,088
All right depends on, I may go by train

289
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,219
or by car whatever I feel like at that time.

290
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:44,013
He is sitting tight.

291
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:46,086
So he goes to the train,

292
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,248
sees if the train is there. If it is, nicely

293
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:52,477
there’s a space available he gets into it.

294
00:15:52,766 --> 00:15:54,567
If the train is not available, all right,

295
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:56,651
he comes home takes his car and goes away.

296
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,871
So now you have informed the people that

297
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,345
you must meet at such and such a place.

298
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,779
That’s also is there you see.

299
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,253
So those people are running up down there

300
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,963
and they will be there at the station.

301
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,303
Now what’s the matter?

302
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,634
Even if they’re at the station you can meet them at the station.

303
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,716
You go by train and you can meet them.

304
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:14,780
What is there to be that much upset about it?

305
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,421
You see you can always contact them.

306
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,824
But the way we get upset we have spoiled

307
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,460
the complete program of going to Birmingham,

308
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:27,098
which is a very beautiful program that we have got.

309
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,781
We have to meet new people, we have to meet

310
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,834
many people, we have to enjoy ourselves.

311
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,365
That’s all finished

312
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,314
because we had planned something and it

313
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,806
did not work out, we are finished.

314
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:41,981
All these things make us a miserable person.

315
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:45,607
And we are so miserable and so grudging and

316
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:48,803
so boring that those who are next to you just get fed up

317
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:50,029
with it and they say,

318
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,156
“Now shut up.

319
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,726
If you are not going to Birmingham,

320
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,424
if you are not going don’t go. But don’t eat my head now”,

321
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,113
is a common experience of many.

322
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:05,796
If this Mr. Ego he’s so, he doesn’t want you to be happy.

323
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:10,295
He doesn’t want you to be relaxed.

324
00:17:10,498 --> 00:17:12,409
He all the time gives you ideas

325
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:14,532
and tells you, “Do this and do that

326
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,134
and you must get it done and this is to be done and You

327
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,479
had better inform that person,

328
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,808
be meticulous about it,”

329
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:21,952
and it will go to such details

330
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,227
that anything fails you are finished

331
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,946
because your nerves are already finished and shattered.

332
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:32,331
Anything, even a drop of inconvenience comes into you

333
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:36,840
or even a feather of disturbance is there, you are finished.

334
00:17:36,997 --> 00:17:40,453
And so everybody is rattling, ”We have tensions. We have problems.”

335
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:41,039
Why?

336
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:50,888
What is the advantage of doing all these things?

337
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,928
No advantage you know that. But then why do you do it?

338
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:56,806
Because you have a big ego. It won’t allow you to rest.

339
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:01,159
Whatever you may try it won’t. So what is the solution of that?

340
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:05,339
Morning till evening ask for forgiveness from God.

341
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,293
Pull your ears from both the sides

342
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:09,132
and say, “Oh God, forgive me.

343
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,114
Oh God, forgive me. And, oh God forgive me,”

344
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:14,214
so this balloon of ego goes down a little.

345
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:19,394
Remember Him morning, evening, every time.

346
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:23,886
Remembering Christ brings down your ego very much.

347
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,321
He did everything that was possible

348
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,601
that you should not develop your ego.

349
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:31,587
Everything that was possible.

350
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,694
He was born as an ordinary carpenter’s son.

351
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:38,703
Lived in the most ordinary conditions.

352
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:44,411
Kept Himself behind the whole scene.

353
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,605
He could have been born as Roman Emperor.

354
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,087
He could have been anybody there.

355
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,753
But no He was born Himself.

356
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,168
You know that He took his birth

357
00:18:56,412 --> 00:19:02,061
in a place where even ordinary people do not take their births.

358
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:05,770
But, there also the light was there.

359
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,901
Wherever He was born there was light and joy.

360
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,484
And this is the thing we have to know, that

361
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,089
we have lost the joy because we have forgotten God Almighty.

362
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:24,610
When we forget Him, that He is love and He is joy,

363
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,763
naturally joy is also forgotten.

364
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:30,238
And then we see people are not at all happy.

365
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,056
They have affluence, they have money, they have everything,

366
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,102
but still they are not happy.

367
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:38,916
All the time they are in such a mess

368
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,029
that you don’t know how to talk to them.

369
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,165
If you say this word they’ll be angry.

370
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,973
If you say that word they’ll be angry.

371
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,015
They are not at all normal human beings.

372
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,104
They are sick people.

373
00:19:50,171 --> 00:19:51,999
Sick with their ego.

374
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:56,684
It’s a very simple thing is to ask for forgiveness.

375
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,130
How many times do we do that?

376
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:06,170
Not even once a day, not even once a month, not even once a year.

377
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,651
Even on a Christmas day if we could say,

378
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,681
“Forgive us Oh Lord for whatever we have done so far.”

379
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,709
It will work out.

380
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:19,255
But that day we must champagne to forgive Him more.

381
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,184
So we must have gossips

382
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,781
and we must have

383
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:28,192
all the arrogant things by the time it is the end of Christmas.

384
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:35,393
This ego, yellow side one,

385
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:39,489
is the one that presses your superego too much. It does.

386
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:44,675
It presses it so much sometimes that a person forgets

387
00:20:45,068 --> 00:20:48,026
that others are hurt by what they talk.

388
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,620
On the contrary they devise methods

389
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:53,964
how to say things which are cutting,

390
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:59,101
which are hurting, which are painful to others.

391
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:03,191
They say such things, I mean all the time if you see.

392
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:06,055
A person say from a village if he comes and sees

393
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,641
he’ll think, are they quarreling, what are they doing?

394
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:10,103
I mean the whole discussion,

395
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,673
even in the parliament I was surprised

396
00:21:12,877 --> 00:21:17,066
the way they talked to each other, no bull will

397
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,902
treat another bull that way, see.

398
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:24,346
Even a dog normally does not bark at another dog.

399
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:30,015
No animal in the world all the time is barking at its fellow man.

400
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,662
No animal in the whole world I can tell you this much.

401
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:34,259
Only the human beings

402
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,104
if two people are there all the time they are going, ha ha ha ha

403
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:40,380
all the time that way. How is it possible?

404
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:45,228
His ego and her ego or maybe both his ego

405
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,011
are dashing at each other.

406
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:52,829
And there is a kind of a funny type

407
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:56,751
of feeling that oh I have mastered the thing,

408
00:21:57,297 --> 00:21:59,297
I have got the thing, I have got the point.

409
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,000
I have proved the point.

410
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:05,270
But in that I have lost everything that was so beautiful

411
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:08,004
and so much joy giving within me.

412
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:11,084
Actually a sensible person would recede

413
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:14,455
from the place where two people are having an argument.

414
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:18,980
Argument is a sign of tomfoolery.

415
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,575
I haven’t seen any argument coming to any end whatsoever.

416
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,572
If it is then it is all right.

417
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,232
But it never does come.

418
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:33,391
Because, if say, you ask Me questions I answer you, all right.

419
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:36,029
If you do not like the answer give it up.

420
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:39,652
But if you argue with Me still and I argue with you

421
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:40,819
where will you end?

422
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,987
Argument is not going to lead you to any knowledge

423
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:49,789
but a very terrible ego developing into you.

424
00:22:50,858 --> 00:22:55,372
The whole modern concept is ego oriented.

425
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,394
All western countries are ego orientated.

426
00:22:59,775 --> 00:23:02,086
They want to develop your ego and pamper it.

427
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,292
There are so many other ways by which they do.

428
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:06,925
Why I’m talking more about it because we are all

429
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:09,835
supposed to be western people and affluent people you see.

430
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:12,403
Supposed to be very wise and leading

431
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:15,156
or misleading, I don’t know, the developing countries.

432
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,140
So we have to understand ourselves where are we

433
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,108
as far as our understanding of things are concerned.

434
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:26,646
How ego is pampered within us is by a large-scale method.

435
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:31,288
They work on your ego throughout to have all these

436
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,183
so-called enterprises.

437
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,126
For example to a woman they’ll say,

438
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:37,736
“Oh you must have a waist like this and you must

439
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,466
have a face like this and you must have –“

440
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,779
For a man, “You must this kind of a body.

441
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:45,411
You should be Mr. Universe or you should be something,”

442
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:47,654
so the man starts working on it immediately.

443
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,906
You must, there so many people I have seen

444
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,338
running on the roads in this cold, I don’t understand.

445
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:53,916
Like mad you know and some of

446
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,135
them are Member of Parliament.

447
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:56,734
The whole night they keep awake and the whole day

448
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,714
they are running about.

449
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,482
I say what are you doing?

450
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,097
What is the need to do this?

451
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,448
To keep good health you must do it.

452
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:06,222
To keep good health don’t work like mad,

453
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,559
be a sensible and a wise person.

454
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:13,765
Wisdom is to be sought to keep good health,

455
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:18,391
to be all right and not this kind of mad ego orientated things.

456
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,917
So then the one way is to excite your ego about your physique.

457
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,356
Then there is ego about, you must have a big car.

458
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,865
You see people try to show off their possessions.

459
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,093
You have a big car,

460
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:35,349
then they’re going about. I mean they really look to me like jokers,

461
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:36,321
that’s all they are.

462
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,189
I mean car I can understand is a convenience

463
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:42,132
and a good quality car if somebody can afford it should have it

464
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:45,053
because it is a headache to have a bad car. So it’s all right.

465
00:24:45,636 --> 00:24:48,222
But by having a car you become something great.

466
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,741
You may not have food in the house

467
00:24:49,777 --> 00:24:52,240
but you must have a very good car to go about.

468
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,131
And all these ideas come.

469
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,293
Then they will advertise, you see, this will

470
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:58,366
be a very good car for you.

471
00:24:58,547 --> 00:24:59,555
What is it for you?

472
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:02,244
It is nothing but to pamper your ego.

473
00:25:02,437 --> 00:25:04,464
All these advertisements are nothing

474
00:25:04,547 --> 00:25:06,821
but by which your ego is pampered.

475
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,651
All these things they’re treated.

476
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,605
Now in America if you go every handle has to be different.

477
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,875
Everything has to be different.

478
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,127
Why so much difference in everything?

479
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,961
Why do you want to have everything so different?

480
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:21,190
Is it some aesthetics, you think in that?

481
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:25,925
It is none of the aesthetics but is just to pamper your ego.

482
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,176
Even the so-called art connoisseurs

483
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,801
are nothing but ego pamperers.

484
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:33,281
Your stamp collections this, that,

485
00:25:33,354 --> 00:25:35,695
all this is nothing but ego pampering.

486
00:25:35,724 --> 00:25:38,615
And what a waste of time, you just think about it.

487
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:43,500
This ego thing comes into us

488
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,384
because we are first of all, as I said, that in the west

489
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,433
the living was very difficult.

490
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,764
They had to fight the nature.

491
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,905
And when you have to fight the nature

492
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,866
you have to develop your ego to fight it.

493
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:58,594
Or actually when you are fighting the nature

494
00:25:58,693 --> 00:25:59,838
the ego develops within you.

495
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,529
And then once that momentum has started in you

496
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,014
it is very difficult to bring it down.

497
00:26:06,234 --> 00:26:10,127
It is such a terrible disease that

498
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:14,249
people have taken it for granted that that’s a part of their lives.

499
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:17,553
You are not your ego. You are not.

500
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:21,597
When I say that you must surrender yourself to God

501
00:26:21,678 --> 00:26:23,678
they think Mother why should we surrender?

502
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:27,297
Yourself means that ego with which you are identified.

503
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,352
I don’t say that you surrender your wisdom.

504
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,372
Or I can say surrender your ego to your wisdom.

505
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,376
But it is so difficult to give it up because

506
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:42,046
we have learned to live with it, identified with it.

507
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:46,667
We just cannot think of life without our ego, we just cannot.

508
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:52,183
And it has gone to such an extent that we don’t even realize

509
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:55,608
how far we have gone in cruelty.

510
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,507
Like, “I like this kind, I like that kind.”

511
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:01,790
You go to somebody’s house and you say like this.

512
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:04,482
Is indecent to talk like that.

513
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:11,165
It is vulgar to express, “I like.” Who are you?

514
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:12,558
Are you God?

515
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,618
I want this. I want that.

516
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,258
I am very particular about this. I’m very, who are you?

517
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,012
Just ask yourself a question, “Who am I?

518
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,642
I’m the Spirit.

519
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,049
I’m that eternal being.

520
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,619
Have I become that?”

521
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:39,716
On the contrary we are hurting everybody’s Spirit by our ego.

522
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:44,861
Every moment when we talk to others we are hurting them.

523
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,918
Actually people have lost faith in God,

524
00:27:48,703 --> 00:27:52,269
because those who are in charge of God are so arrogant

525
00:27:52,851 --> 00:27:55,595
and so egoistical

526
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,894
that it has become impossible for anybody to think of God,

527
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
which is beyond your ego.

528
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:08,089
You’ll be surprised, ego is absolutely superficial like a bubble.

529
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,127
It is just like a balloon,

530
00:28:10,217 --> 00:28:12,198
which can burst just like that.

531
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:14,247
And it should go.

532
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:18,140
It should go so that you should rise.

533
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:24,616
It should disappear so that your attention rises in your Spirit.

534
00:28:24,963 --> 00:28:28,248
And that you see the whole world as a part

535
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:31,131
of that Spirit that you are.

536
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,613
This is the boundary, which you have to cross

537
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:37,464
and for that we have to take help from Christ.

538
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,939
Christ crucified himself. Why?

539
00:28:42,611 --> 00:28:43,757
Because what did He do?

540
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,902
Did He loot people?

541
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:50,862
Today you have thousands of these thugs coming here and looting you.

542
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:54,428
Nobody crucifies them. What did He do?

543
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,881
He just challenged the ego of these Romans

544
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:05,103
and of these Jews, those who were angry with Him,

545
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,159
and that’s why He was crucified.

546
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:14,713
And we have to crucify our ego now through His cross.

547
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:18,952
Otherwise we are going to do the same

548
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:24,790
again to ourselves that in our own being

549
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:28,324
we crucify our Christ by our ego.

550
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,268
It is a very symbolic gesture of Christ,

551
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:35,411
His birth in the most humble place,

552
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:37,167
in a very humble place.

553
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:41,091
He is born in the optic thalamus, you can say,

554
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:44,635
is the place where there brain, all activities coming and

555
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:49,616
all the, all sorts of problems there chasing you,

556
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,901
and there He lives and you have to just awaken Him there

557
00:29:54,984 --> 00:29:59,140
so that your ego is crucified once for all.

558
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:03,020
But I don’t think you fight your ego

559
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,368
because it is not that important to fight.

560
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,146
You are fighting with your shadow.

561
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:10,310
You have shadow which is called as ego

562
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:13,752
which is not to be fought and wasted you,

563
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,604
to waste your energy on him. Just no need to fight,

564
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:20,072
only thing if you stand in the center of the light

565
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:21,396
you don’t see any shadow.

566
00:30:21,512 --> 00:30:23,104
It is so simple as that.

567
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:26,784
If you stand in the center of light that is Christ

568
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,014
you don’t see any shadow anywhere.

569
00:30:29,065 --> 00:30:32,193
But when I say this I may sound like other people who give sermons,

570
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,379
“Stand in the shadow of Christ or stand in the light of Christ.”

571
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:37,352
Now what does that mean?

572
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:43,344
Where is that light or where is that place where you should stand?

573
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,913
That place is here in the center of your

574
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:53,497
optic thalamus where there is no thought.

575
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:56,986
You have to stand in thoughtless awareness.

576
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,888
Many people who have had a problem with Agnya,

577
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:03,017
many people who have come

578
00:31:03,044 --> 00:31:04,894
[Talk is interrupted here and a few words are missing]

579
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,510
…thoughts will stop and they will be beyond thought.

580
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:11,587
And this a very, very important Chakra

581
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,448
for Sahaja Yogis because when the Kundalini rises above,

582
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:19,856
above the Agnya Chakra immediately there is no thought.

583
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:24,575
You do not get any thoughts from ego or superego.

584
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:30,452
But there is wobbling in the Agnya because of your imbalanced ways.

585
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,075
And the imbalanced ways are,

586
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,069
that sometimes you are with ego or with superego.

587
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:39,239
This has happened to our people in the West

588
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,280
because we have had so much of ego we got really tired of it.

589
00:31:44,174 --> 00:31:45,383
We got frightened with it.

590
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,596
Then we started taking to drugs and things to increase our superego.

591
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:53,067
But by doing that what we are doing is

592
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:55,555
pushing by one end and bringing back another end

593
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,285
and that’s how we are wobbling

594
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,527
our ego and superego

595
00:31:59,724 --> 00:32:02,391
by which we are not helping ourselves at all.

596
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:04,986
So what one has to do

597
00:32:05,106 --> 00:32:08,177
is to rise within oneself up to the point of Agnya

598
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,292
and try to steady your Agnya.

599
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:13,383
There are many people have asked Me one question.

600
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,099
How to steady the Agnya?

601
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:22,651
Agnya is placed at the crossing point of our nerves

602
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,316
and also optic thalamus.

603
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:27,485
Now, so it is said that

604
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:30,492
if you have wobbling eyes you’ll have a wobbling Agnya.

605
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:32,806
You have to steady your eyes.

606
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:34,701
You have to soothe them.

607
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:40,773
Now it is very, very out of date, ancient, old

608
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:44,264
and all sorts of names that you call it to a thing like that.

609
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,537
But you must steady your eyes and

610
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,684
steady them in such a way that it is very soothing for the eyes.

611
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:54,876
Which is the most soothing thing for the eyes is the green grass.

612
00:32:56,956 --> 00:33:01,378
If you could see the green grass with your eyes means you walk

613
00:33:02,366 --> 00:33:04,354
with your eyes on the ground.

614
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,189
Your eyes will be soothed, your Agnya will be all right.

615
00:33:08,364 --> 00:33:10,203
That’s why Christ said that,

616
00:33:10,231 --> 00:33:13,504
“I tell you about the adulterous eyes”.

617
00:33:13,732 --> 00:33:15,801
He talked about adulterous eyes.

618
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,803
The eyes with which you do adultery.

619
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,032
Is a very common thing these days.

620
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,933
Every woman a man must see.

621
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,405
Every man a woman must see.

622
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,409
As if it is the most important job.

623
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:30,641
If you have not seen one woman you’re finished.

624
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,108
I mean this is being modern.

625
00:33:33,437 --> 00:33:35,356
But I am an old fashioned lady.

626
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:38,760
And at the time of Christ he said,

627
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,868
“You should not have adulterous eyes.”

628
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:43,787
And the ones who have adulterous eyes are,

629
00:33:44,568 --> 00:33:49,751
no more than any other, but our Western Christians.

630
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:54,249
Who all the time even in the church, even

631
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:57,444
when they’re giving sermons, their eyes are moving with adultery.

632
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:03,644
These eyes have to be very, very pure, very, very deep

633
00:34:03,756 --> 00:34:08,559
and very loving when you want to have your Agnya all right.

634
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,403
Because you receive through you eyes.

635
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,916
Say if you have closed your eyes

636
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:15,072
you do not put your attention to anything because

637
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,032
your eyes are closed.

638
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:18,583
You are not adding more thoughts to yourself.

639
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:22,045
But if your eyes are open you are adding much more thoughts

640
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,630
because everywhere the eyes go the attention goes

641
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:27,521
and you see things and create thoughts and put in them.

642
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:32,267
So your attention which has to go to the Spirit,

643
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:34,103
which has to go to God,

644
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:38,302
which has to shine through the window of Divine.

645
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:41,958
This beautiful thing is ruined by

646
00:34:42,307 --> 00:34:46,082
the way we use our eyes and we do not respect it.

647
00:34:47,682 --> 00:34:54,682
There’s nothing so pure and beautiful as the grass on the ground

648
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,987
or the ground itself, which takes our feet,

649
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:02,178
which supports us, which looks after us, enriches us.

650
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,937
We should put our eyes on the Mother Earth

651
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,915
instead of looking at every person.

652
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:11,437
But from Sahaja Yoga point of view now many of you know

653
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:13,911
what happens to your eyes  when you look at somebody.

654
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:18,270
Maybe a entity might enter your eyes.

655
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,488
And it is, you’ll be amazed

656
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:23,137
that it is the play of the entity

657
00:35:23,186 --> 00:35:25,390
what we call this so-called flirting is.

658
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:28,603
I’ve talked about it before also and people didn’t like it

659
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,213
when I told them about it.

660
00:35:30,888 --> 00:35:34,497
But I have seen actual entities entering from eyes to eyes.

661
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:38,884
I have seen very simple people who come down

662
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,272
to such places, say in a party.

663
00:35:41,784 --> 00:35:46,141
In a party people are just exchanging entities

664
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,373
from one eye to another.

665
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,162
Once it goes to another person

666
00:35:49,235 --> 00:35:51,010
he puts his entity into another person.

667
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:52,758
And that third goes into another person.

668
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:55,800
All the time your attention is diverted.

669
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:58,806
And you feel it is attracted towards something,

670
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,537
you do not know why it is attracted.

671
00:36:02,095 --> 00:36:04,433
Now the certain symbols are also made like that.

672
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:06,847
To add up to the problems,

673
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,872
you see all the society is working at it.

674
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:11,543
That you should appear in such a way that

675
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:12,757
every man should look at you.

676
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,013
Every woman should look at you.

677
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,575
Why? What is the use?

678
00:36:19,796 --> 00:36:21,931
Supposing I look at you what do I get?

679
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,456
What do I get by looking at a person?

680
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,247
What is the advantage just looking at a person?

681
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,046
We are wasting such a lot of energy for what?

682
00:36:34,794 --> 00:36:37,164
In the same way if you are walking on the roads,

683
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:41,589
we are seeing some beautiful things all right.

684
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:43,579
If you have to buy something, all right go ahead,

685
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:45,863
see those things, whatever you have to select is all right.

686
00:36:46,187 --> 00:36:50,005
But all the time just because your eyes are such,

687
00:36:50,029 --> 00:36:52,982
you are just doing it and you do not know the reason

688
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:54,914
why you are doing like this,

689
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:56,954
all the time why your eyes are wobbling.

690
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:02,462
And that is a sure and certain sign for a person to become mad.

691
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:08,420
Absolutely, that’s a sure and certain sign is,

692
00:37:08,474 --> 00:37:11,086
when a person is mad

693
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,709
how do you make it out that a person is lunatic.

694
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,809
If you see his eyes the iris in the eyes are all the time wobbling.

695
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:21,267
They cannot keep it steady.

696
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:24,634
Or they are sick they’re also, you can see,

697
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:28,372
that these eyes are all the time wobbling.

698
00:37:28,401 --> 00:37:29,329
There is no steadiness.

699
00:37:29,944 --> 00:37:32,532
Not only this but you have seen those people who

700
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,182
have come in the Sahaja Yoga when they close their eyes

701
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:38,987
they find their eyes are flickering.

702
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,501
Their eyelids are flickering.

703
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:42,951
That means there is some sort of a disturbance

704
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,338
in the Kundalini rising.

705
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:51,072
Whole tension if you call it as hundred

706
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:55,193
then at least eighty percent of it comes through our eyes.

707
00:37:57,897 --> 00:38:00,972
Then how important it is to protect our eyes

708
00:38:01,214 --> 00:38:04,508
from all kind of useless activities we are doing.

709
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:13,806
Christ - Christ’s life shows so many aspects

710
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:16,761
of how to respect others.

711
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:20,661
But one of them which has been very much misused throughout is

712
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:22,718
that of the prostitute.

713
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:29,712
He saved the prostitute, He saved her no doubt.

714
00:38:30,122 --> 00:38:33,239
But you spoil these prostitutes.

715
00:38:34,841 --> 00:38:37,942
A good woman you make her into prostitutes.

716
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:41,798
You give her ideas by which she becomes a prostitute.

717
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:43,385
A good Huswife (old English word like housewife)

718
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:47,226
is turned into a prostitute by an egotistical man.

719
00:38:47,887 --> 00:38:53,684
Young small girls who are virgins are being destroyed

720
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:56,470
by your dirty glances.

721
00:38:56,655 --> 00:38:58,436
Do you realize this?

722
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:01,711
That you are doing just the opposite what Christ had done?

723
00:39:01,827 --> 00:39:03,420
And you say that He saved, Christ,

724
00:39:03,628 --> 00:39:06,347
so even if we are prostitutes He’ll save us.

725
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:07,809
But why be prostitutes?

726
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,178
This is such a stupid style of thinking.

727
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,039
That we should become prostitutes so that Christ will save us.

728
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:25,821
One has to think about all these things

729
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,712
in the proper light of Sahaja Yoga.

730
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:30,605
Unless and until you are realized

731
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:33,047
My talk is just useless for you.

732
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,137
But once you are realized you will know

733
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,555
that if you glance at someone

734
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:41,422
you might suddenly get a headache at the back.

735
00:39:41,527 --> 00:39:44,534
You might feel a dart has gone into your head

736
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:45,892
or something has happened.

737
00:39:45,992 --> 00:39:47,724
You might feel that you’re blinding

738
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:53,024
with somebody’s face and you will get all kinds of experiences

739
00:39:53,054 --> 00:39:56,711
by which you will know how important are your eyes.

740
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,405
All your nervousness and everything can be cured

741
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,254
if you have pure eyes.

742
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,039
But it is such a vicious circle

743
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:07,645
that through your eyes you gather all the bad

744
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:10,807
and is accumulated in the Agnya and you have to clear the Agnya

745
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,296
to make the eyes clear.

746
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,246
It’s a vicious circle.

747
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:16,733
But it can start at a point as I said,

748
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,302
we have to ask for forgiveness.

749
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:27,079
Secondly we have to bring Christ in our Agnya Chakra.

750
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:31,314
Thirdly we have to give up all

751
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:35,724
drugs and all intoxicants and all smoking.

752
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:39,576
That happens automatically when you are a Sahaja Yogi,

753
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,454
it will work out.

754
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:45,800
But eyes express the whole of your being, your brain,

755
00:40:46,072 --> 00:40:50,483
your body, your limbs everything.

756
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:56,120
And if your Agnya is all right then you eyes

757
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:58,220
are perfectly all right.

758
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,797
They emit nothing but love

759
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:02,830
wherever they glance.

760
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,977
Only with a glance of your eyes you can raise the Kundalini.

761
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:12,371
Only with the glance of your eyes you can cure people.

762
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,659
Only with your glance you can bring joy into

763
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:19,090
the destroyed and the ruined people.

764
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:23,064
So these eyes which you see are the windows

765
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,377
of your being, of your heart.

766
00:41:25,597 --> 00:41:30,122
When the Spirit is expressed through your eyes,

767
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:32,214
you must have noticed yourself,

768
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:36,212
that when the Kundalini rises then the eyes become dilated.

769
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:39,697
And a realized soul has got

770
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:46,550
black eyes because they have these eyes are dilated.

771
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:49,852
At least when I see them they are all dilated black eyes.

772
00:41:50,604 --> 00:41:51,730
Apart from that

773
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:55,520
a realized soul can be made out by his eyes which are sparkling.

774
00:41:55,918 --> 00:41:57,918
There’s a sparkle like diamonds.

775
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,287
They sparkle all the time and

776
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,792
you can make out from the eyes

777
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:03,827
that this person is a realized soul.

778
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,305
There’s a tremendous difference between a non-realized

779
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:10,021
soul’s eyes and a realized soul’s eyes.

780
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:15,658
So you can imagine how your Spirit sees through your eyes.

781
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:19,672
But if the eyes are not pure it doesn’t stay there long.

782
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,859
So if we have to understand Christ

783
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:25,107
physically we have to respect our eyes.

784
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:31,420
Mentally we have to give up all that is impure in our mind.

785
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:35,734
Now, so we come to the impurities of the mind.

786
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,539
And the impurities of mind are,

787
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:42,483
there are so many poisons, you know, about.

788
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:45,236
I mean there are books and books written about the poisons.

789
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:48,501
And the psychologists are supposed to take out all your poisons.

790
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:50,446
I don’t know if they can do it at all.

791
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:51,983
But they have the worst Agnya.

792
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:55,171
All these psychologists have the worst Agnya

793
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,513
and I don’t think they are capable

794
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,262
of really giving any relief to people

795
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,598
who are suffering mentally.

796
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,084
Mental sufferings are of two types.

797
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,473
Say the same thing is that one is…

798
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:15,900
MOTHER SAYS ASIDE: Vibrations are so much, I can’t stand it.

799
00:43:16,538 --> 00:43:23,370
One type of mental troubles are

800
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:26,417
where people oppress you very much.

801
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:30,370
You see you go on bearing the cross.

802
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:35,129
Now this is a very wrong idea people have about Christ.

803
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:39,534
Bearing the cross doesn’t mean that anybody who tries

804
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:44,193
to oppress you should go on taking the enslavement upon yourself.

805
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,954
You’re not to enslave to anyone whatsoever.

806
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,455
Anybody who tries

807
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,765
to make a slave out of you, you should deny it absolutely.

808
00:43:57,087 --> 00:43:59,087
You should say Ham, I am.

809
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:01,180
Who are you to dominate me?

810
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:02,322
Anyone

811
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:05,758
whether you are of a black skin, or a red skin or a yellow skin,

812
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:11,310
nobody has right to dominate anyone in this whole world.

813
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,084
And if anybody is doing it, “Oh what to do now,

814
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,520
after all you see we are poor people,

815
00:44:17,604 --> 00:44:20,579
or we are like this or he’s supporting,” and all that.

816
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:25,292
Then they are running away from their duty towards themselves.

817
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:27,770
Such people cannot get Realization.

818
00:44:28,879 --> 00:44:31,517
Slaves are not going to become kings.

819
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:40,139
So the slavery that is supposed to be confused with bearing the cross

820
00:44:40,546 --> 00:44:44,467
is another confusion of modern times.

821
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:48,760
We have to rise in our self-respect.

822
00:44:49,216 --> 00:44:50,650
And we have to understand

823
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,050
that no one in this world has a right to dominate us.

824
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:59,506
But then what is bearing of the cross is?

825
00:45:00,389 --> 00:45:04,319
First of all the people of His level never suffer.

826
00:45:04,892 --> 00:45:06,259
It’s just a joke going on.

827
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:08,667
It’s a Leela, it’s a play going on for them.

828
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,346
They never suffer,

829
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:18,087
and even if they so called act as suffering

830
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,472
they just do it because they want to do it.

831
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,754
They are not helpless people.

832
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:28,203
They are not slaves.

833
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,025
And those who think that by bearing it up and by suffering it

834
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:36,840
we are becoming Christians

835
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:39,152
they should know they are psychological cases.

836
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,253
And if they are crying and weeping and all the time saying,

837
00:45:45,355 --> 00:45:50,109
“What to do, you see I am in love and my lover tortures me.”

838
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,536
You are neither in love neither you have a lover.

839
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:56,900
It is a kind of a psychological clubbing.

840
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:58,895
That he is a dominating man

841
00:45:58,951 --> 00:46:01,424
and you like his domination, that’s why you are together.

842
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,909
Is a simple fact.

843
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:13,152
So every human being has his own self-respect.

844
00:46:13,415 --> 00:46:17,994
And he must respect his self that is the Spirit within him.

845
00:46:18,035 --> 00:46:19,252
And nothing should dominate it.

846
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:20,332
Whether you belong to this country or that country,

847
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:21,198
or this ism or that ism. All this will break down.

848
00:46:21,226 --> 00:46:23,099
Under the rule of God

849
00:46:23,888 --> 00:46:27,105
nobody has the right to dominate anybody’s Spirit.

850
00:46:30,657 --> 00:46:32,507
But when you are given freedom

851
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:35,227
you go to the other side that is Mr. Ego.

852
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,991
You do not know how to use your freedom.

853
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:42,423
So you try to dominate others.

854
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:46,952
Your freedom is, everybody’s freedom is in danger.

855
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:50,919
You’re on top of everyone, and torturing everybody’s souls.

856
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:53,934
And you are dominating by land

857
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:59,240
and by properties or by possessions.

858
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:06,314
So either this way or that way,

859
00:47:06,728 --> 00:47:10,768
mentally if you are of this category or that category,

860
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,167
you are against yourself.

861
00:47:15,048 --> 00:47:17,958
Just be in the center and see for yourself.

862
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,566
Just be looking at it.

863
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,906
Are you emitting love towards another person?

864
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:31,632
If you are a slave how can you love? You cannot.

865
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:42,727
If you are free and abandoned how can you love?

866
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:49,353
Love has its own bondages very sweet and beautiful.

867
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:52,149
You have to live with them.

868
00:47:53,946 --> 00:47:55,450
You enjoy those bondages.

869
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,339
For a little child will come to your house

870
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:01,707
and he will spoil your house no doubt, and that he should do.

871
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:05,137
And you should enjoy that spoiling.

872
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:11,721
Then your freedom if it is challenged by a little child’s crying,

873
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,213
then you are not wise people.

874
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:16,971
This is abandonment.

875
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:21,001
Or I would say it is loneliness.

876
00:48:21,069 --> 00:48:27,145
It is cutting off from the primordial, from the big one,

877
00:48:28,148 --> 00:48:30,144
from the large one that you are.

878
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:36,634
Is not to be able to tolerate the freedom of others.

879
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,108
A child has no freedom to cry in the house.

880
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:43,769
What sort of freedom you conceive of.

881
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,084
A mother has no right to say

882
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:49,042
something she wants to say about her child,

883
00:48:49,062 --> 00:48:51,539
which is her duty to tell him what is right and wrong.

884
00:48:52,455 --> 00:48:54,308
If the son does not have right

885
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:57,147
to eat whatever he likes in his own mother’s family

886
00:48:57,404 --> 00:48:59,285
then what sort of freedom do you have?

887
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:01,178
It’s such a confusion of things.

888
00:49:04,261 --> 00:49:06,094
So this kind of freedom

889
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:10,100
is just the opposite and extreme of enslavement.

890
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:14,500
But in the center is love where you are bound by everyone.

891
00:49:15,027 --> 00:49:18,419
I am bound by My children. Yes, I am.

892
00:49:19,045 --> 00:49:20,033
I am proud of them.

893
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:24,019
They bound Me and I bound them too.

894
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:28,348
It’s a mutual bounding which we enjoy among ourselves.

895
00:49:30,756 --> 00:49:34,368
There is such a give and take when there is such a bondage of love.

896
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,378
But do we understand the importance of bondage of love?

897
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:43,205
At the slightest pretext we break it.

898
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,770
Say wife says, “I would like to go out today”.

899
00:49:47,037 --> 00:49:48,074
The husband says “Why?

900
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:49,945
I am very tired don’t you understand?“

901
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:54,990
Or if the husband says, “I feel like eating something,”

902
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,768
or some particular thing he says pancake or something,

903
00:49:58,043 --> 00:49:59,145
a small thing.

904
00:49:59,218 --> 00:50:01,286
“Oh I am very tired every time you are demanding.”

905
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,473
If she could just think by making that little thing

906
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,856
he would be so very happy.

907
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:08,840
She should be dying to know what he wants.

908
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,987
And he should be dying to do what she wants.

909
00:50:11,023 --> 00:50:13,185
And then enjoy each other’s company

910
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:17,480
or you are wasting all your properties that you have as human beings.

911
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:21,610
You don’t know how much you are wasting from each other.

912
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,725
Every moment is filled with such beautiful bondages,

913
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:31,204
where exchanges are there. What have you gained?

914
00:50:32,468 --> 00:50:34,468
The way you are fighting.

915
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:36,126
The way you are going about.

916
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:38,111
What have you gained let me see?

917
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,620
When you die you have to announce in the paper

918
00:50:41,753 --> 00:50:44,564
that XYZ is dead and you find there is nobody.

919
00:50:44,594 --> 00:50:48,004
And you have even to pay for people to visit you when you die.

920
00:50:49,673 --> 00:50:51,123
This is the case today.

921
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:56,553
Such dryness, such emptiness, such loneliness exists.

922
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,905
What have you achieved through this.

923
00:51:00,906 --> 00:51:04,099
So this bondage we have to.

924
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:07,233
And there is no question of sacrifice you see, the way.

925
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,353
We must sacrifice for the family. What are you sacrificing?

926
00:51:12,407 --> 00:51:14,757
I mean if you pay for your family

927
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,474
you get the joy out of it. That’s why you do it.

928
00:51:19,722 --> 00:51:22,770
If you have to lead a nice good life

929
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,898
you are not sacrificing anything

930
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:30,063
but you are gaining by that, leading a good life.

931
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,694
If your wife says, “Don’t go to the pub,”

932
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,870
and if you do not go there,

933
00:51:37,206 --> 00:51:40,056
then you should not say she is an orthodox,

934
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:42,864
old fashioned this that, that and that and that.

935
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:45,216
But instead you should thank you stars that

936
00:51:45,226 --> 00:51:47,273
in this modern times also that there is somebody

937
00:51:47,286 --> 00:51:48,468
who’s telling you the truth.

938
00:51:51,185 --> 00:51:53,628
Because the whole edifice has come up,

939
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:56,740
do you mean to say that truth should not be told?

940
00:51:58,264 --> 00:52:01,314
All this is falsehood in which you are living.

941
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,599
And if you have to be happy come down to reality.

942
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:09,848
Friends, also same thing.

943
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:13,618
With the friends what sort of relations do we have with our friends?

944
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,522
What do we expect from them?

945
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:17,360
Sending them a Christmas card

946
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:21,571
and then if they don’t send, feeling bad about it.

947
00:52:26,171 --> 00:52:29,629
There are no deeper bondages we have not lived with them.

948
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,681
If you allow our self to be bound by them,

949
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,916
they will be bound by us.

950
00:52:35,913 --> 00:52:37,913
You better try this.

951
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:41,761
Try to be bound by them. Don’t be afraid of anybody else.

952
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:44,463
Just try to be bound by others

953
00:52:44,707 --> 00:52:47,432
and you’ll be amazed how much they will be giving you.

954
00:52:47,617 --> 00:52:49,617
I am a living example of this.

955
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:55,691
I can tell you I am a living example of this.

956
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,222
I am bound by all of you.

957
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:01,952
If somebody says, “Mother when are you going to leave us?”

958
00:53:02,113 --> 00:53:05,131
No I cannot. I cannot. I am just bound by you. I just

959
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:07,988
do not want to leave because I love you very much.

960
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,105
How can I leave you?

961
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,316
It’s impossible for Me.

962
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,731
So then, what do I gain out of this life?

963
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,550
Everything that is in this world.

964
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,572
What do you want Me to get?

965
00:53:22,273 --> 00:53:24,869
I cannot even count what I can get out of it.

966
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,603
Immeasurable, ocean.

967
00:53:30,226 --> 00:53:32,632
I become an ocean Myself.

968
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:38,647
Break your ideas about your own personal

969
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:43,514
freedom and liberation, is liberating your intelligence.

970
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:49,299
You‘re liberating your own wisdom.

971
00:53:51,578 --> 00:53:58,177
And the sweetness and the beauty which is never perishable

972
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,410
whether you are old or young.

973
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:03,770
That is going to be your own.

974
00:54:05,649 --> 00:54:09,475
But these poisons that are being built outside and inside you,

975
00:54:09,604 --> 00:54:10,870
please throw them away.

976
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:15,370
These are mental poisons.

977
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:18,752
Through Agnya you can take them out.

978
00:54:19,408 --> 00:54:22,215
You see, this is an opening also

979
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,326
through which  many things go out.

980
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:28,299
Try to work it out.

981
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,698
Look at the tree with love

982
00:54:34,235 --> 00:54:36,515
and you’ll find that the tree itself

983
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:38,925
is giving you the joy of its creation.

984
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:40,994
Because you’ll become thoughtless.

985
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:44,979
And the creator who has made that beautiful tree

986
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:48,310
will be pouring all that joy which is stored into it into you.

987
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,384
Every human being is a store of joy.

988
00:54:53,786 --> 00:54:58,178
Unlimited, I assure you, believe Me.

989
00:54:59,102 --> 00:55:04,404
And don’t waste them because somebody is not properly dressed,

990
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,830
or he’s not according to the way

991
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:11,252
you want him to be which you learnt in your public school.

992
00:55:13,572 --> 00:55:19,495
Every doorstep, everywhere there is beauty lying, do not miss it.

993
00:55:20,365 --> 00:55:25,917
But if you have possessiveness about it, an adultery about it,

994
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,535
then you can never enjoy them.

995
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:39,694
You can never enjoy all that beauty, all that store, all that wealth

996
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:45,755
that is in every human being every moment it is bubbling.

997
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:51,947
For Agnya it’s a good thing, Christmas is coming.

998
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,955
And at the time that when I have to wish you Happy Christmas,

999
00:55:56,813 --> 00:56:02,152
that at this occasion I am speaking about Agnya Chakra

1000
00:56:02,555 --> 00:56:06,292
in which, what I said is, Agnya is

1001
00:56:06,664 --> 00:56:09,829
one must know what to order and how to obey.

1002
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:12,436
Obey the Divine.

1003
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,870
Obey your elders.

1004
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:20,772
Obey your self and not your ego.

1005
00:56:22,581 --> 00:56:25,566
And then you can order also others.

1006
00:56:27,025 --> 00:56:29,041
Not only human beings,

1007
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:31,886
but you can even order the sun and the moon and

1008
00:56:31,919 --> 00:56:33,919
all the winds and everything in the world.

1009
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:39,397
Everything you can control, everything with this Agnya.

1010
00:56:40,127 --> 00:56:41,434
You try one thing.

1011
00:56:42,186 --> 00:56:44,715
If you know somebody is going to do something wrong,

1012
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:50,715
just take his name and put it to Agnya. He’ll not do it, try it.

1013
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,144
This is a trick I’m telling about

1014
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:56,442
for those who are realized souls

1015
00:56:56,469 --> 00:56:58,091
not for those who are not yet realized

1016
00:56:58,108 --> 00:56:59,762
but those who are realized can try.

1017
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,881
If the other person is doing something wrong

1018
00:57:02,925 --> 00:57:04,357
you can try your Agnya.

1019
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:07,441
Anything you order on your Agnya will be respected

1020
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,965
but your Agnya must have Christ there.

1021
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:17,211
Because you have the great support awakened within you,

1022
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,613
which does not exist here but into every man’s head.

1023
00:57:23,503 --> 00:57:28,301
It is all pervading into all small atoms and molecules, it is

1024
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:32,681
everywhere into the sun and any place you go. It is there.

1025
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:42,330
So try to develop your Agnya that is the mastery of your self.

1026
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:46,563
Those who have a good Agnya can master anything

1027
00:57:47,071 --> 00:57:51,950
and understand that the idea about mastering

1028
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:55,232
worldly things and mastering human beings and mastering this

1029
00:57:55,344 --> 00:58:00,022
and some of them are mastering in, say, other crafts and things,

1030
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:02,304
best thing is to master your Agnya.

1031
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,437
And you really become the master of yourself

1032
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:10,316
by which you can master many things.

1033
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,699
And today on this great day

1034
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:17,778
when I’m wishing you a Happy Christmas, I wish you to have

1035
00:58:19,002 --> 00:58:22,563
the most powerful Agnyas,

1036
00:58:22,762 --> 00:58:24,762
that people when they see your forehead

1037
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:28,483
should know that Christ is reborn again with in you.

1038
00:58:28,826 --> 00:58:29,871
May God bless you.
