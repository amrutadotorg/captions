00:04.460 --> 00:11.340
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

00:11.580 --> 00:15.100
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

00:15.300 --> 00:26.140
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

00:27.140 --> 00:33.980
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

00:34.180 --> 00:38.260
who had no idea about God at all

00:38.460 --> 00:42.140
because they started a theme

00:42.340 --> 00:47.140
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

00:47.340 --> 00:54.540
So, the birth determined the caste of a person.

00:54.740 --> 00:56.700
Before that,

00:56.900 --> 01:03.980
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.780
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

01:07.020 --> 01:09.460
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

01:09.660 --> 01:14.580
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

01:15.580 --> 01:19.100
And that is how also

01:19.300 --> 01:23.140
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

01:23.340 --> 01:25.940
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.620
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

01:29.860 --> 01:34.540
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

01:34.740 --> 01:38.340
So it was agreed that

01:38.540 --> 01:43.700
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.900
Gradually, it amounted to this

01:46.060 --> 01:48.740
that any child born out

01:48.940 --> 01:51.060
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

01:51.260 --> 01:54.940
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

01:55.140 --> 01:57.660
Realized souls as their children.

01:57.860 --> 01:59.940
Maybe their own karmas,

02:00.140 --> 02:03.260
maybe the child, anything it is,

02:03.460 --> 02:07.620
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

02:07.780 --> 02:11.020
devilish children.

02:11.220 --> 02:20.700
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

02:20.940 --> 02:25.180
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

02:25.380 --> 02:28.660
or the one who has known the Brahma.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.500
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

02:31.700 --> 02:36.020
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

02:36.220 --> 02:37.860
by what you do.

02:38.060 --> 02:42.300
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

02:42.572 --> 02:45.045
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.232
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

02:48.353 --> 02:55.326
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

02:55.806 --> 03:02.406
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

03:02.966 --> 03:07.446
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

03:07.646 --> 03:10.646
who can only worship God.

03:11.046 --> 03:16.846
So to put another extreme

03:17.086 --> 03:21.046
to what Rama has created,

03:21.726 --> 03:23.966
to bring people into the centre,

03:24.166 --> 03:28.006
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

03:28.326 --> 03:30.406
and rigidity of ritualism

03:30.726 --> 03:36.486
and too much of fundamentalism.

03:36.806 --> 03:38.486
So to put an end to that

03:38.726 --> 03:41.526
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

03:41.726 --> 03:47.566
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

03:47.926 --> 03:52.326
So he started a new theme of,

03:52.526 --> 03:58.766
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

03:58.966 --> 04:01.366
that such a new theme should come up.

04:01.606 --> 04:06.566
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

04:07.246 --> 04:09.766
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

04:10.006 --> 04:13.526
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

04:13.726 --> 04:20.206
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.926
So, the whole thing is a Leela.

04:23.166 --> 04:27.526
And on this theme he worked out everything

04:27.846 --> 04:30.886
to establish that it is a play.

04:31.566 --> 04:34.526
And that is what you see in America,

04:34.726 --> 04:37.886
very common that for people it has become a joke,

04:38.126 --> 04:40.646
life has become a joke.

04:40.926 --> 04:43.606
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

04:43.846 --> 04:47.886
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

04:48.126 --> 04:54.006
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

04:54.246 --> 04:59.726
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

05:00.086 --> 05:02.966
But it is a myth with Americans now

05:03.166 --> 05:06.006
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

05:06.246 --> 05:08.046
you have to have realisation.

05:08.286 --> 05:11.086
Like if you are standing in the water,

05:11.366 --> 05:18.286
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

05:19.486 --> 05:24.206
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

05:24.886 --> 05:28.326
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

05:28.526 --> 05:30.606
by asserting itself.

05:30.846 --> 05:32.726
But if you're in the boat

05:33.006 --> 05:36.886
then the water that is around is an illusion.

05:37.126 --> 05:39.566
So, it's the state at which you are.

05:39.846 --> 05:44.246
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

05:44.446 --> 05:48.846
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

05:49.086 --> 05:52.926
It is a reality. So, what they forgot this point,

05:53.126 --> 05:56.166
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

05:56.446 --> 06:00.286
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

06:00.726 --> 06:02.046
thinking that it's an illusion

06:02.246 --> 06:06.246
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

06:07.606 --> 06:10.366
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

06:10.566 --> 06:11.926
this thing should be so

06:12.126 --> 06:15.486
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

06:15.686 --> 06:18.926
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

06:19.126 --> 06:22.926
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

06:23.206 --> 06:25.326
And some people go to that limit to say

06:25.526 --> 06:28.286
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

06:28.526 --> 06:30.806
nothing like a evil force.

06:31.086 --> 06:34.726
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

06:34.966 --> 06:40.806
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

06:41.526 --> 06:46.086
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

06:46.926 --> 06:50.846
In that play he was to be destroyed.

06:51.486 --> 06:56.926
So, he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

06:57.126 --> 06:59.526
what not to be destroyed.

06:59.726 --> 07:03.166
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

07:03.406 --> 07:06.006
So, to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

07:06.206 --> 07:09.366
Like even if you think everything is a play,

07:09.566 --> 07:13.806
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

07:14.086 --> 07:16.846
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

07:17.086 --> 07:18.606
like in a drama you sit down

07:18.846 --> 07:20.926
and you watch everything as a spectator,

07:21.166 --> 07:27.086
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

07:27.486 --> 07:31.566
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

07:31.806 --> 07:34.966
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.606
You have a sense of discretion to know

07:37.806 --> 07:40.366
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

07:40.606 --> 07:45.166
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

07:45.686 --> 07:50.166
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

07:50.406 --> 07:53.566
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

07:53.806 --> 07:56.886
you're involved in it. So, it is not,

07:57.206 --> 07:58.926
for you do not know the discretion

07:59.126 --> 08:00.726
between the tragedy and the comedy.

08:00.926 --> 08:04.006
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

08:04.246 --> 08:07.726
if you do your job well then, it's a comedy,

08:07.926 --> 08:10.806
otherwise it's a tragedy.

08:11.326 --> 08:15.086
So, there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

08:15.326 --> 08:18.926
another of the one who is in it.

08:19.246 --> 08:21.886
So, one has to understand in that light,

08:22.166 --> 08:25.046
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

08:25.246 --> 08:30.286
he was meaning for him, not for others.

08:30.846 --> 08:32.286
For him it is a play.

08:32.486 --> 08:36.286
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

08:36.486 --> 08:39.646
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

08:39.846 --> 08:42.646
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

08:42.846 --> 08:48.166
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

08:48.526 --> 08:51.806
So, to him it was a play, everything was a play

08:52.006 --> 08:56.726
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

08:57.206 --> 09:02.046
So, the first thing if you are

09:02.366 --> 09:04.526
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

09:04.726 --> 09:09.046
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

09:09.566 --> 09:14.126
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

09:14.326 --> 09:16.686
You cannot say what is wisdom.

09:16.926 --> 09:20.806
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

09:21.006 --> 09:24.366
Wisdom is a temperament,

09:24.606 --> 09:27.846
is a quality of a personality

09:28.206 --> 09:33.206
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

09:33.446 --> 09:37.446
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

09:37.686 --> 09:39.446
who are not traditional.

09:39.686 --> 09:42.566
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

09:42.766 --> 09:45.886
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

09:46.126 --> 09:50.126
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

09:50.326 --> 09:52.846
so he did not need any tradition at all.

09:53.046 --> 09:56.206
But for you, you have to understand from the people

09:56.406 --> 09:58.566
who have tradition what is wisdom.

09:58.806 --> 10:03.006
So, we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

10:03.246 --> 10:08.526
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

10:08.726 --> 10:13.406
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

10:13.646 --> 10:20.286
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

10:20.486 --> 10:22.326
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

10:22.566 --> 10:26.966
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

10:27.326 --> 10:31.046
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

10:31.406 --> 10:34.446
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

10:34.646 --> 10:37.206
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

10:37.406 --> 10:38.846
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

10:39.046 --> 10:42.286
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

10:42.646 --> 10:46.606
So, because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

10:46.886 --> 10:51.406
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

10:51.606 --> 10:54.566
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

10:54.766 --> 10:55.686
instead of

10:55.886 --> 10:58.046
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

10:58.246 --> 11:00.846
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

11:01.046 --> 11:04.726
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

11:04.926 --> 11:07.966
spoiling the other chakra also.

11:08.206 --> 11:15.886
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

11:16.406 --> 11:18.726
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

11:18.966 --> 11:22.926
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

11:23.446 --> 11:25.686
That's the best way to escape it.

11:25.966 --> 11:30.366
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

11:30.686 --> 11:33.286
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

11:33.486 --> 11:36.246
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

11:36.446 --> 11:40.166
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

11:40.446 --> 11:41.486
Now the another side

11:41.686 --> 11:44.526
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

11:44.726 --> 11:46.806
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

11:47.046 --> 11:51.366
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

11:52.126 --> 11:54.926
So, "What's wrong?"

11:56.606 --> 12:00.326
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

12:00.886 --> 12:03.286
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

12:03.526 --> 12:07.926
So, it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

12:08.126 --> 12:10.286
for example they paint their hair.

12:10.526 --> 12:13.926
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

12:14.126 --> 12:19.086
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.806
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

12:22.006 --> 12:25.006
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

12:25.246 --> 12:31.726
They cannot even create a little ant,

12:32.006 --> 12:35.646
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.406
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

12:38.646 --> 12:40.086
So, this is the right side thing

12:40.326 --> 12:46.606
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

12:48.246 --> 12:51.926
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

12:52.206 --> 12:56.526
that eyes are the ones

12:56.726 --> 12:59.566
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.366
the power of Shri Krishna.

13:01.646 --> 13:06.886
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

13:07.086 --> 13:09.846
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

13:10.046 --> 13:11.726
if he has Krishna consciousness,

13:11.926 --> 13:14.686
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

13:14.886 --> 13:18.286
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

13:18.526 --> 13:19.966
should be able to cure anyone.

13:20.206 --> 13:22.846
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

13:23.086 --> 13:24.886
if it has Krishna consciousness,

13:25.126 --> 13:28.966
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

13:29.206 --> 13:33.486
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

13:33.726 --> 13:38.006
So, on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

13:38.246 --> 13:39.286
When you feel guilty,

13:39.526 --> 13:42.526
they try to find out some method of expression.

13:42.726 --> 13:44.526
So they say they go to some guru

13:44.726 --> 13:47.326
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

13:47.566 --> 13:50.006
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

13:50.206 --> 13:53.926
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.166
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

13:57.366 --> 13:59.686
you get completely caught-up.

13:59.886 --> 14:02.086
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

14:02.326 --> 14:05.766
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

14:06.006 --> 14:09.526
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

14:09.726 --> 14:14.926
who get anginas and also who get cancer

14:15.126 --> 14:17.286
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

14:17.486 --> 14:20.166
without the connection with the Divine.

14:20.406 --> 14:23.046
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

14:23.246 --> 14:26.046
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

14:26.246 --> 14:29.566
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

14:29.806 --> 14:34.966
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

14:35.166 --> 14:39.646
without feeling the power of that mantra.

14:40.326 --> 14:42.486
So, in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

14:42.686 --> 14:45.446
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

14:45.686 --> 14:48.046
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

14:48.286 --> 14:51.566
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

14:51.806 --> 14:53.486
They think they're very responsible people

14:53.686 --> 14:55.806
and do all irresponsible things.

14:56.006 --> 14:58.526
So, when you want to spoil that chakra,

14:58.726 --> 15:02.726
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

15:02.926 --> 15:07.366
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

15:07.606 --> 15:13.486
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

15:14.286 --> 15:17.286
When you start saying in the ego form that,

15:17.526 --> 15:22.726
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

15:23.006 --> 15:27.086
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

15:27.326 --> 15:31.166
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

15:31.446 --> 15:33.046
then the whole thing disappears

15:33.286 --> 15:37.326
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

15:37.566 --> 15:40.006
Islam is nothing but surrender.

15:40.246 --> 15:44.046
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

15:44.286 --> 15:49.006
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

15:49.246 --> 15:52.046
So, you play the melody of God.

15:52.246 --> 15:56.526
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

15:56.766 --> 15:59.086
Every time you go back to discretion.

15:59.286 --> 16:01.726
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

16:01.966 --> 16:05.006
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

16:05.246 --> 16:06.846
Like somebody wants to drink.

16:07.046 --> 16:12.366
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

16:13.326 --> 16:16.326
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

16:16.606 --> 16:21.406
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

16:22.086 --> 16:26.846
So, this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

16:27.166 --> 16:32.886
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

16:33.086 --> 16:36.126
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

16:36.366 --> 16:38.086
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

16:38.326 --> 16:41.206
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

16:41.406 --> 16:44.326
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

16:44.566 --> 16:47.246
And then whatever you do has a justification.

16:47.486 --> 16:52.726
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

16:52.926 --> 16:54.846
they actually robbed the other people of their land

16:55.046 --> 16:57.406
and now very nicely settled down.

16:57.646 --> 16:58.886
Now, when I say that,

16:59.126 --> 17:01.606
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

17:01.846 --> 17:05.846
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

17:06.126 --> 17:08.366
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

17:08.606 --> 17:11.006
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

17:11.246 --> 17:14.006
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

17:14.246 --> 17:19.526
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

17:19.726 --> 17:22.286
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

17:22.486 --> 17:25.006
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

17:25.246 --> 17:28.406
This is the way you face and not just to say,

17:28.606 --> 17:32.886
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

17:33.126 --> 17:35.366
But what are you doing about it?

17:35.606 --> 17:39.166
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

17:39.366 --> 17:42.886
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

17:43.126 --> 17:45.206
I said, "What did you do there?

17:45.446 --> 17:47.846
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

17:48.086 --> 17:50.486
at least you did not go to fight there.

17:50.686 --> 17:52.326
Why did you feel guilty about it?"

17:52.566 --> 17:54.686
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

17:54.886 --> 17:59.846
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

18:00.126 --> 18:02.486
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

18:02.686 --> 18:07.086
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

18:07.286 --> 18:12.206
that we suddenly become a personality

18:12.446 --> 18:15.566
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

18:15.846 --> 18:20.606
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

18:20.806 --> 18:23.846
Alright, how?

18:24.206 --> 18:29.046
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

18:29.326 --> 18:32.966
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

18:33.206 --> 18:35.726
Both are headaches to the whole world.

18:35.966 --> 18:39.126
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

18:39.486 --> 18:43.286
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

18:43.606 --> 18:50.046
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

18:50.486 --> 18:55.246
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.926
Children and father cannot live together.

18:58.126 --> 18:59.886
Mother cannot live with the children.

19:00.086 --> 19:03.166
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

19:03.406 --> 19:07.446
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

19:07.686 --> 19:12.566
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

19:12.846 --> 19:14.846
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

19:15.046 --> 19:17.326
There's no unison, there is no concord.

19:17.566 --> 19:21.246
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

19:21.446 --> 19:25.846
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

19:26.046 --> 19:31.486
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

19:31.726 --> 19:34.926
Even the destruction of evil is important,

19:35.246 --> 19:38.326
even the killing of the evil is important.

19:38.566 --> 19:42.006
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

19:42.206 --> 19:43.606
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

19:43.806 --> 19:47.926
and should have been put in charge of God?

19:49.086 --> 19:51.366
He's saved by killing him.

19:51.606 --> 19:53.366
Because he was destroyed,

19:53.566 --> 19:58.486
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

19:58.966 --> 20:02.246
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

20:02.446 --> 20:05.726
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

20:05.926 --> 20:08.246
evil is to be finished.

20:08.526 --> 20:09.606
So, what you have to pray

20:09.806 --> 20:12.606
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

20:12.846 --> 20:17.326
all the destruction of the world,

20:17.526 --> 20:21.086
all the minds which build up our destruction,

20:21.286 --> 20:23.926
please try to neutralise it."

20:24.126 --> 20:26.446
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

20:26.646 --> 20:27.446
Instead of that,

20:27.646 --> 20:32.606
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

20:32.846 --> 20:34.966
That's not correct . You have to stand up

20:35.206 --> 20:37.126
and you have to say, "That it's wrong",

20:37.366 --> 20:40.726
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

20:40.966 --> 20:42.246
we have no right."

20:42.446 --> 20:47.006
So when Krishna told Arjuna that, "You kill everyone

20:47.246 --> 20:49.766
who are related to you, who are your friends

20:50.006 --> 20:55.046
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

20:55.246 --> 20:57.406
It was Shri Krishna who said,

20:57.686 --> 21:01.926
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.446
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

21:04.646 --> 21:09.726
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

21:10.806 --> 21:14.806
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

21:15.006 --> 21:17.046
which started killing everyone,

21:17.246 --> 21:21.286
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

21:21.646 --> 21:23.246
You have no sense of right and wrong.

21:23.486 --> 21:26.926
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

21:27.126 --> 21:29.406
First of all try to save instead of killing.

21:29.646 --> 21:34.126
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

21:34.326 --> 21:35.646
people are getting drowned

21:35.846 --> 21:38.006
and you find that you have to save the people.

21:38.246 --> 21:42.086
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

21:42.286 --> 21:44.206
There is no occasion for killing now.

21:44.406 --> 21:47.446
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

21:47.646 --> 21:50.126
What you have to do is to save people,

21:50.326 --> 21:54.406
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

21:54.646 --> 21:59.206
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

21:59.446 --> 22:02.646
You just move them out. Take them away.

22:02.926 --> 22:04.046
Have nothing to do with them.

22:04.246 --> 22:07.406
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

22:07.646 --> 22:11.286
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

22:11.526 --> 22:15.126
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

22:15.366 --> 22:19.046
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

22:19.286 --> 22:22.606
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.966
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

22:26.166 --> 22:30.406
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

22:30.606 --> 22:32.966
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

22:33.166 --> 22:33.886
you don't take up

22:34.086 --> 22:37.766
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

22:38.006 --> 22:40.926
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

22:41.126 --> 22:43.246
I've seen people become very aggressive,

22:43.446 --> 22:45.086
they talk very aggressively.

22:45.286 --> 22:48.406
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

22:48.646 --> 22:52.486
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

22:52.686 --> 22:55.206
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

22:55.446 --> 22:58.246
Very common.

22:59.446 --> 23:03.886
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

23:04.326 --> 23:06.726
Then you start aggressing each other also,

23:06.926 --> 23:09.766
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

23:09.966 --> 23:10.886
You're not to aggress.

23:11.086 --> 23:13.846
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

23:14.046 --> 23:17.166
What is discretion is diplomacy.

23:17.446 --> 23:20.566
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

23:20.806 --> 23:22.846
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

23:23.046 --> 23:24.766
this man is dangerous,

23:25.006 --> 23:26.366
he is troubling you,

23:26.566 --> 23:28.246
now if you have a proper sense,

23:28.446 --> 23:31.886
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

23:32.126 --> 23:36.926
that there won't be any more discussion or destruction.

23:37.126 --> 23:41.766
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

23:42.006 --> 23:44.726
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

23:44.966 --> 23:49.286
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

23:49.646 --> 23:51.646
So must have discretion, must understand.

23:51.846 --> 23:54.846
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

23:55.046 --> 23:56.926
where you find somebody is telling you,

23:57.126 --> 23:59.846
"You see, this person has said this about you."

24:00.086 --> 24:02.566
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

24:02.806 --> 24:05.286
"That person has said this about you."

24:05.486 --> 24:07.206
Then you start quarelling

24:07.406 --> 24:11.566
instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

24:11.726 --> 24:14.686
"Why, why this is happening,

24:14.926 --> 24:17.366
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

24:17.606 --> 24:19.166
We were friends, what has happened?"

24:19.366 --> 24:22.286
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

24:22.486 --> 24:28.846
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

24:29.086 --> 24:33.846
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

24:34.086 --> 24:36.126
delicate, beautiful.

24:36.326 --> 24:40.006
Nobody should notice

24:40.206 --> 24:46.286
that you have been in any way effective,

24:47.886 --> 24:50.206
and that's how you'll work it out.

24:50.406 --> 24:53.246
So, the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

24:53.446 --> 24:57.006
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

24:57.406 --> 24:59.886
So, he plays.

25:00.086 --> 25:02.126
Give you an example how he plays.

25:02.326 --> 25:07.686
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

25:08.086 --> 25:13.166
who had a blessing from Shiva

25:13.406 --> 25:19.486
that nobody can kill him.

25:20.486 --> 25:26.286
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

25:26.646 --> 25:30.046
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

25:30.486 --> 25:34.966
So, there was a saint who had a blessing

25:35.286 --> 25:38.886
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

25:39.086 --> 25:43.006
sleep in your yoga sleep,

25:43.206 --> 25:46.086
and once you open your eyes

25:46.286 --> 25:51.766
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

25:54.006 --> 25:57.246
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

25:57.526 --> 26:00.406
He was fighting this devil

26:00.606 --> 26:04.286
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

26:04.486 --> 26:08.326
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

26:08.726 --> 26:11.486
So he started running away from the field,

26:11.726 --> 26:13.726
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

26:13.926 --> 26:16.486
the one who runs away from the battle field,

26:16.726 --> 26:19.326
is regarded as something really derogatory,

26:19.526 --> 26:23.166
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

26:23.406 --> 26:24.286
So, he didn't mind,

26:24.486 --> 26:28.126
he ran away and then this devil started following him

26:28.326 --> 26:29.446
And he went into the cave

26:29.646 --> 26:33.806
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

26:34.446 --> 26:37.406
And he removed his shawl

26:37.606 --> 26:41.726
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

26:42.006 --> 26:43.686
and hid himself.

26:43.926 --> 26:45.966
So, this rakshasa came behind him.

26:46.166 --> 26:49.846
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

26:50.086 --> 26:53.726
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

26:53.966 --> 26:56.006
Come along now, open your eyes!"

26:56.246 --> 27:02.206
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

27:02.446 --> 27:05.246
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

27:05.446 --> 27:08.486
and he just was burnt.

27:11.486 --> 27:15.286
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

27:15.566 --> 27:18.886
That is the sign of diplomacy.

27:19.086 --> 27:24.286
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

27:24.486 --> 27:27.086
the whole discretion, what he should do,

27:27.286 --> 27:29.006
what is right, what is wrong,

27:29.246 --> 27:32.806
is he doesn't have this problem.

27:33.086 --> 27:37.926
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.646
So, he played a trick .

27:39.846 --> 27:45.606
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

27:46.166 --> 27:51.846
And he made one king - you see-

27:52.806 --> 28:00.086
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

28:00.286 --> 28:02.806
But he could never touch them.

28:03.006 --> 28:05.846
So, Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

28:06.046 --> 28:07.966
He has to have justification also;

28:08.166 --> 28:10.766
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

28:11.086 --> 28:13.646
So he killed this king, brought all these women

28:13.886 --> 28:19.726
and they all became his wives, so-called.

28:21.286 --> 28:23.406
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

28:23.606 --> 28:26.126
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

28:26.326 --> 28:29.566
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

28:29.846 --> 28:32.766
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

28:33.046 --> 28:37.046
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

28:37.286 --> 28:40.726
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

28:40.926 --> 28:45.086
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

28:45.286 --> 28:49.406
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

28:49.646 --> 28:52.726
meaning the power of creation,

28:52.966 --> 28:55.046
because creation has been done already.

28:55.286 --> 28:58.246
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

28:58.446 --> 29:00.286
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

29:00.486 --> 29:02.446
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

29:02.646 --> 29:05.886
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

29:06.086 --> 29:09.086
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

29:09.326 --> 29:12.446
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

29:12.686 --> 29:14.406
and she opens her left side.

29:14.646 --> 29:16.486
And in front of her

29:16.726 --> 29:20.726
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

29:20.966 --> 29:23.606
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

29:23.806 --> 29:26.086
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

29:26.286 --> 29:30.526
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

29:30.726 --> 29:33.646
But in this one, the one that they have here

29:33.886 --> 29:35.806
is the child is kept underneath this,

29:36.046 --> 29:39.326
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

29:39.526 --> 29:43.526
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

29:43.726 --> 29:46.526
So I'll tell you the last story about her

29:46.726 --> 29:53.166
which will conclude this talk about

29:53.406 --> 29:55.126
Radha and Shri Krishna.

29:55.366 --> 29:57.806
That one day,

29:58.606 --> 30:04.246
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

30:04.486 --> 30:06.206
and Narada said, "See,

30:06.446 --> 30:08.926
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

30:09.126 --> 30:11.406
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

30:11.606 --> 30:16.246
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

30:16.486 --> 30:21.166
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

30:21.406 --> 30:25.126
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

30:25.326 --> 30:28.366
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

30:28.566 --> 30:31.486
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

30:31.686 --> 30:33.366
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

30:33.566 --> 30:36.646
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

30:36.846 --> 30:38.246
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

30:38.446 --> 30:42.166
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

30:42.366 --> 30:44.126
so don't listen to him."

30:44.326 --> 30:46.446
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

30:46.686 --> 30:48.246
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

30:48.446 --> 30:50.406
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

30:50.606 --> 30:53.966
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

30:54.166 --> 30:57.726
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

30:57.966 --> 31:00.926
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

31:01.126 --> 31:02.886
He said, "There's very simple thing that

31:03.086 --> 31:07.806
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

31:08.046 --> 31:11.566
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

31:11.806 --> 31:13.366
then I'll be saved."

31:13.566 --> 31:17.006
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

31:17.206 --> 31:18.726
"Already he doesn't love us

31:18.966 --> 31:20.966
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

31:21.166 --> 31:24.926
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

31:25.126 --> 31:28.006
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

31:28.206 --> 31:29.646
it's better to forget about it."

31:29.846 --> 31:32.166
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

31:32.366 --> 31:35.766
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

31:35.966 --> 31:38.966
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

31:39.166 --> 31:42.206
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

31:42.406 --> 31:44.686
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

31:44.926 --> 31:47.206
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

31:47.406 --> 31:49.766
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

31:49.966 --> 31:52.606
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

31:52.806 --> 31:55.846
and he said to her that,

31:56.046 --> 31:59.126
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

31:59.326 --> 32:04.326
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

32:04.886 --> 32:07.366
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

32:07.686 --> 32:10.406
for that pain, of course, why not?"

32:11.206 --> 32:16.846
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

32:17.086 --> 32:19.046
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

32:19.286 --> 32:21.366
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

32:21.606 --> 32:23.366
he has no sense of sin at all.

32:23.606 --> 32:25.646
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

32:25.886 --> 32:27.206
what am I to worry about sins.

32:27.406 --> 32:30.566
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

32:30.766 --> 32:31.886
this is his worry."

32:32.166 --> 32:34.686
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

32:34.886 --> 32:37.206
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

32:37.446 --> 32:40.246
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

32:40.446 --> 32:42.606
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

32:42.846 --> 32:46.126
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

32:46.366 --> 32:49.206
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

32:49.406 --> 32:51.126
He said, "You'll understand just now."

32:51.406 --> 32:53.686
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

32:53.926 --> 32:58.926
you see Radha's feet were dusted

32:59.126 --> 33:01.126
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

33:01.326 --> 33:07.566
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

33:07.766 --> 33:10.246
you see, the soil is yellowish

33:10.446 --> 33:14.606
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

33:14.806 --> 33:17.086
which she removed and took it.

33:17.286 --> 33:22.326
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

33:22.806 --> 33:26.366
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

33:26.566 --> 33:31.326
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

33:31.566 --> 33:33.606
on the lotus of his heart.

33:33.806 --> 33:39.806
The lotus had the pollen,

33:40.286 --> 33:42.326
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

33:42.526 --> 33:44.206
and was making it yellow.

33:44.526 --> 33:47.926
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

33:48.126 --> 33:54.126
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

33:56.246 --> 34:00.766
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

34:01.006 --> 34:03.966
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

34:04.206 --> 34:07.526
They have to be Radha to understand him.

34:07.766 --> 34:10.006
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

34:10.246 --> 34:12.966
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

34:13.206 --> 34:18.846
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

34:19.046 --> 34:22.246
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

34:22.526 --> 34:25.646
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

34:25.886 --> 34:28.446
give him the the power and everybody danced.

34:28.686 --> 34:32.246
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

34:32.526 --> 34:35.966
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

34:36.166 --> 34:40.206
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

34:40.446 --> 34:42.286
For a minute you abandon everything."

34:42.526 --> 34:45.366
And that abandonment has now become a,

34:45.606 --> 34:47.486
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

34:47.686 --> 34:51.486
here it has become a year-long Holi.

34:51.726 --> 34:53.566
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

34:53.766 --> 34:55.446
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

34:55.686 --> 34:58.926
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

34:59.126 --> 35:01.726
And that's why I think, what happens that

35:01.926 --> 35:05.806
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

35:06.046 --> 35:09.046
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

35:09.286 --> 35:12.286
And once they get into you, you get funny,

35:12.486 --> 35:14.006
you don't know why you behave like this,

35:14.206 --> 35:16.566
why things work out that way.

35:16.846 --> 35:18.726
This is why we have to understand

35:18.926 --> 35:21.566
that we have to be attractive to God.

35:21.806 --> 35:26.126
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

35:26.406 --> 35:30.126
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.286
So May God Bless You.
