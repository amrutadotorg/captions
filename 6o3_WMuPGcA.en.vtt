00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.340
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.100
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:26.140
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.980
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.260
who had no idea about God at all

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.140
because they started a theme

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.140
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.540
So, the birth determined the caste of a person.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.700
Before that,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:03.980
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.780
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.460
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.580
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.100
And that is how also

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.140
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.620
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.540
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
So it was agreed that

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.700
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.900
Gradually, it amounted to this

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.740
that any child born out

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.060
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.940
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.660
Realized souls as their children.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.940
Maybe their own karmas,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.260
maybe the child, anything it is,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.620
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.020
devilish children.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.700
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.180
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.660
or the one who has known the Brahma.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.500
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.020
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.860
by what you do.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.300
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:45.045
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.232
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:55.326
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

00:02:55.806 --> 00:03:02.406
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:07.446
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.646
who can only worship God.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:16.846
So to put another extreme

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:21.046
to what Rama has created,

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.966
to bring people into the centre,

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:28.006
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:30.406
and rigidity of ritualism

00:03:30.726 --> 00:03:36.486
and too much of fundamentalism.

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:38.486
So to put an end to that

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:41.526
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:47.566
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:52.326
So he started a new theme of,

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:58.766
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.366
that such a new theme should come up.

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:06.566
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:09.766
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:13.526
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:20.206
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.926
So, the whole thing is a Leela.

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:27.526
And on this theme he worked out everything

00:04:27.846 --> 00:04:30.886
to establish that it is a play.

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.526
And that is what you see in America,

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:37.886
very common that for people it has become a joke,

00:04:38.126 --> 00:04:40.646
life has become a joke.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.606
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

00:04:43.846 --> 00:04:47.886
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:54.006
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:59.726
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:02.966
But it is a myth with Americans now

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:06.006
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:08.046
you have to have realisation.

00:05:08.286 --> 00:05:11.086
Like if you are standing in the water,

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:18.286
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:24.206
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:28.326
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.606
by asserting itself.

00:05:30.846 --> 00:05:32.726
But if you're in the boat

00:05:33.006 --> 00:05:36.886
then the water that is around is an illusion.

00:05:37.126 --> 00:05:39.566
So, it's the state at which you are.

00:05:39.846 --> 00:05:44.246
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:48.846
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:52.926
It is a reality. So, what they forgot this point,

00:05:53.126 --> 00:05:56.166
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

00:05:56.446 --> 00:06:00.286
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.046
thinking that it's an illusion

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:06.246
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:10.366
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:11.926
this thing should be so

00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:15.486
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:18.926
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:22.926
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

00:06:23.206 --> 00:06:25.326
And some people go to that limit to say

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:28.286
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

00:06:28.526 --> 00:06:30.806
nothing like a evil force.

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:34.726
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

00:06:34.966 --> 00:06:40.806
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:46.086
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

00:06:46.926 --> 00:06:50.846
In that play he was to be destroyed.

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:56.926
So, he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:59.526
what not to be destroyed.

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:03.166
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:06.006
So, to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:09.366
Like even if you think everything is a play,

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:13.806
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.846
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:18.606
like in a drama you sit down

00:07:18.846 --> 00:07:20.926
and you watch everything as a spectator,

00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:27.086
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

00:07:27.486 --> 00:07:31.566
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:34.966
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:37.606
You have a sense of discretion to know

00:07:37.806 --> 00:07:40.366
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

00:07:40.606 --> 00:07:45.166
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:50.166
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:53.566
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.886
you're involved in it. So, it is not,

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.926
for you do not know the discretion

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:00.726
between the tragedy and the comedy.

00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:04.006
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:07.726
if you do your job well then, it's a comedy,

00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:10.806
otherwise it's a tragedy.

00:08:11.326 --> 00:08:15.086
So, there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

00:08:15.326 --> 00:08:18.926
another of the one who is in it.

00:08:19.246 --> 00:08:21.886
So, one has to understand in that light,

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:25.046
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:30.286
he was meaning for him, not for others.

00:08:30.846 --> 00:08:32.286
For him it is a play.

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:36.286
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

00:08:36.486 --> 00:08:39.646
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

00:08:39.846 --> 00:08:42.646
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:48.166
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

00:08:48.526 --> 00:08:51.806
So, to him it was a play, everything was a play

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:56.726
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

00:08:57.206 --> 00:09:02.046
So, the first thing if you are

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:04.526
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

00:09:04.726 --> 00:09:09.046
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:14.126
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

00:09:14.326 --> 00:09:16.686
You cannot say what is wisdom.

00:09:16.926 --> 00:09:20.806
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

00:09:21.006 --> 00:09:24.366
Wisdom is a temperament,

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.846
is a quality of a personality

00:09:28.206 --> 00:09:33.206
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:37.446
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:39.446
who are not traditional.

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:42.566
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:45.886
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:50.126
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:52.846
so he did not need any tradition at all.

00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:56.206
But for you, you have to understand from the people

00:09:56.406 --> 00:09:58.566
who have tradition what is wisdom.

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:03.006
So, we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:08.526
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

00:10:08.726 --> 00:10:13.406
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:20.286
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.326
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:26.966
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:31.046
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:34.446
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

00:10:34.646 --> 00:10:37.206
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:38.846
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:42.286
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:10:42.646 --> 00:10:46.606
So, because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:51.406
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

00:10:51.606 --> 00:10:54.566
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

00:10:54.766 --> 00:10:55.686
instead of

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:58.046
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

00:10:58.246 --> 00:11:00.846
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:04.726
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

00:11:04.926 --> 00:11:07.966
spoiling the other chakra also.

00:11:08.206 --> 00:11:15.886
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:18.726
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

00:11:18.966 --> 00:11:22.926
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

00:11:23.446 --> 00:11:25.686
That's the best way to escape it.

00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:30.366
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

00:11:30.686 --> 00:11:33.286
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:36.246
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:40.166
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

00:11:40.446 --> 00:11:41.486
Now the another side

00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:44.526
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:46.806
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

00:11:47.046 --> 00:11:51.366
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

00:11:52.126 --> 00:11:54.926
So, "What's wrong?"

00:11:56.606 --> 00:12:00.326
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.286
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:07.926
So, it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:10.286
for example they paint their hair.

00:12:10.526 --> 00:12:13.926
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:19.086
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:21.806
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

00:12:22.006 --> 00:12:25.006
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:31.726
They cannot even create a little ant,

00:12:32.006 --> 00:12:35.646
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

00:12:36.086 --> 00:12:38.406
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:40.086
So, this is the right side thing

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:46.606
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:51.926
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:56.526
that eyes are the ones

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:59.566
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.366
the power of Shri Krishna.

00:13:01.646 --> 00:13:06.886
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:09.846
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

00:13:10.046 --> 00:13:11.726
if he has Krishna consciousness,

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:14.686
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

00:13:14.886 --> 00:13:18.286
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:19.966
should be able to cure anyone.

00:13:20.206 --> 00:13:22.846
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

00:13:23.086 --> 00:13:24.886
if it has Krishna consciousness,

00:13:25.126 --> 00:13:28.966
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:33.486
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:38.006
So, on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

00:13:38.246 --> 00:13:39.286
When you feel guilty,

00:13:39.526 --> 00:13:42.526
they try to find out some method of expression.

00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:44.526
So they say they go to some guru

00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:47.326
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:50.006
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

00:13:50.206 --> 00:13:53.926
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:57.166
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

00:13:57.366 --> 00:13:59.686
you get completely caught-up.

00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:02.086
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:05.766
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

00:14:06.006 --> 00:14:09.526
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:14.926
who get anginas and also who get cancer

00:14:15.126 --> 00:14:17.286
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

00:14:17.486 --> 00:14:20.166
without the connection with the Divine.

00:14:20.406 --> 00:14:23.046
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

00:14:23.246 --> 00:14:26.046
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:29.566
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:34.966
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:39.646
without feeling the power of that mantra.

00:14:40.326 --> 00:14:42.486
So, in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

00:14:42.686 --> 00:14:45.446
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

00:14:45.686 --> 00:14:48.046
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

00:14:48.286 --> 00:14:51.566
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:53.486
They think they're very responsible people

00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:55.806
and do all irresponsible things.

00:14:56.006 --> 00:14:58.526
So, when you want to spoil that chakra,

00:14:58.726 --> 00:15:02.726
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:07.366
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:13.486
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:17.286
When you start saying in the ego form that,

00:15:17.526 --> 00:15:22.726
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:27.086
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:31.166
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

00:15:31.446 --> 00:15:33.046
then the whole thing disappears

00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:37.326
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:40.006
Islam is nothing but surrender.

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:44.046
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

00:15:44.286 --> 00:15:49.006
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

00:15:49.246 --> 00:15:52.046
So, you play the melody of God.

00:15:52.246 --> 00:15:56.526
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

00:15:56.766 --> 00:15:59.086
Every time you go back to discretion.

00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:01.726
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:05.006
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:06.846
Like somebody wants to drink.

00:16:07.046 --> 00:16:12.366
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

00:16:13.326 --> 00:16:16.326
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:21.406
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:26.846
So, this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:32.886
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

00:16:33.086 --> 00:16:36.126
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

00:16:36.366 --> 00:16:38.086
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

00:16:38.326 --> 00:16:41.206
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:44.326
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:47.246
And then whatever you do has a justification.

00:16:47.486 --> 00:16:52.726
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:54.846
they actually robbed the other people of their land

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:57.406
and now very nicely settled down.

00:16:57.646 --> 00:16:58.886
Now, when I say that,

00:16:59.126 --> 00:17:01.606
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

00:17:01.846 --> 00:17:05.846
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.366
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:11.006
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

00:17:11.246 --> 00:17:14.006
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

00:17:14.246 --> 00:17:19.526
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

00:17:19.726 --> 00:17:22.286
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

00:17:22.486 --> 00:17:25.006
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

00:17:25.246 --> 00:17:28.406
This is the way you face and not just to say,

00:17:28.606 --> 00:17:32.886
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

00:17:33.126 --> 00:17:35.366
But what are you doing about it?

00:17:35.606 --> 00:17:39.166
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

00:17:39.366 --> 00:17:42.886
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:45.206
I said, "What did you do there?

00:17:45.446 --> 00:17:47.846
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

00:17:48.086 --> 00:17:50.486
at least you did not go to fight there.

00:17:50.686 --> 00:17:52.326
Why did you feel guilty about it?"

00:17:52.566 --> 00:17:54.686
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:59.846
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:02.486
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:07.086
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

00:18:07.286 --> 00:18:12.206
that we suddenly become a personality

00:18:12.446 --> 00:18:15.566
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

00:18:15.846 --> 00:18:20.606
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:23.846
Alright, how?

00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:29.046
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

00:18:29.326 --> 00:18:32.966
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:35.726
Both are headaches to the whole world.

00:18:35.966 --> 00:18:39.126
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

00:18:39.486 --> 00:18:43.286
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

00:18:43.606 --> 00:18:50.046
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

00:18:50.486 --> 00:18:55.246
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:57.926
Children and father cannot live together.

00:18:58.126 --> 00:18:59.886
Mother cannot live with the children.

00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:03.166
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

00:19:03.406 --> 00:19:07.446
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:12.566
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

00:19:12.846 --> 00:19:14.846
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

00:19:15.046 --> 00:19:17.326
There's no unison, there is no concord.

00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:21.246
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:19:21.446 --> 00:19:25.846
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

00:19:26.046 --> 00:19:31.486
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

00:19:31.726 --> 00:19:34.926
Even the destruction of evil is important,

00:19:35.246 --> 00:19:38.326
even the killing of the evil is important.

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:42.006
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

00:19:42.206 --> 00:19:43.606
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

00:19:43.806 --> 00:19:47.926
and should have been put in charge of God?

00:19:49.086 --> 00:19:51.366
He's saved by killing him.

00:19:51.606 --> 00:19:53.366
Because he was destroyed,

00:19:53.566 --> 00:19:58.486
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:02.246
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

00:20:02.446 --> 00:20:05.726
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

00:20:05.926 --> 00:20:08.246
evil is to be finished.

00:20:08.526 --> 00:20:09.606
So, what you have to pray

00:20:09.806 --> 00:20:12.606
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:17.326
all the destruction of the world,

00:20:17.526 --> 00:20:21.086
all the minds which build up our destruction,

00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.926
please try to neutralise it."

00:20:24.126 --> 00:20:26.446
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

00:20:26.646 --> 00:20:27.446
Instead of that,

00:20:27.646 --> 00:20:32.606
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

00:20:32.846 --> 00:20:34.966
That's not correct . You have to stand up

00:20:35.206 --> 00:20:37.126
and you have to say, "That it's wrong",

00:20:37.366 --> 00:20:40.726
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

00:20:40.966 --> 00:20:42.246
we have no right."

00:20:42.446 --> 00:20:47.006
So when Krishna told Arjuna that, "You kill everyone

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:49.766
who are related to you, who are your friends

00:20:50.006 --> 00:20:55.046
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

00:20:55.246 --> 00:20:57.406
It was Shri Krishna who said,

00:20:57.686 --> 00:21:01.926
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:04.446
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:09.726
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

00:21:10.806 --> 00:21:14.806
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

00:21:15.006 --> 00:21:17.046
which started killing everyone,

00:21:17.246 --> 00:21:21.286
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

00:21:21.646 --> 00:21:23.246
You have no sense of right and wrong.

00:21:23.486 --> 00:21:26.926
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

00:21:27.126 --> 00:21:29.406
First of all try to save instead of killing.

00:21:29.646 --> 00:21:34.126
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.646
people are getting drowned

00:21:35.846 --> 00:21:38.006
and you find that you have to save the people.

00:21:38.246 --> 00:21:42.086
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

00:21:42.286 --> 00:21:44.206
There is no occasion for killing now.

00:21:44.406 --> 00:21:47.446
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

00:21:47.646 --> 00:21:50.126
What you have to do is to save people,

00:21:50.326 --> 00:21:54.406
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:59.206
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

00:21:59.446 --> 00:22:02.646
You just move them out. Take them away.

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:04.046
Have nothing to do with them.

00:22:04.246 --> 00:22:07.406
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

00:22:07.646 --> 00:22:11.286
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:11.526 --> 00:22:15.126
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

00:22:15.366 --> 00:22:19.046
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

00:22:19.286 --> 00:22:22.606
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:25.966
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:30.406
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

00:22:30.606 --> 00:22:32.966
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:33.886
you don't take up

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:37.766
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

00:22:38.006 --> 00:22:40.926
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:43.246
I've seen people become very aggressive,

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:45.086
they talk very aggressively.

00:22:45.286 --> 00:22:48.406
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:52.486
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:55.206
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

00:22:55.446 --> 00:22:58.246
Very common.

00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:03.886
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:06.726
Then you start aggressing each other also,

00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:09.766
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

00:23:09.966 --> 00:23:10.886
You're not to aggress.

00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:13.846
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

00:23:14.046 --> 00:23:17.166
What is discretion is diplomacy.

00:23:17.446 --> 00:23:20.566
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:22.846
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

00:23:23.046 --> 00:23:24.766
this man is dangerous,

00:23:25.006 --> 00:23:26.366
he is troubling you,

00:23:26.566 --> 00:23:28.246
now if you have a proper sense,

00:23:28.446 --> 00:23:31.886
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

00:23:32.126 --> 00:23:36.926
that there won't be any more discussion or destruction.

00:23:37.126 --> 00:23:41.766
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

00:23:42.006 --> 00:23:44.726
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

00:23:44.966 --> 00:23:49.286
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

00:23:49.646 --> 00:23:51.646
So must have discretion, must understand.

00:23:51.846 --> 00:23:54.846
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

00:23:55.046 --> 00:23:56.926
where you find somebody is telling you,

00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:59.846
"You see, this person has said this about you."

00:24:00.086 --> 00:24:02.566
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

00:24:02.806 --> 00:24:05.286
"That person has said this about you."

00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:07.206
Then you start quarelling

00:24:07.406 --> 00:24:11.566
instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

00:24:11.726 --> 00:24:14.686
"Why, why this is happening,

00:24:14.926 --> 00:24:17.366
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:19.166
We were friends, what has happened?"

00:24:19.366 --> 00:24:22.286
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

00:24:22.486 --> 00:24:28.846
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

00:24:29.086 --> 00:24:33.846
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:36.126
delicate, beautiful.

00:24:36.326 --> 00:24:40.006
Nobody should notice

00:24:40.206 --> 00:24:46.286
that you have been in any way effective,

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.206
and that's how you'll work it out.

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:53.246
So, the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

00:24:53.446 --> 00:24:57.006
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

00:24:57.406 --> 00:24:59.886
So, he plays.

00:25:00.086 --> 00:25:02.126
Give you an example how he plays.

00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:07.686
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

00:25:08.086 --> 00:25:13.166
who had a blessing from Shiva

00:25:13.406 --> 00:25:19.486
that nobody can kill him.

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:26.286
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:30.046
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

00:25:30.486 --> 00:25:34.966
So, there was a saint who had a blessing

00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:38.886
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

00:25:39.086 --> 00:25:43.006
sleep in your yoga sleep,

00:25:43.206 --> 00:25:46.086
and once you open your eyes

00:25:46.286 --> 00:25:51.766
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

00:25:54.006 --> 00:25:57.246
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

00:25:57.526 --> 00:26:00.406
He was fighting this devil

00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:04.286
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

00:26:04.486 --> 00:26:08.326
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

00:26:08.726 --> 00:26:11.486
So he started running away from the field,

00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:13.726
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.486
the one who runs away from the battle field,

00:26:16.726 --> 00:26:19.326
is regarded as something really derogatory,

00:26:19.526 --> 00:26:23.166
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:24.286
So, he didn't mind,

00:26:24.486 --> 00:26:28.126
he ran away and then this devil started following him

00:26:28.326 --> 00:26:29.446
And he went into the cave

00:26:29.646 --> 00:26:33.806
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

00:26:34.446 --> 00:26:37.406
And he removed his shawl

00:26:37.606 --> 00:26:41.726
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

00:26:42.006 --> 00:26:43.686
and hid himself.

00:26:43.926 --> 00:26:45.966
So, this rakshasa came behind him.

00:26:46.166 --> 00:26:49.846
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:53.726
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

00:26:53.966 --> 00:26:56.006
Come along now, open your eyes!"

00:26:56.246 --> 00:27:02.206
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

00:27:02.446 --> 00:27:05.246
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

00:27:05.446 --> 00:27:08.486
and he just was burnt.

00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:15.286
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

00:27:15.566 --> 00:27:18.886
That is the sign of diplomacy.

00:27:19.086 --> 00:27:24.286
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

00:27:24.486 --> 00:27:27.086
the whole discretion, what he should do,

00:27:27.286 --> 00:27:29.006
what is right, what is wrong,

00:27:29.246 --> 00:27:32.806
is he doesn't have this problem.

00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:37.926
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:39.646
So, he played a trick .

00:27:39.846 --> 00:27:45.606
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:51.846
And he made one king - you see-

00:27:52.806 --> 00:28:00.086
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

00:28:00.286 --> 00:28:02.806
But he could never touch them.

00:28:03.006 --> 00:28:05.846
So, Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

00:28:06.046 --> 00:28:07.966
He has to have justification also;

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:10.766
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

00:28:11.086 --> 00:28:13.646
So he killed this king, brought all these women

00:28:13.886 --> 00:28:19.726
and they all became his wives, so-called.

00:28:21.286 --> 00:28:23.406
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

00:28:23.606 --> 00:28:26.126
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

00:28:26.326 --> 00:28:29.566
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:32.766
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:37.046
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

00:28:37.286 --> 00:28:40.726
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

00:28:40.926 --> 00:28:45.086
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

00:28:45.286 --> 00:28:49.406
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:52.726
meaning the power of creation,

00:28:52.966 --> 00:28:55.046
because creation has been done already.

00:28:55.286 --> 00:28:58.246
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

00:28:58.446 --> 00:29:00.286
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

00:29:00.486 --> 00:29:02.446
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:05.886
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

00:29:06.086 --> 00:29:09.086
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

00:29:09.326 --> 00:29:12.446
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

00:29:12.686 --> 00:29:14.406
and she opens her left side.

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:16.486
And in front of her

00:29:16.726 --> 00:29:20.726
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

00:29:20.966 --> 00:29:23.606
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:26.086
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:30.526
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

00:29:30.726 --> 00:29:33.646
But in this one, the one that they have here

00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.806
is the child is kept underneath this,

00:29:36.046 --> 00:29:39.326
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

00:29:39.526 --> 00:29:43.526
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

00:29:43.726 --> 00:29:46.526
So I'll tell you the last story about her

00:29:46.726 --> 00:29:53.166
which will conclude this talk about

00:29:53.406 --> 00:29:55.126
Radha and Shri Krishna.

00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:57.806
That one day,

00:29:58.606 --> 00:30:04.246
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

00:30:04.486 --> 00:30:06.206
and Narada said, "See,

00:30:06.446 --> 00:30:08.926
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

00:30:09.126 --> 00:30:11.406
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

00:30:11.606 --> 00:30:16.246
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:21.166
So, the rumour, you see, went into the women.

00:30:21.406 --> 00:30:25.126
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

00:30:25.326 --> 00:30:28.366
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

00:30:28.566 --> 00:30:31.486
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

00:30:31.686 --> 00:30:33.366
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

00:30:33.566 --> 00:30:36.646
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

00:30:36.846 --> 00:30:38.246
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

00:30:38.446 --> 00:30:42.166
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

00:30:42.366 --> 00:30:44.126
so don't listen to him."

00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:46.446
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

00:30:46.686 --> 00:30:48.246
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

00:30:48.446 --> 00:30:50.406
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:53.966
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:57.726
They said, "What's the matter? what sort of a pain it is,

00:30:57.966 --> 00:31:00.926
what can we do to overcome this pain?"

00:31:01.126 --> 00:31:02.886
He said, "There's very simple thing that

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:07.806
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

00:31:08.046 --> 00:31:11.566
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

00:31:11.806 --> 00:31:13.366
then I'll be saved."

00:31:13.566 --> 00:31:17.006
So, these ladies used their brains. They said that

00:31:17.206 --> 00:31:18.726
"Already he doesn't love us

00:31:18.966 --> 00:31:20.966
and then if we give him the dust of our feet,

00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:24.926
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

00:31:25.126 --> 00:31:28.006
So, what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:29.646
it's better to forget about it."

00:31:29.846 --> 00:31:32.166
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

00:31:32.366 --> 00:31:35.766
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:38.966
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:42.206
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

00:31:42.406 --> 00:31:44.686
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

00:31:44.926 --> 00:31:47.206
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:49.766
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:52.606
and this is the medicine." So, he went to Radhaji

00:31:52.806 --> 00:31:55.846
and he said to her that,

00:31:56.046 --> 00:31:59.126
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

00:31:59.326 --> 00:32:04.326
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

00:32:04.886 --> 00:32:07.366
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

00:32:07.686 --> 00:32:10.406
for that pain, of course, why not?"

00:32:11.206 --> 00:32:16.846
So, he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:19.046
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

00:32:19.286 --> 00:32:21.366
He said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.366
he has no sense of sin at all.

00:32:23.606 --> 00:32:25.646
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

00:32:25.886 --> 00:32:27.206
what am I to worry about sins.

00:32:27.406 --> 00:32:30.566
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

00:32:30.766 --> 00:32:31.886
this is his worry."

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.686
So, he took the dust of Radha's feet

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.206
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

00:32:37.446 --> 00:32:40.246
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

00:32:40.446 --> 00:32:42.606
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:46.126
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

00:32:46.366 --> 00:32:49.206
He said, "That I know." So, he said, "But how do you explain it?"

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:51.126
He said, "You'll understand just now."

00:32:51.406 --> 00:32:53.686
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

00:32:53.926 --> 00:32:58.926
you see Radha's feet were dusted

00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:01.126
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

00:33:01.326 --> 00:33:07.566
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

00:33:07.766 --> 00:33:10.246
you see, the soil is yellowish

00:33:10.446 --> 00:33:14.606
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

00:33:14.806 --> 00:33:17.086
which she removed and took it.

00:33:17.286 --> 00:33:22.326
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

00:33:22.806 --> 00:33:26.366
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

00:33:26.566 --> 00:33:31.326
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

00:33:31.566 --> 00:33:33.606
on the lotus of his heart.

00:33:33.806 --> 00:33:39.806
The lotus had the pollen,

00:33:40.286 --> 00:33:42.326
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

00:33:42.526 --> 00:33:44.206
and was making it yellow.

00:33:44.526 --> 00:33:47.926
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:54.126
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

00:33:56.246 --> 00:34:00.766
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:03.966
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

00:34:04.206 --> 00:34:07.526
They have to be Radha to understand him.

00:34:07.766 --> 00:34:10.006
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

00:34:10.246 --> 00:34:12.966
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

00:34:13.206 --> 00:34:18.846
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

00:34:19.046 --> 00:34:22.246
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

00:34:22.526 --> 00:34:25.646
So, he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:28.446
give him the the power and everybody danced.

00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:32.246
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

00:34:32.526 --> 00:34:35.966
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:40.206
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

00:34:40.446 --> 00:34:42.286
For a minute you abandon everything."

00:34:42.526 --> 00:34:45.366
And that abandonment has now become a,

00:34:45.606 --> 00:34:47.486
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:51.486
here it has become a year-long Holi.

00:34:51.726 --> 00:34:53.566
So, people are busy with a year-long Holi

00:34:53.766 --> 00:34:55.446
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

00:34:55.686 --> 00:34:58.926
So, what will be the situation of such a place?

00:34:59.126 --> 00:35:01.726
And that's why I think, what happens that

00:35:01.926 --> 00:35:05.806
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

00:35:06.046 --> 00:35:09.046
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

00:35:09.286 --> 00:35:12.286
And once they get into you, you get funny,

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:14.006
you don't know why you behave like this,

00:35:14.206 --> 00:35:16.566
why things work out that way.

00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:18.726
This is why we have to understand

00:35:18.926 --> 00:35:21.566
that we have to be attractive to God.

00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:26.126
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

00:35:26.406 --> 00:35:30.126
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

00:35:30.606 --> 00:35:33.286
So May God Bless You.
