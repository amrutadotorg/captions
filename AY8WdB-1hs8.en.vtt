“A Disaster or a Solution to Come” (Resurrection
Time)

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.750
Public Program
Caxton Hall, London, UK

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:14.780
August 16, 1982

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.869
These days, when you read newspapers, you
meet people, you get the feeling that everybody

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:36.510
is waiting for a disaster, or for some sort
of a solution, that has to come.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:51.710
This feeling that comes to us is also something
very innate, something from our unconscious,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.880
because the situation that we see around seems
to be quite dangerous.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:13.640
Not that we get upset with the financial problems
or with other mundane type of problems that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:33.610
we have had, but what upsets people is – that
human beings have become just like machines.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.890
They’re running mad.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.680
They’re running morning till evening.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.990
They have no time for each other.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:58.079
There is no feeling sometimes to understand
each other, and, as if we are all becoming

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.960
insensitive to each other’s problem.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:24.760
Apart from that, those people who are intelligent
and loving people, feel that people at the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:35.510
helm of affairs do not feel responsible for
the humanity at large.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:45.379
Then the poverty and then other problems,
which are gross, still they bother us too

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:59.220
much – one side, the affluence, another
side the poverty; one side the scientific

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:09.459
approach to life, the other side what science
has created, things like atomic bombs.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.300
All these create a kind of a confusion in
our mind.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.690
Everybody seems to be confused.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.560
They don’t know whether whatever they are
doing is right or wrong, whether they are

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.080
going to the right path or to the wrong path.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.690
Very frustrated, disgusted, one feels sometimes,
and does not know why are we on this Earth.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:51.599
Confusion is the first impression one gets
when one visits our world from outside.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.810
People are absolutely confused, and also very
insecured, extremely insecure.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.830
If you see the rich, they are insecured because
they have too much money.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.120
The poor are insecure because they have no
money.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:20.250
All kinds of insecurities work out a tremendous
world of confusion.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:36.070
Now, let us see how we are created from amoeba
to this stage.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:47.800
We have become human beings without understanding
anything about it, and are we to evolve more,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.940
to achieve something higher, to \get out of
this confusion, or are we to be dissolved

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.470
with this confusion in our mind?

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.170
This confusion is important in a way.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.570
If there is no confusion, we are not going
to seek any solution out of it, and that is

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:21.610
why people feel that some solution has to
come out.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.420
We are confused because we have no absolute
values.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.690
We have not felt the absolute values.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.490
Somebody says, “To be honest is a very good
idea,” but we find that, “No, if we are

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.639
very honest it doesn’t pay.”

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:47.789
Some say to be devoted and dedicated and loyal
is the best policy, but no, it does not work

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.520
out that way.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.449
But there must be something that decides whether
we are right or wrong.

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:06.630
That’s what we think; it has to be like
that.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.160
After all, this whole creation was created
with such love and care, with such delicacy.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:21.520
If you are a doctor you will see how beautifully
you are created inside, every nerve, how beautifully

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:30.520
it grew into a sensitive cell; how the whole
body was created, how these eyes were created

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.669
with such accuracy.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:44.930
We see cameras and cameras in this world created
by us; no camera can be compared with our

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.930
eyes.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.580
Such a tremendous machinery has been created
within us with such care, discarding many

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.580
others.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.490
Many have gone out of the circulation of evolution,
and then, this man, the great personality

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.889
of a human being, came out of it.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.919
For what?

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:08.919
To be confused?

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.310
To be upset?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.940
To be insecured?

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.110
How can that be?

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.730
It’s not true.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.090
It cannot be.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.220
After all, why are we human beings?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.530
God has made us with a purpose, no doubt about
it.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:31.270
There is a purpose in giving us this kind
of a body, this erect body.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:39.030
There is a purpose in everything that we have
today as human beings.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.440
Even the confusion, as I said.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.210
Today is the day for people to seek.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.740
Thousands of people are seeking.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.620
They are fed up with whatever they have been
doing – they are fed up with it.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.740
They are not seeking out of fashion.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.080
Many people think that it’s a fashion, they’re
a lost race and they are this and they are

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080
that.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.330
It’s not true.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:08.350
There were never so many seekers as there
are today, and they are seeking.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:13.830
Maybe they do not know what they are seeking,
but they are not satisfied with their state

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:19.560
of affairs, and they are seeking something
higher.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.610
And that “higher” is the Absolute, is
the Absolute.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:31.759
Now, this “higher,” if it is the Absolute,
everything must relate to it.

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:35.060
Absolute point means everything is related.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:41.399
For example, if you have a one meter here,
if you say it is five meters, that means this

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:52.230
is five times than the gold rod you have got
in Paris which is called as “one meter.”

00:08:52.230 --> 00:09:01.019
Everything has to be related to that absolute,
and that relationship then establishes the

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:04.100
relationship with each other.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:17.270
For example, on the religious side if you
see, there have been so many religions, one

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.340
after another.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:31.750
We had Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism,
Buddhism, Jainism, Islam – so many religions.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.950
They all must relate to Absolute.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:45.390
We must find out how many “meters” each
one of them are; where do they stand in relation

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.100
to this Absolute – has to be.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:54.480
It cannot be just something, like people said
“Oh, we’ve got the Absolute, Mother, we

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.209
are realized souls, we are twice born.”

00:09:58.209 --> 00:09:59.760
“Then how do you say?”

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.580
“Because I see a light in my head.”

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.830
What does that mean?

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:09.440
It is not absolute when you can see the light
as it is there.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:19.660
If you faint also you might see a little light
short-circuiting there.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.680
There could be some others who say “Yes,
I’ve got the Knowledge.”

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.680
“How?

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.740
What is it?”

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.250
“Because, Mother, I don’t think anymore.”

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.730
So I said, “You must be drunk.”

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:45.529
Everything that we seek has to be related
to everything else.

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.029
Otherwise solution won’t be there.

00:10:48.029 --> 00:10:58.209
To find the absolute value of anything we
must know that there’s nothing else but

00:10:58.209 --> 00:10:59.209
that.

00:10:59.209 --> 00:11:13.070
That’s the only thing, that’s one, that’s
a unity; it cannot have a parallel.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.850
Some people jump in the street and say that
“We’ve found the Last.”

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.000
Then why are you jumping?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:32.480
Now, that absolute thing has to be something
that should come in your awareness if it is

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.300
a evolutionary process.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:46.019
In our evolution, whatever we have achieved
has come in our awareness.

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:54.230
That means it should become a part and parcel
of our awareness, part and parcel of our awareness.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:05.040
Like as I can see you, I can feel you, in
the same way you should be able to see, and

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.570
through that light we should be able to explain
each and every thing.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:18.730
For example, in this room, if there is darkness
and I can’t see you, I don’t know who

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:25.060
is sitting where, what is the relationship
of everyone?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:33.839
But when the light comes in, you immediately
know, that this gentleman is third on the

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.810
row, or that gentleman is fifth on the row.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:44.760
Apart from that, you know what sort of a shape
and a color the person has.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:53.460
Whatever could be seen through these eyes,
one can see if there is light.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:13:01.540
But this light is not sufficient because this
we have already got it, there’s nothing

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.220
more in our awareness with that.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:16.589
We have to think of a light, which gives us
a complete idea as to what is the relationship

00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:21.190
between us and our Creator.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:28.641
What is the relationship between all those
who came on this earth to tell us about that

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:32.000
relationship?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.089
What is the relationship of human beings with
each other, with different countries, with

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:46.910
different people, with different faces, races
and creed?

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:55.019
What is the relationship between man and the
nature?

00:13:55.019 --> 00:14:01.170
What is the relationship between man and all
the elements around?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:08.510
Here we just hang in the air, we don’t know
if we have any relationship whatsoever with

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.800
the Sun.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.690
He gives us light, but what about us?

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.360
Have we any control over the Sun, or not?

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.260
Is there any subtle connection between us
and Him, or not?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:31.160
All these connections have to be established
in these absolute findings, otherwise that’s

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.380
not absolute.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:39.670
We should not be satisfied with something
extremely cheap, which you can buy with money,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.540
that’s the cheap thing – I think that’s
the cheapest thing – very easy to buy something

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.820
with money.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.760
People may say “We have no money.”

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.790
It’s not the point, because those who have
money can buy.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.073
But this must be something that cannot be
bought by money.

00:14:56.073 --> 00:14:57.073
People don’t understand.

00:14:57.073 --> 00:15:05.110
When I went to America first, they said “Mother
how are you saying that you can’t take money

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.110
for this?”

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.370
I mean, imagine, the absurdity.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:13.090
Such an absurd thing they could not understand.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.120
You cannot pay for it.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.230
Now you cannot manage it also and maneuver
it.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.970
If you could then it’s man-made.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:35.230
It has to be something natural, spontaneous,
living, because man can’t do living work.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.170
Otherwise you should not bother.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.970
You should say “I am not bothered, I don’t
care for it.”

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:51.620
That’s how it should be, but we get very
much satisfied with something that’s absolutely

00:15:51.620 --> 00:16:03.410
easily available to us, that is what we can
really pay for, or if we stand on our heads

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.240
we think we should get that.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:15.070
I asked one gentleman, who used to stand on
his head every day, I said “Why are you

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:16.070
doing it?.”

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.070
He said “I’m seeking God.”

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:23.220
I said “What makes you think that by standing
on your head you’ll get to God?”

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.589
He says “Because none of the animals do
that, so to be a higher animal, I was thinking

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:33.380
if I would stand on my head, it would be a
better idea.”

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:41.170
But it can’t be, just think of it – some
sort of physical acrobat, I mean so many can

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.580
do it.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.110
In the circus people do all kinds of things,
if you see them the way they jump onto a horses,

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.110
it’s surprising.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.940
It’s not easy to do.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.529
They acquire all kinds of techniques by which
they can jump onto a horse, walk on a little

00:16:56.529 --> 00:17:07.810
string of wire, all kinds of things they can
do, but do you think that is something divine?

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:18.850
So, this absolute point has to be something
spontaneous, something living should come

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:24.539
in our awareness; must express in our awareness.

00:17:24.539 --> 00:17:33.220
And when we talk that word “awareness,”
we must understand that human awareness itself

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:41.100
we have not understood.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.690
The difference between us and animals is tremendous.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.580
It’s tremendous.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.210
They don’t understand so many things.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:18:03.650
They don’t understand beauty, they don’t
understand insurance, they do not understand

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:11.150
many of these hangs-up that we have gathered.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:18.289
So many odd things we have done, they don’t
understand.

00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:26.919
Human beings have a capacity to harness the
nature for their own purpose, to use the nature

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:33.260
for their own purpose, which animals can’t
do.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:53.049
Despite all that, we feel so powerless, so
helpless, and singled out.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:19:02.250
But if this creation has any meaning, that
light has to come, that light has to work

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.910
out.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:07.700
It must work.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:17.789
But, now, as you have been already told about
the Kundalini, this instrument’s within

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:21.720
you, is there already waiting.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:27.890
The time has come, the maturity it has reached,
that you have to have your realization – because

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:35.460
of that maturity in a human mind that you
are seeking, because you are so matured now,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.280
that you can’t do without it.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:47.990
Say, when you are a child, you don’t understand
many things, and then you grow up.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:54.200
You grow up, reach a point, say at a point
where you understand the marriage, then you

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.380
want to marry.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:06.500
Then you reach a point where you want to have
a house, you try to have a house.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:16.760
But this maturity that is coming to us is
extremely subtle, many-sided, encompassing

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.590
many aspects of life, I should say all of
them.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:30.030
It’s not only one side that is going to
mature.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:40.340
It’s not that just few leaves are going
to show out from a growing tree.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:47.900
It’s not only that some new branches are
going to shoot out.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.130
It’s not that many flowers are going to
show.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:21:02.440
It’s that the flowers have so matured now
that they have to become the fruit.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:12.570
That maturity has come to us through our trial-error
method, our own.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.340
This is done by human beings.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:22.100
Animals did the same for their evolution,
and human beings also have done this, their

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:32.289
trial and error – again they make mistakes,
they try to correct it, again they try, and

00:21:32.289 --> 00:21:34.190
again make mistakes.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.230
That’s how we have matured now.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:48.120
We have reached a stage of understanding the
beauty of balance in life.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:58.799
We are trying to stabilize ourselves, and
the insecurity is working out – a negative

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:05.140
method of course, but a challenge, challenge
to your maturity, whether you are matured

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:15.750
or not, whether your seeking is true or not.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:30.990
The maturity can be judged only when you are
there to become the fruit.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.630
You have to become the fruit.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.320
You have to become the Spirit.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.960
You have to be the Spirit.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.470
You have to be born again.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:50.380
But many have said that, many are saying that.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:56.920
They say that they are already reborn.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.299
But what is the difference?

00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:10.330
The difference is, one has an awareness, which
is collectively conscious, which is – he

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:15.860
has become – is the becoming, he’s not
just talking about it, telling about it; is

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.710
the becoming.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:25.929
And the other is the one who just believes
into it.

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:27.309
“I believe….”

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:32.830
Which is this “I” that believes into something?

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.000
[I’m just asking you to sit down.]

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:48.429
Who believes, is the “I” which does not
know itself.

00:23:48.429 --> 00:24:07.290
So just a faith of any kind, is not the real
faith unless and until it is a part of your

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:08.309
awareness.

00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:20.260
“I believe in God,” – many people talk
as if they are obliging God by believing in

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.260
Him.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.440
What does that mean?

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:29.580
“I believe in God,” so all right, you
must be having a balanced life, all right.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.990
But just to believe, but one may ask, “Why?”

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.990
why to believe in God?

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:46.760
Why to have the balance, what is the need
to lead a life which is called so-called,

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.220
“righteous life”?

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.630
Enslaving yourself to these ideas – why?

00:24:52.630 --> 00:25:02.450
One can ask a question of that kind, and many
are asking that question.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:07.920
You have to balance if you have to ascend.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:19.100
But, because of this confusion, one cannot
expect a very balanced life, because everybody

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:26.070
seems to be groping in the dark.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:33.390
Then you can’t believe that the people are
absolutely balanced.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:42.710
You can’t just think that way – that would
be wrong.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:51.620
So they have to have a balance, and they have
to have an ascent.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:59.179
To have the balance, people have tried lots
of things.

00:25:59.179 --> 00:26:06.870
Thousands of years they talked of religion,
they talked of, sustenance, of Ten Commandments,

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:13.529
this thing, that thing; nothing worked out
with human beings.

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:15.870
Everybody jumped out of their balance.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:27.980
So now there has to be a method that automatically
gives you a balance as well as a good ascent

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:35.980
and a happy landings into the Kingdom of God.

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.720
That has to happen.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:44.820
Now, you are all built-in that way, this is
what it is, but again you don’t have that

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.850
faith in Me, neither in what we are saying.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:53.630
Because again: “I believe in Mataji,”
there are many who finish with that.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:58.710
You have to have faith in your Self, in your
Spirit, by experiencing it.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:06.450
It’s a something, a dynamic thing that has
to happen within you – a tremendous thing.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:13.340
It’s nothing something, just your mental
belief that, “Today we are communist, tomorrow

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.730
we are capitalist,” and third day something
else.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:26.279
It’s something that has to become, again
I say “become,” and again become.

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:32.330
And that becoming is now.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.060
The time has come.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:42.220
This is the resurrection time; this is the
Last Judgment, believe it or not.

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:48.500
There is not going to be another time for
that.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:58.070
This is the way we are going to be judged:
our maturity, our balance, our capacity.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:08.321
Many people come to our meetings, few get
their realization, or many get their realization

00:28:08.321 --> 00:28:14.920
– makes no difference to Me, to anyone or
to Sahaja Yog or to you.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:21.529
Because if there are seeds which are just
sprouted and are wasted; they are wasted as

00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:24.960
if they are not sprouted.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.510
They do not grow.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:41.789
They are just like any other seeds which have
not been touched by the Divine.

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:51.240
Even if you get realization, which is now
quite easy for people to get to, they are

00:28:51.240 --> 00:29:01.450
for it, because the Divine is anxious, because
your Creator is anxious, to manifest itself,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:10.090
but to settle down as a realized soul is difficult.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:20.770
I have to tell you at the very outset that
if you have to mature into it you have to

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.540
understand yourself.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.419
You must have your self-esteem.

00:29:25.419 --> 00:29:29.110
If you just are here for a shopping, “Oh,
all right, let’s hear Mother also,” that’s

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.549
not the way it is going to work out.

00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:40.140
If you are people of that caliber, then only
you can ascend.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.380
There’s nothing else needed of you.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:50.150
You may be a prime minister or you may be
a queen or you may be just a parlor maid,

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.700
makes no difference to the Divine.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.080
You may be a socialist, communist or a capitalist,
makes no difference.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.630
You may be this color, that color, makes no
difference.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:13.260
But you have to have the caliber of a true
seeker, who is intelligent enough to see that

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:20.610
he has not come on this earth just to be wasted.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:28.059
If you make many instruments and if they are
just wasted, they are not put to the mains,

00:30:28.059 --> 00:30:35.090
they are good for nothing, they have very
loose connections – He’ll just say, “Cancel

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.210
all these.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.950
Stop this factory.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.309
There’s no use having any more creations.”

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:52.169
Only those who are matured enough, who have
self-esteem – even age, you’ll be surprised,

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:58.140
does not matter – I have seen people who
are eighty years of age could be very stupid,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:06.190
and people who are very young, very small
children also, could be great.

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:18.500
So it is the inner quality of a person, his
maturity, that matters in Sahaj Yoga.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:25.220
I know it is rather difficult to understand
that why, if it is Sahaja, if the Kundalini

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:32.760
rises so easily in us, why is it we take time
to establish ourselves?

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.480
The reason is very simple.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:46.210
We are not simple people, we are not, we are
very complicated, we have complicated our

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.410
lives with so many problems.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:57.169
Now, cancer is a disease which cannot be explained
by doctors.

00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:04.110
We can explain it in Sahaj Yoga; is caused
by over-activity of the sympathetic nervous

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.250
system.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:15.340
If you could soothe the over-activity of the
sympathetic nervous system you can cure cancer,

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:22.510
but say, those people who go to spiritualists,
those people who go to false gurus, those

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:35.670
people who indulge into black magic and other
activities of a negative nature, getting spirits

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:45.720
and things like that, are more susceptible,
are really the susceptibles.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:33:00.289
If a person who is mad and lunatic, and the
husband or wife of such a person has relationship

00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:06.990
with him, he can develop multiple sclerosis.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:16.929
Sahaj Yoga can cure multiple sclerosis.

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:23.529
What we call the Mooladhara Chakra – if
that centre is caught up with other chakras,

00:33:23.529 --> 00:33:25.360
one can develop multiple sclerosis.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:34.769
The way we have been banging ourselves into
the unknown areas, we have really made ourselves

00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:35.980
very complicated.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:42.190
In the scientific field also we have gone
to the other extreme, believing that science

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:49.510
is our own creation, and have created problems
like atomic bomb, that we can see so clearly,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:53.710
but what we have done to ourselves we cannot
see.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.760
We are not simple people.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:04.340
Christ has said you have to be like a child
when you want to enter into the Kingdom of

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.429
God.

00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:12.990
Now some people I’ve found, they thought
by wearing dresses like primitive people they’ll

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:17.440
become simple like primitive – they will
not.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.149
Their brains are modern, how can they become
primitive?

00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:26.839
The brain’s all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, there’s the thought-combustion

00:34:26.839 --> 00:34:34.520
going on every minute, every second, every
split of a second.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.740
But even primitive people are not very good
for their ascent.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:41.210
That’s also a wrong idea.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:54.540
You have to come to a point of balance where
you have crossed your conditionings and you

00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.180
have not entered into the ego, which is just
a wee bit of a space.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:08.000
If you are not too far away it’s all right,
this way or that way.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:22.350
But if you are too far away from the center
then you are to be brought in.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:28.450
But what goes in favor of modern times is
that great seekers have taken their birth

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:29.619
on this Earth.

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:35.720
Of course, with other people they have complicated
themselves.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.140
They didn’t keep to their own personality,
to their own understanding.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.690
They got complicated with other people.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:51.970
Whatever trends came in, whatever things happened,
they did, they are politicians, this that,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:58.060
or they are, this side, they are belonging
to this cult or that cult and others have

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:03.170
become “club members” – all sorts of
things.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:10.780
They have not kept their personality, as they
were.

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:21.599
Like Kabir Das has said, “Jaisi kee taisi
rak deeni chadariya,” “As I had this chadar

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:33.220
on my body, I kept it as
it was.”

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:40.400
We have spoilt it, complicated it, it is hooked
to many things.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:47.170
We have one great advantage that you are great
seekers, very great seekers of ages born.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:55.130
This is a very big advantage, and is your
seeking only has brought Sahaj Yoga to this

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.130
Earth.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:01.530
But one disadvantage is there, that in these
modern times we have complicated ourselves

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:08.060
too much, because of confusion maybe, or maybe
because of our ego, that we wanted to try

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:18.369
everything and would not listen to anybody
else– “What’s wrong?.”

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:23.230
Whatever it is, we have complicated.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:33.339
Also, we do not know what diseases are breeding
within us, what is our mental condition.

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:37.460
We do not know how we are placed with ourselves.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:43.760
That’s how we are complicated.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:56.690
When Kundalini rises and you get your connection
with the Divine, it does, sorts out things,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:38:05.980
it does, no doubt, it will, but you have to
be growing with it.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:18.740
If you do not grow with that ascent, then
again that small connection that you have

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:22.869
established will break.

00:38:22.869 --> 00:38:33.329
Like the roots have reached the source, but
the tree has to grow according to the supply,

00:38:33.329 --> 00:38:37.869
understanding: the root has to grow further
too.

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:43.730
That’s how you really establish yourself.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:39:01.010
And I really beg of you and ask very humbly,
with great concern, that please don’t have

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.119
diffidence about yourself.

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:11.650
You have already created a problem by feeling
guilty thanks to these horrible psychologists

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.089
who have given us these ideas.

00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:18.460
Don’t have diffidence.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:26.230
You are seekers of very great quality, no
doubt, but there are complications which can

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.730
be sorted out.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:38.740
You placed yourself away from your being,
and see for yourself that this Spirit is your

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:46.580
being, not that what is complicated, that’s
just the outside, which can be corrected by

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.580
Kundalini, by your spiritual power.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:55.650
You can now correct, you’ll be empowered
with that.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.579
Sahaj Yoga is tremendous.

00:39:58.579 --> 00:40:05.270
Those who have established themselves are
tremendous people today in life.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:15.099
They are enjoying themselves, they are very
happy people, such nice relationships exist

00:40:15.099 --> 00:40:18.119
– they are beautiful.

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:23.869
Even whatever I have in England I am very
happy and surprised, I didn’t expect so

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:28.270
much.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:35.040
They have compassion, they cannot enjoy this
nectar of life alone, and they want you all

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.500
to join in with them.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:46.170
They are here to help you in a very humble
way, as they have been helped.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:41:00.030
Gradually it has been built up now, and it
is for you people to understand that so many

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:07.869
human beings that are created will be lost
if they do not enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:14.020
That’s the only purpose of Sahaj Yoga.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:25.030
As you know, the subject is so vast, knowledge
so great, there’s no end to it.

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:32.650
Whenever you get your realization – I hope
you get it now, today – and when you establish

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:40.770
yourself, you’ll be amazed, you yourself
will become the library of all the knowledges,

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:46.030
because you become that subtle thing which
gives knowledge.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:50.329
You reach to that absolute point which gives
all the knowledge.

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:56.040
You’ll be able to see which is knowledge,
which is not knowledge.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:03.030
Your priorities will immediately change because
you will have that light within yourself.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.910
But, as I say, it is a becoming.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.580
I cannot just say that, “All right, you
are realized soul, all right, give five pounds

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.580
and you are out.”

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.980
It’s not that way, I must tell you.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.930
This is My helplessness to make people understand
that you cannot just become realized souls,

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:25.740
you cannot be certified, it has – it is
a thing that should happen to you, it should

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.839
be your own.

00:42:27.839 --> 00:42:32.770
That you should be able to maneuver yourself,
you should be able to handle it yourself,

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.630
it should be your own power which should express
it.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:36.630
I just cannot say, “All right, done!

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.750
Now you are a member of Sahaj Yoga.”

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:42.770
You cannot.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:48.720
I must tell you this is the thing which you
should understand; after all you are sensible

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.630
people.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:56.220
You cannot demand it.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:08.970
Even if you read – but I cannot do it, it
has to happen.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:09.970
And after it has happened do not take it for
granted.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.710
Be careful about it, I must tell you I have
seen people who just come, get realization

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:16.250
and get lost.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:22.420
And after five years they appear again, all
tattered and torn, finished.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:30.599
This is what you have been seeking all your
lives.

00:43:30.599 --> 00:43:34.420
And that’s to be achieved.

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.869
I’m just here to give you what belongs to
you.

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:46.020
That also I don’t have, I should say, to
give you, it’s within you.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:53.400
Maybe one candle can enlighten another candle,
that’s all, like a catalyst.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.130
So don’t make your ego stand up, that “Why
You, Mother?”

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:02.920
Of all the things, it’s a thankless job
I must tell you.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:09.360
It’s a job I have to do.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.160
I do not do it for any thanks.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:17.630
I just do it because I have to do it, that’s
My nature.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.820
I cannot get over My nature.

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:30.480
There’s no quarrel between you and Me at
all, in no way.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.280
I am here just to give you what you have.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:43.720
You can’t pay Me, you should not feel bad
about it.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:47.150
You cannot overpower Me nor will I overpower
you.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:56.660
It’s a relationship, as a candle or a light
has to the hand.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:06.200
It’s just to help you to find your way.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:26.300
I hope in these modern ideas I will be able
to give you this queer thing, because people

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.300
can’t understand.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.710
I was amazed; I didn’t know this was so.

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:36.460
They can’t understand that anything can
work out without money, that there can be

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:39.970
something like love for love’s sake.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.310
Everybody loves for something.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:48.230
They can’t understand a madwoman like Me
who just loves because She loves, She can’t

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:51.230
help it otherwise.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.090
People don’t believe in such people.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:58.090
They just can’t imagine such a thing.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:04.830
But we have so many people who have gone,
who did this for you.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:09.260
Though they are in the history, but they are
not lost.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:16.730
There could be someone like that, and maybe
that all of you are going to be that very

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.130
soon!

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.569
That must happen to all of you.

00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:26.530
Thank you very much.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:37.060
Now I would like to spend some time with questioning,
but not too much, and there was a suggestion

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:45.630
that if realization is given like that, which
is a easy thing for Me, somehow, then people

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:48.880
don’t value the realization.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.270
So it should be given after two -three meetings.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:47:00.510
Then they will value it better, because according
to people who give Me suggestions, they understand

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.320
human beings better than I do.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:14.300
If you give them realization then just they
start living in the air, and then they don’t

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:22.930
want to do anything about it till they really
touch the grounds.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:38.869
I still believe in your sanity, in your wisdom,
in your fairness to yourself, and to your

00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:40.059
Creator.

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:47.819
So I still feel that you should get your realization
today.

00:47:47.819 --> 00:47:57.000
But that doesn’t mean that you are going
to leave it.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.230
You have to follow it up, work it out.

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:06.180
That doesn’t mean you have to give any more
money or anything, it doesn’t mean at all.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:12.150
It doesn’t mean anything more than establishing
it, understanding it, “What is this that

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:13.150
we have got?

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.070
What is this power?”

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.829
Now, can we have some questions?

00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:23.250
Yes, please?

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:32.000
Man (not very clear): And when did You know
that it’s hard getting people.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Shri Mataji: Me?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Man: Yes, You.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Shri Mataji: I knew from – since long.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
I’m quite old, you know, ancient.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.480
But, about Me I don’t want to say much,
as a matter of policy, you better find out

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480
gradually.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.770
Because if I say anything people don’t like
it.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:55.220
That’s a fact, whatever I am I am, but I
dare not say, people don’t like it.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:59.700
You see it’s a funny world.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:03.550
Is better that you see for yourself and know
Me.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:04.550
What did Christ say?

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:06.790
What He said is absolute truth.

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.400
He said that He was the Son of God.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.840
We can establish it through Sahaj Yoga you
will know that He was the Son of God.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.290
It was a fact and it was the truth; what He
said was true.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:31.480
If He had not said that, it was not true.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:35.329
So they crucified Him, tortured Him.

00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:38.410
What did Mohammed say?

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:41.490
What did Nanaka say?

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:50.050
Nothing to harm you, just to help you, because
they could see much more than you can see.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.940
But nobody liked it.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:59.700
If you tell a hot-tempered, blind man that,
“I can see the red color and yellow color

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.060
and blue color,” he’ll bang you, he just
can’t bear it.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:13.950
But that’s no point of superiority or anything,
is kind, is that, that you have it within

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.950
you.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.300
It’s your own; I’m again saying it’s
your own.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.040
So, about Me, less said the better.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.970
Because supposing I say something about Myself,
why should you accept also?

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:31.440
If I say, “I am the Governor,” will you
accept Me?

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.869
You will not.

00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:36.680
I know you will not.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.680
All right.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.730
You may, but even if you accept, what happens?

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.070
You don’t get your realization by accepting
that position.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:48.200
Whatever I say you need not accept as I said,
but you should not close your mind.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.349
Get your realization first.

00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:57.530
Your hands must speak, and then you will know
what I am, Who am I, how do I know?

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.350
All about Me you will know yourself.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.560
All right?

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:10.370
That’s a promise.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:15.990
Woman [INDISTINCTLY]: …If we get realization…

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.990
[UNCLEAR]…you have to establish it.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.990
How do we have to establish it?

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.990
Shri Mataji: That we will tell you.

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:24.119
First realization has to take place and then
gradually we will tell you because your hands

00:51:24.119 --> 00:51:25.119
will speak.

00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:29.359
You will know what’s happening to you; where
are the problems, on what centers – ss you

00:51:29.359 --> 00:51:32.640
can see clearly there – what are the problems.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.900
You will know what chakras are caught up,
what is the blockade [PREVIOUS WORD & ITS

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.180
REPEATS SOUND LIKE: “Blockit”], where
is your blockade?

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:44.420
Then also you will now how to clear the blockade,
then you will also know how to move your Kundalini

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:45.420
yourself.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.349
You will also know how to give realizations
to others.

00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:54.270
Just after realization you can even cure people,
immediately you can start curing.

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.869
But that’s not much.

00:51:56.869 --> 00:52:03.369
After establishment you can give realization
to people.

00:52:03.369 --> 00:52:09.520
And how to establish, everything is told,
free again.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:15.190
Because here only thing that is working out
is the concern, nothing else.

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:21.680
So how to establish, everything will be told.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.650
Now for example, we have books, but we don’t
give it to people who are not yet realized

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.260
properly.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.589
You have to go from one stage to another a
little bit.

00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:34.780
But it’s not even like a regular course.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:41.390
So there is no course in the living things,
but as you see, first the seed sprouts, and

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:47.829
then the seedlings are taken and established,
and then they become into tree, and then grown

00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:48.829
properly.

00:52:48.829 --> 00:52:53.480
First they are protected and then they are
exposed to nature.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:53:00.540
In the same way, you’ll be very carefully
established, and you will yourself know that

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.540
you are getting established.

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.540
You will certify yourself; I don’t have
to say anything.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.540
All right?

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.540
Man [INDISTINCT]:I’ve been thinking now,
after getting your realization, you have to

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.540
be in contact with people who can, who run
a course formally…?

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:21.640
Shri Mataji: No, it’s not a training, but
you have to contact, the contact with the

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.570
Divine has to be kept, and you will know the
Divine.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:31.680
The establishment of the contact you will
feel through cool breeze blowing into your

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:37.520
hands, through your fingers getting sensitive
and you can feel which chakras are catching.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:44.910
And to keep that contact you have to keep
contact with other people who know about it.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:48.400
And they will tell you how they have done
it.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:54.880
Then you yourself can go and do this work
yourself on your own.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:03.000
I went to Vancouver and people got realization,
many people got it.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.260
There was nobody who would tell them, and
I was there only for a day.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:14.730
So we sent somebody from Australia, she went
there on her own.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:21.460
She has created a beautiful center in Vancouver
and now we have one in Toronto[Mother actually

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.460
says “Toranto”] also.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.780
Only one person.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:32.590
There’s one person who must have given realization
to at least ten thousand people in India,

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.370
who got realization.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:40.329
First you have to get your realization, mature,
establish, then you yourself can do it.

00:54:40.329 --> 00:54:43.920
You become the master, a perfect master to
do it.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.690
All capabilities are within you.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:48.869
You do not know what you are, how God has
made you so beautifully.

00:54:48.869 --> 00:54:53.170
Lady: will it take a very long time?

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:58.160
Shri Mataji: Beg pardon?

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:03.369
Lady: Will is it take long?

00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:04.369
Shri Mataji: I didn’t follow you.

00:55:04.369 --> 00:55:05.369
Lady (louder): Will it take long?

00:55:05.369 --> 00:55:07.480
Shri Mataji: It may take a split of a second.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.690
Lady: To establish?

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:11.890
Shri Mataji: It doesn’t take too long, I
don’t think – yester– today, they were

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:12.890
asking Me, “How much?”

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.170
I said “Three weeks is the maximum.”

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:21.710
Should be, after realization three weeks should
be maximum to establish, according to My own

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:22.870
judgment so far.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:28.099
But in the beginning, I shouldn’t say – that
might upset you.

00:55:28.099 --> 00:55:34.140
It took really four years to struggle with
six of them.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:40.140
Now it’s not so difficult.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:46.280
Now we can manage many permutations and combinations
of problems, quite easily.

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:54.220
Don’t worry about time, just don’t worry.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.630
It’s beyond time.

00:55:57.630 --> 00:55:58.839
All right?

00:55:58.839 --> 00:56:06.390
Man: What is the flower of India?

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:11.840
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:12.840
Man: The flower of India?

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840
Shri Mataji: I didn’t follow.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.840
Various people: Flower…

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:15.840
Shri Mataji: Power?

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.840
People: No, flower.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.840
Shri Mataji: What is the flower?

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.840
Man: Of India.

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.840
Shri Mataji: What is the flower of India?

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840
Man: India, yes.

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840
Shri Mataji: What do you mean?

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.840
Man: I, N, D, I, A, what is the flower of
India?

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.010
Shri Mataji: What is this question?

00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:27.339
Man: Well, that is the question.

00:56:27.339 --> 00:56:33.920
Shri Mataji: Well, I’m not talking to you
here, you here as an Indian, is a wrong idea.

00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.980
Lotus is the flower…

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.980
Man: Thank you

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:41.710
Shri Mataji: …we accept as our national
flower, but I’m not an Indian here, I am

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:44.030
a Britisher, all right?

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:45.770
Out and out.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.090
[man makes indistinct quip].

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:49.740
What is the flower of England?

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.300
Man and others: The rose…rose.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.349
Shri Mataji: That’s wrong, it should be
daisy

00:56:55.349 --> 00:57:05.220
[Some laughter from the audience and then
the man says indistinctly [SOUNDS LIKE: “there’s

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.220
a long, long take that back.”]

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:11.530
Shri Mataji: On a very subtle way it should
be a daisy, because England is the heart of

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:22.920
the universe, and heart resides in the Sahasrara,
and Sahasrara is not like a rose, it is like

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.140
a daisy.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:30.829
Have you had any experience of the daisies
that are coming out these days in England,

00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:38.660
they have tremendous fragrance.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:49.320
Rose may be, because you had Wars of Roses
or something like that, but rose is not your

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.349
flower.

00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:54.500
They misunderstood, I think.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.010
Daisy everywhere – all kinds, all types,
all colors, beautiful!

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:57.010
All right?

00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:58.010
Man: – When achieving your realization,
is it necessary to give up anything?

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:21.500
Shri Mataji: I think you better tell Me here,
I just, you know I can’t understand at this

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.500
point.

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:28.440
Another man: He’s asking, is it necessary
to give up anything in order to achieve realization?

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.240
Shri Mataji: No, nothing.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:39.600
You see, we give up something because we have
an idea we’re holding onto something, you

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600
see.

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:45.329
But when you discover you are holding on to
nothing, is just given up as such.

00:58:45.329 --> 00:58:51.230
Like some people came to Me, said “Mother
You are living in a family life, and how do

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:55.299
You say that, You have something to do with
Divine?”

00:58:55.299 --> 00:58:56.630
I said “Why?.”

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.290
He said, “What have you given up?”

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.869
I said “What have you given up yourself?”

00:59:00.869 --> 00:59:07.510
They said “We have given up our families,
we have given up carpets and houses and this

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.510
and that.”

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:09.910
I said “Really?

00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:19.680
Now can you take away anything from this house
which is equal to the dust of the Lotus Feet

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:20.940
of your Lord?

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.210
Take away, anything.”

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.170
He couldn’t find anything, just looked around.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:30.940
I said “That should be at least equal to
the dust.”

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:36.250
When you are not holding on to anything, what
is there to give up?

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:45.079
The whole attitude becomes detached.

00:59:45.079 --> 00:59:53.290
You don’t “give up,” but you see, like
the drama finishes off.

00:59:53.290 --> 01:00:18.880
In the drama you are crying, weeping, with
the hero you become Napoleon, sometimes killing

01:00:18.880 --> 01:01:09.660
people and banging, then suddenly you discover
the drama is over.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.820
“Now, oh God!

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:32.799
I was just playing this role of Napoleon,
while I was just watching the drama.”

01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:43.140
Automatically this myth of involvement dissolves,
all right?

01:01:43.140 --> 01:02:13.160
So you don’t give up anything, you just
see it.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:19.470
What is there to give up?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:25.569
[Indistinct question about giving up alcohol]

01:02:25.569 --> 01:02:29.030
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:39.640
Lady: He doesn’t want to give up alcohol,
Mother.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:45.730
Shri Mataji: Give up the?

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:48.770
Woman: Alcohol.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:56.380
Shri Mataji: No, no, never!

01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:05.110
Did I say so?

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:19.530
I’m sorry for that.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:04:06.510
(laughter) Did I say in My lecture that you
give up alcohol?

01:04:06.510 --> 01:05:02.200
I never said so, but it
happens – they just give up (laughter).

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:08.900
I didn’t say so.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:12.260
All right?

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:15.020
It just happens.

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:19.390
I don’t say – never say that.

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:27.520
You mean to say I don’t want you to be realized?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:33.270
To say such a thing?

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:41.910
I never said “don’t do it.”

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:49.510
I’ve finished with Ten Commandments now.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:06:00.140
Nothing, it just happens, you become Ten Commandments
yourself.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.990
You just become.

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:12.289
Then, even if I ask you, you will say “Mother,
no, no, no.”

01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:20.130
Because when you will get the highest you
don’t want anything else.

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:28.079
Why do we drink, you know?

01:06:28.079 --> 01:06:35.650
We are bored stiff with life.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:54.830
We don’t drink because we want to run an
industries of drinking, do we?

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:58.860
