00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.280
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.000
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.240
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.360
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.600
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.440
from ayatollah Ruhani

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.440
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.840
of the Holy Mother,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.720
where he indicates the importance of women

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.560
in the world is needed here.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.560
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.160
I did not know that I would be here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.520
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.080
addressing this audience.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.240
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.280
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.000
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.360
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.280
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.480
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.880
Ah…

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.000
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.360
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.240
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.760
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.520
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.160
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.640
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.760
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.440
Yes, I will share that with you.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.600
by ten small words.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.840
And they indicate how this global world transformation

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.280
should be undertaken.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:05.480
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.720
Right Here and Right Now.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.120
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400
this world is fighting about what is right,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.480
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.360
it’s a grey area.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.400
So we need a reference point,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.880
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.720
and between truth and lie.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.160
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.960
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.800
to become the masters of our own destiny.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.840
And tonight we’ll be guided

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.080
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.200
We will do so in the light of Truth

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.840
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.960
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.440
These prizes represent excellence.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.000
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.480
and peace.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.080
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.240
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.000
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.080
100 years ago when she said:

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.760
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.200
for betterment of the world”.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.760
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.000
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.320
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.280
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.440
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.240
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.520
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.760
could also be used for war affair.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.840
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.080
it’s like a small fire cracker,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.880
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.080
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.840
about peace as absence of war.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:11.600
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.520
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.480
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.840
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.400
How do we treat our body?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.480
Are we slaves to other masters

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.960
or are we our own master?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.760
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.440
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.680
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.520
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.920
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.640
to realize what inner peace is.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.000
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.360
What does Self Realization mean?

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.840
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.520
that exist in each and every individual,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.720
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.320
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.520
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.600
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.280
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.000
being an old soul would decided by Herself

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.600
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.200
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.800
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.880
which is instant Self Realization,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.280
which is to activate the dormant principle

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.240
that we all have: the Kundalini,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.280
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.280
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.280
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360
the one we have in ourselves.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.000
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.360
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.400
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.680
and with other religions,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.440
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.400
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:18.400
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.960
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.520
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.280
We are always talking, talking, talking.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.520
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.240
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.960
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.520
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.800
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.920
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.400
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.640
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.760
reverence for Nature,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.400
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.720
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.640
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.560
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.560
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.920
Nature is nothing but a plethora

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.080
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.600
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.760
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.040
in our greed and in our lust for power,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.400
we are in the process of destroying the

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.080
very thing that makes this planet unique

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.640
and that is Life on Earth.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.720
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.560
that harbors this miracle.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:19.000
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.680
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.520
and we must take care of her and respect her.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.960
Earth is also called Nature.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.240
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.920
we must live by the laws of Nature.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.960
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.160
And we are only one species of –

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.440
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.560
But this we know

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.320
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.920
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.360
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.240
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.000
pulling out thread after thread after thread

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.760
of what consists the fabric of life

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.160
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.000
without correcting us as naughty children.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.680
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.320
between ourselves and God.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.480
Any religion or any group

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.320
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.440
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.080
The world should not know of violence

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.080
and the world should not know of war.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.920
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
“Earth Ethics”

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.840
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.280
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.040
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.240
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.560
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.480
from many different walks of life.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:40.320
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:46.400
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.240
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.480
as a kind of a school, a school

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.640
where we are learning perfection and purification.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.960
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.320
interactive and interrelated.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.560
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.920
every action has a reaction,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.840
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.440
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.360
She has learned from many many lives

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.800
what it is all about

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.880
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.680
the spiritual laws,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.520
they’re always here and they work as infallible

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.720
as the law of gravity works.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.480
It always works, all those unseen laws.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.400
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:04.360
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.800
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.000
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.640
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.040
And lately, I have met young men and women

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.520
in different parts of the world,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.720
and certainly from many different parts of the world

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:38.880
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.880
that radiate inner peace and balance.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.760
They are unique.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.600
You who follow or who are in a process of following

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.240
will be, I think,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.360
those individuals who shall call themselves

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.160
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.680
And after tonight session is over,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.560
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.000
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.600
and you shall realize that blind faith

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:23.680
is of no value and that fanaticism and

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.400
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.280
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.440
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:51.600
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.160
I know that the future is in your hands

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.960
I know it’s in my hands.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.480
And I also know that the future of the planet

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:07.800
exists in the heart of the individuals.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.520
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.240
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.680
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.840
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.760
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.000
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.600
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.360
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.360
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.840
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.520
about how is the outcome of this conference,

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.520
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.560
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.640
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.880
Tonight we should take the action.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.760
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.920
and I said:

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.680
“Is there hope for the future?”.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:30.720
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.480
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.000
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.760
it was His finest creation in the Universe

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.600
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:56.200
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.200
When they were there,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.000
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and said:

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.520
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.600
having a good time. And, by the way,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.040
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:19.320
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:26.480
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.560
The devils cried out and said:

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.280
We don’t want any part of such party.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.240
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.880
So they left.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.480
Then the party started,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.040
the angels were having a jolly good time

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.520
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:55.640
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.040
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.400
The angels were feeding each other,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.080
they were sharing and they were caring,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:19.040
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.040
Thank you very much.
