WEBVTT

00:07.200 --> 00:13.280
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

00:13.680 --> 00:20.000
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

00:20.400 --> 00:25.240
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:25.640 --> 00:33.360
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.600
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

00:36.640 --> 00:39.440
from ayatollah Ruhani

00:39.560 --> 00:43.440
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

00:43.480 --> 00:45.840
of the Holy Mother,

00:45.960 --> 00:50.720
where he indicates the importance of women

00:50.760 --> 00:54.560
in the world is needed here.

00:54.920 --> 00:59.560
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

00:59.600 --> 01:02.160
I did not know that I would be here

01:02.280 --> 01:05.520
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

01:05.600 --> 01:09.080
addressing this audience.

01:09.240 --> 01:17.240
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

01:17.880 --> 01:25.280
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

01:25.480 --> 01:32.000
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

01:32.200 --> 01:35.360
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

01:35.520 --> 01:39.280
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.480
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

01:43.800 --> 01:44.880
Ah…

01:51.720 --> 01:57.000
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

01:57.080 --> 02:02.360
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

02:02.600 --> 02:08.240
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

02:08.360 --> 02:11.760
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

02:11.960 --> 02:17.520
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

02:17.640 --> 02:21.160
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

02:21.320 --> 02:26.640
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

02:26.920 --> 02:32.760
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

02:33.600 --> 02:38.440
Yes, I will share that with you.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.720
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

02:42.760 --> 02:46.600
by ten small words.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.840
And they indicate how this global world transformation

02:51.920 --> 02:54.280
should be undertaken.

02:54.440 --> 03:05.480
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

03:05.680 --> 03:10.720
Right Here and Right Now.

03:11.840 --> 03:21.120
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

03:21.440 --> 03:24.400
this world is fighting about what is right,

03:24.520 --> 03:28.480
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

03:28.520 --> 03:30.360
it’s a grey area.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.400
So we need a reference point,

03:33.520 --> 03:37.880
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

03:38.000 --> 03:41.720
and between truth and lie.

03:42.000 --> 03:42.160
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.960
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

03:55.000 --> 03:59.800
to become the masters of our own destiny.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.840
And tonight we’ll be guided

04:03.880 --> 04:09.080
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

04:09.320 --> 04:14.200
We will do so in the light of Truth

04:14.560 --> 04:21.840
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.960
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.440
These prizes represent excellence.

04:31.600 --> 04:37.000
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

04:37.040 --> 04:39.480
and peace.

04:39.560 --> 04:47.080
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

04:47.760 --> 04:54.240
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

04:54.240 --> 04:58.000
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

04:58.000 --> 05:00.080
100 years ago when she said:

05:00.080 --> 05:04.760
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

05:04.800 --> 05:08.200
for betterment of the world”.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.760
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

05:12.760 --> 05:18.000
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

05:18.360 --> 05:23.320
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

05:23.520 --> 05:27.280
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.440
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

05:31.680 --> 05:36.240
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

05:36.240 --> 05:40.520
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

05:40.760 --> 05:43.760
could also be used for war affair.

05:43.920 --> 05:48.840
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

05:48.840 --> 05:51.080
it’s like a small fire cracker,

05:51.080 --> 05:56.880
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.080
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

06:00.200 --> 06:04.840
about peace as absence of war.

06:05.240 --> 06:11.600
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.520
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

06:17.760 --> 06:23.480
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

06:23.680 --> 06:28.840
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

06:29.000 --> 06:32.400
How do we treat our body?

06:32.560 --> 06:37.480
Are we slaves to other masters

06:37.560 --> 06:39.960
or are we our own master?

06:40.080 --> 06:44.760
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

06:44.800 --> 06:48.440
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.680
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

06:52.720 --> 06:58.520
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

06:58.680 --> 07:04.920
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.640
to realize what inner peace is.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.000
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.360
What does Self Realization mean?

07:15.480 --> 07:20.840
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

07:21.000 --> 07:27.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

07:27.400 --> 07:30.520
that exist in each and every individual,

07:30.520 --> 07:36.720
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.320
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.520
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

07:43.520 --> 07:49.600
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

07:49.720 --> 07:55.280
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

07:55.440 --> 07:59.000
being an old soul would decided by Herself

07:59.040 --> 08:02.600
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

08:02.600 --> 08:06.200
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

08:06.240 --> 08:08.800
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

08:08.880 --> 08:11.880
which is instant Self Realization,

08:11.960 --> 08:15.280
which is to activate the dormant principle

08:15.320 --> 08:17.240
that we all have: the Kundalini,

08:17.280 --> 08:23.280
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

08:23.520 --> 08:30.280
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.280
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

08:41.360 --> 08:43.360
the one we have in ourselves.

08:43.440 --> 08:50.000
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

08:50.160 --> 08:55.360
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

08:55.560 --> 08:58.400
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

08:58.440 --> 09:00.680
and with other religions,

09:00.800 --> 09:07.440
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

09:07.680 --> 09:11.400
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

09:11.440 --> 09:18.400
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.960
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

09:23.040 --> 09:26.520
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.280
We are always talking, talking, talking.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.520
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

09:32.600 --> 09:37.240
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.960
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.520
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.800
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

09:50.800 --> 09:54.920
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

09:54.960 --> 09:59.400
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

09:59.600 --> 10:03.640
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

10:03.680 --> 10:05.760
reverence for Nature,

10:05.840 --> 10:10.400
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.720
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

10:13.840 --> 10:17.640
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

10:17.640 --> 10:20.560
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

10:20.640 --> 10:26.560
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

10:26.760 --> 10:29.920
Nature is nothing but a plethora

10:30.000 --> 10:34.080
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

10:34.280 --> 10:38.600
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

10:38.720 --> 10:42.760
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

10:42.880 --> 10:46.040
in our greed and in our lust for power,

10:46.200 --> 10:48.400
we are in the process of destroying the

10:48.600 --> 10:51.080
very thing that makes this planet unique

10:51.160 --> 10:55.640
and that is Life on Earth.

11:02.400 --> 11:08.720
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

11:08.760 --> 11:11.560
that harbors this miracle.

11:11.640 --> 11:19.000
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

11:19.000 --> 11:22.680
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

11:22.760 --> 11:25.520
and we must take care of her and respect her.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.960
Earth is also called Nature.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.240
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

11:32.520 --> 11:35.920
we must live by the laws of Nature.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.960
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.160
And we are only one species of –

11:42.240 --> 11:47.440
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.560
But this we know

11:49.600 --> 11:53.320
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

11:53.520 --> 11:59.920
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

12:00.000 --> 12:07.360
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.240
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

12:11.320 --> 12:14.000
pulling out thread after thread after thread

12:14.080 --> 12:16.760
of what consists the fabric of life

12:16.840 --> 12:20.160
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

12:20.240 --> 12:25.000
without correcting us as naughty children.

12:25.360 --> 12:31.680
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

12:31.800 --> 12:35.320
between ourselves and God.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.480
Any religion or any group

12:38.520 --> 12:42.320
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

12:42.320 --> 12:48.440
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.080
The world should not know of violence

12:58.240 --> 13:01.080
and the world should not know of war.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.920
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
“Earth Ethics”

13:10.080 --> 13:13.840
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

13:13.960 --> 13:18.280
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

13:18.360 --> 13:21.040
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

13:21.080 --> 13:25.240
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

13:26.280 --> 13:30.560
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

13:30.640 --> 13:33.480
from many different walks of life.

13:33.640 --> 13:40.320
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

13:40.440 --> 13:46.400
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

13:46.720 --> 13:52.240
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

13:52.360 --> 13:56.480
as a kind of a school, a school

13:56.520 --> 14:01.640
where we are learning perfection and purification.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.960
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

14:06.000 --> 14:09.320
interactive and interrelated.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.560
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

14:12.600 --> 14:14.920
every action has a reaction,

14:15.000 --> 14:19.840
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.440
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

14:25.520 --> 14:29.360
She has learned from many many lives

14:29.400 --> 14:31.800
what it is all about

14:31.920 --> 14:35.880
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

14:35.920 --> 14:37.680
the spiritual laws,

14:37.720 --> 14:42.520
they’re always here and they work as infallible

14:42.560 --> 14:45.720
as the law of gravity works.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.480
It always works, all those unseen laws.

14:49.680 --> 14:55.400
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

14:56.680 --> 15:04.360
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

15:04.520 --> 15:09.800
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

15:09.920 --> 15:16.000
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

15:16.000 --> 15:22.640
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

15:22.760 --> 15:27.040
And lately, I have met young men and women

15:27.040 --> 15:29.520
in different parts of the world,

15:29.600 --> 15:32.720
and certainly from many different parts of the world

15:32.840 --> 15:38.880
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

15:39.000 --> 15:43.880
that radiate inner peace and balance.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.760
They are unique.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.600
You who follow or who are in a process of following

15:50.080 --> 15:53.240
will be, I think,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.360
those individuals who shall call themselves

15:56.400 --> 16:00.160
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.680
And after tonight session is over,

16:03.880 --> 16:08.560
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

16:08.600 --> 16:12.000
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

16:12.280 --> 16:16.600
and you shall realize that blind faith

16:16.680 --> 16:23.680
is of no value and that fanaticism and

16:26.520 --> 16:31.400
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

16:31.440 --> 16:35.280
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

16:35.320 --> 16:41.440
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

16:43.800 --> 16:51.600
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.160
I know that the future is in your hands

16:55.240 --> 16:57.960
I know it’s in my hands.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.480
And I also know that the future of the planet

17:02.520 --> 17:07.800
exists in the heart of the individuals.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

17:15.280 --> 17:20.520
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

17:20.680 --> 17:24.240
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

17:24.320 --> 17:29.680
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.840
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

17:33.920 --> 17:36.760
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

17:36.760 --> 17:42.000
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.600
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.360
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

17:50.560 --> 17:53.360
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.840
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

17:55.840 --> 17:58.520
about how is the outcome of this conference,

17:58.520 --> 18:02.520
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

18:02.520 --> 18:05.560
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

18:05.560 --> 18:08.640
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.880
Tonight we should take the action.

18:10.880 --> 18:16.760
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

18:16.800 --> 18:18.920
and I said:

18:19.520 --> 18:23.680
“Is there hope for the future?”.

18:23.840 --> 18:30.720
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

18:31.240 --> 18:36.480
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

18:36.560 --> 18:41.000
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

18:41.040 --> 18:45.760
it was His finest creation in the Universe

18:45.840 --> 18:49.600
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

18:49.720 --> 18:56.200
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.200
When they were there,

18:58.240 --> 19:01.000
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
and said:

19:02.040 --> 19:06.520
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

19:06.640 --> 19:09.600
having a good time. And, by the way,

19:09.760 --> 19:14.040
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.320
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

19:19.440 --> 19:26.480
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.560
The devils cried out and said:

19:29.640 --> 19:33.280
We don’t want any part of such party.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.240
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

19:36.280 --> 19:38.880
So they left.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.480
Then the party started,

19:41.520 --> 19:44.040
the angels were having a jolly good time

19:44.160 --> 19:47.520
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

19:47.640 --> 19:55.640
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

19:58.000 --> 20:05.040
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.400
The angels were feeding each other,

20:08.440 --> 20:13.080
they were sharing and they were caring,

20:13.240 --> 20:19.040
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.040
Thank you very much.
