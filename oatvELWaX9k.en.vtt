00:00:01.982 --> 00:00:10.472
And I request you, that all those who
are wandering in search of God,

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:17.464
they too will have to take support of music first.
Without that the work will not be done

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:27.479
because the speciality of our Indian music is such that
it can only be attained only by austerity and hard work.

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:43.224
Human beings can have vision of the Divine in it’s
various aspects such as it’s gravity, it’s flight,
it’s spread, it’s depth, it’s delicacy.

00:00:44.887 --> 00:00:53.437
And all music emanates from that Om(AUM),
which is known to people as the Spirit(Atma).

00:00:54.427 --> 00:01:02.887
Therefore, when man becomes engrossed in this
music it is easy for him to find(get to) God.

00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:11.823
Maybe you find my words a bit poetic
and they seem somewhat far from reality,

00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:28.265
maybe it feels, that I'm saying like this just
to please the musicians, but this is not true.

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:40.091
We also have seven energy centres(chakras) within
ourselves and in total there are twelve chakras, similarly

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:48.828
music also has seven notes and including five
other notes the whole scale is formed.

00:01:51.198 --> 00:02:01.478
When Kundalini moves on our chakras, it produces a sound(note)
The same notes are considered in our music.

00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:08.717
Our Indian music was founded by great
visionaries, sages and saints.

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:21.277
They may be belonging to any religion, be born in
any part of the country - North, South, East, West -
wherever they may have taken their birth,

00:02:21.346 --> 00:02:28.616
but considering the Spirit as the foundation,
the whole musical edifice is built.

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:36.403
They didn’t let things fly in the air like the Western music.
Western music keeps on flowing like a cut kite,

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:40.663
sometimes it’ll get cold, sometimes it’ll get hot,
sometimes it will flow somewhere, sometimes somewhere,
somewhere else.

00:02:42.068 --> 00:02:51.298
But our Indian music has always been bounded
by one thing and that thing is our Spirit.

00:02:51.788 --> 00:02:59.918
Now-a-days I see that people don't particularly like
this music, nor do they desire to understand it.

00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:06.966
The reason for this is that something new
has come to us which appears to be easy.

00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:16.584
But man has forgotten to attain the Spirit(Atma) as well.
Even talking about the Atma has become ancient and is
not in fashion nowadays.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:23.763
Nowadays if someone talks about the Spirit,
people think that Mother is also talking of
something of the ancient times.

00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:28.658
Is there something like Spirit etc and whether
there is such a thing as God or not?

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:43.911
But even now, no matter how many people in this India
may have turned their faces away from God,
their string is still in His hands.

00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:55.281
And howsoever far you may go, this land of
India is such that you cannot forget God.

00:03:55.462 --> 00:04:03.942
Superficially you may keep on saying that
there is no God, He has no power,
and we do not believe Him,

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:12.105
and we believe only in our own power, but
I have never seen such an Indian till now,

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:17.131
who upon reaching a limit doesn’t say that,
"Okay, there must be a thing called God."

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:24.119
And we say that God is not a thing,
He is an All-Pervading Power.

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:37.196
And we are not eager to get to that
Power and to know that Power,

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:45.921
neither do we yearn for it nor do we understand that
there is any such power that can flow from within us.

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:53.871
The reason is that very little has been written on it and
whatever has been said, has been said very secretly.

00:04:53.871 --> 00:05:00.089
The thing which we consider as the wealth of this country
or property or what we consider as great traditions,

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:09.335
even in those traditions, it is said about this
thing but very less light is cast on how does
this thing happen or take place.

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:19.516
That's because this thing will only be
revealed when it’s time comes.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.910
Thus thinking and understanding this,
people have kept this a secret.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.800
Everyone has said that the All-Pervading Power of
God Almighty moves around in this world.

00:05:35.255 --> 00:05:42.025
And we also see that whatever everyday living arrangements
there are, whatever living work there is,

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:54.783
is done by some one Power and that Power makes a fruit
out of a flower, a tree out of a seed.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.680
All the living works are done by the Power
and whatever that Power is, we do not know it,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.162
and we can't find or attain it. We can’t do this
and this is a thing higher than us.

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:24.185
To achieve this, if man has decided such a thing that,
"Sir, this thing does not exist at all," then
it is futile to talk to such people.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:32.419
Because if people sitting in the dark say,
“There is no such thing as the Sun,” then
how will they move forward?

00:06:33.603 --> 00:06:41.503
But certainly, there can be other people who think
that, "Well, all these people have said that,

00:06:41.503 --> 00:06:47.561
there is something known as the Sun, so why
shouldn’t we see it, why not know it?"

00:06:47.802 --> 00:06:53.192
And what has everybody said, how do we get
to know it? No one has said that,

00:06:53.192 --> 00:07:01.000
if you stand on your head, then you will get
to God or you will get to the Divine by
putting a rope in the nose and pulling.

00:07:01.568 --> 00:07:09.678
By doing such deranged activities, the Divine
can be achieved, no one has said so. Some
new things continue to emerge everyday.

00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:25.476
All remain engaged getting to their proper physical body,
in making arrangements for land, properties and gathering
all the useless items around the world.

00:07:25.476 --> 00:07:32.915
But our vision is not on what has to be collected because
we don’t even find someone like this who has gathered it.

00:07:33.343 --> 00:07:43.403
Whosoever comes and talks, only I know, is either some absconder
escaped from jail or someone who is eager to make money.

00:07:43.403 --> 00:07:55.461
He talks of God but cheats at home that’s why
it’s absolutely correct to loose faith in God
- absolutely correct.

00:07:56.507 --> 00:08:07.347
But what’s the fault of God Almighty in this? The Divine
has made us into a human-being from an amoeba.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:18.545
He has created this beautiful creation for you. All these
colours and these notes and all that sweet music, has come
only from the feet of the Supreme Soul.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:30.889
It is only He who has given us the power within to
enjoy it. Only He has given us the power to recognize
and love our parents and children.

00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:35.697
Only He has made arrangements for our eating
and drinking and everything else.

00:08:35.697 --> 00:08:44.627
But if we quarrel among ourselves and break
our heads, what should God do?

00:08:45.835 --> 00:08:53.185
These are all man made problems. God has not
created any problem for us, none at all.

00:08:53.185 --> 00:09:02.319
But it’s just a question of asking once and
you'll come to know what is that God Almighty
and what is your Spirit?

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:09.029
So beautifully He has placed the whole instrument within us.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:15.882
Gradually, as we evolved,
evolution kept on happening

00:09:16.113 --> 00:09:31.603
in that way, slowly-slowly, all these institutions
kept on adding within us one after another and
all these energy centres placed within.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.740
This instrument was made with great effort,
it was cherished with great care.

00:09:36.752 --> 00:09:43.262
The ultimate goal is that, the way a human being is
visible outwardly, he becomes a super human being.

00:09:44.054 --> 00:09:52.634
The one who is considered to be common and trivial and
inferior, becomes a very high quality instrument of God.

00:09:52.707 --> 00:10:00.437
But the nature of man is such that he
wants to make everything his means but
doesn’t want to be a means of anything.

00:10:00.498 --> 00:10:13.468
It’s contrary to his nature. Why should he become someone's
instrument? But the One who made you as a means, you will
definitely have to become His instrument.

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:21.846
If you are not ready to be His instrument even,
then whatever resources you have collected,
all of them are futile.

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:26.593
You have not achieved any happiness and
bliss from them and neither can.

00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:32.095
You go and see in those countries where those
people have gathered thousands of means.

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:37.915
A variety of resources have been collected.
If you go, there are such cars,

00:10:37.915 --> 00:10:44.267
that you can open it’s door while sitting,
make it into a room, make something else
out of it - what's in all this?

00:10:45.296 --> 00:10:51.896
What’s the point of all this spectacle? Such
houses are there, where if you go,

00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:55.381
there in one place only will be a swimming pool,

00:10:55.381 --> 00:11:01.340
and while sitting in the same place itself, you can start
the motor(car), get everything done - then what’s the use?

00:11:04.302 --> 00:11:10.792
What did man achieve by all this show business?
Did anyone get joy out of it?

00:11:10.945 --> 00:11:18.685
Leave aside the joy, I even go on to say,
has anyone developed any kind of wisdom?

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:25.514
And even not talking about wisdom,
does anyone have peace within?

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:34.057
When there is no war, there are preparations for war and
then after that, after the war, again the war preparations.

00:11:34.584 --> 00:11:40.974
Such has become the wisdom of man in these
countries, and the matter of peace is such,

00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:48.363
in these countries, two people can’t stay without
quarrelling, for more than five minutes.

00:11:50.886 --> 00:12:00.416
In such a situation it should be thought that
whatever is precious to us, what we desire,

00:12:02.162 --> 00:12:19.972
even those little things can't be found there, like,
a mother's love, a father's shelter, children's caress
and their obedience - nothing.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:35.930
You are living in an artificial, flashy world,
made with this money, untouched by everything.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:49.520
Beyond this is the true world of God Almighty,
His true Kingdom, His true love.

00:12:50.769 --> 00:13:01.869
You haven't known Him yet, You haven't seen
Him yet, that’s why all these things appear
of great importance to you.

00:13:03.075 --> 00:13:10.835
But these things can in no way make you happy.
See just now, you were listening to music here -

00:13:12.683 --> 00:13:18.063
those who played to give pleasure to others,
that would be a comfortable thing.

00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:25.874
But if you're rich with this carpet today,
then it becomes a headache for you.

00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:33.941
You think that it may not be spoilt, it may not be soiled,
Mother is sitting like this, it’s fibres may break,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:44.000
don't know how much it cost, Oh my God, how to spread it now!

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:50.270
If you didn't care for this, the other
thing would be, what else to be bought?

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:54.326
The neighbours have this thing,
when will it come to our place?

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:59.966
The whole life will pass in this confusion,
in this puzzle. Finally found out

00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:08.301
that the person has left the world
or is admitted in the mental asylum.

00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:18.605
In view of these circumstances, a person
should think, are we born for this?

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:23.889
Did God make us humans so
that we go to a mental asylum,

00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:32.591
and keep on fighting with each other,
getting angry, not enjoying anything,

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:40.265
not enjoying other human beings –
what has happened after all?

00:14:41.415 --> 00:14:48.474
What is left in us, remained within, which is
untouched, because of which we

00:14:48.474 --> 00:14:53.077
have become such, that we can’t see anything
in the world beyond ourselves.

00:14:53.885 --> 00:15:03.835
Why has so much selfishness, so much blindness,
so much tyranny come? Sometimes a person should
sit aside and think about this also.

00:15:04.308 --> 00:15:12.678
All the time he keeps thinking how much he
has been wronged, how much loss they gave
him, how much they troubled him?

00:15:12.678 --> 00:15:21.520
And what have you done? Then also start thinking
how much trouble I have caused, even that was
a thought and this too is a thought.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.563
Either ways man is immersed in grief.

00:15:26.338 --> 00:15:36.818
So did God make you a human so that you sit
here and cry all the time and mourn?

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:48.016
Was this the will of God that He makes such people
who are grieving, afflicted, unhappy, patients?

00:15:48.016 --> 00:15:54.041
Or people like this, who are drowned in their ego,
do whatever they want? Great idiots.

00:15:57.595 --> 00:16:05.725
A gentleman came one day wearing a coat inside out.
I said, "Sir, why did you wear your coat from the wrong side?"

00:16:05.737 --> 00:16:13.237
Started saying, "What's wrong with it, why do You
say so?" I said, "Nothing wrong but the right side
looks nice, what’s the problem?"

00:16:13.237 --> 00:16:16.057
"So what do You think? I’ll do whatever
I want, who are You to say?"

00:16:16.057 --> 00:16:20.336
I said, "It’s all right. The thing is, it’s visible
to the eye that's why I said, will not say again.”

00:16:20.336 --> 00:16:32.162
Came to know that he is a very rich man. So a rich man
thinks that he can do whatever he wants. Because he is
very rich, he thinks, doesn’t matter what others think.

00:16:32.193 --> 00:16:36.003
Others who call themselves poor, their
condition is even better.

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:40.569
Now-a-days it is, 'Help the poor, help the poor’.

00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:52.024
Really, I do not see anyone poor, because if we
give someone a hundred rupees, he goes straight -
where? To the liquor shop.

00:16:52.885 --> 00:16:59.415
If this man was poor, why would he take
the hundred rupees to the liquor shop?

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:09.059
He should go home to his children and family and give them
something to eat and drink but instead he goes straight to the bar.

00:17:09.615 --> 00:17:17.325
Does it mean they are poor? 'Go on strike,
go on strike, allowance should be increased, big inflation
has happened, there has been a lot of inflation.’

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:24.440
Okay, the allowance has increased. Where
are you going? Same bar.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:30.027
Asked, "Why did you have the allowance increased?" "Mother
You know, the cost of a bottle of wine has gone up a lot.

00:17:30.817 --> 00:17:35.857
You don't know, You don't drink, what do You
know? "It's all right, I am ignorant."

00:17:38.646 --> 00:17:48.096
So what to do with such poor people also? And the poor
have an ego that, 'We are poor.' This is also
an arrogance among the poor.

00:17:48.096 --> 00:17:54.640
Like a beggar comes, "Sir, give me two rupees.”
"I don’t have two but one, take one."

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.408
"Hey, what do you think of yourself?
Keep it for yourself, have some cigarette etc.”

00:17:58.542 --> 00:18:04.692
Such arrogant people like this, all of them. Nowadays the poor
have also taken a stand that 'We are poor'.

00:18:05.019 --> 00:18:12.739
What poor are these! The humility of poverty is not visible
anywhere, on the contrary, they’re sitting on the head.

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:15.971
How are they poor and how are they rich,
can't understand anything?

00:18:18.376 --> 00:18:26.006
Neither is there respect and dignity between father and son,
nor any concern for mother or sister. Upon seeing,
these things seem to you,

00:18:26.006 --> 00:18:33.076
that Mother is talking about very ancient things, but
whatever of ours was old, was very important for today.

00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:44.643
Is very important. Once again you turn around and think about
it. Whatever we've lost, today I’m searching that within you.

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:55.458
Without that this work cannot be done. The people,
who in their arrogance, think themselves to be
very great, Sahaja Yoga is not for them.

00:18:55.458 --> 00:19:01.343
And those, who being poor, think that they can sit on
everybody’s head, there is no Sahaja yoga for them either.

00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:11.968
Sahaja Yoga is for those who are wiser,
deeper, solemn and religious people.

00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:22.561
Religion doesn't mean that from morning to evening
one chants God’s name but religious means those
who live in balance within themselves.

00:19:23.216 --> 00:19:35.166
Do not aggress. Those who consider themselves to be
fanatics, are useless. We are not concerned with them.

00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:43.391
Now it should be thought, that the habit we have got
into, that whenever there will be an audience,

00:19:44.598 --> 00:19:50.928
the speaker will always think that he has to win
over the audience because they will vote for him.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:20:01.130
If vote is not required, then some money has to be collected.
Audience gathers for some motive only, not unnecessarily.

00:20:02.363 --> 00:20:08.333
The speaker has some personal motive from
the audience, then only the audience gathers.

00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:16.481
But when there's music, that audience gathers
which wants to enjoy.

00:20:19.407 --> 00:20:27.987
When someone is a connoisseur of art, then that audience gathers,
which thinks the importance of the artist is more than them.

00:20:30.194 --> 00:20:37.384
In such a situation, going a little further think,
that when you have come here for the awakening of Kundalini,

00:20:37.384 --> 00:20:42.660
then understand, that you have come for your gain, not mine.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:53.346
You have to see your benefit. The Ganga
of Kundalini is within you.

00:20:53.896 --> 00:21:01.056
She can be awakened and you can get your realization
also. There's nothing new in it any more.

00:21:01.062 --> 00:21:10.842
Because the time has come. If this work is not done
in such crazy times, in such terrible times,
then when will it be done?

00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:23.613
This is the time that this work was to be done and
will be done and at this time man is in great delusion;
He is trapped in a great deal of confusion.

00:21:24.261 --> 00:21:33.951
At this time he is not able to understand
who out of you is right and who is wrong
but you should know one thing that

00:21:33.951 --> 00:21:43.020
when I have nothing to gain from you, then it is for
Me to see, who out of you is right and who is wrong?

00:21:43.987 --> 00:21:50.747
You don't have to see whether I'm right or wrong
because I don't want anything from you.

00:21:50.808 --> 00:21:57.478
This must be understood first, because mostly,
we come to see whether the person is right or wrong.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:08.247
But at this time we should look towards ourselves
whether we are correct? What a great thing it is
for which you have come.

00:22:08.353 --> 00:22:15.513
Self realization, which is the greatest thing.
There is nothing greater to be achieved in the world
than this.

00:22:15.513 --> 00:22:22.371
And if Mataji is sitting down here to give that
thing, then are we really worthy of it?

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:31.776
I say yes, you are, and you absolutely are.
Have faith and this work can be done.

00:22:31.776 --> 00:22:38.276
God made you very thoughtfully.
Has made you such that I have seen man,

00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:44.229
no matter how much he may have fallen down, no matter
how difficult he is, his Kundalini can be awakened.

00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:51.631
Don't know how! Such is the wonder of God,
His Grace is so amazing, I’ll tell you,

00:22:51.862 --> 00:22:59.492
for which people come and tell that, “Mother,
this person is so useless, You please leave him,”
even that person transcends.

00:22:59.772 --> 00:23:07.892
How wonderful it is! In my opinion, this is
what God must have thought that, if these people
are not awakened at this time,

00:23:07.892 --> 00:23:16.106
then all these people will be wasted and the
superb thing I made, man, who is My best creation,

00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:22.897
in it’s annihilation, all My creation will come to an end
and that's why this work is going on in full swing.

00:23:24.614 --> 00:23:33.624
But what does man seek and want to know,
he decides it with his intelligence.

00:23:34.855 --> 00:23:42.765
All that you have decided with your intelligence,
is a limited thing, it is a thing of your own making.

00:23:43.141 --> 00:24:01.541
But what is the Truth, what is real, to get to that reality,
one must first think of knowing it, seeing it, testing it,

00:24:02.699 --> 00:24:13.179
Because reality is fixed in it’s place. You can't
achieve it until you believe in It and consider
that It is in it’s place.

00:24:14.021 --> 00:24:20.781
It's stationed in it’s place and in order to
achieve that thing you have to reach there.

00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:25.945
Not that that thing will fall at your feet,
'Sir, you please lift me up on your head.”

00:24:28.652 --> 00:24:40.712
I am a Mother and Mothers sometimes give suggestions
to children and make them understand and sometimes,
sometimes even have to scold them.

00:24:41.423 --> 00:24:55.033
Children are mindless. They have to be led to God
with much love and wisdom because apart from
this I don't see any other choice.

00:24:55.995 --> 00:25:03.185
Without getting it, man will be devastated. Without
attaining the Spirit(Atma), you may do whatever you like,

00:25:03.185 --> 00:25:08.515
you may distance yourself, whatever you
may do, you'll be finished.

00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:28.095
Wherever you go and see in foreign countries,
you'd be surprised how fast these people
going to hell, going to hell,

00:25:28.095 --> 00:25:36.692
where the life is ending, what is their condition,
because they haven't found their Spirit.

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:45.236
A tree is visible from outside, it should not be
taken for granted as everything - we have to seek/find
the roots that are there.

00:25:45.317 --> 00:25:57.307
As long as you do not get down to it’s root, this
tree has no value and that root is inside us,
especially in this land of yoga.

00:25:57.307 --> 00:26:03.593
Whether you wear a suit or put on a tie
and even change your name and address too,

00:26:03.593 --> 00:26:09.916
after all, you are the children of this country
and this country is a land of yoga.

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:24.779
There is such a power in this country that
the people living here, have a special kind of right,
that they can attain the Divine.

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:37.607
You won't believe but as long as there is no
light inside, you may find My words to be probably
not true and probably may not even like them.

00:26:37.631 --> 00:26:45.761
But whatever it is, it must be understood that you
have a special kind of right, that you can achieve God.

00:26:46.415 --> 00:27:00.255
This is your legacy, this is your heritage, this
is a boon given to you by the Divine, that you
can attain this great power within yourself.

00:27:00.531 --> 00:27:14.481
Even after getting this Great Power of love,
you lose it quite quickly, like we are now
bent upon giving up our freedom after getting it.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:24.831
But it is very easy for an Indian to get to it.
It's not that easy for this work to be done abroad.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:35.100
But I travel abroad a lot. The reason is that there
if a man gets his realization, he stands up like a tree.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:41.489
And thousands of seeds may be sprouted in India,
only one or two somewhere become a tree.

00:27:44.572 --> 00:27:53.012
We have no dignity about ourselves. We don't value ourselves,
don't understand ourselves, we don't know ourselves.

00:27:53.327 --> 00:28:04.997
We have wasted our lives in small-small things.
It doesn’t appear in our life, in our goal,

00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:11.661
that in it we have thought of something great,
something lofty and something wonderful.

00:28:12.371 --> 00:28:21.971
Today the time has come that man has to think and if he
doesn't think about it, then the situation ahead is very bad.

00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:34.935
What is gone wrong now, can also improve, that too
can be corrected, so first of all, you achieve your Spirit.

00:28:35.014 --> 00:28:40.534
How to get it? Everyone will ask, "Mother, how?"
You don't need to worry about that.

00:28:40.534 --> 00:28:47.868
This Power lies within you, the Spirit is inherent in you.
As soon as this Power is connected to the Spirit,

00:28:47.868 --> 00:28:54.487
you start feeling this All-Pervading Power of God within you.

00:28:56.268 --> 00:29:06.318
There is a seed, how do you make it grow? Just
leave it in the Mother Earth’s womb, and it itself,

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:15.560
by itself, Sahaja – Sahaja means, Saha means ‘with’
and 'ja' means born - born with you

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:23.018
is this right, that your yoga, your union,
will happen with the Power of that God.

00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:35.912
And as soon as the yoga takes place, for the first time,
you get that power in your hands, which is All-Pervading.

00:29:36.403 --> 00:29:48.953
You start knowing it, you start understanding it.
Gradually this power increases, and you understand
it’s working that how does it flow,

00:29:48.964 --> 00:29:57.894
how should it be used and as you grow,
like that a seed grows into a tree.

00:29:59.756 --> 00:30:10.136
The special reason for this department is, that we
don’t know how we got a place for an ashram here?

00:30:10.316 --> 00:30:17.306
The government had given us a place earlier also, but
it was given such, that nothing can be understood.

00:30:18.306 --> 00:30:27.347
We were given a place in the vegetable market, where
the bullocks sit and there are abandoned cars.
Don't know how the government’s brain is.

00:30:27.564 --> 00:30:35.844
We said, “We are going to meditate here, so
what is this special place you have found for us?”

00:30:36.133 --> 00:30:43.053
Thus they had given us a wonderful place.
However, they are still trying to find a better place.

00:30:43.053 --> 00:30:50.849
God knows where else they will take us now.
The Government’s intellect will work as it works,
now we can't do anything.

00:30:50.849 --> 00:30:56.359
However, by the Grace of God, we’ve got this
place here - it's a small place.

00:30:56.359 --> 00:31:04.108
But when did we get this. In this enclave of yours,
having this place means something.

00:31:04.108 --> 00:31:11.366
It’s one or the other past virtue of yours,
one or the other speciality of yours, that’s why
this place here has been given.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:19.750
You don't have to pay money for this. Understand one thing,
that God doesn't know anything called money at all.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:26.304
This man cannot understand at all, it cannot
penetrate his head that the work of God
happens without money.

00:31:26.363 --> 00:31:33.683
Do you give money to a flower when it becomes a
fruit or if you put money in front of a tree

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:38.276
does it understand whether it is money,
or it is mud, or what it is?

00:31:41.984 --> 00:31:47.254
God didn't make money, you made money,
only you know it’s state.

00:31:48.737 --> 00:31:57.077
You cannot give or take money for this.
Yes, that’s another thing, that you brought
me flowers, that’s alright.

00:31:57.624 --> 00:32:03.340
You spent some money for the flowers, it’s okay.
You made this, you paid for it, it’s okay.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:09.532
But for your Kundalini awakening you don't have
to give money - this people don't understand.

00:32:09.687 --> 00:32:17.727
Especially, when we go to the villages, people
come with five paisa. An old woman came gave Me
five paisa with great love.

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:22.692
I said, "Oh, what are you doing?" So the
administrators said, "Don't give money."

00:32:22.692 --> 00:32:32.852
She said, "Okay, Mother doesn't like five paisa,
take ten paisa.” Now what to say to her?

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:39.610
Wisdom is so great that they can’t understand
that how will money work in the living work?

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:45.835
Suppose someone's breathing is not proper.
If you show it money, will it work?

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.040
Yes, in another way you can do, if you get medicine
from the doctor, do this, that’s another thing.

00:32:54.362 --> 00:33:01.132
But when breathing is improper, which is a
living work, you can't pay to change it.

00:33:01.523 --> 00:33:14.633
The second thing is that, whatever is the necessity
of man and which are the most important works,
they happen automatically.

00:33:14.744 --> 00:33:25.544
There is no need to do any hard work for it. For example,
just consider our breathing. For this if we need
to read books, then how long can we live?

00:33:25.705 --> 00:33:32.445
Many people think that after reading a book they can
find God. This is a matter of even more madness.

00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:39.834
Kabirdasji has said that, “The more a person reads,
he becomes foolish”. So I couldn’t understand at first,
how the learned(pundits) could become foolish.

00:33:40.026 --> 00:33:48.448
Didn’t understand. Now I see a lot that,'It is written
in this book, it is written in that book'

00:33:48.448 --> 00:33:57.588
Hey brother, what is written in the book of life, see that.
Book can be written by anyone who has a little money.

00:33:57.588 --> 00:34:01.931
Nowadays, we can find such people who write books
- a gentleman also told Me that,

00:34:01.931 --> 00:34:07.419
"You give me this many thousand rupees, then I will
write a book about You." I said, "You please let it be.”

00:34:09.573 --> 00:34:17.603
So writing a book is not a big deal and finding God
by reading a book, these fantasies are also absolutely wrong.

00:34:17.603 --> 00:34:25.295
It's written in this book, it's written in that book
- how would you know whether it is true or not?

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:32.141
Be it any book, I say, of the world. Your children
will not believe in any book in the times to come.

00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:38.963
You take any book and keep in front of them
they will say, "From where did you say this thing?
Where is this book from?”

00:34:39.146 --> 00:34:46.866
because what you have read, what have you achieved?
After reading this, has your thinking improved?

00:34:47.046 --> 00:34:55.376
Which qualities have you acquired? You are as you were earlier.
Must be just the burden of books and money from home….

00:34:57.601 --> 00:35:02.751
instead of being humbler than before
you've got a lot more vain

00:35:03.132 --> 00:35:11.572
and you've become very loose-tempered, and you
think that you are even greater than God,
so why should we read such a book?

00:35:12.556 --> 00:35:19.096
Whichever book we read, whether it is correct or not,
there is even no way of knowing this.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:34.440
There is only one way for everything. The Spirit
within, it is One, which is Absolute.

00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:50.076
By knowing That, which is the only One thing, which is not
interrelated to others, That which is complete,
That Thing will be understood.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:59.911
Like now, there was music happening here today. I saw
some people walked away from here, must have been
upset too, those who do not like classical music,

00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:05.312
they must be thinking, "What has Mother started? She had
come to tell about Kundalini, has started this music."

00:36:07.389 --> 00:36:16.319
Now the foreigners who are sitting here don't
even understand this music, what melody it is
and what rhythm is it.

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:24.794
But they were listening with pleasure and many of our
Sahaj Yogis were also listening. The reason for this
is that, this music was touching their Spirit.

00:36:26.396 --> 00:36:31.976
Until It is awakened, this music appears to be like this only.

00:36:32.207 --> 00:36:39.367
The day It is awakened, on that day
how will you know how it has affected you?

00:36:39.395 --> 00:36:47.515
It’s effect is understood by a Sahaja Yogi, that vibrations
started flowing from within and kept on increasing,
increasing and the joy kept coming.

00:36:49.406 --> 00:36:55.756
So the Divine power is activated, it
does not speak, it manifests, does the work.

00:36:55.756 --> 00:37:04.510
Like a man thinks that, "Now sitting down I have thought,
thought well.” So what? By thinking will your motor run?

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:08.383
Run and show it. Sat in the car and kept on thinking,
kept on thinking, kept on thinking.

00:37:09.285 --> 00:37:18.525
"I thought," - gone. You thought, means from your
intellect? Do you know it’s boundaries?

00:37:19.797 --> 00:37:29.127
"We think." How do you think? By that
thinking, what work can you do?

00:37:29.299 --> 00:37:41.829
At the most, a dead thing from a dead thing
.... and by repeatedly using them yourself,
you too become sort of dead.

00:37:42.188 --> 00:37:52.148
Means, like that now you have made a car, now you’ve
started moving in the car. You’ve become a slave of the car.

00:37:52.374 --> 00:37:59.544
Because your two legs are useless and if someday
the car fails, then your condition is bad.

00:37:59.769 --> 00:38:05.349
Then after that it is very difficult for you
to walk and you sit down at one place.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:15.670
Whatever such things you have made,
they’re loaded onto your head and by loading them,
you think you've grown a lot.

00:38:15.946 --> 00:38:22.066
So you've grown outside - you've become very small
inside - you have no strength(power) of your own.

00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:30.446
Our power comes only from the Spirit and it
must be achieved - this one desire must be had first.

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:41.279
It must first desired, "Mother, I am the Spirit
and let the light of the Spirit come in my attention."

00:38:41.574 --> 00:38:46.334
Unless you have this desire in your heart,
till then My hand will not work.

00:38:47.486 --> 00:38:54.156
At first there should be a desire that, "I am
the Spirit and I will attain this Spirit."

00:38:54.156 --> 00:39:04.789
Now as a mother's condition is, that even if she wants
to feed castor oil, then by telling some story
for it, and mixing something sweet, she gives it.

00:39:06.086 --> 00:39:13.586
But let me tell you the truth, that once the Spirit
is achieved, you will find that your physical, mental,

00:39:13.586 --> 00:39:19.092
intellectual, whatever the tribulation and
whatever the struggle, everything will end.

00:39:20.068 --> 00:39:32.408
Whatever few are suffering, it will be all over and you
will be on a different level, different world,
will become a different person.

00:39:33.751 --> 00:39:41.035
That's why the one who knows the Brahma(Spirit), is known
as twice born, means the one who has got the second birth.

00:39:41.625 --> 00:39:48.895
And I have seen many people in America who roam around
with advertisements on them that,“We’ve got
our second birth.”"Okay, how?"

00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:59.935
Okay, you said, 'Second birth has taken place', so some
symptoms of it should also be seen, how can you
say that you’ve got your second birth?

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:06.930
So when a person gets his second birth, then
his consciousness, his awareness,

00:40:08.512 --> 00:40:17.172
whatever he feels, becomes common,
becomes of the masses, becomes collective.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:26.560
As you can tell, while sitting down here, as to which
chakras of such-and-such a person are caught?

00:40:29.739 --> 00:40:39.489
All information can be had from this because your Spirit
is the knower of everything. Your intelligence,
this is also intellect as well as that.

00:40:40.168 --> 00:40:49.838
This is what makes man dignified. But what is Only,
the Spirit knows and what is the truth, the Spirit tells.

00:40:53.325 --> 00:41:04.905
We have been hearing this a lot. Till now, many people
have explained in different ways. Among them there were
many who spoke the truth and there are many who told lies.

00:41:04.944 --> 00:41:10.124
Many people who tell lies, copy the one
who speaks the truth in such a manner, that
the one who speaks the truth

00:41:10.124 --> 00:41:16.291
remains speechless, that how can he be repeating
my own words, so loudly and with courage.

00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:21.744
And the foreign people think that, “Oh, when he is
saying, then it must be true, how can he tell lies?”

00:41:21.744 --> 00:41:24.890
They don't know that we are experts in telling lies.

00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:36.955
Therefore whatever is said there should be
reality about it, it should be experienced.

00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:49.897
It's too much time now. Whatever work I wanted to do,
I have done in music itself, in 10-15 minutes only,
you people will get your realization.

00:41:50.047 --> 00:42:00.787
I have no doubt about it, but another meaning of Yoga is,
the trick or technique – ‘Do such a trick Nandlal(Shri Krishna)’

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:14.460
such a trick by which you know everything regarding
your Spirit, recognize It’s powers, make use of It
and give It’s benefit to everyone.

00:42:14.522 --> 00:42:21.672
Until this happens, It’s skill, which is
called deftness, unless you learn,

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:25.944
then it’s like, a car that's brought and kept
for you and has rusted while standing.

00:42:26.954 --> 00:42:34.734
Such is the state of yoga. Mostly among Indians
I have seen this kind of yoga only, like a
rusted car is standing before Me

00:42:34.782 --> 00:42:43.192
and saying, "Mother, I came to you twenty years ago,
came ten years ago, but I’ve become as I was.”

00:42:44.285 --> 00:42:53.595
So this is not the point. You have to engage yourself,
will have to work hard, will have to know, because this is
the One Only thing to be known, the rest is nothing to know.

00:42:53.595 --> 00:43:01.916
If you know this, then you have known everything.
Even small children can know this,
even illiterate people can know this.

00:43:01.916 --> 00:43:11.252
A very illiterate man, don’t know how many thousands of
people he has healed through the practice of Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:11.252 --> 00:43:15.996
cured their diseases, even diseases like cancer
were cured. He is not a doctor,

00:43:16.756 --> 00:43:22.356
he has not learnt Medicine but going down to
the principles, he has worked it out.

00:43:22.747 --> 00:43:32.297
You all can do it too. First of all, you cure yourself,
attain the principles through your Spirit
and later you learn about it.

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:39.211
Especially for you people, the temple has come so
close by, that even if you walk you can reach there.

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:46.944
Here you do not have to pay any money, as has been
said earlier. Just with faith, with attention upon
yourself, you have to put in some effort.

00:43:47.693 --> 00:43:56.863
Mostly there’s a program here every Sunday at ten in the
morning. You have to give nothing, you only have to take.

00:43:56.954 --> 00:44:04.054
And that's why come here after emptying your pitcher
and learn slowly whatever you want to learn.

00:44:04.237 --> 00:44:10.927
You’ll be surprised how limitless is the
Grace of God and the person who is realized

00:44:10.927 --> 00:44:15.047
how much The Divine cares for him and how important he is.

00:44:15.292 --> 00:44:25.782
I hope you people pay attention to my words
and every Sunday at ten o'clock come to this place and
know and learn about Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:26.544 --> 00:44:32.414
Now you people just sit with your hands towards Me,
like this, with your eyes closed and take off your glasses.

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:48.252
I bow to all the (INAUDIBLE) people of Bengal.

00:44:52.387 --> 00:45:14.680
First of all, I thank honourable Mr. Bhagwati Prasad ji Banerjee
very much, that even after this chaotic and troublesome busy life,

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:29.307
came among us today and spoke so many words of deep wisdom
to you. Nowadays there are very few such people.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:38.990
I have always believed that people who are in the legal
or law profession, in them, the religion somehow persists.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:48.862
My father was also a lawyer, my husband was also a lawyer,
My father-in-law was also a lawyer. I come from a family
of lawyers and everyone in my house is a lawyer

00:45:48.919 --> 00:46:00.449
and I have seen a kind of religious awareness in
many lawyers, here and outside as well.

00:46:01.378 --> 00:46:10.798
From the system of religion(Dharma) within us law is made.
The ten valencies within us are our ten religions.

00:46:10.798 --> 00:46:16.263
As Carbon has four valencies, human-beings have ten valencies.

00:46:16.412 --> 00:46:26.412
When man came towards evolution, when he evolved,
he evolved, when he became a human-being from Carbon.

00:46:26.456 --> 00:46:34.926
Many incidents happened at that time, many
Incarnations came into the world, and in the end
he reached the stage of a human-being.

00:46:34.973 --> 00:46:40.343
It is necessary in the human condition that
we have religion established within.

00:46:40.646 --> 00:46:47.846
I would say this about Lenin, that I have seen
his body, I have gone to Russia with my husband.

00:46:47.935 --> 00:46:56.875
You will be surprised, that he was a realized man,
realized person. Later with the coercion of the
party he fell into this

00:46:56.875 --> 00:47:05.279
but the reason for what he said about religion is this,
that there was no religion in Russia at that time before.

00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:10.125
And then the Tsar said, "Everyone has some or the
other religion, we should also get some religion.”

00:47:10.125 --> 00:47:16.735
These people don't know anything about religion,
nobody has seen in-depth among them,
they had no visionaries.

00:47:16.735 --> 00:47:24.435
As there have been great saints and sages here, such people
have been very few there and when they used to speak,
people only considered them to be mad.

00:47:24.435 --> 00:47:29.095
The religion that was there, was said to
be made very organized, well-organized.

00:47:29.095 --> 00:47:36.889
They have also tried to organize the Divine, that's why,
in a way, what Lenin said at that time, is correct.

00:47:36.889 --> 00:47:46.338
Because when they had no religious system, Tsar said,
that there must be some religious arrangement.
And I have checked it Myself.

00:47:46.455 --> 00:47:54.585
When we were there I said, "Well, I would like to go to these
priests you have here and I want to see the churches here."

00:47:54.585 --> 00:48:02.383
When we went there, you’ll be surprised that,
there was only one religion there, which you call as
Orthodox Greek Christianity.

00:48:02.383 --> 00:48:07.825
And there are two types of orders in it - one
Black and one White – it’s a very over-organized thing.

00:48:07.825 --> 00:48:13.707
And when we reached there that gentleman
came himself because we were VIPs.

00:48:13.707 --> 00:48:21.005
And the chief there told us that, "Nowadays,
since we are fasting, we will eat vegetarian food.”

00:48:21.066 --> 00:48:24.296
So we said, "That's great, will eat vegetarian food.”

00:48:24.296 --> 00:48:31.062
But they didn't mind eating vegetarian food,
means there was no harm in eating non-veg,

00:48:31.062 --> 00:48:38.766
but that gentleman drank so much alcohol, drank so much,
that when we started coming back, he didn't even
realize that the chief guest was returning

00:48:38.766 --> 00:48:44.716
or they should see us off - so much alcohol they drank.
So I asked, "How are these people here, what is this?"

00:48:44.716 --> 00:48:52.481
So they informed that when the Tsar expressed his desire
that there must be some religion there, these people
started saying, "Which religion should we follow now?"

00:48:52.481 --> 00:48:59.983
Thus they asked the Catholic, so the Catholic said,
"There is one thing in our religion, you can drink
alcohol but you cannot remarry.

00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:06.041
Tsar said, "This is not possible because we have
so many proposals for marriage, so this cannot be,
it will not work for us."

00:49:06.051 --> 00:49:11.430
That's why he refused them. Then he said, "Well,
if not this thing, we should see some other religion.”

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:19.301
Muslims came. Muslims said, "Okay, among us there is
an arrangement of having more marriages but we don’t
have the system of drinking.”

00:49:19.301 --> 00:49:23.029
Can't drink alcohol. He said, "This religion
cannot work at all here."

00:49:23.029 --> 00:49:28.072
Then third, a Greek Orthodox one, a new religion
had emerged, came.

00:49:28.072 --> 00:49:33.313
It said, "Okay, it doesn’t matter to us. You
do what you want, just keep giving us money."
Like the gurus nowadays.

00:49:35.969 --> 00:49:43.159
When Lenin said this about them it was the truth.
What he said was an intermediary thing.

00:49:43.159 --> 00:49:47.225
We are neither Capitalist nor Communist
and in fact are both.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.880
When you have all the powers -
suppose that we have all the powers,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.919
so we became capitalists, but can’t rest in peace
without sharing, so we have become Communists.

00:49:59.048 --> 00:50:02.528
When there is no peace without sharing,
thus we become communists.

00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:10.599
In fact, whatever are your theories, it’s reality, actuality,
you’ll come to know, when you will attain enlightenment.

00:50:10.599 --> 00:50:15.624
Because all these are also from assumptions
that come from your Unconscious,

00:50:15.624 --> 00:50:22.204
that we are communists, some say we are capitalists
- all these are external things – what capital do
they have - these stones?

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:27.870
If they had any capital then why would they be
crying today? Those who have become huge capitalists,

00:50:27.895 --> 00:50:35.045
you can know three such countries as Switzerland,
Norway and Sweden. There’s a competition among the
people of all the three countries

00:50:35.045 --> 00:50:40.588
that who will die first and who will
commit suicide? Is this capitalism?

00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:45.721
They didn't have any enjoyment from it. The one
who hasn’t enjoyed, what’s the use of his capital?

00:50:45.721 --> 00:50:53.860
So our imagination too, that by getting money or with the
improvement of our economic condition, we’ll be absolutely
fine - is a complete misunderstanding.

00:50:53.968 --> 00:51:02.928
Because we can't bear money. You give Rs.100 to any man,
immediately he will go to drink alcohol.

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:07.837
Any wrong deed. People with much money
remain engrossed in wrongdoings.

00:51:08.008 --> 00:51:12.068
Have you seen any wisdom coming to them because of money?

00:51:12.697 --> 00:51:19.227
Then people think that let's get power. Those who have
got power, become absolutely insane persons.

00:51:19.227 --> 00:51:26.127
You can't even talk to them. So those whose attention
is also towards power, that after attaining the power
they’ll be happy, that is also not the case.

00:51:26.544 --> 00:51:32.864
Some say, "Okay, they should take care of our
mother and son, our mother and sister."
There’s a madness in our country regarding this.

00:51:32.864 --> 00:51:38.161
'My son, my daughter, my, my,' it’s so much
that it’s also exaggerated.

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:44.437
Shri Krishna has given a very good insight in this
matter that in the world there are three types of
people, there are only three castes.

00:51:44.437 --> 00:51:48.788
We who fight for caste-caste, there are not
so many castes - there are only three castes.

00:51:48.788 --> 00:51:55.775
Fourteen thousand years ago Markandeya Swami had said,
'Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu jaati rupena sansthita'
there are three Goddesses,

00:51:55.775 --> 00:52:01.100
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati - there are three Goddesses.
According to that we have three qualities.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:09.494
One is Tamasic(Left-sided), one is Rajasic(Right-sided)
and one is Sattvic(Center). Those who are tamasic,
they believe wrong things to be true only.

00:52:09.632 --> 00:52:18.362
Mostly people in our country, I think, are tamasik.
Any man released from jail, wears saffron clothes,
they start touching his feet.

00:52:18.362 --> 00:52:24.138
Who is that man, from where did he come,
what does he do – don’t know. I think,
Calcutta is full of occultists.

00:52:24.138 --> 00:52:29.299
Whomsoever I meet says, "I am initiated."
And Kundalini is frozen, how are you initiated?

00:52:29.658 --> 00:52:37.958
Pursuing the wrong thing is a tamasic trait.
Believing the wrong to be right and giving
one’s life for it, is a tamasic trait.

00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:41.685
Then some people do it for their wife,
some do it for their son.

00:52:41.685 --> 00:52:47.494
Doing one or the other wrong thing, which has
nothing to do with the collective,

00:52:47.494 --> 00:52:52.122
which is not related to the collective,
to act like this, is a tamasic symptom.

00:52:52.337 --> 00:53:01.077
And the rajasic characteristic is that as of the people
of the Western countries, who don’t even know the
difference between right and wrong.

00:53:01.271 --> 00:53:10.061
If you - like some people in London came to us,
with pink hair, pins here, 4-5 pins hanging here,

00:53:10.061 --> 00:53:14.586
I said, “What personation(avatar) is this?" so they
asked, "What's wrong, what's wrong with it?"

00:53:14.586 --> 00:53:20.280
Now what to say to the idiots, what’s wrong with it?
You hang all the pins from here, so
what could be bad in it?

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:26.603
But this is what these people do not know - why are you
people following the Western people? They don't even
know what is good and what is bad?

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:33.520
It’s a great foolish state, extreme foolishness.
If you listen to their talks, you’ll be surprised.
One greater than the other.

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:39.028
We had gone to Boston. There it was said, "Mother
has come, we will put an advertisement for Her.”

00:53:39.034 --> 00:53:44.529
They asked, "How many Rolls Royces does She have?"
“So, She doesn't take any money, from
where will She have the Rolls Royces?"

00:53:44.529 --> 00:53:47.869
Started saying, "Then we are not interested in
such a person who doesn't have Rolls Royce.”

00:53:47.869 --> 00:53:51.874
They've commercialized so much,
that even God has become commercial.

00:53:52.374 --> 00:53:57.154
And that's why all the commercialized gurus from here
went and sat there, it was their fate.

00:53:57.236 --> 00:54:05.146
But now it should be understood that the third one was
Saatvik(virtuous). The person who is virtuous
knows what is good and what is bad.

00:54:05.146 --> 00:54:12.378
What is religion(Dharma), what is unrighteousness(Adharma)?
The one who understands both, is a virtuous man and
such a man can be evolved.

00:54:12.378 --> 00:54:19.706
And only such a man attains the Spirit. Lot's of
people also ask, "Mother, why establish the religion?

00:54:19.706 --> 00:54:23.397
The ten valencies that we have within,
why should they be kept established?"

00:54:23.397 --> 00:54:31.997
The reason is this, that if you want to be the Spirit, if you
want to fly in the sky, you should keep yourself in balance.

00:54:31.997 --> 00:54:39.045
And that's why the rules we have, the law, is
maintained in equilibrium(balance) that we may
not go to extremes in imbalance.

00:54:39.045 --> 00:54:46.383
We go on the right side when we become rajasik.
then we torture others inhumanly,

00:54:46.383 --> 00:54:51.968
misbehave with them and dominate them,
are aggressive to them.

00:54:51.968 --> 00:54:58.342
And when we become Tamasik, we kill ourselves,
do evil(wickedness) to ourselves only.

00:54:58.342 --> 00:55:04.075
Don’t eat, don’t drink, observe fast, do a variety
of things so that our bodies get destroyed.

00:55:04.075 --> 00:55:11.931
So many misconceptions persist in our country,
that while breaking them one by one, My
twelve to fourteen years have been spent

00:55:11.931 --> 00:55:17.245
but now I know, that today for the first time
I have come in front of you, so I request you,

00:55:17.245 --> 00:55:24.568
that you only have a concept(belief) within,
that what we will know from experience,
that is the right thing.

00:55:24.568 --> 00:55:30.909
Any talk devoid of experience, remains only a talk,
to which Shankaracharya said, 'Web of words'.

00:55:30.909 --> 00:55:37.085
Then a lot of pompous show the people do, all farce
of the world - some dance like this, jumping
- it's all a sham.

00:55:37.085 --> 00:55:43.782
Yoga is within, inner yoga. Inside us a happening
takes place, which is the awakening of Kundalini.

00:55:43.782 --> 00:55:50.804
I have even seen such books in which it is written
that this disease is caused by the awakening of Kundalini,
that happens – it’s never going to happen.

00:55:50.804 --> 00:56:00.185
Because Kundalini that is, is your own mother.
Every person has his Kundalini sitting in the triangular bone

00:56:00.185 --> 00:56:09.875
awaiting, waiting for this chance, when will my son
turn this way and when can I give him rebirth.

00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:15.239
This is your pure desire. Rest all the other
desires of the world, are not pure.

00:56:15.239 --> 00:56:19.805
The reason for this is that, you know
it’s believed in Economics

00:56:19.805 --> 00:56:27.333
that the desires that are, your desires are, in
general, means, never fully satiable

00:56:27.333 --> 00:56:33.668
but yes, one or two be in particular, are fulfilled.
Means that today we will say that,
"We need a car," the car arrived,

00:56:33.668 --> 00:56:37.717
then we need a home, a home needed, then this
is needed - these desires will continue.

00:56:37.717 --> 00:56:45.671
But the Pure Desire that is, is your Kundalini.
It is the power of God. It is the reflection
of Adishakti in you.

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:54.862
This Adishakti needs only one thing. She asks only
one thing, that She be united with the formless Brahma.

00:56:54.862 --> 00:57:00.645
That I be united with the All-Pervading Power
of God, this is the only Pure Desire.

00:57:00.645 --> 00:57:05.886
Until that desire is fulfilled, till then all other
desires come, go, and are finished.

00:57:05.886 --> 00:57:10.455
But when this desire is awakened -
then man is called a seeker -

00:57:10.455 --> 00:57:17.301
And after it’s awakening when man achieves it,
after attaining it, there is nothing left to be achieved,
then it is about giving.

00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:23.058
Like a lamp, until it is lit, it is cherished,
made, oiled, wick is put.

00:57:23.058 --> 00:57:26.559
When it is lit, then it’s work of giving starts.

00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:31.199
Similarly, God so beautifully made the man,
cherished it so much.

00:57:31.199 --> 00:57:36.027
To say that there is no God, there is no problem
in that also. Say it or not, He is, so He is.

00:57:36.027 --> 00:57:42.163
But even when someone says, "There is no God,"
then too he says there is. Even saying ‘No,’ means there is.

00:57:42.231 --> 00:57:48.751
And that’s why, today is the time has come
to prove, whether there is God or not.

00:57:50.077 --> 00:57:59.477
Yes, earlier only one or two people used to be
realized, only one or two used to be a saint,
only a person or two used to achieve it.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:06.270
Because just like on a living tree, at first,
only one or two flowers bloom on it

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:14.541
But when spring comes, many flowers blossom on
that tree, then many fruits emerge from it.

00:58:14.541 --> 00:58:22.789
That's why today Sahaja Yoga is done in the community, the
collective. This is not for one or two, it is society-oriented.

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:31.147
It has a vision towards the society. If there is no
purification in the society because of this, then
Sahaja Yoga is futile.

00:58:31.147 --> 00:58:40.069
It is a path of purification, of the transformation
of man, absolutely is a way for him to be reborn,
due to which man changes completely.

00:58:40.148 --> 00:58:46.128
What the respected trustee has said, that
equality should come in us.

00:58:46.128 --> 00:58:54.518
Equality from the outside and only from mental
projection or thought, will never come. Whatever
will come, will only appear to be.

00:58:54.518 --> 00:58:59.684
I have not seen such equality anywhere in the world.
But when your Spirit is awakened,

00:58:59.684 --> 00:59:07.416
then, on your Central Nervous System, a new
dimension within you, is in your nerves

00:59:07.416 --> 00:59:15.360
and you feel that you have been awakened with the
Collective Consciousness. This is not a mental projection.

00:59:15.376 --> 00:59:22.166
This reality you feel, that where your chakras are
catching, where the other person’s chakras are catching.

00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:27.371
Where is his Kundalini, where is your Kundalini
- as if no one other remains.

00:59:27.699 --> 00:59:35.069
You must have heard that, many people do missionary work.
They do things like, bring the poor and do this for them, do that,

00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:40.464
there is no hand of God in this. Poverty has been
created by you. God has not made anyone poor.

00:59:40.464 --> 00:59:45.487
Picked up the poor and gave them medicine -
there is no need to give the name of God to this act.

00:59:45.943 --> 00:59:52.623
When you are self-realized, there is no need to give
anything to anyone, it happens automatically.

00:59:52.623 --> 01:00:00.396
Maybe, a lot of people sitting here today
get well. Your Kundalini will be awakened in such a
manner that your health will be fine.

01:00:00.446 --> 01:00:11.386
Most of the troublesome diseases, such as cancer,
which are called incurable diseases, many such
diseases get cured through this.

01:00:11.386 --> 01:00:18.040
Since your Kundalini Power has been awakened,
it has nourished all those energy centres(chakras)

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.813
and because of that, the deities sitting on those chakras,
with them being awakened, you become healthy again.

01:00:23.813 --> 01:00:28.410
There’s nothing special about it, nothing is to be done
in it, I don't seem to have anything to do with it.

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:33.764
I have to say that if there is pain in one finger,
and it is rubbed with the other finger,

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:42.702
so will this finger be obliged to it
or something? That has to be done, it has to be done
because (when) it has become an integral part of the body.

01:00:42.702 --> 01:00:48.560
Similarly you don’t remain the other
and when this condition comes,

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.146
that I have done you a favour, that I
I have done good to you - this feeling is no more.

01:00:53.146 --> 01:01:00.165
It just keeps on flowing in inaction, just like
the light of the Sun but even then our intellect
that is there, is very sharp.

01:01:00.165 --> 01:01:03.795
We see everything with our intellect and
keep trying to know it through our intelligence.

01:01:03.898 --> 01:01:12.458
Although Sahaja, Sahaja means, 'Saha' – born
with you is the right of such yoga, which
is your own. It's your birthright.

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:18.230
Freedom that we call, we haven’t got that freedom
yet. If we had got it, then this would not have
been the condition of our country.

01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:23.711
Shivaji said at the time of his coronation
- then Ramdas Swami himself was a Brahmin -

01:01:23.711 --> 01:01:29.497
but he came and told Shivaji that,
'awaken Self dharma (indistinct)',
awaken dharma of the Spirit.

01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:37.171
Until the religion of self is awakened, there
will be no welfare of the country. Independence is gained
but he said that this is freedom of the Self(Spirit).

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:43.865
There should be the technique of the Self. 'Swa' means
the technique of the Spirit. Unless you awaken it
till then this work will not take place.

01:01:43.865 --> 01:01:53.771
Although in Maharashtra, a lot of work has been done on
on Kundalini. The reason is that in this state great
saints and sages have worked hard on this.

01:01:53.771 --> 01:02:02.790
Especially Gyaneshwarji has said that, he has said
that 'Now The Universal One should be happy with us
and being pleased grant boons to us.'

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:07.502
Tosh - Give us pasayadaan with Tosh.
It means give these vibrations, give this Chaitanya.

01:02:07.502 --> 01:02:18.029
And 'Swadharma Surya Vishva Pahuk' – means let
the whole world know the Sun(light)
of the religion of Spirit.

01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:27.711
Until this awakening of the religion of the Spirit
doesn’t happen in us, we only verbalize, in mental projection
keep on saying, that we are brothers.

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:33.316
We used to say 'Chinese, Indians are brothers',
where has it gone? We are not brothers among
ourselves. Not among ourselves.

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:38.813
Amongst Indians, it is a speciality that,
until they cut each other's neck,
they will not be at ease.

01:02:38.962 --> 01:02:48.072
So how are we brothers? It’s just to say that we are
brothers and there is friendship. There can be no friendship
anywhere until you can’t be awakened in the Spirit

01:02:48.072 --> 01:02:57.112
because the collective individual in you, which,
the collectivity that is within you, can be sought
for by the Spirit itself.

01:02:57.848 --> 01:03:06.318
The collective being which is within you, is the Spirit.
Until you have found it, you're all different-different,
separate.

01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:15.959
And there's a reason for that. Everyone was created different,
so that each person in his individualistic direction,
firstly should know, what is good, what is bad?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:23.310
Check your freedom first. If he is on the
central path, then he can attain his Spirit,

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:31.993
the Spirit with which he awakens in the entire collective.
Thus the things that we think should be for the
whole society, how would they be?

01:03:31.993 --> 01:03:36.655
Is there any method, you tell? Some person,
whom you put in power,

01:03:36.655 --> 01:03:45.232
can never live without any single dogma, absolutely
selfless, absolutely someone without ideology, at all.

01:03:45.232 --> 01:03:50.478
It will go on forming in his mind, because
his Brahmarandhra has not yet been pierced.

01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:58.960
When the Brahmarandhra is pierced, one becomes united with
the infinite, absolute, sole power of God Almighty.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.210
There are no two questions in it.
There are never two Truths.

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:09.634
Now let Me tell you like this that if you see a man,
can you tell whether this person is good or bad?

01:04:09.634 --> 01:04:12.880
Can't tell. One person would say, "He’s
very good," one will say, "He’s bad."

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:18.486
But when you get the realization of the Self,
vibrations start flowing within you.

01:04:18.486 --> 01:04:23.332
If that person is bad, then your vibrations will
stop completely just as if you are a computer.

01:04:23.332 --> 01:04:29.532
Otherwise too you are a computer. Such a special computer
that without thinking about anything, without any programming,

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:36.406
seeing something, you know what you are.
But that computer starts working only when it
gets connected to the mains.

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:43.130
Just like this is also an instrument here. Till
it will not be connected to mains, it is useless.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:50.080
Similarly, we should also be connected to the mains.
Now in devotion people take the name of God, shout, scream.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:55.295
Now if you see in Oxford Street, you’ll die
with shame, that those people wearing dhoti,

01:04:55.295 --> 01:05:01.533
and putting the bodis available in the market,
beating drums all along the way, and
all their dhotis also fall, sarees also fall,

01:05:01.533 --> 01:05:05.763
no manners, nothing, like idiots, beg while
chanting 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna'.

01:05:06.849 --> 01:05:15.939
That Krishna who is Lakshmipati Himself,
these devotees beg in this way.

01:05:15.939 --> 01:05:24.340
Begging does not suit the son of Lakshmipati.
But they are not, it is some other community
which is after wrong things.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:32.124
Shri Krishna has clearly said 'Yoga: Kshema: Vahamayam'.
We forget that Krishna was a diplomat.
He was an embodiment of diplomacy.

01:05:32.124 --> 01:05:37.315
They knew that man would waver a little.
Ghee cannot be taken out directly from this.

01:05:37.315 --> 01:05:42.730
He had clearly said, 'Yoga: Kshema: Vahamayam'.
First achieve yoga, then there will be welfare.

01:05:43.058 --> 01:05:48.838
Never said 'Kshem Yoga' or even said 'Kshema'
that at that time (UNCLEAR - carries?)
'Yoga: Kshema: Vahamayam'

01:05:48.838 --> 01:05:56.441
On Bhakti(devotion) also He has said, 'Patram, Pushpam,
Falam, Toyam,’ whatever you give I'll take but which
devotion is needed - 'When there is not the other’.

01:05:56.441 --> 01:06:01.674
That is, when in Self-realization you are part and parcel,
when someone – ananya means, when there is not the other.

01:06:01.674 --> 01:06:07.446
So the state is such, that at that time there is
not the other. You must have oneness with God.

01:06:07.446 --> 01:06:11.463
Upon seeing this people think, "Mother how
is it like this, how can it be so simple?"

01:06:11.463 --> 01:06:14.798
Especially those who are intellectuals,
they say, "How can it be that simple?"

01:06:14.932 --> 01:06:20.422
But this is a living process. The living work
of The living God is always Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:20.422 --> 01:06:24.897
You think, that for our breathing, if you have
to go to a guru and read a book

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:29.522
and take initiation for that, then what’s
the use, can anyone live?

01:06:29.790 --> 01:06:38.270
Look at any living process. There’s a seed.
If you just put it in the mother's lap(sow it),
it sprouts on its own.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:41.839
How does it germinate, can anyone tell? Why
it sprouts, can anyone tell?

01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:45.991
No one can tell. Science can't tell
about this that how, why,

01:06:45.991 --> 01:06:50.644
due to which power does it sprout? What
power does it have which sprouts it?

01:06:50.644 --> 01:06:55.310
We don't do any living work but there is so much
arrogance in us that there is no limit.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.637
We - understand now - that a tree has fallen down
we made something out of it, suppose,

01:06:59.637 --> 01:07:04.373
made a stage, then we think that we have done a
great job. These stones were lying there, made a building -

01:07:04.373 --> 01:07:07.864
You made dead from dead – What living work
have you done till today?

01:07:07.864 --> 01:07:14.300
Only when you are Self-realized, then you
can do living work, because with your hands
Kundalini is awakened.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:21.350
Now no matter how much is said about it, you
won't understand until you get the experience of it.

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:27.052
There must definitely be an experience. Talking about it,
without experience, is just a waste of time.

01:07:27.052 --> 01:07:33.301
Like, suppose, you have to come into this room,
and you asked, "Mother, how to turn on the light?"

01:07:33.301 --> 01:07:38.515
I said, "Okay son, turn on that switch".
You go and switch it on - it's done.

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:45.961
But it doesn't mean behind this light there's
no other light, there's no other huge organization
behind it,

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:50.486
there’s no great history behind it
and it doesn’t have any big discipline -

01:07:50.486 --> 01:07:57.868
everything is there, but everything is made easy for you,
because when work has to be done on the collective,
it has to be made easy.

01:07:57.868 --> 01:08:04.357
As long as Kundalini awakening is not available to the
common man, maybe God’s name may be erased from the world.

01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:10.808
The common man should be benefited from it
and this has been my effort. When I was born,

01:08:10.808 --> 01:08:14.511
father knew about Me, what My work was
and he told Me that,

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:18.571
"Daughter, you don’t need to talk right now,
don't say anything about it,

01:08:18.571 --> 01:08:23.753
because no use writing another Gita, Bible
and Koran. You please do this

01:08:23.753 --> 01:08:31.612
that first find out how the common people can be
awakened, which is Your work, for which You have
come into the world.

01:08:31.612 --> 01:08:38.386
At that time I saw the arrangements/system within man,
saw his modus operandi, saw all his ways,

01:08:38.386 --> 01:08:46.375
and then I thought, why can't we
find a method that only by doing it
the common man should be realized immediately.

01:08:46.375 --> 01:08:51.706
And such a system was made and I understood one thing
because of which this work was not happening,

01:08:51.706 --> 01:08:58.387
that man cannot be awakened without breaking
the Sahastrara because the peethas of all the
seven chakras are in this Sahasrara

01:08:58.387 --> 01:09:04.501
and until this integration, this Oneness
is established, this work cannot be done.

01:09:04.593 --> 01:09:09.423
And when this work was accomplished, I am greatly
surprised, I Myself am surprised,

01:09:09.423 --> 01:09:14.231
that thousands are realized in a moment, thousands
of people, but it's a little difficult in the city.

01:09:14.231 --> 01:09:18.613
The people of the city are a little too smart,
and think too much of themselves than required.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:22.833
As you said, ego comes in us and
there are many such things

01:09:22.833 --> 01:09:26.021
and those who do not get into ego, are
trapped in some or the other misconceptions.

01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:30.929
But the simple people of the villages – in Maharashtra
ten-ten thousand people get their awakening all together.

01:09:30.929 --> 01:09:35.812
It's an amazing thing to look at, but it
happens. It happens, there’s no doubt about it.

01:09:35.812 --> 01:09:42.290
How can you give money for this?
Does God know money? It's something made by you.

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:47.765
Those who take money from you in the name of God,
never consider that person to be a man of God..

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:51.995
Only the man who unites you with the Divine,
is the man who has come from God

01:09:51.995 --> 01:09:58.599
because what does money mean to him? That person,
you just tell me, that when you understand,
that you are a seed,

01:09:58.599 --> 01:10:06.763
if you want to make it alive
or a tender sprout comes out of it,

01:10:06.763 --> 01:10:12.693
then, do you give it money, do you give money
to this Mother Earth, do you pay the Sun,

01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:17.918
or the air we live on, to this water,
what money does this Ganga understand?

01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:22.849
The sacred thing of God Almighty
doesn't understand money.

01:10:22.849 --> 01:10:28.291
The first thing to be understood, that the man who
asks for money for something and calls it
God, is a wrong thing.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:34.954
Secondly, that it is effortless, it is spontaneous.
It should happen effortlessly.

01:10:34.954 --> 01:10:38.624
Now someone will say, "You stand on your head,
your Kundalini has been awakened.”

01:10:38.624 --> 01:10:46.098
Such books have been taken out by people and
especially those who are intellectuals, they
like these new fashion books a lot.

01:10:46.098 --> 01:10:50.653
Anyone may come in this new fashion - Rajneesh has come,
various others came. There’s no scriptural basis for them.

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:57.569
All of this is evolutionary. The scripture that is,
is evolutionary. It started with this, then that,
then that happened next -

01:10:57.569 --> 01:11:02.211
There must be some basis or support for it.
Someone says something straight out of the air,
people start believing into it.

01:11:02.211 --> 01:11:10.028
Just like in our Maharashtra, some Brahmins
are very intelligent, for them also a
equivalent man has come out.

01:11:10.028 --> 01:11:16.410
He has written a book called 'Karunopaya'
Arunopaya Karunopaya' I said, "Now, what is this,
what is this?"

01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:23.136
Says, "We pass on the power(Shakti path) to them."
I said, "Where is this word, where is it in the
Scripture?"

01:11:23.136 --> 01:11:28.918
Shakti Path is not a word at all. What word
is this,‘Shakti path’? What a dirty word,
Shakti Path. How is it possible?

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:32.908
Means to show one’s importance -
that we pass power to them.

01:11:32.985 --> 01:11:37.265
I said it has no Scriptural basis.
This is all your apocalypse.

01:11:37.265 --> 01:11:41.988
And those who came to us, had High Blood Pressure,
paralysis, various diseases of the world.

01:11:41.988 --> 01:11:46.597
I said, "If your guru, can’t even fix your health
then why do you bother about him?

01:11:47.299 --> 01:11:53.679
And that, one person had cancer in his lung.
I asked him, "How did you get lung cancer?"

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:58.411
He said that, “Our Guru, who was a great devoted person,
He didn't eat from anyone's hand,

01:11:58.411 --> 01:12:05.705
and to us, he lived on the fifth floor and
we people brought food with wet clothes to him
on his floor

01:12:05.705 --> 01:12:10.028
and used to give him. In that first I had pneumonia.
I thought, well,

01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:14.761
such a sacrifice should definitely be made for my guru.
After that, now cancer has also happened."
I said, "This too, are you sacrificing?"

01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:21.852
Think that the Guru, who makes you sacrifice,
is wrong. Sacrifice is not of anything external,
it doesn't happen outside.

01:12:21.852 --> 01:12:26.075
That it’s seen, dressed in saffron clothes,
‘I’ve sacrificed this, I’ve sacrificed that.’

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:30.445
What are you sacrificing? - stones.
Sacrifice is an internal thing.

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:36.580
The man who is free from inside, has no attachment
to anything. To be attached is a difficult thing
for such a man.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:44.765
He finds it very difficult to take anything from anyone.
I can see only one reason for these things.

01:12:44.765 --> 01:12:48.107
You can give these things to someone,
fill your love in it.

01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:54.979
A small thing, like Shabri fed berries to Ram.
Everything in the world is just like
the berries of Shabri.

01:12:54.979 --> 01:13:01.151
If they’re given to someone in the love of a Mother,
then I’m very happy. Things get reversed, don't they?

01:13:01.151 --> 01:13:05.847
So until this thing comes in us, till then
we should not believe that we have found anything.

01:13:05.847 --> 01:13:09.723
But there are many such people who say
that their Kundalini has been awakened.

01:13:09.723 --> 01:13:16.002
There are many such people as well. Some say,
"There is a lot of uneasiness in this and
such and such trouble happens."

01:13:16.002 --> 01:13:21.620
Those who have no right to it, who are not
pure, who look at it with dirty eyes,

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.991
and those who don’t know anything about it,
if they attack the Kundalini,

01:13:24.991 --> 01:13:31.833
so this is the hand of Shri Ganesha, which hits hard -
what we call the problems of the
Sympathetic Nervous System, they arise.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:36.443
And in this way many kinds of abnormalities in man
- yelling, screaming, various other things of the world.

01:13:36.443 --> 01:13:43.110
A gentleman came, he sat with both
his feet towards Me, so people said,

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:47.365
"Don't sit with your feet like this towards Mother.
You know, you are an Indian, sit comfortably."

01:13:47.365 --> 01:13:50.373
So he said, "No, I can’t sit, my Kundalini has been awakened.

01:13:50.373 --> 01:13:55.834
If I sit like this, crossing my legs, then
I start jumping like a frog."

01:13:55.834 --> 01:14:00.591
So I called him, "Come here. Are you going to be
a frog? What is going to happen to you now?"

01:14:00.591 --> 01:14:06.062
You have to become a Super human being. The one,
who has to become a super human being,
how will he jump like a frog?

01:14:06.062 --> 01:14:14.537
Similarly you’ll also find many such texts or
treatise, in which various contradictory
useless things have been written.

01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:20.554
But everything that is written is not a scripture,
should not be accepted. What some people say,
it is not a Divine statement.

01:14:20.554 --> 01:14:26.761
First of all, until you have the Spirit
awakened within you, whatever you know,

01:14:26.761 --> 01:14:33.021
whatever you have found or achieved, you have
found nothing because everything is false.
Everything is false without attaining the Spirit.

01:14:33.021 --> 01:14:36.875
First achieve the Brahman(Spirit), then you will
get to know the reality what is this thing?

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:40.976
Now we say that it is Kamakhya Devi's
temple, such and such temple, so what?

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:44.732
There’s nothing in these temples because there
all the evil spirits are sitting and earning money.

01:14:44.732 --> 01:14:49.045
So it is important to see, that someone said,
"What is this temple of Kamakhya Devi,
it’s good for nothing.”

01:14:49.045 --> 01:14:53.513
But this is not the point. A Self-realized man
will see and say, "Yes, it is Self-manifested."

01:14:53.513 --> 01:14:59.302
They are self-manifested, born from the earth itelf.
Now whether these things are true, or false,
or how are they, how would you know?

01:14:59.302 --> 01:15:04.022
You shouldn’t believe what I say?
You yourself should take it’s experience,

01:15:04.022 --> 01:15:08.378
you yourself should get those vibrations and you
go and see for yourself what is this thing?

01:15:09.237 --> 01:15:13.977
You become so much aware, so much awareness
comes, that you immediately understand,

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:19.385
where you are and where is the other
and what is his state?

01:15:19.385 --> 01:15:22.694
Secondly, the Lakshmi principle is awakened in it.

01:15:22.694 --> 01:15:27.947
Especially when Lakshmi is awakened in us
then man receives his welfare.

01:15:27.947 --> 01:15:33.534
In London you know how much there is unemployment,
there is too much unemployment,

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:39.479
but our Sahaja Yogis – approximately there are about
three to four thousand Sahaja Yogis -
not even one of them is unemployed.

01:15:39.479 --> 01:15:48.436
Everyone has livelihood, no one is unemployed and
there is a rule in Sahaja Yoga, that whosoever comes,
will try to get a job and they do get a job.

01:15:48.436 --> 01:15:51.401
The Divine helps us in so many different ways.

01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:57.632
The reason for that is, what we call reason
and the consequence, you go beyond cause and effect.

01:15:57.795 --> 01:16:06.615
The Kundalini that is, is beyond that. You go into
that Kingdom of the Divine which is beyond cause and
effect.

01:16:06.615 --> 01:16:12.724
We keep struggling because of the cause or it’s consequence
Like now there is poverty, because of poverty it is bad.

01:16:12.724 --> 01:16:17.136
So the only way to rise beyond poverty is
Kundalini awakening - it's the Truth.

01:16:17.284 --> 01:16:22.991
As long as these tantrikas remain here in this Bengal,
the kingdom of Lakshmi can never come here.

01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:30.111
You do not know that if a Tantrika comes from one door
Lakshmiji leaves through the other. This Bengal is
so full of Tantrikas, how will it be here.

01:16:30.111 --> 01:16:36.323
I saw the same condition in Kerala, that in Kerala
people bury the dead at home and so much black
magic they do there.

01:16:36.323 --> 01:16:44.688
Wherever there will be black magic - you may go to
any corner of the country wherever there is black magic -
there cannot be the kingdom of Lakshmiji.

01:16:44.688 --> 01:16:51.348
That's why we, you know, turn on the lights
everywhere on the day of Diwali, so that
Laxmiji should stay inside.

01:16:51.348 --> 01:16:56.729
She doesn’t like at all that we go to such people,
but here the emphasis is so much on this

01:16:56.729 --> 01:17:04.130
and there are so many wrong gurus that I was very
afraid of coming here. You know I’ve started
Sahaja Yoga in India around fourteen years back

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:11.796
but the reason for coming here after so many days
was this, that I thought I should get place
to set foot here, then I’ll definitely come.

01:17:11.796 --> 01:17:21.616
I hope you people will look towards this, because
you are the clean, pure, eternal, imperishable Spirit.

01:17:21.617 --> 01:17:28.547
Attaining the Spirit, is your own birthright.
I am not doing anything for it.

01:17:28.547 --> 01:17:35.030
It is with you, fully prepared, you just have to
achieve it. But at that time your brains
should be kept open.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:39.611
If you are a scientist, then a scientist wants
to keep an open mind.

01:17:39.611 --> 01:17:45.970
Keeping that mind open you should think
whether what Mother is saying is true or not.

01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:50.248
What we call as the hypothesis or dharana,
in that way you listen to me.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:56.102
After that you should believe only when it is proved
to be correct. But from the very beginning if you start
saying 'no, no' then how will anything enter within?

01:17:56.102 --> 01:17:58.367
Although it has nothing to do with intelligence.

01:17:58.367 --> 01:18:02.177
I have also seen such people who
did a lot of opposition to Sahaja Yoga.

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:09.816
Our own Doctor Warren himself faced a lot of trouble
in the beginning but see today, where he has reached,
from where to where he has reached.

01:18:09.816 --> 01:18:15.408
Because this is experience. Even if you say to
the experience, "Yes, so what, what does it matter
if I get cool breeze in my hands?"

01:18:15.742 --> 01:18:22.742
The only biggest drawback of Sahaja Yoga is
that it is open to everyone. Every kind of
person comes into it.

01:18:22.742 --> 01:18:27.335
The doors are open to all for this. It’s possible
that even one or two wrong people may come into it.

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:30.873
One or two hypocrites may also come, one or two
dupes could also come.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:37.515
But when you are awakened and are in that state,
you will know immediately how is this man,
how are his vibrations.

01:18:37.515 --> 01:18:42.914
But this is not possible until there is
an upliftment within you, evolution doesn't
take place, you remain incomplete,

01:18:42.914 --> 01:18:49.596
you remained in the condition of a human being.
The reason you were made a human being, you didn’t
achieve it - that is to attain the Spirit.

01:18:49.596 --> 01:18:56.526
And then it should be said that this is our
heritage, it is our heritage. This is the
heritage of our India.

01:18:56.526 --> 01:19:02.720
No one has this. Whatever great development
you have seen in foreign countries and it

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.431
it is just as if a tree has grown big without
any roots and one day topples down,

01:19:07.431 --> 01:19:14.356
and everyone's brains are not right just now
and they are somehow headed for their destruction
straight away,

01:19:14.356 --> 01:19:19.919
because you haven't found your roots and the roots are
is in the country and we are falling at their feet,
then what will happen?

01:19:19.919 --> 01:19:22.224
When the roots are in this country,
you must get to(find) them.

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:28.948
There I have to start with the 'G' of Ganapati,
one has to start with righteousness. My hands break
getting people realized there.
