00:45:35.901 --> 00:45:40.701
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi
language

00:45:40.726 --> 00:45:47.201
because I had to tell them something
which I don't want you to know.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:01.884
Today is a great day, I should say
in a way,

00:46:02.368 --> 00:46:09.277
because I am going to tell you
one thing great.

00:46:09.302 --> 00:46:17.015
That is Shri Gyaneshwara - in Marathi
they call it 'Dnyaneshwara' -

00:46:18.384 --> 00:46:25.514
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:40.261
And Saraswati, who was a virgin,
she looked after Him like Her own son.

00:46:40.286 --> 00:46:48.103
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati
but She looked after Him.

00:46:48.128 --> 00:46:52.331
And then also there’s description how
He was born and all those (things),

00:46:52.356 --> 00:46:55.499
is very interesting.

00:46:55.524 --> 00:47:05.783
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra,
He took His incarnation.

00:47:05.808 --> 00:47:11.563
And also there were many great, great,
very great saints

00:47:11.588 --> 00:47:20.936
in so many numbers took place,
took their birth in this Maharashtra.

00:47:22.274 --> 00:47:29.484
But such horrible people, they tortured
their lives.

00:47:29.509 --> 00:47:32.495
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you;

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:36.758
worse than any inquisition anywhere.

00:47:36.783 --> 00:47:40.285
Individually they attacked.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:45.811
And that same people are born again

00:47:47.353 --> 00:47:52.971
in this great country of Maharashtra.

00:47:52.996 --> 00:47:56.476
They are very talented people; they write
very well.

00:47:56.501 --> 00:48:00.846
Their language is so rich.

00:48:00.871 --> 00:48:07.835
You can see that, what description

00:48:09.397 --> 00:48:20.364
of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara,
is so beautiful.

00:48:21.663 --> 00:48:29.187
He says that, "The moon doesn’t run
after moonlight,

00:48:29.212 --> 00:48:34.481
the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

00:48:34.506 --> 00:48:43.164
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother
about his own glory.

00:48:45.987 --> 00:48:52.784
The sun shines till it shines, then it
takes back all his rays.

00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:59.843
Whatever work the rays have to do
they do it. And the sun is just watching,

00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:03.883
watching all the work, then he takes
them back.

00:49:03.908 --> 00:49:11.566
And he gets completely contained within
himself”.

00:49:11.591 --> 00:49:18.217
Samavun ghene, completely contained
within himself.

00:49:18.242 --> 00:49:24.209
The description He has given of realized
souls

00:49:24.234 --> 00:49:30.746
is so beautiful, if you could just
experience it.

00:49:30.771 --> 00:49:35.259
Namadeva, who was born much later,
said that

00:49:35.284 --> 00:49:44.715
even one line of Gyanesha [Gyaneshwara]
if you could experience,

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.309
you had that.

00:49:47.334 --> 00:49:51.458
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava
in English,

00:49:51.483 --> 00:49:57.484
understanding how He describes
a realized soul,

00:49:57.509 --> 00:50:01.638
and you'll find that within yourself
it has happened.

00:50:01.683 --> 00:50:05.255
You are different from others very much.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:15.397
You'll be amazed how you have got
such beautiful description of your Self.

00:50:15.422 --> 00:50:22.473
I was talking about Maharashtrians;
they are extremely talented people.

00:50:22.498 --> 00:50:28.710
See their music. In music no-one can
beat them.

00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:33.894
See their drama. In drama no-one can
beat them.

00:50:34.771 --> 00:50:39.839
You can see from films. In Maharashtra
only

00:50:39.864 --> 00:50:43.634
great films were created.

00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:50.049
The another one is Bengal, which is,

00:50:50.074 --> 00:50:56.420
I would say, different but of the same
level.

00:50:56.445 --> 00:51:00.918
It's such a talented people here,

00:51:00.943 --> 00:51:06.647
it shows that God has a special blessing
for these two,

00:51:06.672 --> 00:51:12.704
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise
very high.

00:51:12.729 --> 00:51:18.022
But all the time complaining about others,
talking ill of others,

00:51:18.047 --> 00:51:21.662
and something very low they do.
I'm surprised that,

00:51:21.697 --> 00:51:28.062
I hope you don't pick up anything from them.

00:51:28.087 --> 00:51:36.665
And also the fussiness that is of the North
Indians;

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:40.529
that's also not a very good thing.

00:51:40.554 --> 00:51:46.593
It's surprising how you people have adjusted
yourself to this country,

00:51:46.618 --> 00:51:51.459
which has all kinds of parasites.

00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:58.936
Because you live with vibrations, you feel
the vibrations.

00:51:58.961 --> 00:52:03.584
It's something so great to see you all here,

00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:10.632
and I'm telling them that they should try
to understand you people.

00:52:10.657 --> 00:52:17.193
Really I’m very proud of you all who have
come all the way here.

00:52:17.218 --> 00:52:27.099
In this puja I am thinking of so many great
saints who were born,

00:52:27.124 --> 00:52:33.848
who were great gurus, mahagurus. Of course
Gyanesha,

00:52:33.873 --> 00:52:44.459
I must say, is the king of all those high,
highly evolved souls, no doubt.

00:52:44.484 --> 00:52:52.428
So we are now having a puja on the twenty
-fourth of December

00:52:52.462 --> 00:52:58.003
because it's a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya's
birth.

00:52:58.028 --> 00:53:01.793
And so we'll be having on the twenty-fourth
night.

00:53:01.818 --> 00:53:07.899
In any case it's a Christmas Eve. We could
all start with that.

00:53:07.924 --> 00:53:14.274
And also Dattatreya, who took His form
in Maharashtra.

00:53:14.299 --> 00:53:18.881
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya.

00:53:18.906 --> 00:53:24.645
They understand the Nath Panthis.
These Nathas went all over.

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:33.650
They went to Kiev. You'll be amazed,
they went even up to Bolivia,

00:53:33.675 --> 00:53:42.068
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri.
Can you imagine?

00:53:42.093 --> 00:53:46.508
Such great people they were,

00:53:46.533 --> 00:53:52.021
and that is what I expect to happen
in this Maharashtra.

00:53:52.046 --> 00:53:59.882
And I'm sure one day I'll be very much
happy with all of them; not few.

00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:03.951
There are some very great Maharashtrians,
no doubt,

00:54:03.977 --> 00:54:10.926
but all of them have to join together
because I talk of synthesis,

00:54:10.951 --> 00:54:14.195
not of divisive method.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:20.494
I hope they understand the inner feeling
that I have,

00:54:20.519 --> 00:54:29.718
otherwise all the good diamonds will be
selected

00:54:29.743 --> 00:54:34.986
and the ones which are defective will be
thrown away.

00:54:36.479 --> 00:54:43.468
What's the use? But all of them are capable
of achieving any height.

00:54:43.493 --> 00:54:47.027
They may belong to any caste, community,
doesn't matter;

00:54:47.052 --> 00:54:51.055
but they are born in Maharashtra,

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:55.415
which is such a great country.

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.610
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi,

00:54:58.635 --> 00:55:02.425
this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi
temple.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:07.494
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi
also, in a way,

00:55:07.519 --> 00:55:13.022
but they lack: one is the wisdom,

00:55:13.047 --> 00:55:18.882
and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

00:55:19.729 --> 00:55:27.563
The spirit of Kartikeya - that

00:55:31.729 --> 00:55:38.396
pure, absolute dynamism

00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:46.750
which doesn't indulge into nonsensical things
and useless things;

00:55:46.775 --> 00:55:52.804
which shows results.
May God bless you all!
