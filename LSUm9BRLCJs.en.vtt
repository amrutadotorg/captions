00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.350
Today we have gathered here

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.390
to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.750
We must understand the significance

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.870
of Shri Krishna's advent

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.630
on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.510
As you know very well, except for once or twice,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.230
Shri Brahmadeva has taken his incarnation.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.990
Also once Shri Ganesha has taken His birth

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.390
as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.070
But Vishnu Tattwa, the principle of Vishnu,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.390
has taken many a times birth on this earth,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.910
as the Goddess had to take many a times Her birth.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.470
They had to work together many a times,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.830
and with the principle of Vishnu,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.430
the principle of Mahalakshmi has acted

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.830
to help the ascent of the people.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.310
So the principle of Vishnu is for your ascent,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910
for the evolutionary process of human beings.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.390
Through this advent

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.550
and through the power of Mahalakshmi,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:12.230
we have become human beings from amoeba stage.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.630
This is a spontaneous working for us

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.950
but for the principle of Vishnu,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.670
He had to go through various incarnations to evolve.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.630
As you know there have been incarnations

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.350
of Shri Vishnu as a fish to begin with

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:52.110
and went on till it came to the state of Shri Krishna,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.510
where they say that He has become complete.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.270
But one has to realize that

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.070
He works on our central nervous system,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.710
He builds our central nervous system.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.110
Through our evolutionary process,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.550
our central nervous system has been built up,

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.950
and this central nervous system has given us

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.670
all the human awareness that we have;

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
otherwise we would have been just like the stones.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.390
But through this building up of our awareness,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.150
one after another,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.070
building up different chakras within us,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.310
this principle of Vishnu has brought us to the understanding

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.030
that we have to seek the truth

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.030
and ultimately we have to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.830
So this principle of Shri Krishna

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.310
is so important that at the state,

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.590
as you call it the Vishuddhi chakra

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.630
we become complete,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.350
in the sense that when the Sahasrara is opened out for you

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.590
and you start feeling the vibrations,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.270
you are not yet fully complete.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.150
If you were just complete then it would have been

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.990
an end of your evolution,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.510
because at that stage, if you had finished it,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.230
then there was no need to have Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.230
But actually it means that once the Sahasrara is opened out,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.790
then you have to come down to your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.590
that means to your collective.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.470
If it is not working on your Vishuddhi chakra,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.990
the enlightenment on Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.910
you cannot feel the vibrations.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.710
As you saw yesterday,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.270
the artists started playing in a very new dimension.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.750
It's not that only they got awakening of the Kundalini.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.070
The awakening of the Kundalini was there, no doubt,

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.910
but it had to come down to their Vishuddhi chakra.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.110
If I could not have brought it back to their Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.710
their hands could not have moved that fast,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.630
they would have never felt the sweetness,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.950
the madhurya of Shri Krishna,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.030
and they would not have manifested it.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.750
So all that is expressed through your fingers and hands

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.070
achieves that new awareness of creating the madhurya,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.870
the sweetness.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.350
In your art, in your music,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.510
in your gestures,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.510
in every way, your hands are very important.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.910
But Vishuddhi chakra also plays part, as you know,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.710
on the sixteen chakras or the sub-plexuses

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.110
which look after our face,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.990
our ears, nose, eyes, neck,

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.870
all these things are looked after by Vishuddhi chakra.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.230
As a result also, you can become great actors,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.190
you can have eyes which are innocent,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.710
you can have a skin which is shining,

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.430
you can have ears which can hear the Divine music,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.630
you can have a nose which shows your dignity.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:49.710
In the same way, your whole facial expression changes.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.070
If you are a very harsh person

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.710
and a hot-tempered person

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.070
and you have harshness on your face,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.150
or else if you are like a beggar all the time,

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.150
or you are crying all the time, weeping,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.230
your face looks so miserable,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.190
everything changes and comes into the center,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:13.150
where you look beautiful, you look attractive,

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.430
in the Divine way, and also you get

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.990
a very sweet countenance.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.830
Also the teeth and the tongue

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.710
are looked after by the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.790
So your teeth which are in trouble get cured.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.750
You sometimes, as I told you

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.230
I have never been to a dentist all my life.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.830
So you can imagine that you don't have to go to the dentist any more

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.150
if you have your Vishuddhi chakra all right.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.390
Then also your tongue improves.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.950
For example some people are very sarcastic by temperament.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.590
They cannot say something sweetly,

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.270
all the time they are sarcastic, saying sarcastic things.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.430
Some people have a habit of abusive language.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:12.710
Some people are extremely beggarish type,

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.470
all the time talking in a very beggarish manner.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.470
There's no dignity, there's no sweetness

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.750
and there is no self-confidence for some people.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.750
Some people even stammer,

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.150
some people cannot stand on the stage and give a lecture.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.990
All these things drop out

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.110
as soon as your Vishuddhi chakra improves.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.550
This is only outward, this is the outward manifestation

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.630
of the Vishuddhi chakra's improvement within yourself,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.910
through the awakening of Shri Krishna on Vishuddhi chakra.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:52.910
But what happens really is that, inside you, you become a witness.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.110
You become a witness in the sense that all that is disturbing,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.470
all that is troubling you, all that is a problem,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.910
you just start watching it,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.070
you start witnessing it, you start seeing it,

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.870
and you do not get disturbed.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.470
That seeing, that witnessing state

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.990
has a tremendous power.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.950
Whatever you see without thinking,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.190
your problems get solved.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.870
Any problem you have, once you get this witness state

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.710
- what you call 'tatasth'-

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.230
means you are standing on the shores

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.070
and so watching the waves to move -

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.870
then you know how to solve the problems.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.830
So your witness state has to be developed

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.550
and sometimes I have seen,

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.070
people have to go through little difficulties

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.550
to develop that witness state.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.390
This is very important that once the Kundalini starts

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.710
supplying you from your Sahasrara downward,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.630
moving on your chakras

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.350
and enriching your different chakras,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.150
on the Vishuddhi chakra

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:10.430
when it has to stay, it really tries to

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.590
little bit take you through turmoils

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.270
and you start thinking that, "See now, my life was so blissful.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.830
I had so many blessings and now what has happened?"

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.870
But this is the time when you should become tatastha,

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.910
means you should become a witness.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.150
If you become a witness everything improves.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:38.190
For example you are say a person who is working in some place.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.670
As soon as you become a witness, you see,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.910
your attention goes inside

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.710
and you start watching things from inside out.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.470
As a result you see exactly what's wrong, where,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.190
and as you have got the power of witnessing,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.790
with that power you get over the problems that you have.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.670
Problems get solved very easily

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:05.870
if you know how to witness the whole situation

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.910
than to get involved into it.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.710
And this is the best state which you call as Sakshiswarupatva,

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.350
which you achieve when the Kundalini comes up

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.830
and the connection is established

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.790
and the Divine ray starts flowing through that

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.990
and enriches your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.910
Now the name of Shri Krishna has come from the word 'krishi'

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.710
meaning 'the ploughing',

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:44.350
'ploughing' of the soil

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.230
for planting the crops.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.710
Now He is the one who has done the ploughing for us,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.750
in the sense that He has created us in such a manner

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.950
that when the sprouting has to be done

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.710
you are already ready for it.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.870
But as it is we human beings spoil our Vishuddhi chakra

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.830
by many wrong things, as you have seen that

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.070
we smoke or we take drugs,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.630
or we take tobaccos and all that.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.990
So our Vishuddhi chakra goes out.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.790
On top of that, if you are a person who doesn't talk at all

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:34.070
or who talks too much or who shouts and screams

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.910
and who shows temper, raises his voices,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.510
also spoils his Vishuddhi chakra.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.430
So the first thing is that in your

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.310
using the Vishuddhi chakra, you have to remember

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.950
it is to be used for sweetness, for madhurya.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.310
If you want to say something to someone,

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.430
try to say something that is sweet and nice,

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.150
practice it.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.710
In certain places I have seen

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.430
that people are used to a kind of a talk

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.590
and sometimes they cannot talk in the fashion that is sweet.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.630
For them it is adharma as if to talk sweetly to someone.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.750
They only believe that you must really talk in a manner

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.630
that will hurt others.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.670
So hurting anybody is not in the dharma of Shri Krishna.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.830
He either killed somebody

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.070
or He was sweet, there's nothing in between.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.790
Either you have to be sweet to people

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.950
or you have to kill someone.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.630
Now killing part you leave it.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.870
So you have to be only sweet.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.190
You all have to be sweet to each other,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.870
specially among Sahaja Yogis

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.550
you have to be extremely sweet to each other.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.710
And dealing with others also sweetly you have to tell

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.230
them if you find anything wrong with them that,

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.710
"See, this is not good. You are now come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.910
Now you must behave like this or behave like that."

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:07.230
Now Shri Krishna's life has another very

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.830
significant role to play,

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.430
that is He came on this earth after Shri Rama's advent,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.310
who was also Shri Vishnu.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:21.110
When Shri Rama came the people were very ignorant,

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.070
they had no idea about dharma.

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.270
So as a king He wanted to teach them dharma

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.870
and so He had to become very serious.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.990
So His incarnation was something

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.990
of a very serious father who is

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.870
very seriously undergoing all kinds of turmoils and things

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.630
and to create an image of a benevolent king.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.630
As a result when He, His incarnation was over,

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.430
people became very serious-minded

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.310
and all the seriousness started in the religion,

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.030
all the ritualism started;

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.630
people became extremely rigid

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.790
and that rigidity killed all the joy of life

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.790
and then all kinds of other things also

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.150
started with that rigidity, is the beginning of Brahmanism.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.830
Brahmanism started in India when people started

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.950
using Brahmanism as a birthright

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.630
while it is not a birthright of anyone

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.150
to be a Brahmin but you have to become a Brahmin.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.750
After Realization you become a Brahmin,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.990
this fact is established not only

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.230
in Shri Krishna's time, but also in Shri Rama's time

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.230
because Shri Rama Himself was not a Brahmin.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:47.630
He made a person to write His Ramayana,

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.670
who was Valmiki, who was a shidul caste

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:52.750
and was a fisherman.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.550
Very surprising, He asked this fisherman

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.870
to write His Ramayana when he was not a Brahmin,

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.630
and He made him a Brahmin

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:05.950
in the sense as you have become Brahmins means knowing the Brahma.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.190
Those who know the Brahma are the Brahmins

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.390
and not those who are born in the Brahmin caste are Brahmins.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.390
And that is why people sometimes get very upset

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:21.110
that how can these be Brahmins if they are so perverse

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.470
and they can commit all kinds of sins.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.110
So by following any such religion or any such rigid ideas

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.470
you cannot improve.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.590
If you call yourself a Christian

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.750
then one thing has to be seen in a Christian

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.190
that you cannot have adulterous eyes.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.270
Now I would like to know how many Christians can claim that.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.990
If they have no adulterous eyes about, say, women,

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.910
they'll have adulterous eyes about things.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.870
So you cannot say that, by becoming Christians,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.510
we have become really Christians;

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.910
in the same way we can say about Hindus.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.430
In the Hindu religion, Krishna has said

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.710
that the Atma resides in everyone.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:11.990
He never said that the birth determines your jati, your caste.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.350
But among Hindus we believe

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.270
that everybody has a jati

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.174
and that everybody is a separate thing;

00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:22.230
some people are to be treated as low, some as high.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.030
This is just the opposite what Shri Krishna has preached,

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.270
because He said in everybody there is Atma.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.030
And now in Sahaja Yoga we have proved

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.280
that whatever religion you may follow,

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.000
whatever things you follow, ideas or philosophy,

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.480
whatever you may follow, you all can become realized souls;

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.960
so nobody is higher, nobody is lower.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.424
Is the best thing is to believe

00:17:44.624 --> 00:17:47.280
that all others are wrong and we are correct.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.680
But all of those people who believe like this

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.400
may have to go to hell directly,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.400
because they have not reached the truth.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.600
The truth is you have to become a realized soul,

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.760
and if you are not a realized soul

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.760
you are nowhere near God.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.480
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.560
Christ himself has said that,

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.560
"You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.920
You are to be born again.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.000
And when you'll be calling Me 'Christ, Christ',

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.400
I won't recognize you."

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.360
Openly He has said it, He has warned you.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.000
Same about Mohamed Sahib Himself has said

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.400
"When the time of Qayama, the resurrection, will come,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.320
your hands will speak".

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.320
And He has also said very clearly,

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.890
"Till the Qayama you do all these things,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.890
like, you see, (rosaiya ?) and all that.

00:18:35.097 --> 00:18:38.336
But when the Qayama comes, when you get your resurrection

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:42.010
then you don't have to do it." Clearly He said it.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.810
But nobody is trying to find out the Qayama,

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.290
only they're trying to find faults with this or that

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.290
and fight with each other.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.170
Now this Resurrection time He has already mentioned,

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.070
"When your hands will speak", is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.030
So after this you don't have to do anything.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.270
Now you have become a Pir according to Him.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.910
Once you have become a wali

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.510
you don't have to do all these things and you become dharmatit.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:09.030
Is said also in Indian philosophy by Shri Krishna that,

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.430
"You become dharmatit, you go beyond religion",

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.390
means religion becomes part and parcel of you.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.710
You don't have to have outside religions

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.310
which are of no use. Is clearly said.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.180
 And Shri Krishna has said it as clearly as anybody could say it,

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.100
very, very clearly, that you have to go beyond your gunas,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.620
beyond your dharmas,

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.260
that means you have to become a person who is religious

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.325
innately

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.490
and not to become a person

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:51.130
who is just outwardly something like Christian, Hindu, Muslim. No.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.060
Inside, inside you have to become.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.380
Now as a result of that you have seen what Shri Krishna has said

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.940
that, "Once you become from inside then I don't have to tell you,

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.460
'Don't drink, don't do this, don't do that, nothing'."

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.620
You just don't do it.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.660
You just don't do it and you understand it so well

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.340
that this should not be done, that should not be done.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.210
To overcome all kinds of nonsense of religion

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.126
Shri Krishna's advent was there.

00:20:31.326 --> 00:20:33.446
Is a very important advent but I don't know

00:20:33.646 --> 00:20:36.000
how many people understand that.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.520
He came to show that it's all Leela,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.520
is all the play of God.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.520
What is there to be serious?

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.750
What is there to be ritualistic?

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.430
You cannot bind God in any rituals.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.030
That's why He came on this Earth, to tell you

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.430
that you should not try to bind yourself by rituals

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.350
which are nonsensical.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.750
This was His teaching so many years back.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.550
He taught this six thousand years back but still,

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.630
if you see in every religion there are so many rituals going on.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.550
So when the incarnations died, people started rituals,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.830
funny stuff. Even when Shri Krishna died,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.150
they didn't know what to do. Now because He said,

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.230
"No more rituals, just play Holi, be happy, joyous,

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.310
dance and sing", that's what He said,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.470
now what to do now if He has said so?

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.060
So they started a new thing,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.180
"Let us make it a romantic stuff."

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.000
Human beings know how to make everything perverse;

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.280
nobody can beat them in this.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.120
So they made Him look like a very romantic personality,

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.840
romancing with Radha.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.430
Radha, 'Ra' is energy, 'Dha' is the one who has sustained energy.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:54.450
So show romances with Her when She was Mahalakshmi Herself,

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.650
to show His relationship with Mahalakshmi

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.530
as if They were Husband and Wife.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.530
So there were also some poets who started describing them

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.710
as husband and wife, and all kinds of nonsense.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.350
In Divine relationship there is nothing like husband and wife;

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.770
is the power which is potential, and power that is kinetic.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.490
There is no such relationship that exists

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:18.530
as human beings try to make it,

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.720
because human beings have a habit

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.920
to bring all the Divine Incarnations to their own levels.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.880
As you have seen that, if you see,

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.600
the best are the Greeks,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.390
who brought all the great Incarnations to their own levels.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.630
In the same way they could not do much with Shri Krishna

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.550
so they said, "All right, make him a romantic personality

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.040
that will suit us."

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.080
So it suited many horrible people.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:49.880
We had one Nawab in Lucknow who had 365 wives

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.140
and he used to dress up like Shri Krishna,

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.380
sometimes like Radha, and dance

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.760
and he said, "Now I have become Shri Krishna."

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.920
So, so many, you know, gurus came as Shri Krishna playing flute,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.960
becoming, calling everybody else as their gopis

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.960
and this and that. All nonsense.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.960
And we have so many groups now working like that,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.520
Brahma Kumaris and all that.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.560
When there is one Krishna, the rest are all gopis and gopas

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.630
and they don't marry and all kinds of nonsense.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.030
This is absolutely absurd and perverse

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:25.990
and brings bad name to Shri Krishna.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.990
Shri Krishna was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:35.190
He was so detached that once His wives,

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.630
who were His powers, and they said that,

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.560
"We want to go across and worship a particular saint."

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.120
He said, "All right, why don't you go?" They said," No,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.460
the river is in spate and we don't know how to cross the river."

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.580
He said, "All right, you go and tell the river that

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.860
we want to go and see such and such saint

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.610
and Shri Krishna has said that you come down.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.330
If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:05.410
and if He has had no wife then you go down."

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:09.570
So they went to the river and said that

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.450
"If Shri Krishna has had no wives

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.690
and He is a Yogeshwara then please go down".

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.628
The river went down. They were surprised,

00:24:18.828 --> 00:24:20.710
that He is supposed to be our husband

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.110
and still He is Yogeshwara. He is so detached.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.350
They crossed over and they went and worshipped the saint.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.250
So the saint said, "Now you can go back."

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.610
When they were coming back, they found again the river was in spate.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.850
So they went back to the saint and they said,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.770
"Now how do we go back?"

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.290
He said, "How did you come?"

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.010
They said, "Shri Krishna said that, 'You go and ask the river

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.180
if I was a Yogeshwara, then you go down'."

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.700
"All right, so you go and ask the river

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.540
that the saint did not eat anything whatsoever

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.940
and he was absolutely detached about it,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.420
so the river will go down."

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.380
So they were surprised because they had fed him,

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.920
he had ate everything, he had done everything.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.320
So they went to the river and said, "Oh river,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.560
the saint never ate anything,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.640
he was absolutely detached about food,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.670
he did not touch the food," And the river went down.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.950
So they were surprised, how is it that the saint ate everything

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:15.630
and did not eat anything?

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.500
Means he was in aswadha, he was not

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.860
involved into the food, he was detached

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.860
and they were surprised. Looks like,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:32.550
It looks like a lie from a, see, human point of view, it is not.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.430
It is not, that's a fact.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.470
He is a Yogeshwara and He is so detached.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.470
So people don't understand Divinity and they think that

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.570
how can it be a person who has 16,000 wives

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.370
and five other wives can be a person who is not yet married?

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.320
Because He was Yogeshwara.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.040
And that is what you all have to be, Yogeshwara.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.400
You are married, you have got children.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.000
I'm happy you are married because that's an auspicious thing to do,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.160
to marry to begin with.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.680
But you should not get involved with your family,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.140
"My child, my family."

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.820
Many people I have seen, they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.880
get married and get lost;

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.800
because to them, "Married now, I'm enjoying my family now,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.340
looking after my family."

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.580
Our family is the whole universe,

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.860
it is not just my own wife and my children

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.040
but the whole Universe is our family.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.520
And this is what Shri Krishna tried to show in His life

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.480
that the whole Universe is your family.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.630
You are a universal being.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.270
This is what He preached throughout,

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.530
that you are a universal being

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:49.260
and you have to be a part and parcel of the whole.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.980
You are the part and parcel of the whole,

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.740
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.260
and this is not a lecture but has to happen within yourself

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.860
that you have to develop your collective consciousness.

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.920
And this is the gift of Shri Krishna,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.120
because at the brain He becomes the Virata.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.860
So now we have three identities within ourselves.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.660
On the heart is Shiva,

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.740
in the brain is Shri Krishna, the Virata,

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.980
and in the liver, Brahmadeva.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.220
So we have three identities

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.500
and in the stomach, in the Void as you say,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.620
are all the Guru Tattwa where all the great Gurus

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.280
from Adi Nath, Mohamed Sahib

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.180
and others up to, we can say, Shirdi Sai Nath;

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:48.580
all of them are the Guru principle which we worshipped last time

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:55.113
when we were in Andorra.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.380
So how they are all related with each other,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.740
how they have worked out together

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:07.470
and brought you to the state of this witness is very important.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.840
Now your Vishuddhi chakra has to be improved.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.680
First of all, this feeling guilty business

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.200
was so much yesterday that, I tell you,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.380
it was impossible to pull it out.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.580
There's nothing to feel guilty, it's a fashion,

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.620
just a fashion, "I'm sorry" morning till evening "I'm sorry,

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.920
I'm sorry," What are you sorry for, for being a human being

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.840
or for a Sahaja Yogi?

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.420
So one has to be very pleasant towards oneself also.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.180
All the time, "I'm sorry, I should not have done this,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.980
I should not have done that", all the time feeling sorry

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.280
and feeling guilty spoils your left Vishuddhi.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.160
As your left Vishuddhi is spoilt

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.920
what happens is that your Shri Krishna Tattwa is gone.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.070
Then you cannot feel the collective,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.150
then you cannot understand what has gone wrong with you.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.790
So just if you have to say sorry also, say sorry to God

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.190
and after that don't say sorry anymore.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.190
You face it.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.390
Whatever you have done wrong, all right face it!

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.030
This was wrong, all right it will not be done.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.590
Do not argue with it, do not continue with it,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.350
just face it and say, "This was wrong, and this wrong

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.590
I will not do again." And it's finished.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.180
For you are after all saints now.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.420
You have become now walis, you have become now realized souls,

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.520
you have become now atmajas.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.240
You have got Brahmachaitanya,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.600
you have seen on your heads there was light,

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.320
you have seen the proof of it.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.440
So I don't have to give you a second certificate.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.600
Only thing, you better understand and be aware

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.080
of your own position. As Shri Krishna has said,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.120
"You have to be aware of your Self."

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.000
First to get self-realization

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.620
and then to be aware of your position.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.740
Then you'll be surprised how you develop proper

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:06.610
attention, and proper understanding.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:09.330
  Absolutely it is a easy thing to do

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:17.570
as soon as you find that you have achieved that witness state.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:25.040
So please try to make yourself a witness.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.510
When you see something, go into thoughtless awareness

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.350
that is your fort. Don't think.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.750
See the beauty that is there, just pouring in.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:36.750
Just watch

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:41.030
how these trees are standing still just watching you all.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.030
See absolutely still, nothing is moving,

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.240
they don't allow even one leaf to move.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.880
Let it be till the breeze starts.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.400
Mother starts the breeze.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.600
Till we'll just keep quiet and watch.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.680
Like these mountains how they are steadily watching everything

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.840
and emitting joy and beauty.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.840
In the same way, we have to become a witness.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.590
We need not talk too much, we need not keep quiet

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.430
but in the center we should witness

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.750
the whole thing as Leela.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.380
That's why He is called as Leeladhara,

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.980
means the one who sustains the Leela of a person.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.860
It doesn't make you mad, it doesn't make you funny,

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.420
but it makes you joyous.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.620
Anything that makes you joyous

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.840
is the Vishnu principle of Shri Krishna.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.660
I hope all of us are going to enjoy

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.140
our Vishnu principle hereafter

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.820
as we have enjoyed before by meditating.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.540
Because when we meditate we go into thoughtless awareness.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.810
When we are in thoughtless awareness,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.930
then only we grow, otherwise we cannot grow.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.130
Whatever we may try we cannot grow.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.230
Unless and until we meditate

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.950
we cannot become thoughtlessly aware.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.670
All those who also want to gain in any walk of life,

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.400
in any dimension, those who want to become say,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.660
great artists, great scientists, great anything,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.780
in Sahaja Yoga is important you must meditate,

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.660
otherwise the Kundalini will come down

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.540
and you lose all your talents.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.320
That's a fact, which has to be told,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.120
and you have seen how people got transformed.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.840
But sometimes it can be very temporary

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.390
and it may go down

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.310
if people do not take to it in the proper way.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.630
I wish you all very great luck for your witness state.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:36.990
In the witness state,

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:43.500
we do not anyway express ourselves in a funny manner

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.820
but just in looking at ourselves.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.600
Because only we have created all the problems

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.092
and it is we only, detaching ourselves from ourselves,

00:32:57.292 --> 00:33:00.660
can see these problems and can solve them.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.830
By God's Grace, as I know, you all are going to grow very much,

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.430
and this state is to be achieved.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:12.324
In every state whether it is a blessing,

00:33:12.524 --> 00:33:15.710
whether it is a progress or whether it is just turmoil,

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.430
you have to be seaworthy.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.018
Any ship which is a seaworthy is the one

00:33:20.218 --> 00:33:25.070
which can face all kinds of beautiful voyages

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.670
or even turmoil and even the tempest.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.908
May God bless you.
