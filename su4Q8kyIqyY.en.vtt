00:09:54.279 --> 00:10:00.639
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:04.609
He's created this whole thing.

00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:08.569
The whole atmosphere is there.

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:13.168
The whole feeling is there of love.

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:20.789
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:26.959
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:31.788
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:37.349
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

00:10:37.349 --> 00:10:45.159
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

00:10:45.159 --> 00:10:51.878
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

00:10:51.878 --> 00:11:00.549
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:04.229
of violence since long.

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:14.899
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

00:11:14.899 --> 00:11:15.999
take place.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:17.899
There has to be complete peace.

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:26.249
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

00:11:26.249 --> 00:11:29.119
beautiful nation.

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:44.419
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:52.219
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:55.189
He gives peace.

00:11:55.189 --> 00:12:01.588
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:04.609
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:04.609 --> 00:12:07.759
You all have got your Realization.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:15.829
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:22.949
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:25.458
You will create peace.

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:35.139
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:45.639
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:49.898
peace to others and become examples of it.

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:59.469
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:01.829
I never expected.

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:15.469
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

00:13:15.469 --> 00:13:24.609
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:25.609
I have faced all that.

00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:33.708
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:47.279
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:50.249
this depth you have to develop.

00:13:50.249 --> 00:14:00.898
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:11.189
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:14.749
for you to do anything extra.

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:20.529
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:22.519
Just feel it.

00:14:22.519 --> 00:14:25.489
You are a peaceful person.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:31.749
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:37.272
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

00:14:37.272 --> 00:14:38.272
You will not do that.

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:49.039
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:58.789
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:00.739
to them, they won't like it.

00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:05.298
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

00:15:05.298 --> 00:15:09.138
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:09.138 --> 00:15:18.548
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

00:15:18.548 --> 00:15:27.548
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:37.548
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

00:15:37.548 --> 00:15:42.219
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

00:15:42.219 --> 00:15:50.918
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:51.918
things.

00:15:51.918 --> 00:16:03.448
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:04.448
point.

00:16:04.448 --> 00:16:10.559
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:12.469
He was born.

00:16:12.469 --> 00:16:15.948
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

00:16:15.948 --> 00:16:26.039
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:31.589
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

00:16:31.589 --> 00:16:35.939
It's very difficult to talk to them.

00:16:35.939 --> 00:16:44.168
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:45.459
Who was Babar?

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:52.138
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

00:16:52.138 --> 00:16:55.128
No, it was not.

00:16:55.128 --> 00:17:03.228
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

00:17:03.228 --> 00:17:05.129
call it a Babri Masjid.

00:17:05.129 --> 00:17:12.948
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

00:17:12.948 --> 00:17:18.918
He died, but he came from abroad.

00:17:18.918 --> 00:17:22.179
He was not even an Indian.

00:17:22.179 --> 00:17:24.839
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:32.529
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:40.828
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

00:17:40.828 --> 00:17:43.138
Rama was born.

00:17:43.138 --> 00:17:50.529
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:53.858
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

00:17:53.858 --> 00:18:01.519
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:08.819
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:15.658
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

00:18:15.658 --> 00:18:28.599
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:30.888
Kashmir.

00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:34.459
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

00:18:34.459 --> 00:18:37.239
How do you know?

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:41.759
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:48.699
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

00:18:48.699 --> 00:18:53.639
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:18:53.639 --> 00:18:57.670
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:58.670
He said, "Why?"

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.670
"Because I want to go."

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:06.438
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:08.409
"It doesn't matter.

00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:09.729
Take it."

00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:20.269
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:23.439
them, "What is here going on?"

00:19:23.439 --> 00:19:29.259
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

00:19:29.259 --> 00:19:33.799
Even the name gives you such peace.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:37.229
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

00:19:37.229 --> 00:19:44.469
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

00:19:44.469 --> 00:19:47.649
It's very surprising.

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:55.229
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

00:19:55.229 --> 00:20:01.099
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.149
For example, they say, "Allah."

00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:04.868
Who is Allah?

00:20:04.868 --> 00:20:16.199
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

00:20:16.199 --> 00:20:18.558
Ram.

00:20:18.558 --> 00:20:25.649
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

00:20:25.649 --> 00:20:28.469
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

00:20:28.469 --> 00:20:33.909
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:46.019
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

00:20:46.019 --> 00:20:53.529
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

00:20:53.529 --> 00:20:57.329
Hindus are also not understanding.

00:20:57.329 --> 00:21:03.149
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:06.738
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

00:21:06.738 --> 00:21:09.529
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:19.969
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

00:21:19.969 --> 00:21:21.349
They never have vibrations.

00:21:21.349 --> 00:21:26.719
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.119
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:32.029
But they have no point to prove.

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:39.949
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

00:21:39.949 --> 00:21:47.168
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

00:21:47.168 --> 00:21:53.048
But they are all - what should I say?

00:21:53.048 --> 00:21:56.379
- Absolutely blocked people.

00:21:56.379 --> 00:22:00.569
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:08.579
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

00:22:08.579 --> 00:22:16.069
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:24.459
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:26.118
got Self Realization.

00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:29.149
You are all Realized Souls.

00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:39.009
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

00:22:39.009 --> 00:22:46.259
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

00:22:46.259 --> 00:22:52.358
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

00:22:52.358 --> 00:22:59.428
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

00:22:59.428 --> 00:23:01.639
find this is the problem.

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:08.178
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:18.049
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:20.569
very great people.

00:23:20.569 --> 00:23:25.988
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:32.029
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:37.428
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

00:23:37.428 --> 00:23:38.969
They're much beyond you."

00:23:38.969 --> 00:23:51.808
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

00:23:51.808 --> 00:23:54.769
It was a very big gap before.

00:23:54.769 --> 00:24:02.019
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:03.498
kinds of things.

00:24:03.498 --> 00:24:06.779
Now you are so many.

00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:15.140
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.140
you.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140
I would request you only one thing.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:26.798
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:29.368
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

00:24:29.368 --> 00:24:33.139
This is a common thing.

00:24:33.139 --> 00:24:37.819
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

00:24:37.819 --> 00:24:38.819
He got exposed."

00:24:38.819 --> 00:24:41.079
"Means, what happened?"

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:43.259
"He was exposed, Mother.

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:45.978
He was put in jail."

00:24:45.978 --> 00:24:48.709
"Aiy, this is too much.

00:24:48.709 --> 00:24:52.188
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

00:24:52.188 --> 00:24:53.498
So this is the problem.

00:24:53.498 --> 00:24:58.129
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:01.829
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

00:25:01.829 --> 00:25:04.748
Must try to purify yourself.

00:25:04.748 --> 00:25:05.748
You have to change.

00:25:05.748 --> 00:25:13.048
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

00:25:13.048 --> 00:25:14.048
out.

00:25:14.048 --> 00:25:15.178
It won't work out.

00:25:15.178 --> 00:25:23.498
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

00:25:23.498 --> 00:25:27.308
Why I love children?

00:25:27.308 --> 00:25:30.178
Because they're innocent.

00:25:30.178 --> 00:25:32.349
They don't have all these things.

00:25:32.349 --> 00:25:43.899
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

00:25:43.899 --> 00:25:48.118
It's not simple.

00:25:48.118 --> 00:25:56.009
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

00:25:56.009 --> 00:25:57.759
Now why?

00:25:57.759 --> 00:26:01.259
Because they want money.

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:03.009
All right.

00:26:03.009 --> 00:26:05.469
Then what do they do with their money?

00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:14.918
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:18.998
the money gets lost.

00:26:18.998 --> 00:26:21.139
If not, they are caught up.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:24.358
That's not so important.

00:26:24.358 --> 00:26:29.759
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:37.699
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

00:26:37.699 --> 00:26:39.909
at least have some fear of God.

00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:45.269
But the rich are very greedy.

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:48.409
They're running after this, running after
that.

00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:51.349
There's no end to it.

00:26:51.349 --> 00:27:00.289
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:07.159
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:10.498
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

00:27:10.498 --> 00:27:18.949
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

00:27:18.949 --> 00:27:23.869
There's no place for love for the right side.

00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:36.599
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:38.699
We can never progress.

00:27:38.699 --> 00:27:44.499
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

00:27:44.499 --> 00:27:45.499
it.

00:27:45.499 --> 00:27:55.078
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

00:27:55.078 --> 00:27:57.689
But that love is missing.

00:27:57.689 --> 00:28:01.549
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:07.729
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:10.749
Love is not limited.

00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:13.379
Love has to be unlimited.

00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:18.479
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:29.389
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

00:28:29.389 --> 00:28:37.199
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

00:28:37.199 --> 00:28:45.649
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:54.519
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:58.679
Money is the enemy of love.

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:06.129
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:06.129 --> 00:29:08.029
I'm hopeless, I agree.

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:11.549
I don't know how to take interest even.

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.409
What is so interesting about it?

00:29:14.409 --> 00:29:21.029
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:23.289
I said, "I know."

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:28.439
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

00:29:28.439 --> 00:29:31.279
There's so many other things to be interested.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.059
You see the children.

00:29:33.059 --> 00:29:35.078
You see nice, nice people.

00:29:35.078 --> 00:29:41.729
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

00:29:41.729 --> 00:29:49.328
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

00:29:49.328 --> 00:29:57.419
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.389
In India is the worst, I think.

00:29:59.389 --> 00:30:04.249
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

00:30:04.249 --> 00:30:09.039
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:22.259
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:33.499
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

00:30:33.499 --> 00:30:34.499
- absolutely.

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:46.439
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:52.129
There's no interest in money.

00:30:52.129 --> 00:31:01.699
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

00:31:01.699 --> 00:31:07.729
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

00:31:07.729 --> 00:31:12.649
You have not purchased it.

00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:14.568
Nobody has to purchase it.

00:31:14.568 --> 00:31:17.419
It's free, flowing everywhere.

00:31:17.419 --> 00:31:20.269
It's so joy giving.

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:22.919
What else do you want with money?

00:31:22.919 --> 00:31:23.919
Nothing.

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:32.139
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

00:31:32.139 --> 00:31:49.938
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

00:31:49.938 --> 00:31:56.139
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

00:31:56.139 --> 00:31:59.218
Nothing is dependent on money.

00:31:59.218 --> 00:32:09.129
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

00:32:09.129 --> 00:32:14.009
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:20.319
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:23.049
They commit suicides.

00:32:23.049 --> 00:32:24.049
Why?

00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:29.349
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

00:32:29.349 --> 00:32:32.239
What is the gain they have?

00:32:32.239 --> 00:32:44.049
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

00:32:44.049 --> 00:32:51.309
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

00:32:51.309 --> 00:32:58.549
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

00:32:58.549 --> 00:33:04.809
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

00:33:04.809 --> 00:33:09.289
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:15.539
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:22.349
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

00:33:22.349 --> 00:33:23.489
are you doing?

00:33:23.489 --> 00:33:25.759
Why are you wasting your time?

00:33:25.759 --> 00:33:34.199
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

00:33:34.199 --> 00:33:39.319
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:45.019
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:52.769
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:53.929
who should provide.

00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:59.759
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:02.599
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:04.448
They are not spiritual.

00:34:04.448 --> 00:34:08.429
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:16.438
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

00:34:16.438 --> 00:34:18.401
What is the social work?

00:34:18.401 --> 00:34:21.669
Looking after the poor or something like that.

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:33.070
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:44.479
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

00:34:44.479 --> 00:34:52.149
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

00:34:52.149 --> 00:35:00.639
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

00:35:00.639 --> 00:35:03.599
First is forgiveness.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:04.809
You have to forgive people.

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:06.959
They are utterly stupid.

00:35:06.959 --> 00:35:13.359
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:16.529
So, nothing to worry about that.

00:35:16.529 --> 00:35:25.588
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

00:35:25.588 --> 00:35:38.078
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

00:35:38.078 --> 00:35:41.749
sort of a - I should say what?

00:35:41.749 --> 00:35:43.109
- some grouping.

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:47.169
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:47.169 --> 00:35:49.199
We are self-sufficient.

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:50.948
We don't need anything.

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:54.179
If you are one, we are all right.

00:35:54.179 --> 00:35:56.679
If you are many, we are all right.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:36:05.539
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:09.599
love, that Universal Love of God.

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:15.879
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:20.829
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:25.999
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:30.629
It's all something to be thought of.

00:36:30.629 --> 00:36:33.568
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:33.568 --> 00:36:37.549
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:39.641
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:39.641 --> 00:36:40.641
Not possible.

00:36:40.641 --> 00:36:47.099
You should have no interest in all these things.

00:36:47.099 --> 00:36:56.239
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

00:36:56.239 --> 00:36:58.409
Nobody can touch you.

00:36:58.409 --> 00:37:04.479
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

00:37:04.479 --> 00:37:10.889
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:12.239
What is your role?

00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:13.588
What is your position?

00:37:13.588 --> 00:37:25.438
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

00:37:25.438 --> 00:37:26.438
you should know.

00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:36.459
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

00:37:36.459 --> 00:37:41.199
You're not competitive.

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:49.328
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

00:37:49.328 --> 00:37:52.489
I know how the blessings work.

00:37:52.489 --> 00:38:00.838
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

00:38:00.838 --> 00:38:03.159
Your loving nature.

00:38:03.159 --> 00:38:15.208
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:16.948
of God.

00:38:16.948 --> 00:38:24.078
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

00:38:24.078 --> 00:38:32.129
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

00:38:32.129 --> 00:38:35.499
They don't want something very extraordinary.

00:38:35.499 --> 00:38:47.859
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

00:38:47.859 --> 00:38:51.269
change the whole world.

00:38:51.269 --> 00:38:59.639
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:09.489
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:10.519
been achieved.

00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:15.619
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:17.149
Think about it.

00:39:17.149 --> 00:39:19.708
What you need is introspection.

00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:21.149
What you need is understanding.

00:39:21.149 --> 00:39:26.059
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

00:39:26.059 --> 00:39:32.818
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

00:39:32.818 --> 00:39:38.008
And that has to be done.

00:39:38.028 --> 00:39:41.208
May God bless you.
