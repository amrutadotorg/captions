00:25.560 --> 00:26.560
Shri Mataji: It’s quite.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
Sahaja Yogi: Still quite, some more people
are coming.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.560
Few people are still coming.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.610
So, with Mataji’s permission, I will just
say a few more words while people are still

00:33.610 --> 00:42.830
coming into the hall so that when She speaks
that can be full attention.

00:42.830 --> 00:48.800
Because this is a subject where we have to
really give our attention fully and not be

00:48.800 --> 00:56.620
distracted by what’s going on in the next
seat or behind us.

00:56.620 --> 01:03.550
What has to happen is that our attention should
go inside.

01:03.550 --> 01:11.650
It’s not an easy thing for people who are
used to thinking, to stop thinking, and just

01:11.650 --> 01:15.200
watch what’s going on.

01:15.200 --> 01:21.909
Because we are so identified with our thoughts,
we don’t realize that they’re not reality

01:21.909 --> 01:28.700
and they’re actually preventing us from
experiencing reality which is absolutely the

01:28.700 --> 01:34.100
present time.

01:34.100 --> 01:45.759
So, please realize that if you have come here
to get something, it’s something personal

01:45.759 --> 01:58.399
to you by which your relationship to others
is very much purified and improved but which

01:58.399 --> 02:07.319
is for you and it’s for them also, but you
don’t worry about them.

02:07.319 --> 02:20.360
Now one thing which will help this experience
to take place, this happening to work out,

02:20.360 --> 02:28.790
is if you don’t mind to take out take off
your shoes and just rest your stocking feet

02:28.790 --> 02:30.020
on the floor.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.660
It’s a very simple reason for doing this
it’s like an earthing system.

02:35.660 --> 02:41.720
It’s just giving a contact with the Mother
Earth.

02:41.720 --> 02:52.550
It’s not a meaningless thing that the Muslims
insist that we do this when we go to their

02:52.550 --> 03:05.180
mosques because Mohammed was a genuine teacher
who was connected to this All-pervading source

03:05.180 --> 03:15.319
and who tried to teach people the actions
that would help them to be balanced and to

03:15.319 --> 03:18.040
reach this higher state.

03:18.040 --> 03:23.590
But people follow it without understanding
why they’re doing it.

03:23.590 --> 03:29.980
So it’s simply to provide an earthing an
outlet if you like for negativity to pass

03:29.980 --> 03:35.670
out because we have to become the Spirit.

03:35.670 --> 03:42.780
We are the Spirit but we have to have that
knowledge.

03:42.780 --> 03:53.610
And by letting all our thoughts all up but
Karma’s all our emotional hang-ups farce

03:53.610 --> 04:02.599
out through the different elements like the
earth, the flame of the candle, into the sky,

04:02.599 --> 04:05.469
then we find the Spirit is what remains.

04:05.469 --> 04:16.940
It’s absolutely silent, it’s absolutely
untarnished it cannot be killed as Christ

04:16.940 --> 04:19.200
proved.

04:19.200 --> 04:28.550
It cannot be harmed by anything; it’s born
again and again.

04:28.550 --> 04:38.240
And we have to know the joy of the Spirit
which is just to be the Silent Witness of

04:38.240 --> 04:46.110
all the activity that goes on in our lives.

04:46.110 --> 05:19.009
So now I’d like to introduce the Divine
Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

05:19.009 --> 05:38.120
Sahaja Yogi: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: No, I’ll stand.

05:38.120 --> 05:46.800
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth.

05:46.800 --> 05:59.520
At the very outset I must thank our very respected
mayor of North Hank Hampton to grant us permission

05:59.520 --> 06:10.539
to use this beautiful Hall for this work of
God.

06:10.539 --> 06:25.770
Yesterday, at Bedford, I explained to you
about this energy which is placed in the sacrum

06:25.770 --> 06:35.620
bone which in Sanskrit language is called
as Kundalini.

06:35.620 --> 06:43.080
This energy is placed in the “sacrum”
bone which is the Greek word; that means Greek

06:43.080 --> 06:50.229
people also knew that there is something sacred
in this bone.

06:50.229 --> 07:02.889
Now this energy is the energy of desire within
us, the primordial desire, the ultimate desire

07:02.889 --> 07:08.870
that is not yet manifested.

07:08.870 --> 07:13.289
That is the reason it is called as residual.

07:13.289 --> 07:18.460
This desire is to become one with the Divine.

07:18.460 --> 07:31.621
We are born today in these modern times in
a very great time I should say because this

07:31.621 --> 07:34.330
is the Blossom time of human beings.

07:34.330 --> 07:45.280
Never before in the history of spirituality,
so many seekers were born, so many honest

07:45.280 --> 07:48.889
sincere seekers of Spirit were born.

07:48.889 --> 07:57.550
There are a special category of people they
don’t know why they are not satisfied with

07:57.550 --> 08:05.030
what they have, perhaps they don’t know
even what they have to seek but definitely

08:05.030 --> 08:13.040
they know that they have to seek something
new.

08:13.040 --> 08:24.220
We have our scriptures all over the world
and to understand as I said the personality

08:24.220 --> 08:33.400
of any incarnation like Christ, we have to
consult every scripture to see where it is

08:33.400 --> 08:41.120
indicated about the life of these incarnations.

08:41.120 --> 08:58.140
This knowledge of the beyond, knowledge about
the roots of the Tree of Life was a secret

08:58.140 --> 09:04.680
knowledge before, was very limited, was given
to very few people.

09:04.680 --> 09:12.250
It’s described that at the time of Rama,
his father-in-law Nanaka, who was the incarnation

09:12.250 --> 09:19.290
of the Primordial master, had
only one disciple who came to ask for Self-realization.

09:19.290 --> 09:27.110
And he said: “You can ask for my kingdom”
because he was a king, “but don’t ask

09:27.110 --> 09:29.709
for this”.

09:29.709 --> 09:33.680
Because that was the beginning of life.

09:33.680 --> 09:44.800
But as in the story of a tree, there are only
one or two flowers in the beginning a time

09:44.800 --> 09:56.589
comes when there’s a Blossom time and many
flowers blossom and the wind comes which sends

09:56.589 --> 09:59.750
the
message and they become the fruits.

09:59.750 --> 10:07.230
That’s what is the time today is the time
of Resurrection as described in Quran, as

10:07.230 --> 10:12.190
time of judgment as described in the Bible.

10:12.190 --> 10:19.640
This is described by a great astrologer in
India, who was born thousands of years back

10:19.640 --> 10:24.820
whose books were revised about 300 years back.

10:24.820 --> 10:28.700
He has described this time again.

10:28.700 --> 10:38.850
When we think of the Resurrection time or
the time of judgment, we must understand that

10:38.850 --> 10:44.740
this judgment has to come to us spontaneously
from a living force.

10:44.740 --> 10:48.770
Because God is a living being and his force
is living.

10:48.770 --> 10:55.139
All the living things you see that exist – for
example, a flower becomes a fruit.

10:55.139 --> 11:00.190
All such tremendous things, we see we take
it for granted, are the blessings of this

11:00.190 --> 11:06.160
living force which is all-pervading but it
is subtle which we cannot feel.

11:06.160 --> 11:12.980
That’s what Christ has said that, “you
are to be born again” that’s a very important

11:12.980 --> 11:13.980
thing.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.890
Actually, he came on this earth with this
message.

11:16.890 --> 11:22.709
He didn’t come to establish any balance
within us because that was done by Moses and

11:22.709 --> 11:24.640
Abraham and all these people.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.970
But he actually came on this earth for us
to ascend.

11:27.970 --> 11:38.170
This is the greatest message and Resurrection
is his message and not crucifixion.

11:38.170 --> 11:44.670
Crucifixion has a very great
meaning no doubt and about which I’ll tell

11:44.670 --> 11:48.079
you later as I’ll go from chakras to chakras.

11:48.079 --> 11:56.170
When he said about the Holy Ghost he could
not explain either.

11:56.170 --> 11:59.130
The reason being there was no time.

11:59.130 --> 12:07.130
There were only four years for him to speak
about all these things and that’s how he

12:07.130 --> 12:10.050
could not explain what was the Holy Ghost.

12:10.050 --> 12:14.010
So, for every practical purpose, it’s a
mystery.

12:14.010 --> 12:18.019
But after Realization, you will be amazed,
it’s not a mystery.

12:18.019 --> 12:23.470
You know everything about the domain of God,
his laws and methods.

12:23.470 --> 12:27.630
Once you get your Realization, it’s a surprising
thing.

12:27.630 --> 12:34.111
But it is surprising because we do not know
what we are.

12:34.111 --> 12:40.610
We do not know the Tree of Life is within
us and that this divine power appears as the

12:40.610 --> 12:49.370
centres as described in the Bible: tongues
of flames, I will appear before you like tongues

12:49.370 --> 12:50.370
of flames.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.930
And you really see them as tongues of flames.

12:52.930 --> 12:57.959
These centres are silent tongues of flames
burning with different colours.

12:57.959 --> 13:05.040
Of course, especially at the top, they have
many colours and all these colours are beautifully

13:05.040 --> 13:08.320
displayed and really peace giving.

13:08.320 --> 13:16.290
But all this, what I am saying to you, is
not to be taken for granted either and not

13:16.290 --> 13:17.460
to have faith in Me blindly.

13:17.460 --> 13:22.630
That’s not the way to approach Sahaja Yoga.

13:22.630 --> 13:26.810
Because I’m talking of reality and not of
some brainwashing.

13:26.810 --> 13:32.589
It’s the reality that you must get and you
have to be honest about it that you have to

13:32.589 --> 13:34.920
get the reality.

13:34.920 --> 13:45.170
Now, when I say that all these things are
within us, I am saying it like a hypothesis

13:45.170 --> 13:48.290
in a scientific research.

13:48.290 --> 13:53.730
And once it is proved to be true then you
have to believe in it.

13:53.730 --> 13:59.199
So, as a research
student or as a person who is trying to know

13:59.199 --> 14:05.040
the new knowledge about the roots, you have
to keep yourself open and a little tolerant

14:05.040 --> 14:06.759
about it.

14:06.759 --> 14:07.759
As Mr.

14:07.759 --> 14:14.019
Brown has told you that we have many angsts
and that’s why the problem is that’s why

14:14.019 --> 14:15.019
we are confused.

14:15.019 --> 14:21.200
But this Kundalini is such a force that it
shoots off taking you away from all those

14:21.200 --> 14:29.250
angsts and makes the Spirit shine in your
attention in your central nervous system.

14:29.250 --> 14:38.510
Now the Spirit is a reflection of God Almighty
within you.

14:38.510 --> 14:45.520
That’s the collective being because God
is a collective being it is a collective being.

14:45.520 --> 14:50.610
It is not that I say you are all brothers
or sisters that’s not the way so brainwashing,

14:50.610 --> 14:55.649
but it exists within us as an actuality.

14:55.649 --> 14:59.360
And when you actualize the Spirit you become
collectively conscious.

14:59.360 --> 15:06.250
You become, that means on your fingers as
you see, you start feeling other people.

15:06.250 --> 15:14.970
Then there is nobody the other you can feel
yourself your centres and you can find out

15:14.970 --> 15:20.100
what’s wrong with you what’s wrong with
others.

15:20.100 --> 15:26.470
Today, when I met the radio gentlemen, they
suggested that people would be very anxious

15:26.470 --> 15:31.370
to
know how people get cured by Sahaja Yoga.

15:31.370 --> 15:36.890
So, first I would like to explain to you what
happens.

15:36.890 --> 15:46.690
This force the residual force within you is
the Kundalini as I told you and is the power

15:46.690 --> 15:53.810
that, when rises, she pierces through all
these centres.

15:53.810 --> 16:02.769
And all these centres represent our physical
being our emotional being our mental being

16:02.769 --> 16:04.310
and our spiritual being.

16:04.310 --> 16:13.570
For example, the very first one that you see
here, the red one, is our innocence.

16:13.570 --> 16:16.790
Innocence as human beings.

16:16.790 --> 16:19.699
As animals we had innocence.

16:19.699 --> 16:24.660
Then God created human beings and he gave
them freedom.

16:24.660 --> 16:28.330
He said: “All right, you’ll be on your
own keep your innocence.

16:28.330 --> 16:34.269
Don’t run towards the so-called knowledge,
the knowledge: “What is this matter?

16:34.269 --> 16:35.269
What is that?

16:35.269 --> 16:36.269
Who is God?

16:36.269 --> 16:38.300
All those things.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.399
Keep innocent”.

16:40.399 --> 16:45.350
If he had maintained that innocence with our
freedom intact there would have no problem

16:45.350 --> 16:48.000
at all.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.579
But in the curiosity of human beings when
they had the freedom, they consulted a satanic

16:53.579 --> 16:55.040
force.

16:55.040 --> 16:59.149
And the so-called book of knowledge started
opening out.

16:59.149 --> 17:05.690
So, whatever we have got the knowledge is
a “avidya ” is not knowledge, it is non-knowledge.

17:05.690 --> 17:10.140
Because by knowing this you do not know the
way about it.

17:10.140 --> 17:15.868
For example, if you know that is gravity in
the matter or you can say there is gravity

17:15.868 --> 17:18.300
in the mother earth, you just know there is
gravity.

17:18.300 --> 17:24.920
It’s just a statement of fact which you
see with your eyes but you can’t say why,

17:24.920 --> 17:26.930
why there is gravity.

17:26.930 --> 17:33.710
Whatever you learnt through science is just
the knowledge that you see but you cannot

17:33.710 --> 17:36.760
explain why it is there.

17:36.760 --> 17:43.700
So, it is not a complete knowledge it is just
a gross knowledge of the thing that you have

17:43.700 --> 17:45.940
which you can use for your purpose.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.130
Also, science can help.

17:47.130 --> 17:53.270
Now, I find science is very helpful because
if there was not a microphone, I could not

17:53.270 --> 17:54.690
have talked to you people.

17:54.690 --> 17:57.850
If there was no television people could not
have received

17:57.850 --> 18:02.170
vibrations those who received on the television
today.

18:02.170 --> 18:03.690
It should not have impossible.

18:03.690 --> 18:06.710
So, even the science has helped you.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.880
But that knowledge was not required and it
was all right.

18:10.880 --> 18:17.860
But when we chose the other way, God also
helped us by sending on this earth many incarnations

18:17.860 --> 18:22.840
to first tell us that: “You’d better establish
your balance”.

18:22.840 --> 18:29.300
And this balancing was done at this point
[the Void] where you see the green circle

18:29.300 --> 18:31.110
which is here in the stomach.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.170
So, this balance has to be established.

18:33.170 --> 18:38.970
When we got the Ten Commandments, you see,
we thought it’s a challenge to our ego:

18:38.970 --> 18:43.020
who are they to say: “Thou shalt not do
this “.

18:43.020 --> 18:44.980
What’s wrong?

18:44.980 --> 18:48.892
Everybody says “what’s wrong?” when
they preach people don’t like it because

18:48.892 --> 18:50.080
those please do not follow it, you see?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.480
Naturally people say: “What’s this?”

18:53.480 --> 18:58.570
But when the Kundalini awakens, she enlightens
these Ten Commandments so we can say the religion

18:58.570 --> 19:00.150
within you.

19:00.150 --> 19:05.270
That’s called as the principle of the Master
within you.

19:05.270 --> 19:10.970
The master – say, in the car the one who
is the master is watching the driver who’s

19:10.970 --> 19:11.970
driving.

19:11.970 --> 19:19.370
First, learning how to drive, then suddenly
he finds a driver has become an expert.

19:19.370 --> 19:21.710
And then he becomes a master.

19:21.710 --> 19:27.640
In the same way, when you start moving towards
the right-side of action and the left-side

19:27.640 --> 19:32.430
of desire you act.

19:32.430 --> 19:38.630
Balance it: you make errors, mistakes you
correct them, again you balance it.

19:38.630 --> 19:43.720
You discover the mistakes you have made, again
you balance it.

19:43.720 --> 19:50.100
But these Ten Commandments, when they are
enlightened within you, you just don’t do

19:50.100 --> 19:55.570
those things, you don’t like it, you just
don’t like, you just give up because there’s

19:55.570 --> 19:56.570
enlightenment.

19:56.570 --> 20:00.740
For example, in this hall there is no light
then you may fumble down when they fall down

20:00.740 --> 20:04.340
you may learn by following ten times that
there are so many steps.

20:04.340 --> 20:07.891
But if there is light you can see everything.

20:07.891 --> 20:10.060
You can see the absolute relationship between
everything.

20:10.060 --> 20:14.280
So, when you discover your absolute, the relative
position of everything is understood and automatically

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
you become righteous.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
Nobody has to tell you: “Become righteous
“.

20:16.280 --> 20:21.240
You just become you can’t help it.

20:21.240 --> 20:31.420
So, this is what it is we the diseases are
caused mostly by imbalances.

20:31.420 --> 20:39.130
As Mr Brown has told you that the Mother Earth
sucks the problems because all these centres

20:39.130 --> 20:44.020
are made out of the elements, different elements
at different levels.

20:44.020 --> 20:49.840
And we have imbalances of these elements in
our body and that’s how we get sick.

20:49.840 --> 20:58.140
So, now the Mother Earth gives us, if she’s
here, if she knows Me, she’ll suck your

20:58.140 --> 21:01.390
problems which are come by the imbalance of
the mother earth.

21:01.390 --> 21:08.790
For example, arthritis and things like that,
all these come as problems of Mother Earth.

21:08.790 --> 21:14.680
Especially in the cold countries people have
this trouble they can be cured by taking help

21:14.680 --> 21:15.680
of the Mother Earth.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.520
It’s very surprising.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.480
The other day I had an Indian lady at my house.

21:19.480 --> 21:25.700
She has terrible arthritis, and her hands
were like this and she couldn’t walk.

21:25.700 --> 21:33.850
But when she understood how to ask the Mother
Earth to take away her problems and the methods

21:33.850 --> 21:38.960
of divine laws, within half an hour she got
rid of her arthritis.

21:38.960 --> 21:46.160
Even yesterday there was one gentleman who
got better, much better which his arthritis.

21:46.160 --> 21:50.630
In the same way, we have problems with the
imbalances within us.

21:50.630 --> 21:53.730
Now, let us see what problems do we have with
imbalances.

21:53.730 --> 22:00.780
I am sorry, today I am going to speak on more
about our physical side because specially

22:00.780 --> 22:04.741
he said people will be interested and I think
if you are physically not all right, how can

22:04.741 --> 22:06.770
you be all right spiritually?

22:06.770 --> 22:14.730
Now the imbalances we have within us, because
we are extremists.

22:14.730 --> 22:22.080
If you are a person who is emotional you go
to the end of your emotions till you become

22:22.080 --> 22:23.240
mad and lunatic.

22:23.240 --> 22:30.850
You weep out yourself so much that you have
to land up in some lunatic asylum.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.660
But nature has its own way of controlling
that.

22:34.660 --> 22:40.890
For example, a person who is a lunatic never,
never has the failure of the brain.

22:40.890 --> 22:50.590
It should be but the failure- on the contrary
the failure of the brain it has, but not the

22:50.590 --> 22:57.590
failure of the heart, though an emotional
person works with the heart.

22:57.590 --> 23:02.050
On the contrary the one who works too much
with the brain, thinks of the future, plans

23:02.050 --> 23:07.000
too much, his brain should fail but his heart
fails.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.580
All heart failures come to people who think
of the future, plan too much, think all the

23:12.580 --> 23:18.450
time, all the time worried about the future,
work very hard physically because the right

23:18.450 --> 23:20.650
side is the physical and the mental side.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.690
They have all heart problems.

23:22.690 --> 23:30.850
And those who are very emotional, I mean,
you say heart too much, always crying, weeping,

23:30.850 --> 23:33.620
they get failure of the brain.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.990
Just imagine, what a balance is build!

23:35.990 --> 23:42.540
And a doctor told Me, from a mental hospital,
that they have a cardiograph machine, but

23:42.540 --> 23:49.130
it was never used because a lunatic’s heart
never fails.

23:49.130 --> 23:57.500
So, once you have such an imbalance nature
takes the respite but it can be very fatal

23:57.500 --> 23:59.900
and dangerous.

23:59.900 --> 24:03.510
There are many diseases which are caused,
really, most of the diseases are caused by

24:03.510 --> 24:05.640
imbalances.

24:05.640 --> 24:09.750
Now let us take out a person who is a very
speedy person, it’s very common these days.

24:09.750 --> 24:13.000
I mean people are so speedy that you don’t
know how to talk to them.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.580
They are telescopically speedy their words
go telescopically and you don’t know how

24:17.580 --> 24:20.640
to scan it out, how to talk to them.

24:20.640 --> 24:25.420
Now such people who are speedy, who are running
all the time, who are not there in the present

24:25.420 --> 24:33.180
at all, all the time of the future are the
people who move too much on the right hand-side.

24:33.180 --> 24:43.740
And there is the second centre which is looking
after the right-side, the creativity, the

24:43.740 --> 24:45.590
thinking.

24:45.590 --> 24:51.490
Because when you think the cells of the brain
are replaced every minute by the fat that

24:51.490 --> 25:00.010
is in your stomach, by this centre which we
call as Swadisthana which in the gross expresses

25:00.010 --> 25:03.600
itself as aortic plexus.

25:03.600 --> 25:08.140
Of course, the medical science won’t accept
it but when we have proved it by curing people

25:08.140 --> 25:10.410
I hope they will accept it.

25:10.410 --> 25:14.590
Now this imbalance comes in because you are
all the time thinking.

25:14.590 --> 25:24.980
Now this poor centre has to look after other
organs within us like the liver, spleen, pancreas,

25:24.980 --> 25:30.710
kidneys, intestines and uterus.

25:30.710 --> 25:35.860
Now such a person who is thinking all the
time neglects all these organs and any one

25:35.860 --> 25:39.150
of these diseases he can have.

25:39.150 --> 25:47.740
For example, he can have liver [problems]
he can have diabetes, he can have leukaemia.

25:47.740 --> 25:53.610
Leukaemia cost more to these speedy people
not so much to the people who are futuristic,

25:53.610 --> 26:02.680
but more to the people who are speedy.

26:02.680 --> 26:07.340
Because the spleen acts for our emergencies.

26:07.340 --> 26:15.910
Supposing a person is extremely speedy; he
just rushes to the bathroom, takes his bath

26:15.910 --> 26:21.210
goes and gets his breakfast and drives on
the way eating his breakfast all the time.

26:21.210 --> 26:25.810
Poor spleen does know how to cope with this
crazy personality.

26:25.810 --> 26:29.080
Because here it is, he’s going in a mad
rush.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.500
In the modern times, you see the traffic is
so bad, they just, they are shouting at the

26:33.500 --> 26:34.500
traffic.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.330
Then there’s a breakfast going on.

26:36.330 --> 26:41.460
All these things are going simultaneously
and poor, this spleen, doesn’t know how

26:41.460 --> 26:48.110
to react and how to cope all the time to these
emergencies, one after another, simultaneously

26:48.110 --> 26:49.730
so many coming up.

26:49.730 --> 26:57.780
So, it gets crazy it loses its control completely
and it starts producing additional blood cells

26:57.780 --> 26:59.580
and blood cells and blood cells.

26:59.580 --> 27:06.960
And when they become too much then they start
flowing on their own, because there is no

27:06.960 --> 27:10.700
relationship left now because of the speediness.

27:10.700 --> 27:14.360
And that’s how Leukaemia has established.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.820
Now leukaemia can be easily cured, very easily
cured.

27:18.820 --> 27:23.760
Because when you put your hand when you are
a Realized soul the energy is flowing.

27:23.760 --> 27:28.560
You just you put your hand on the spleen of
the person, you’ll be surprised that the

27:28.560 --> 27:31.060
spleen settles down because it gets new vitality.

27:31.060 --> 27:37.850
It gets the wisdom from these vibrations,
we can say, from this energy because this

27:37.850 --> 27:42.180
energy is the one that thinks, that cooperates
and organizes.

27:42.180 --> 27:47.170
That’s the one which sorts out also all
kinds of plants and everything.

27:47.170 --> 27:55.020
It is this living energy which when given
to the spleen it becomes wiser: it rests,

27:55.020 --> 27:56.020
it becomes silent.

27:56.020 --> 28:02.730
And also, if you give the person the balance
with your hand, you can make the person much

28:02.730 --> 28:08.620
more relaxed, much more silent within himself.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.140
And that is how you can cure.

28:10.140 --> 28:16.410
And we have, not only that, I have cured of
course nowadays, I don’t cure people much.

28:16.410 --> 28:21.200
There’s a disciple in America and one gentleman
met Me in a village.

28:21.200 --> 28:25.960
He came in his car and he told me that: “My
grandson has gone to America for his treatment

28:25.960 --> 28:29.190
of leukaemia and now they said he’s a gone
case and in 15 days he is going to die.

28:29.190 --> 28:31.920
That’s the certificate”.

28:31.920 --> 28:40.750
So, I told him that: “I’m so busy in the
villages now, you can go back and bring up

28:40.750 --> 28:48.420
this lady she’s there in New York and she’s
an American Sahaja Yogini “.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.090
And he rang her.

28:50.090 --> 28:52.650
She said: “All right, I’ll try to work
it out “.

28:52.650 --> 28:54.800
And she cured him.

28:54.800 --> 29:00.310
The boy came to see Me in London he’s now
back in the school, he’s perfectly all right.

29:00.310 --> 29:02.860
Now people think it’s magical.

29:02.860 --> 29:03.860
It is not!

29:03.860 --> 29:05.040
It’s nothing so great.

29:05.040 --> 29:10.030
Because we take so many things for granted,
every day, if you see the living work of God,

29:10.030 --> 29:11.030
it’s tremendous!

29:11.030 --> 29:15.750
Look at this honey, look at the way the flowers
become fruits.

29:15.750 --> 29:20.790
I mean millions and billions of things we
take it for granted even our evolution from

29:20.790 --> 29:22.430
amoeba to the stage we have come.

29:22.430 --> 29:25.560
We don’t know how we have come, how God
has done it.

29:25.560 --> 29:30.110
It’s done so delicately with such care with
such understanding.

29:30.110 --> 29:35.180
At least we should know that there must be
some meaning when he has brought us to this

29:35.180 --> 29:36.410
level as a human being.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.580
What is the meaning?

29:37.580 --> 29:38.580
Why?

29:38.580 --> 29:39.860
What was the reason?

29:39.860 --> 29:42.470
Why he made us like this?

29:42.470 --> 29:49.590
And just when you discover this meaning spontaneously
automatically this thing gets cured, because

29:49.590 --> 29:52.850
that vitality starts coming to you from the
top.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.520
Now we grow over tensions why?

29:55.520 --> 30:02.630
Because you see, there, with the activity
of these two sides left and right side, we

30:02.630 --> 30:06.530
develop two big balloons in our head.

30:06.530 --> 30:12.660
With the left-side one which is for conditioning
us, which frightens us, gives us fear and

30:12.660 --> 30:18.890
all that, which is our past, we develop an
institution call “superego”.

30:18.890 --> 30:26.180
Such people are all the time under fear, under
danger, or crying, weeping sort of people.

30:26.180 --> 30:29.650
The other side are the people who act.

30:29.650 --> 30:34.550
When they act, they have another by-product
in the head called “ego” which you must

30:34.550 --> 30:36.410
have heard quite a lot.

30:36.410 --> 30:41.530
And this Mr ego is on one side and superego
on another side and once they close down will

30:41.530 --> 30:42.860
become like an eggshell.

30:42.860 --> 30:45.110
You are closed.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.810
You have an “I-ness”.

30:46.810 --> 30:51.050
You are Mr So, you are Mrs So.

30:51.050 --> 30:58.340
Now when this is accumulated there [Agnya]
we feel the tension because either we are

30:58.340 --> 31:04.820
in action or we are in whipping conditions
where we are in inaction.

31:04.820 --> 31:07.700
This tension mounts up in the head and you
feel the tension.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.900
And with this tension you get all sort of
complications.

31:10.900 --> 31:14.120
With the left-side you might get low blood
pressure and all that.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.720
With the right-side you might get high blood
pressure.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.370
Now how do you reduce the tension?

31:20.370 --> 31:22.110
People ask Me how do you reduce the tension?

31:22.110 --> 31:23.650
It’s a very simple thing.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.670
You see, life’s work is extremely simple.

31:25.670 --> 31:27.860
Like your own breathing is so simple!

31:27.860 --> 31:30.510
Have you ever thought about the breathing
that you do?

31:30.510 --> 31:34.950
You don’t read any books you don’t go
anywhere you don’t consult anyone it just

31:34.950 --> 31:36.150
happens to you.

31:36.150 --> 31:41.450
In the same way, it’s such a simple thing
that your tension on the head is because either

31:41.450 --> 31:43.840
you are worried or you are planning something.

31:43.840 --> 31:49.810
You are aggressive or you are taking the aggression;
one of the two.

31:49.810 --> 31:51.280
So, what happens?

31:51.280 --> 31:58.000
Here I say that Christ plays a very big role
in our life because he is placed in that crossing

31:58.000 --> 31:59.560
point if you see.

31:59.560 --> 32:01.570
This is the cross.

32:01.570 --> 32:05.860
When he said on the cross: “It has been
accomplished”.

32:05.860 --> 32:17.060
When he says that the placing of Christ in
that little space of ego and superego is accomplished.

32:17.060 --> 32:26.890
When Christ is awakened through the kindling
of the Kundalini then these two things are

32:26.890 --> 32:27.890
sucked in.

32:27.890 --> 32:31.470
That’s why we say he died for our sins because
the left-side are the sins and the right-side

32:31.470 --> 32:33.850
are the Karmas the action, the ego.

32:33.850 --> 32:35.760
So, he sucks it.

32:35.760 --> 32:40.539
By that suction you are amazed that suddenly
you find there’s a depression here like

32:40.539 --> 32:42.540
a child has.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.920
And you feel the throbbing here.

32:45.920 --> 32:50.180
And after the throbbing you feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.650
From your own head the cool breeze is coming
out.

32:52.650 --> 32:54.280
This Holy Ghost is manifesting herself.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.280
And she’s all around.

32:55.280 --> 33:00.740
Also, you can start feeling in your hands
if your- this centre is all right.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.920
This is what he meant “to be born again”.

33:02.920 --> 33:06.190
Not just to call some people: “All right
now we have a baptism”.

33:06.190 --> 33:10.510
So, the poor child is screaming and you put
your hand on his head and say: “All right,

33:10.510 --> 33:11.510
you’re baptized now”.

33:11.510 --> 33:13.670
That’s artificial, it’s just a drama.

33:13.670 --> 33:16.010
And this kind of drama they do in every religion.

33:16.010 --> 33:17.890
It’s not only in Christianity.

33:17.890 --> 33:21.960
You’ll find even Hindus do the same joke
and everybody has the same joke.

33:21.960 --> 33:27.880
But it’s not true because if there is baptism
there has to be transformation.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.420
And there is no transformation whether you
baptize a child or not.

33:30.420 --> 33:33.700
On the contrary, I have seen some children
they become funny.

33:33.700 --> 33:38.260
Because this is a very precious place, it
is a very holy place [Sahasrara] and anybody

33:38.260 --> 33:44.030
who is not a holy person who is not a sanctified
person places the hand on top of the head

33:44.030 --> 33:47.100
of such any child, he can become even mad.

33:47.100 --> 33:55.040
We had three examples of that kind that people
who got baptism, children who are perfectly

33:55.040 --> 34:01.950
normal but after baptism their eyes started
squinting around and they lost their awareness.

34:01.950 --> 34:07.640
Because the people who put their hands on
this very precious holy place where not themselves

34:07.640 --> 34:08.640
holy.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.720
They didn’t have a clean heart.

34:10.720 --> 34:16.030
And that’s why- this is the centre of the
heart which is there in the Spirit.

34:16.030 --> 34:23.091
And this one [Sahasrara] when it is touched
by someone who has a heart of a stone can

34:23.091 --> 34:25.560
pass bad vibrations satanic vibrations.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.339
People can spoil them.

34:27.339 --> 34:32.129
You have a very great poet in this country-
you had him- was William Blake.

34:32.129 --> 34:34.540
And he said: “A priest cursed on my head”.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.409
And people asked Me: “What it is?”

34:36.409 --> 34:41.710
I said: “The priest must be somebody who
is not such a good man perhaps and he touched

34:41.710 --> 34:42.710
his forehead”.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.030
Because he was a Realized soul.

34:44.030 --> 34:49.190
And he’s written so much about Sahaja Yoga
that nowhere in the world I have seen so much

34:49.190 --> 34:53.280
written about Sahaja Yoga as your great poet
William Blake.

34:53.280 --> 34:57.820
Now when this happens so many other things
can also happen to us.

34:57.820 --> 35:03.840
For example, a person who is very emotional,
for example, the one who is always whipping

35:03.840 --> 35:06.560
crying going to the left-side.

35:06.560 --> 35:12.800
Oh, they are – most of the people feel guilty
that’s the worst disease of the West.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.710
By feeling guilty you get spondylitis, thyroid
all kinds of troubles.

35:17.710 --> 35:18.980
So, no use.

35:18.980 --> 35:21.440
What’s the use to feeling guilty after all?

35:21.440 --> 35:23.970
Or people who believe that “we must suffer”.

35:23.970 --> 35:26.870
Now this I can’t understand at all!

35:26.870 --> 35:29.390
Because Christ has suffered for us.

35:29.390 --> 35:30.650
What more are we going to suffer?

35:30.650 --> 35:32.210
Now he suffered already for us.

35:32.210 --> 35:34.800
Has he left something for us to suffer?

35:34.800 --> 35:38.890
Those people who believe like Jews did believe
in such a thing, they suffered.

35:38.890 --> 35:40.960
We don’t have to suffer at all!

35:40.960 --> 35:44.990
That’s a promise.

35:44.990 --> 35:46.210
He suffered for us.

35:46.210 --> 35:48.970
Only thing, we have to awaken him, that’s
all.

35:48.970 --> 35:55.010
Nor do we have to feel we are very guilty
because if you feel guilty then this left-side

35:55.010 --> 35:56.900
gets caught up [Left Vishudhi].

35:56.900 --> 36:03.050
And it creates a problem for your Realization
first of all and secondly, it might give you

36:03.050 --> 36:04.060
a physical problem.

36:04.060 --> 36:09.630
I’ve seen this is very common with the West
people I don’t know why they should feel

36:09.630 --> 36:10.630
guilty.

36:10.630 --> 36:19.170
One must know that God Almighty is the ocean
of compassion, ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness.

36:19.170 --> 36:24.120
We cannot understand his forgiveness, we cannot
be like him.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.670
And what guilt can we have?

36:25.670 --> 36:32.060
Even the judges on this earth who are just
human beings cannot punish you.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.990
How can that God is going to punish you for
what?

36:34.990 --> 36:39.610
So, we live with myths: “Oh, I should not
have done it, I should not have done it”.

36:39.610 --> 36:44.160
This has come also with our modern life.

36:44.160 --> 36:49.350
For example, if you put your fork and spoon
in this way then you are all right, sophisticated.

36:49.350 --> 36:53.870
If you just put it a little this way: then
you are: “Oh, I should not have done it”.

36:53.870 --> 36:57.620
If you spill the coffee then you are as if
you’d murdered three persons the way you

36:57.620 --> 36:58.620
feel about it.

36:58.620 --> 36:59.660
It is not so.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.490
It’s not so.

37:01.490 --> 37:05.440
In the realm of God what does it matter?

37:05.440 --> 37:06.440
It’s nothing important.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.720
For him, the most important thing is that
you are a human being.

37:09.720 --> 37:15.490
And you must know that you are at the epitome
of the whole creation and that should have

37:15.490 --> 37:19.670
no self-pity about it, no self-pity at all.

37:19.670 --> 37:26.670
But you must have self-confidence that God
has created you with a purpose, that you become

37:26.670 --> 37:31.080
collectively conscious and you see the play
of God’s beauty and his glory.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.590
That’s why he has created you.

37:33.590 --> 37:38.940
Not to feel guilty not to have self-pity and
to cry and weep and always say: “I’m horrible.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.060
I have problems”.

37:40.060 --> 37:46.090
Such people get troubles to themselves while
those are aggressive trouble others.

37:46.090 --> 37:49.950
Both are just the same in the eyes of God
whether you trouble yourself or others, it’s

37:49.950 --> 37:51.900
just the same.

37:51.900 --> 37:59.320
Now this kind of an imbalance that comes within
us can be corrected with the awakening of

37:59.320 --> 38:00.860
Christ within us.

38:00.860 --> 38:05.910
The chanting at this place when he is awakened,
when he is awakened because you are to be

38:05.910 --> 38:06.950
connected with him.

38:06.950 --> 38:10.641
Then is our Lord’s prayer that’s the mantra.

38:10.641 --> 38:18.380
We have to say that he is kept awakened and
that is the chanting we have.

38:18.380 --> 38:25.310
You’ll be amazed after coming to Sahaja
Yoga the Christians who hated the Jews have

38:25.310 --> 38:36.020
understood the importance of Moses because
he resides in this void part, this green circle

38:36.020 --> 38:42.560
and all ten of them who incarnated again and
again reside there.

38:42.560 --> 38:48.490
Now those who are fanatics say, those who
believe that only more Muhammad is the one

38:48.490 --> 38:56.490
or those who believe that only the Moses is
the one or any such funny ideas, they also

38:56.490 --> 38:59.950
suffer physically.

38:59.950 --> 39:06.763
I had a doctor from Iran, about ten years
back I should say, he came to England to see

39:06.763 --> 39:11.390
me and he had a cancer of the stomach.

39:11.390 --> 39:17.400
And I asked him, I said: “Do you believe
that Muhammad is the only one you had?”

39:17.400 --> 39:18.400
“Yes.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.400
I believe in that."

39:19.400 --> 39:20.700
I said: “How can it be?

39:20.700 --> 39:23.580
He himself has said there have been many prophets.

39:23.580 --> 39:25.990
And how can you say that he’s the only one?”

39:25.990 --> 39:28.660
So, he said: “No, no, no.

39:28.660 --> 39:29.701
He was the last.

39:29.701 --> 39:34.120
He was the most modern so I believe in him
and I don’t believe in anybody else”.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.600
I said: “You have to believe in Moses.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
“Oh!

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
That I cannot believe.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.050
These Jews, I can’t believe in them.

39:39.050 --> 39:41.220
I hate the Jews I can’t believe Moses."

39:41.220 --> 39:44.430
I said: “All right, go ahead, if you can’t
believe in him.

39:44.430 --> 39:46.270
Same is Nanaka.

39:46.270 --> 39:50.340
Same is Janaka.

39:50.340 --> 39:51.500
They are the same people again born again.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.230
And the same quality of the Primordial master
is born again.

39:54.230 --> 39:59.210
I said: “All right, go ahead, I cannot cure
you if you are a fanatic you suffer."

39:59.210 --> 40:02.460
So, he went home and he had a bad time.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.110
Doctor said: “You are going to die now”.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.970
So, after eight days his wife brought him
again.

40:05.970 --> 40:11.820
I said: “Now do you believe in it?” he
said: “Yes Mother, I do.

40:11.820 --> 40:13.930
Please, cure me”.

40:13.930 --> 40:15.170
And he got cured.

40:15.170 --> 40:16.790
He’s still alive all right.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.730
Fanaticism has its own respite to.

40:18.730 --> 40:22.890
Fanaticism is real madness I should say to
be fanatical about something.

40:22.890 --> 40:26.960
It’s a mental projection to believe that
somebody belongs to you.

40:26.960 --> 40:31.730
Actually, you have to belong to them and nobody
belongs to you.

40:31.730 --> 40:38.890
This fight of religion imagine when you see
that in this world there are fights going

40:38.890 --> 40:42.860
on in the name of God, in the name of religion,
you’re shocked!

40:42.860 --> 40:50.000
The things that were created for peace, for
bliss and for heavenly abode of human beings

40:50.000 --> 40:56.060
are being used for something that is absolutely
opposite of that.

40:56.060 --> 41:04.030
It’s most surprising how people are believing
into a team to such an extent that they are

41:04.030 --> 41:10.100
just getting monopolized and filthen [unsure]
and they are torturing others.

41:10.100 --> 41:15.320
It could become even very sophisticated like
people who have formed lots of mental projections

41:15.320 --> 41:19.600
you see, they have dogmas, this, that and
they cultivate you every time they have a

41:19.600 --> 41:22.650
lecture and then you believe in it: “Oh,
oui, [yes?] this is this”.

41:22.650 --> 41:25.710
And from your childhood you are told, “you
are like this you are like that”.

41:25.710 --> 41:28.600
Ultimately, what do you find at the end of
life?

41:28.600 --> 41:33.200
Nothing but the same and same and same going
on.

41:33.200 --> 41:39.210
But the principle of religion is to give you
a balance and that doesn’t happen unless

41:39.210 --> 41:41.550
and until this religion is awakened within
you.

41:41.550 --> 41:47.590
Once it is awakened, I don’t have to tell
you that: “You give up your drugs”.

41:47.590 --> 41:49.310
You just give up.

41:49.310 --> 41:51.140
I don’t have to tell you: “Take your alcoholism
out.

41:51.140 --> 41:52.140
” You just do it.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.230
I just don’t tell you.

41:53.230 --> 41:57.360
I don’t say that if you have alcoholism
or anything as a disease it just drops up

41:57.360 --> 41:58.360
automatically.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.860
Even if you want you cannot drink.

42:00.860 --> 42:02.520
You won’t enjoy it at all!

42:02.520 --> 42:08.150
It’s just as a by-product as you get rid
of your troubles.

42:08.150 --> 42:13.590
In the same way, these habits also drop out.

42:13.590 --> 42:20.010
You become independent you become free not
slave of anything because you are the Spirit

42:20.010 --> 42:22.300
which is the freedom within you.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.030
Complete supreme freedom is your Spirit.

42:25.030 --> 42:36.160
Last of all, I will tell you about a horrible
disease, which is the modern disease nowadays,

42:36.160 --> 42:42.090
is the disease of cancer, which is a horrible
thing as people say.

42:42.090 --> 42:49.740
Cancer is caused mostly, which I have seen,
in the people who are left-sided.

42:49.740 --> 42:53.760
Not so much in the right-sided people, those
who are aggressive.

42:53.760 --> 42:56.880
But those who are emotionally ones disturbed
get this trouble.

42:56.880 --> 43:04.650
So far, I have not seen one patient of cancer
who has not been emotionally very much inclined.

43:04.650 --> 43:12.730
It might look, appear that a person is very
aggressive, but if you really go into the

43:12.730 --> 43:19.120
history of a person you will find that he
had a problem, that his mother died, or his

43:19.120 --> 43:24.710
father died early, or some sort of an emotional
problem he developed later on, or a shock

43:24.710 --> 43:29.610
from his wife or a fiancée, from his children
or something like that.

43:29.610 --> 43:35.210
It’s more a case of emotional disturbance.

43:35.210 --> 43:43.360
Now when you find, that a person has a cancer,
on the hands you’ll find that all these

43:43.360 --> 43:45.080
fingers are burning [Shri Mataji shows all
the fingers of Her left hand], sometimes even

43:45.080 --> 43:46.930
these fingers start burning [Shri Mataji shows
fingers of Her right hand].

43:46.930 --> 43:54.190
When it is on a galloping state you put your
hands towards a person who is suffering from

43:54.190 --> 43:59.020
cancer- even doctors might not diagnose it,
they might find it later on – all your fingers

43:59.020 --> 44:00.140
start burning.

44:00.140 --> 44:05.320
You start burning here and here [Shri Mataji
points on the top of the palm near the fingers].

44:05.320 --> 44:06.650
Also, you may start feeling a throbbing here
[Shri Mataji points to the solar plexus].

44:06.650 --> 44:14.340
Of course, throbbing doesn’t mean that a
person has a cancer, but is one of the symptoms.

44:14.340 --> 44:16.330
Now how cancer is caused?

44:16.330 --> 44:17.330
It’s very simple.

44:17.330 --> 44:22.710
And to understand it- it’s better that if
you understand- you will not those things

44:22.710 --> 44:24.740
which are not to be done.

44:24.740 --> 44:30.730
Anything we do into extremes, I mean any emergency
is taking over by this two sides, because

44:30.730 --> 44:33.720
they manifest the sympathetic nervous system.

44:33.720 --> 44:37.370
They act for our sympathetic nervous system
whenever there is an emergency.

44:37.370 --> 44:43.170
For example, a person has a habit, a simple
habit, of say, rubbing his ears, very simple

44:43.170 --> 44:44.170
habit.

44:44.170 --> 44:45.530
He may develop a cancer there.

44:45.530 --> 44:47.310
Because he has overdone it.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.480
An extreme thing he has done is rubbing, rubbing,
rubbing.

44:50.480 --> 44:57.080
So, what happens is that the cells which are
supported by a centre here, for example, it’s

44:57.080 --> 44:58.970
coming from left and right [Shri Mataji forms
a triangle to mime the spinal cord] – and

44:58.970 --> 45:00.080
that’s how a centre is formed.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.820
If you can see all of you.

45:01.820 --> 45:06.520
This is the one through which the medulla
oblongata passes, the spinal cord, this is

45:06.520 --> 45:07.780
the spinal cord.

45:07.780 --> 45:13.630
Now, when there is a pull on right-side or
left-side too much, on the sympathetic nervous

45:13.630 --> 45:17.760
system, then this connection breaks out like
that [Shri Mataji splits the hands].

45:17.760 --> 45:22.900
When it breaks out the connection of the centre
with the whole, because this centre [right

45:22.900 --> 45:25.100
thumb] is supplying the energy, is broken.

45:25.100 --> 45:31.530
When the connection with the whole is broken,
there is no coordination left, there is no

45:31.530 --> 45:32.530
control left.

45:32.530 --> 45:37.170
So, the cells become on their own what we
call malignant.

45:37.170 --> 45:38.440
They start growing on their own.

45:38.440 --> 45:42.230
For example, if their nose develops the cancer,
than nose becomes big.

45:42.230 --> 45:49.340
The rest of the- is smaller and the cells
of the nose start pressing all other organs

45:49.340 --> 45:50.620
in here [on the throat].

45:50.620 --> 45:54.680
And sometimes they may pass into blood and
go to other areas also.

45:54.680 --> 45:59.920
So, these are aggressive cells, malignant
cells are on their own, you cannot control

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
them.

46:00.920 --> 46:07.420
By some chance, if you could bring them back
in connection with the whole, if you can do

46:07.420 --> 46:09.100
that, cancer can be cured.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.780
It’s as simple as that.

46:10.780 --> 46:15.130
When the Kundalini rises, what she does is,
she awakens the centre.

46:15.130 --> 46:20.670
And when the centre is awakened, it just comes
back to normal and a person becomes normal.

46:20.670 --> 46:22.650
That’s how cancer can be cured.

46:22.650 --> 46:25.110
It is very simple, it’s not so difficult.

46:25.110 --> 46:29.710
Human life we have made it so difficult, actually
it’s not so difficult.

46:29.710 --> 46:37.181
It’s a very simple thing if you understand
the laws of nature and laws of God’s divine

46:37.181 --> 46:38.181
Power.

46:38.181 --> 46:45.910
You can overcome most of your maladies, most
of your problems and you’ll reside in the

46:45.910 --> 46:47.440
kingdom of God.

46:47.440 --> 46:54.000
Now, there are so many other diseases which
I don’t want to refer now because I have

46:54.000 --> 46:55.680
tell to you the physical side.

46:55.680 --> 46:58.870
And the mental side is the left side as I
told you.

46:58.870 --> 47:04.420
Also, on the left side is another disease,
is multiple sclerosis.

47:04.420 --> 47:07.810
I saw a very good television show the other
day.

47:07.810 --> 47:10.770
It was put up by some doctors.

47:10.770 --> 47:18.760
And they said that in ourselves there is an
area which is built in from our creation,

47:18.760 --> 47:21.330
means the collective subconscious.

47:21.330 --> 47:24.540
That’s what we call it.

47:24.540 --> 47:30.220
And there are proteins which they call protein
58, protein 52 or something like that.

47:30.220 --> 47:35.040
They enter into our being and trigger the
cancer.

47:35.040 --> 47:40.460
So that shows what we have said, that there
are dead within us.

47:40.460 --> 47:46.800
On the left-hand side is the subconscious
and then the collective subconscious.

47:46.800 --> 47:52.420
And when you enter into the collective subconscious,
anyone of this spirits can catch hold of you.

47:52.420 --> 47:57.410
Once they catch hold of you, you are liable
to any of these diseases.

47:57.410 --> 48:02.930
Specially I have seen if there is a possessed
person – of course they become mad, they

48:02.930 --> 48:05.470
get epilepsy, all this are possessed people.

48:05.470 --> 48:10.130
Epilepsy can be cured; we have someone here
who had epilepsy of the worse type.

48:10.130 --> 48:13.320
She is cured completely.

48:13.320 --> 48:17.110
And all such mental troubles, depression,
can be cured.

48:17.110 --> 48:19.010
Not difficult at all.

48:19.010 --> 48:23.650
But one must know, that if you are possessed
you must really work it out and see to it,

48:23.650 --> 48:26.730
that it goes away from you and you become
yourself.

48:26.730 --> 48:29.270
Because when you are the other, you don’t
know what’s happening to you.

48:29.270 --> 48:35.710
Now this affliction when it comes to you,
there is another horrible disease called multiple

48:35.710 --> 48:38.060
sclerosis which comes up.

48:38.060 --> 48:43.950
I have seen so far there three cases in England
of multiple sclerosis which have been cured

48:43.950 --> 48:45.290
by Sahaja Yoga.

48:45.290 --> 48:48.950
All of them had either the wife or the husband
possessed.

48:48.950 --> 48:51.160
Can you imagine?

48:51.160 --> 48:53.360
It’s something surprising.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.130
We do not know these things are so important.

48:56.130 --> 49:02.050
These are very important things and that’s
why all these people come on this earth said,

49:02.050 --> 49:04.820
that you lead a clean life.

49:04.820 --> 49:07.840
And a sensible married life.’

49:07.840 --> 49:14.900
It is not permitted to have an adulteress
life in any religion whatsoever, because adulteress

49:14.900 --> 49:20.950
life brings forth all kinds of problems of
the sex spoiling the last chakra.

49:20.950 --> 49:27.730
People can become impotent or overexcited,
could become suffering from all the troubles

49:27.730 --> 49:32.760
of this centre, which you know are diseases
which are kept as secrets.

49:32.760 --> 49:40.400
So, one has to lead a very clean wonderful
married life, because marriage is supported

49:40.400 --> 49:42.630
and sanctioned by the collective.

49:42.630 --> 49:46.030
It is sanctioned by God almighty.

49:46.030 --> 49:50.280
So, that kind of a life, that kind of a sexual
life, is a sensible one.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.270
One should not get a shock out of it.

49:52.270 --> 49:55.310
When I say this in the west, people really
don’t like it.

49:55.310 --> 49:56.630
But I’m your mother.

49:56.630 --> 49:59.050
I have to tell you the truth.

49:59.050 --> 50:01.660
Even whatever you have done is done – finished,
doesn’t matter.

50:01.660 --> 50:04.430
But now come to your sanity.

50:04.430 --> 50:10.970
Because there are all these horrible satanic
diseases waiting just to gulp you down.

50:10.970 --> 50:14.450
Apart from diseases such a person creates
a problem for children.

50:14.450 --> 50:16.141
He creates a problem for the whole society.

50:16.141 --> 50:17.400
The whole society topples down.

50:17.400 --> 50:24.070
If they do not respect the marriage, if the
woman becomes aggressive and try to sort of

50:24.070 --> 50:27.770
replace men – they cannot do it, they are
woman.

50:27.770 --> 50:29.180
Men are man, woman are woman.

50:29.180 --> 50:31.990
But that doesn’t mean that somebody is going
to suppress.

50:31.990 --> 50:34.310
They are equal, no doubt, but not similar.

50:34.310 --> 50:37.450
This is a simple point we don’t understand.

50:37.450 --> 50:41.369
They woman is to be respected, but she has
to be respectable.

50:41.369 --> 50:47.310
And she has to be respected, because she is
one who is the power behind the man.

50:47.310 --> 50:51.120
If we understand all these simple things of
life, the life becomes very beautiful.

50:51.120 --> 50:53.610
How we have to respect our elders.

50:53.610 --> 50:55.080
How we have to respect everyone.

50:55.080 --> 50:58.100
The respect itself is gone from the modern
times.

50:58.100 --> 51:02.119
People have accepted themselves as something
you see ‘what’s wrong’ business.

51:02.119 --> 51:04.150
There is no respect for anything whatsoever.

51:04.150 --> 51:08.320
I mean the way they bark at each other; one
doesn’t understand how human beings have

51:08.320 --> 51:13.680
become now dogs or what have they become the
way they start barking at each other.

51:13.680 --> 51:20.000
The whole system goes out of gear when we
become too much materialistic also, because

51:20.000 --> 51:26.510
the matter makes us absolutely a dead matter
also.

51:26.510 --> 51:31.460
But I’m not saying that you have to give
up anything.

51:31.460 --> 51:32.480
What do you give up?

51:32.480 --> 51:38.070
You don’t give up anything because if you
have not taken anything into you, if you do

51:38.070 --> 51:41.670
not cling anything to anything, what do you
give up?

51:41.670 --> 51:47.070
Like this people Hare Rama came to Me and
they saw Me in My house and of course I mean,

51:47.070 --> 51:48.280
we live very well.

51:48.280 --> 51:53.250
Perhaps they thought it was too much for a
saint like Me to life in all these luxuries.

51:53.250 --> 51:57.670
And they started saying: ‘Mother, You are
living in this fashion and how people call

51:57.670 --> 51:58.840
You a saint.

51:58.840 --> 52:00.400
I said: All right.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.000
Now, you talk of Lord Krishna, isn’t it?

52:03.000 --> 52:08.410
Now in this house or one My body anywhere
you find anything equal to the dust of the

52:08.410 --> 52:11.820
feed of Lord Krishna, you take it away.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.530
Anything, but must equal!

52:13.530 --> 52:14.820
‘ That’s one thing.

52:14.820 --> 52:17.761
They looked around and they could find anything.

52:17.761 --> 52:19.770
I said: ‘What have you given up?

52:19.770 --> 52:20.780
Stones?

52:20.780 --> 52:21.780
Ashes?

52:21.780 --> 52:23.200
What is there to give up?‘

52:23.200 --> 52:29.510
When you just see the whole thing as a drama,
when you are not clinging on anything, what

52:29.510 --> 52:30.510
is there to give up?

52:30.510 --> 52:32.650
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in false
asceticism at all.

52:32.650 --> 52:37.010
Be believe in the real asceticism which comes
from within.

52:37.010 --> 52:38.760
Where a person gives.

52:38.760 --> 52:42.390
Where a person enjoys matter in giving others.

52:42.390 --> 52:48.110
We don’t believe in this kind of a falsehood
that you wear a certain type of cloth or you

52:48.110 --> 52:53.390
have a nunnery or this judo-sannyasis going
around.

52:53.390 --> 52:54.390
None of these things.

52:54.390 --> 52:57.880
You have to lead a very normal life in the
centre.

52:57.880 --> 53:01.060
All the great saints of India were married
and had children.

53:01.060 --> 53:03.890
Except for some people like Buddha who died
very early.

53:03.890 --> 53:07.080
He had to take a sannyasa because of His work.

53:07.080 --> 53:14.250
Then we had people like also we can say Kabira,
Nanaka – all of them were married people.

53:14.250 --> 53:18.490
And nobody talked of this extreme nature that
you have to give up everyone.

53:18.490 --> 53:19.791
Such people can be very, very dangerous.

53:19.791 --> 53:23.340
They can be very hot tempered.

53:23.340 --> 53:27.040
They can be so hot tempered that you cannot
just face them.

53:27.040 --> 53:32.100
Because marriage makes you very normal to
come in the centre.

53:32.100 --> 53:36.860
In this life, in this married life you are
going to receive the blessings of God.

53:36.860 --> 53:38.760
There is no abnormity needed.

53:38.760 --> 53:44.470
Actually, we become extremely normal when
you get your realization.

53:44.470 --> 53:47.970
Of course, some of these ideas may not appeal
to you.

53:47.970 --> 53:52.690
But you can see for yourself, whatever I say
is true or not?

53:52.690 --> 53:55.110
After Realization, you become a different
person.

53:55.110 --> 53:59.460
Your priorities change, you become such a
beautiful person because you start giving.

53:59.460 --> 54:02.290
The whole thing starts flowing from you.

54:02.290 --> 54:05.940
Because you become the light and the light
starts flowing from you.

54:05.940 --> 54:15.890
And then you understand and assume your powers,
powers of your Spirit and you enjoy this compassionate

54:15.890 --> 54:16.890
flow.

54:16.890 --> 54:21.560
And all the things look very different, the
whole life changes.

54:21.560 --> 54:27.790
This has to happen to the whole world if you
bring peace and sanity, if you have to save

54:27.790 --> 54:30.030
this creation, we have to do this.

54:30.030 --> 54:34.330
Actually, the divine is more anxious than
anybody else to do it because the creation

54:34.330 --> 54:37.040
will be lost if human beings are lost.

54:37.040 --> 54:43.410
So, those who are people who are seeking should
understand their responsibility that they

54:43.410 --> 54:45.810
have to become the spirit.

54:45.810 --> 54:50.700
And after becoming the spirit they have to
manifest the powers of their spirit.

54:50.700 --> 54:53.960
These are their own powers which they manifest.

54:53.960 --> 54:56.690
Only they have to know how to work it out.

54:56.690 --> 54:59.940
It’s very simple as I said.

54:59.940 --> 55:06.080
And to have it is the best way to understand
it.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.790
May God bless you all.

55:08.790 --> 55:14.650
I would like to have some questions from new
people because today is the first lecture

55:14.650 --> 55:15.740
here, but for a short time.

55:15.740 --> 55:17.220
Please ask constructive questions.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.980
Don’t ask offensive questions unnecessarily.

55:19.980 --> 55:25.900
I’m here to do good to you, not to do any
harm to you whatsoever, take it from Me.

55:25.900 --> 55:31.700
So, be kind to Me and ask Me questions which
are good for you and for everybody else, because

55:31.700 --> 55:37.000
they are all just waiting for their Realization
which should not also spoil their chances

55:37.000 --> 55:38.030
and delay the matter.

55:38.030 --> 55:42.910
So, I would request you to ask Me questions
which are sensible related to the subject

55:42.910 --> 55:46.970
and I’ll be very happy to answer them because
certainly when you get your Realization you

55:46.970 --> 55:51.060
will find your mind will peep out: ‘Oh,
you didn’t ask this question to mother.’

55:51.060 --> 55:58.530
I’m sorry I have been speaking now every
day and last month I was too [?].

55:58.530 --> 56:05.520
Everyday there was a speech on, so little
bit there is a strain on My throat, doesn’t

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
matter.

56:06.520 --> 56:10.110
Can I request you to ask Me questions please?

56:10.110 --> 56:14.340
Thank you.

56:14.340 --> 56:22.800
Shri Mataji: Yes, please?

56:22.800 --> 56:30.690
Woman: Can you get rid of epilepsy?

56:30.690 --> 56:33.280
Shri Mataji: What is it?

56:33.280 --> 56:37.410
Sahaja Yogi: Can you get rid of epilepsy?

56:37.410 --> 56:42.630
Shri Mataji: You just come here to tell Me.

56:42.630 --> 56:50.910
Sahaja Yogi: The lady is asking can you get
rid of epilepsy?

56:50.910 --> 56:52.010
Shri Mataji: Yes.

56:52.010 --> 56:53.010
All right.

56:53.010 --> 56:54.010
Yes.

56:54.010 --> 56:55.640
Woman: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: What is it?

56:55.640 --> 56:58.720
I didn’t follow, can you raise your hand,
please, where are you?

56:58.720 --> 57:03.960
Sahaja Yogi: The lady’s question was whether
one can you get rid of epilepsy.

57:03.960 --> 57:08.530
Shri Mataji: Yes, we do, we can.

57:08.530 --> 57:15.070
If you really cooperate with us it will work
out.

57:15.070 --> 57:17.530
It will work out definitely.

57:17.530 --> 57:18.530
But you have to cooperate.

57:18.530 --> 57:24.450
You see, I’m not a doctor which is one who
takes money from you, so you are not bound

57:24.450 --> 57:25.450
to Me.

57:25.450 --> 57:26.450
It’s your freedom.

57:26.450 --> 57:27.540
It’s your freedom!

57:27.540 --> 57:31.920
Whether you want to cooperate or not, but
sometimes people don’t cooperate, then I

57:31.920 --> 57:32.970
can’t help it.

57:32.970 --> 57:38.770
It’s noting great is to be done but few
things that have to be followed if you cooperate

57:38.770 --> 57:44.880
with Me, of course it can be done without
of course any charges, anything, it just works

57:44.880 --> 57:45.880
out.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.880
Yes.

57:46.880 --> 57:53.810
Woman: [wording incomprehensible]
Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

57:53.810 --> 57:57.520
Woman: Will You help me please?

57:57.520 --> 58:00.380
Shri Mataji: Definitely, why not?

58:00.380 --> 58:03.810
I’m here for that, all right.

58:03.810 --> 58:06.090
Make yourself comfortable, yes.

58:06.090 --> 58:10.670
Actually, I’m not helping anyone, I’m
helping myself.

58:10.670 --> 58:17.180
Supposing this finger is paining and if I
rub it, do I help anyone?

58:17.180 --> 58:18.369
Because you are within Me.

58:18.369 --> 58:26.280
When you start everyone – you’re feeling
another person within yourself we really don’t

58:26.280 --> 58:27.280
help anyone.

58:27.280 --> 58:29.200
There is no question of charity.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.390
It’s question of my saving myself.

58:31.390 --> 58:33.060
All right?

58:33.060 --> 58:38.910
Woman: I’d like your help too, please.

58:38.910 --> 58:42.810
Shri Mataji: What is it?

58:42.810 --> 58:46.180
Woman: I’d like your help too.

58:46.180 --> 58:47.460
Shri Mataji: What did she say, Gavin?

58:47.460 --> 58:51.870
Gavin: She say’s also that she would like
to have your help.

58:51.870 --> 58:54.840
Shri Mataji: All of you.

58:54.840 --> 58:59.840
All of you are going to be helped in a way
if you say call it ‘help’, but I don’t

58:59.840 --> 59:01.470
like the word ‘help’ much.

59:01.470 --> 59:02.890
It’s your own.

59:02.890 --> 59:04.310
It’s your own.

59:04.310 --> 59:08.840
Just like if you go to a banker for example.

59:08.840 --> 59:12.770
Then you say: ‘Can I have my check cashed?’

59:12.770 --> 59:13.770
All right?

59:13.770 --> 59:16.550
At the most you’ll say ‘can you help me?’,
because you are very generous, I should say

59:16.550 --> 59:18.390
and sophisticated.

59:18.390 --> 59:20.580
But actually, it’s your bank there and it’s
your money.

59:20.580 --> 59:22.620
You better have it.

59:22.620 --> 59:35.220
Woman: Mother, can you [inaudible]
Shri Mataji: Can you raise your hand I can’t

59:35.220 --> 59:36.550
see which one is speaking?

59:36.550 --> 59:37.650
Yes, my child.

59:37.650 --> 59:40.963
Woman: Mother, … [wording incomprehensible]
Shri Mataji: What she is saying?

59:40.963 --> 59:44.090
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve through
Your lectures?

59:44.090 --> 59:47.530
Shri Mataji: What do you do Myself?

59:47.530 --> 59:49.494
Sahaja Yogi: What do You hope to achieve?

59:49.494 --> 59:50.494
Shri Mataji: Achieve?

59:50.494 --> 59:51.494
I mean, don’t you understand.

59:51.494 --> 59:52.494
[laughing] What am I achieving is that you
all have to become collectively conscious.

59:52.494 --> 59:54.640
That’s what I’m achieving, nothing else.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
As I am.

59:55.640 --> 59:59.260
I will tell you in political terminology,
all right?

59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.350
I have all the powers within Myself, so I’m
a capitalist.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:07.790
But I can’t enjoy it because I have to give
you, so I’m a communist.

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:10.369
And I want you to enjoy your own powers, that’s
all.

01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:12.070
Nothing more than that.

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:13.760
Shri Mataji: Yes please?

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.850
Man: Is it possible to receive help after
a surgery or before.

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:20.130
Shri Mataji: After?

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:21.820
Sahaja Yogi: After surgery.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.730
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, of course.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.690
There is no problem even after surgery.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:35.450
But if you put something artificial there
– sort of a – say a rod or say, steel

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.480
or something, then we can’t move it.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.000
It has to be something living.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.980
We can repair it, regenerate it and we can
give vitality, but to the rod, say, it’s

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.520
of steel, then what can we do?

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.880
But other surgeries we can work out.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.540
Shri Mataji: Yes, please?

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.710
Yes?

01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:57.710
Please ask the question?

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.290
Man: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: What?

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.250
Sahaja Yogi: He also wants the help of Mother.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:05.540
Shri Mataji: All right, for all of you, I’m
there.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.190
You don’t worry, you all are there.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:13.532
I’m going to come down and see all of you,
all right?

01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:17.580
All of you I’m going to see like yesterday,
as we did.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580
Man: Mother.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.530
When You were speaking about Holy Ghost

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:21.530
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.780
Man: You use the word ‘She’ which regard
to that.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:25.780
Shri Mataji: Shri?

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:30.540
Man: She
Shri Mataji: Yes

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:32.560
Man: You said She.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:33.560
Shri Mataji: ‘She’, yes.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.359
‘She’ is the power and She is called as
Shakti.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.200
‘Shakti’ – She is the power.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:45.650
So ‘He’ is the God Almighty and His power
is the ‘She’ – the Holy Ghost.

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.180
Man: The creator’s power?

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:52.010
Shri Mataji: That’s the power of the divine
power of God, His love.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:55.040
Which has got one: is a creative power.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.750
Another is the power of His desire.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.750
First you must have desire.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:05.710
Then he creates, so He has a power of desire
and He has a power of creativity and also,

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:10.250
He has a third power, which is the power which
gives us sustenance.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:17.250
We become say – we have our qualities, like
carbon has four valences and all that.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.640
And then it also gives us evolution.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:25.640
So, this third power is more important, because
that gives us this ascent also.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:32.730
This is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost
which is the power of God Almighty, which

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.930
is the power of His divine love.

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:43.119
Woman: Mother, if some diseases are caused
by our parents, why innocent children get

01:02:43.119 --> 01:02:44.430
leukaemia for example?

01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:49.440
Shri Mataji: Oh, they get it because the mother
is like that.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.180
Mother must be a speedy lady.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.030
You see, if the mother – today only I had
a lady, I must tell you: I saw a lady, she’s

01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:59.570
told Me that: ” My child is overactive,
she is so active that I don’t know how to

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:00.570
control.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:03.920
It’s not a mental case, but it is a funny
situation, that she is overactive “.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.640
So, I said: “What were you doing?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.640
” when she was pregnant.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.680
She was such, she told Me, in the night she
used to work in the factory, the whole day

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.771
she used to work in the house.

01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:13.771
Imagine?

01:03:13.771 --> 01:03:14.771
I mean, you pay no respect to your pregnancy.

01:03:14.771 --> 01:03:15.771
So, what will happen?

01:03:15.771 --> 01:03:20.790
If the mother is so, sort of a speedy person,
the child gets it.

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.070
You see, mother has such an influence on the
child, isn’t it?

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:27.090
The blood of the mother goes into the child.

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.950
And that blood carries the message.

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.369
That’s how the children get it.

01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:33.790
And that’s very difficult to cure also.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:38.430
One has to know also, when you are pregnant,
how to treat your children, how to be looking

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.470
after your foetus.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:40.570
That’s one has to know all these things.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:41.570
These are very important basic things which
we do not know.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:42.570
Shri Mataji: Yes?

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.570
Man: Your power of healing, is it something
that you sought yourself or were you born

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.570
with it?

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.570
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:49.340
Come and tell Me as I just can’t hear.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:04:01.770
Sahaja Yogi: He is asking, is your power of
healing something You sought yourself or which

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:04.820
was born with You?

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:11.700
Shri Mataji [smiling]: It’s all with Me,
all right?

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.810
As you know you are a human being, I knew,
I was this.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:17.020
But about Me I’d better not tell.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.900
It’s better you discover it.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.830
It’s better not to tell about oneself.

01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:24.070
You better discover it.

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.630
Gradually, you will discover about Me.

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:34.450
Shri Mataji: Yes?

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:37.240
Now, say loudly.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.770
Woman: Is it possible to go to classes in
Northampton and ….

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.420
how much is it?

01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.550
[Unsure]
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to know if there are

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.020
classes in Sahaja Yoga in Northampton.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.910
Shri Mataji: You cannot have a course in it,
you see.

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:58.660
It is not courses, but we have centres.

01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:01.050
You have to just go and know about it.

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:06.430
There is no classes, nothing like that, but
you can come to the centre, where they will

01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:11.910
tell you how to use this power, what does
this mean, all the decoding of it, how to

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:13.590
establish your Realization.

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:19.360
We have a centre here in Northampton and I
don’t know when you have it.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.780
I’ll tell- I don’t know.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.690
But we have a centre here, just right here.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:30.410
Can somebody tell when is the program, at
what time?

01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:53.460
Sahaja Yogi: The program in Northampton [Inaudible
conversation]

01:05:53.460 --> 01:06:01.950
Shri Mataji: You can become masters, real
gurus.

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.020
Yes, you can.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:09.810
But I think people must take it more seriously
about the whole thing and should understand

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:13.900
it and learn it, because the main thing is
we do not take any money, you see.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:17.260
So, people think, that you see, you are not
bound.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.350
You are absolutely free to come and to go.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:25.130
But this freedom sometimes makes a person
a little superficial or sometimes a little

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:26.470
frivolous about it.

01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:34.970
But this is so precious, so invaluable, that
you cannot charge any money for this knowledge.

01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:36.390
All right?

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.369
Now, should we have it?

01:06:39.369 --> 01:06:41.720
No questions?

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.070
Man: [Inaudible]

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:55.830
Shri Mataji: Gavin, what did he say, I just
can’t?

01:06:55.830 --> 01:06:57.900
Did you hear?

01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:59.290
Gavin: No…

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:05.370
Shri Mataji: You didn’t hear him: Just stand
up, I think.

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:06.820
You better stand up here.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.150
Gavin, you just stand up.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.150
Just say it loudly, please, if you don’t
mind.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.150
Yes!

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.150
Man: [Inaudible]

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:14.140
Gavin: When you have a pain within yourself
[…] through the mother earth?

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:22.030
[some words incomprehensible].

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:33.630
Shri Mataji: Yes, some things are sucked by
mother earth, as I told you – some.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:39.160
Some are sucked by the flame of the… – can
be the flame, can be the fire.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.640
The sun also sucks in.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.070
Then the sky also sucks in, anything can.

01:07:43.070 --> 01:07:46.550
It depends on, on what centre you have a problem.

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:49.910
All these centres are separately made by different
elements.

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:53.060
It depends on, what problem you have.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.140
All right?

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:59.670
But on the whole mother earth is the most
precious thing.

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:02.040
She helps the maximum on thing.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:06.530
Man: You spoke about living energies and vibrations
and the scientist with us […] not the scientist

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:20.620
he enjoys trying to get the rays within, he
mentions the gravity […].

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:37.469
Because there were people who thoroughly enjoy
… into the rays of gravity.

01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:39.219
I’ve been very … in things like dowsing.

01:08:39.219 --> 01:08:40.219
[some words incomprehensible].

01:08:40.219 --> 01:08:41.219
Shri Mataji: Ah, dowsing.

01:08:41.219 --> 01:08:42.219
Dowsing is…

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:43.219
Man: A force now … bring … together [unclear]

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.219
Shri Mataji: I talked about this yesterday.

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:47.220
Yesterday I talked, but again if you want,
I’ll tell you in short.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:51.150
You see, we have some other dimension which
we are not know, they are unknown to us.

01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:56.040
But they are not divine, like we have the
left side dimensions as I told you, you go

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.580
into the collective subconscious.

01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:02.460
Now if you go into collective subconscious
some of this busy bodies can enter into your

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.460
being.

01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.339
And they are the once who give you this power
of dowsing.

01:09:06.339 --> 01:09:11.569
You see, that’s how you start knowing there
is water, because there are some spirits in

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:12.569
you which can [?

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:13.569
] to it.

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:17.089
You see, there are ESP’s and all this thing
come from the same sources.

01:09:17.089 --> 01:09:22.270
There could be some on the right-hand side,
supra-conscious once, which are very aggressive.

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:23.270
Hitler used them.

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:31.500
He is the one who used this supra-conscious
people, very aggressive people and enticed

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.049
all German people and made them so aggressive.

01:09:35.049 --> 01:09:37.569
So, these two areas are within us.

01:09:37.569 --> 01:09:41.920
In Sanskrit the one on the left is called
‘adi bhautic’ and the right as ‘adi

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920
daivic’ [?].

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.359
Both of these are to be avoided.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.710
For example, somebody sees auras around Me,
for example now.

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.230
I would say he should not.

01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:50.250
It’s not proper.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.830
Because then you are on the right side.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:57.570
But if you see some gods and goddesses around
Me, that also is not good, because you’re

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:00.219
seeing the left side – the past, and the
future.

01:10:00.219 --> 01:10:03.670
What you have to be is in the centre, in the
present.

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:08.710
So, all these things come to you from some
busy bodies as I said, that they enter into

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:09.710
your being.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:15.360
I have seen another television show where
they showed Gogin entering into somebody.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.900
And he was painting just like him.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:22.170
The lines were just like him, bold the same
wave very different styles that he has.

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.610
And he was doing it and he said: ‘I’m
Gogin.’

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:27.110
And this is very common even with curatives.

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.600
When people cured, they use spiritualists.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:32.350
That’s very dangerous.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:37.160
All these are taking you to the realm, which
is not your own.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.190
It is somebody else who acts in you.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:44.560
Even a thing like, say acupuncture can be
very dangerous, because acupuncture uses the

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.440
whatever energy in you of the sympathetic.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:51.050
This is energy I’m talking which is all
the time flowing.

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.960
When you get connected with the mains all
the time it is flowing within you.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.450
That’s the energy we should have.

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:00.090
And the scientists are correct when they say
vibrations.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.360
But they can’t say, why there are vibrations.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.210
This is the point.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:10.730
Not that I’m against science because today
the science is helping us so much.

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:25.460
Man ask about his son, which have skin problems.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:27.100
[analogous]

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:42.900
Shri Mataji: Ah, skin problem.

01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:51.230
All right, there’s nothing, that’s liver.

01:11:51.230 --> 01:12:01.239
Woman: How can I help myself…

01:12:01.239 --> 01:12:16.250
Sahaja Yogi: How can she learn to cure herself.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:28.580
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s what I’m saying
that today if you get Realization well and

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.580
good.

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.469
Otherwise there is a centre, you can come,
by which whatever you have cured yourself,

01:12:31.469 --> 01:12:32.469
but you can cure others also.

01:12:32.469 --> 01:12:33.469
[1:06:59]

01:12:33.469 --> 01:12:34.469
Man: The Self-realization, Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:34.469 --> 01:12:43.880
Is that the answer about our problems?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.520
[… some words unclear]

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.230
Shri Mataji: Hundred percent, to all problems.

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:53.630
You see, because we live in a relative world.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:57.650
We are living relatively and we are confused,
isn’t it?

01:12:57.650 --> 01:13:00.330
But when you find the absolute, all the questions
are solved.

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:05.530
That’s true, because spirit is to be awakened,
that’s the main thing.

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:06.790
Spirit is the solution.

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.750
Firstly, it is the collective being.

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:13.840
Again, it is the source of all vitality.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:16.440
It is the source of all the creativity.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:21.510
It is the source of all the joy and bliss.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:26.661
Once you achieve that being within you, when
that being shines in your attention, you become

01:13:26.661 --> 01:13:31.550
the master of that.

01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:37.840
[1:08:03] Woman: Question incomprehensible.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:48.850
Shri Mataji: Can you say it loudly?

01:13:48.850 --> 01:14:03.900
Man: She says Mother, has the mother nature
provided the answer in terms of herbs to cure

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:04.900
people?

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:10.760
Shri Mataji: We don’t use any herbs or anything.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:16.650
We at the most can sanctify some water or
salt or sugar, these basic things, that’s

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:17.650
all.

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:21.020
We don’t use any herbs or anything, that’s
not needed now anymore.

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:29.330
Woman: Excuse me, do we have to be religious
to… [some words incomprehensible]

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:33.070
Shri Mataji: You don’t have to be religious
at all.

01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:35.310
But religious is different from religion!

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:38.820
Religion is within you, you can’t get rid
of it.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.440
You see, religion is your quality as a human
being.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.239
That’s within you, you can’t get rid of
it.

01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:51.170
If you go against it, whatever is within you,
then there is a problem.

01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.170
Yes, everyone has that, everyone has that!

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:54.360
That’s true and that’s why you get problems.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.870
But religious is a very absurd thing.

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:02.100
Sometimes religious so called people can be
horridly hot tempered, you know.

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:07.310
Could be very bad and could be – I mean,
it has no relationship whit reality sometimes.

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:14.230
So religious is a different thing, but religion
is important.

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:22.530
Religion is universal, which is within you.

01:15:22.530 --> 01:15:27.280
Now, let’s start now.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.030
Woman: Question about diet.

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:35.590
[exact wording unclear]

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:49.820
Man: She says Mother, does the diet which
we … solve her problems?

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:56.870
Shri Mataji: Yes, not the diet want solve
it completely, but when you take to Sahaja

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:58.860
Yoga, supposing you are a liver-patient, all
right.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:04.900
So, we give you some sanctified or vibrated
sugar to eat, white sugar.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:08.900
Now doctors will say: “Don’t eat white
sugar”, but we have cured so many of liver

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:09.900
troubles.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:14.730
All have migraines and this and that and so
many troubles of the allergies are to be cured.

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:18.330
Now for that of course we say, for about a
month, you just don’t eat some fats.

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.350
You see, that’s all right.

01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:24.340
But that by eating, you see, you paying so
much attention ‘eat this, eat that!

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.020
That food, that food!’

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:27.020
That’s not needed.

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.570
It’s too much attention diverted to food.

01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:30.730
But you should know basics.

01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:33.420
But if this is the problem with you then what
you should eat.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.130
That’s all, it’s not such a emphasis on
diet that you eat this.

01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:43.020
Only by dieting you maybe, all right, at the
most physically, but you are not only a physical

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:44.050
being.

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.150
You are also an emotional being.

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:49.380
If you pay too much attention to your physical
side, you can become a dry personality.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.380
Absolutely.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:56.300
There could be divorces in the families and
such a person who just is nothing but a physical,

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.300
imagine.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:04.300
It can be very dangerous and can be a very,
very angry person who has just physical thing.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:10.520
And such a person gets heart – heart trouble,
because the spirit resides in your heart and

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.230
if you are too much physical, then the heart
goes out, because you must pay attention to

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.230
your spirit.

01:17:16.230 --> 01:18:17.300
So, you are not only a physical being, you
are a mental being, you

01:18:17.300 --> 01:19:44.090
are an emotional being
and you

01:19:44.090 --> 01:20:03.290
are

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:14.110
a spiritual being.

01:20:14.110 --> 01:22:32.900
All

01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:44.590
this

01:22:44.590 --> 01:23:32.100
must

01:23:32.100 --> 01:31:17.860
be integrated and there should be

01:31:17.860 --> 01:37:00.610
a complete balance.
