1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,056
Today is the great day,

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:11,587
when a great son of the Goddess was born,

3
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:15,589
at least it is celebrated today.

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,482
And you are all assembled here

5
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:28,517
to celebrate the birthday of Christ.

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:38,263
You already know how He came on this earth,

7
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:42,668
and what was His great work.

8
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:47,661
But we must see to the subtle side
of Christ.

9
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:51,247
What was His power?

10
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:57,438
Christ’s power was, of course, Omkara.

11
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:02,369
His power was Pranava.

12
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,769
But the essence of Christ

13
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:17,849
was tapasya, tapasvita.

14
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:24,805
He is the incarnation of tapasya,

15
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:36,961
and in that incarnation is a sinless
personality.

16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,608
He's sinless.

17
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:53,225
Of course incarnations never commit sins.

18
00:01:54,067 --> 00:02:01,445
But apparently things that look like sins

19
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,440
are also not in His life story.

20
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:11,382
Like one can say that Shri Rama gave up
His wife, so it is a sinful thing.

21
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,368
Of course those who understand
the subtleties of Shri Rama's life

22
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,992
will know that it's stupid to say such
a thing.

23
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:21,647
Or Shri Krishna's life, they might say
He married so many women.

24
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:28,429
But in Christ's life you do not find
anything

25
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,688
that could be pointed out as a mistake,

26
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,360
even a slightest mistake.

27
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:43,135
It's a very straightforward life,
absolutely pure life

28
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:53,632
and doing no commitments of ambiguous
nature.

29
00:02:56,566 --> 00:03:01,210
But it's very surprising that Christianity

30
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:06,179
is just the opposite of what Christ
wanted it to be.

31
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,151
They painted Him so differently,

32
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:15,289
brought Him out so differently
and made a mess of His life.

33
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,263
Terrible mess I must say,

34
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:26,053
because He was the person who tried to keep

35
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:31,875
to the maryadas of the dharma
to the maximum.

36
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:40,969
And while the Christians stretched their
imagination to such an extent

37
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:48,557
that their sinful life is shocking,

38
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:54,799
the kind of sins they commit is extremely
shocking.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,320
For example, He said in a very subtle way,

40
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:05,113
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

41
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:09,931
Even in Sahaja Yoga I find people still
have this problem.

42
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:13,689
What a sinful thing to do to Christ.

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:22,291
For Christians to have such eyes which
are adulterous,

44
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:29,080
and they are the people who have
the maximum number of this sin.

45
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:34,296
Not only that, but they generate it, they
give it to others.

46
00:04:34,497 --> 00:04:39,644
Those who go to them, they develop it.

47
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:46,610
Those who meet them, they take it up
as something very great and elite.

48
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:50,875
It's such an infectious horrible stuff,

49
00:04:51,076 --> 00:04:58,718
and even after coming to Sahaja Yoga
if you do not understand,

50
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,257
I cannot say what one can achieve in life.

51
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:09,010
Because He's the gate. You may cross
over all your chakras,

52
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,631
but if you are closed at that chakra
you cannot get out.

53
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:19,390
The kind of sinful life people are leading
in the western country

54
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:26,319
has to be absolutely condemned and has
to be thrown out of it,

55
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,172
and nobody should explain it.

56
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:34,811
Nobody should say that it is something,
is just a sin,

57
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:41,341
and all right, Mother will forgive, all
this kind of a nonsense.

58
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:48,110
Is the greatest wrong you are doing
to yourself and to Christ.

59
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:55,159
The abandonment of your character,

60
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,092
which was just the opposite of the golden
character of Christ.

61
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:10,284
He burnt Himself like chandan, sandalwood.

62
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:17,929
Like gold He came out of that fire of hell

63
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,718
to burn away all that is sinful.

64
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,781
So the first attention of anybody who
wants to cross the Agnya

65
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:34,059
has to be a sinless life,

66
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,104
and that is what one has to realize

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,424
that how, in the West, they have become
all anti-Christ.

68
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:52,420
On this day of His birth, one has to say

69
00:06:52,621 --> 00:07:00,820
 that a great life, a great personality,

70
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:06,297
was not only wasted, but perverted,
misused.

71
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:12,254
Just can't believe, how can you use
the life of Christ

72
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:17,299
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things?

73
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:28,971
We have one instance where Christ
converted water into wine.

74
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:36,382
I can do it also - very easy. The wine
is not the alcohol.

75
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:43,723
Alcohol is the rotten wine. You have
to rot it for days together

76
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:47,637
and the more rotten it is, the more
old it is,

77
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:51,795
then it is regarded as something
very expensive.

78
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:55,851
The whole idea is so ridiculous,
I tell you,

79
00:07:56,052 --> 00:08:02,738
so repulsive, absolutely below

80
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:06,705
the dignity of human level to bring down
Christ

81
00:08:06,906 --> 00:08:12,619
into all these social lives that you are
leading there.

82
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:19,002
For you it is important now, all the Sahaja
Yogis from the West,

83
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:25,412
to stand up and make your life pure,

84
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:30,947
make yourself pure, and hate all

85
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:34,994
that is created in the name
of Christianity.

86
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,892
Actually, thank God, they have found out
now

87
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:43,396
the book written by Thomas who has
described

88
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:46,514
the Gnostic way of life, where "gna"
means "to know".

89
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:51,266
In Sanskrit language, "gn" means "to know",
"gnya".

90
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,960
So he has described very nicely
the gnostic light.

91
00:08:55,161 --> 00:09:02,397
This Gnostic Bible, or whatever you may
call it,

92
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:09,840
says about a personal experience
of achieving

93
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:14,059
God realization, Self-realization.

94
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,627
It talks about Sahaj Yog out and out.

95
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:23,657
Thomas on his way to India, went to Egypt

96
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:31,719
and there he has put this in a big vessel
of some metal.

97
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:36,145
Thank God it was done in Egypt,

98
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:39,425
otherwise in any other place

99
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:44,676
they would have used it for some other
purpose,

100
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,980
and already it would have been a perverted
thing.

101
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:54,179
It's important, and very important for all
of us

102
00:09:55,749 --> 00:09:59,747
to understand that the first and foremost
thing for us

103
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,861
is to purify our attention.

104
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,519
And for that Tukarama has said,

105
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:13,446
"Thank God, if I become blind is better."

106
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:24,809
He was born in a very humble place

107
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,744
because He was a tapasvi.

108
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:32,992
For a tapasvi it doesn't matter where
you are,

109
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:40,332
whether you are in a humble place or
you are in an elaborate place.

110
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,200
It doesn't matter where you are born
in a very humble way.

111
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:57,120
And this humility of His is never, never
expressed in the western lives.

112
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:10,069
On the contrary, I find they despise people
who are humble,

113
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,656
the humble abodes are despised.

114
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:22,799
Now it is for you people to bring back
the glory of Christ,

115
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,271
to bring back the dharma of Christ,

116
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:33,167
to reflect the great image of Christ.

117
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:38,005
When people say that you had no ideals,
I'm amazed.

118
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:46,490
Who could be a better ideal than Jesus
Christ?

119
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:49,650
Can't think of anybody better,

120
00:11:49,851 --> 00:11:57,437
but nobody tries to follow Him, only try
to use Him for wrong purposes.

121
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,484
Christmas means they are all must be drunk
already everywhere,

122
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:09,856
already drunk, and maybe they might have
had all kinds of programs

123
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,687
to show that they are absolutely insulting
Christ.

124
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:17,987
So today we have to pray for them,

125
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,734
that may God give them some sense,

126
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,091
not to do these things in the name
of Christ.

127
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,663
They can do in the name of Satan
is all right,

128
00:12:26,864 --> 00:12:32,838
but in the name of Christ to do all these
things is extremely wrong.

129
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:39,705
So coming to His Mother,

130
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,838
She was the power behind it.

131
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,229
And in India still all those people who
believe in Christ

132
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,093
do respect Her as something like a Goddess.

133
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:58,255
But other Indians, who are not Christians,

134
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:05,986
really think Her to be Goddess, and they
visit Her temples all over.

135
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:10,870
She was Mahalakshmi. And She was
Mahalakshmi,

136
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:16,511
which shows that people who follow
the Mahalakshmi principle

137
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:23,040
are beyond the material understanding
of life,

138
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:25,405
beyond the Lakshmi principle.

139
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:28,644
On the contrary, what we find,

140
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:35,919
they are extremely conscious about
the material wealth.

141
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,004
You should see how it shows so clearly.

142
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:43,649
Anything that they will buy, they would
like to buy something that can sell.

143
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,789
It must have a guarantee.

144
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,352
Even if they want to have anything

145
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:57,754
like a small little spoon, they would like
to see a brand behind it.

146
00:13:59,058 --> 00:14:02,338
All the time they are thinking what can
they sell

147
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:07,088
and what can they buy to sell it.

148
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:12,344
The attention doesn't go beyond that.
Moreover,

149
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:22,090
they are very much impressed by people who
wear something rather expensive or unique.

150
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:27,073
One day I was wearing a ring, I think,
it's an old ring of mine.

151
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:29,192
For me it was nothing, I mean I just
thought

152
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:32,944
it's an old ring and was matching with
the sari, so I wore it.

153
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,428
Everybody started saying Me, "Madam,
Madam, Madam."

154
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:37,332
I said, "What has happened?"

155
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:41,114
Started looking, I'm wearing a simple sari,
what is it?

156
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:45,057
Then one lady asked Me, "Is that
a real ring?"

157
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:49,424
I said, "Yes, yes, yes, so?"
"Oh Madam, Madam, Madam!"

158
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,823
I was amazed. Otherwise, I had no value,

159
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:56,267
except for that ring, for which I had
no value at all.

160
00:14:56,474 --> 00:15:00,193
I just wore it by chance. It's an old ring
from My family.

161
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,735
All right, it might be real. So what?

162
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:08,685
Immediately you become "madam" if you
wear a ring.

163
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,889
It's very surprising. But in this country

164
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:19,164
if you are going in a big car, people
don't like you much.

165
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:22,375
If you are going in a big car, and you
want to buy some vegetables,

166
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:27,060
they will say, "Oh, how much black-market
money have you got?"

167
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:31,868
Not much respect for people who have money.

168
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,606
Of course, you are expected to dress up

169
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:38,518
according to your status in life. But
that's all.

170
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,830
Those who wear do not have
the consciousness,

171
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:45,349
and those who see them do not have
the consciousness.

172
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:51,323
It is something very surprising, that where
you are supposed

173
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:54,689
to be worshipping the Mahalakshmi
principle,

174
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:00,564
people just get absolutely blown off

175
00:16:00,765 --> 00:16:04,989
if they see something extraordinary.

176
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,980
I have seen people, I mean very, supposed
to be,

177
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:16,258
you can say high class ambassadors
and all that.

178
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,710
If they come to My house. they would
like to turn

179
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:27,112
the plate to see from where it comes,

180
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:31,908
or they would like to, even to see
the spoon from where it comes.

181
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,101
It's very surprising.

182
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:39,503
Actually, we do not know in this country
what comes from where, what is the mark.

183
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,253
We don't have any marks, nothing
of the kind.

184
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:47,281
And we are existing alright, nothing
wrong with us.

185
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,739
This kind of mental attitude towards life

186
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,084
and the mental projections towards life

187
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:03,273
makes you absolutely gross,

188
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:07,755
while Christ was the subtle, complete
subtle.

189
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:12,824
It was nothing but subtlety itself
personified.

190
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:20,006
He was so subtle, He was such a sukshma
that He walked on the water.

191
00:17:20,968 --> 00:17:27,807
He was nothing but pranava, just
vibrations.

192
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,759
He walked on the water.

193
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,069
There was no jada tattwa in Him.

194
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,539
There was no gross principle in Him,

195
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:46,362
and while the people who follow Him are
following nothing but the jada tattwa.

196
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:50,495
I have to now request you all today

197
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:54,826
to understand that when we are celebrating
the birthday of Christ,

198
00:17:55,027 --> 00:18:01,065
we have to imbibe His qualities, His
subtleties, His greatness.

199
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:05,833
Also, I would request Indians, because they
are also becoming westernized now,

200
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:09,384
thinking that western people are
the wisest.

201
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,071
They have to understand

202
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:17,876
also that we should try to be subtler and
subtler, and not gross,

203
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:22,948
and this is what is important in Sahaja
Yoga culture.

204
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,707
In Sahaja Yoga culture, our attention is
on the subtle things.

205
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:32,616
On the beautiful varieties of subtleties.

206
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:38,931
To see all the sweetness and the goodness,

207
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:52,346
all the artistic, aesthetic projections
of human mind.

208
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:56,305
Not the gross, not the grotesque.

209
00:18:56,506 --> 00:19:00,023
It's going to be a new culture for us.

210
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,243
We have started the dharma, all right.

211
00:19:02,444 --> 00:19:04,849
But every dharma has to have a culture

212
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:14,200
and we are the culture of sukshma,
of the subtler life.

213
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:17,973
That doesn't mean we should be untidy

214
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:21,971
or any way funny type, funny looking
people.

215
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:28,898
Subtler people are the most beautiful,
are the most congenial,

216
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:39,504
are the most idealistic, and are the most
honorable like Christ.

217
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:43,063
So for us the ideal is Christ.

218
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:47,043
Of course, I don't expect you to crucify
yourself.

219
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:52,476
But always willing to sacrifice,

220
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:59,632
coping with all the discomforts and
problems

221
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:06,165
and not talking about yourself, not
worrying about yourself,

222
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:11,592
not discussing other and judging others,

223
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:16,945
but giving assurances to people,

224
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:24,905
that now we are at this level, we'll be
at a higher level,

225
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:29,248
and all the world has to come up
to that level.

226
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:33,760
Very positive talking, very positive
thinking

227
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:38,980
and very positive doing is the way you
can really follow Christ.

228
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:48,806
Whatever He had to do, He did it with
such grace and beauty.

229
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:54,869
That is what it is. So we have to be born
like Christ today.

230
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:01,921
You are all born like Christ because you
are born without the Father,

231
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:07,240
by the Holy Ghost, just like Christ was
born.

232
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:11,567
But look at Him and look at yourself,

233
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:15,791
born the same way as He was born.

234
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:22,871
So you must respect yourself as He
respected Himself.

235
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:29,139
And the way He worked out His resurrection.

236
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,809
In the same way, you all have to work out
your resurrection,

237
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,368
and that is very important.

238
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,845
Today you have to just ask just one thing
from Me, that

239
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:42,089
"Oh, Mother, today we ask you to give us

240
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:49,628
that power of penance, of tapasya
of Christ."

241
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:54,807
I wish this would be granted today and
you will become tapasvis.

242
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:58,803
May God bless you all.

243
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:32,796
Happy Christmas to you.
Yogis: Happy Christmas, Shri Mataji.

244
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:35,344
Shri Mataji: Today you have sucked
My vibrations alright.

245
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:37,491
May God bless you all.

246
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,687
May God bless you all.
