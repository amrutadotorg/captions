00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.646
It's a great thing today that we are
celebrating

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:45.956
the Virgin’s worship in England.

00:05:52.888 --> 00:05:57.933
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:58.676 --> 00:06:05.346
England is the heart where resides
the Spirit of Shiva.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:17.244
And that Virgin should be respected and
revered and worshipped in England

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:27.517
is a great honor, I think, for all
the Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:47.266
Now one has to think why such an importance
is paid to a Virgin?

00:06:49.718 --> 00:07:00.813
Why a Virgin is respected to that extent?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.199
What are the powers of a Virgin?

00:07:12.724 --> 00:07:16.474
That She can bear a child

00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:25.827
of that magnitude that was Christ,

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:36.785
that She could create Shri Ganesha
out of Her own body,

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:50.961
that She could protect innocent, dynamic
force of Her children

00:07:52.197 --> 00:07:57.729
who are egoless, who have not known
what is ego.

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:18.349
So this great power and force resides

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:32.444
in a person who has lots of “guru punyas”
[guru virtues],

00:08:32.653 --> 00:08:37.296
who has done lots of good things
in previous lives,

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:51.425
who has always understood

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:59.954
that Virginity is a power higher than
any other power

00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:14.225
and would save the Virginity and Chastity
with all Her effort and care.

00:09:21.717 --> 00:09:28.327
As you know that within our body She is
placed as Kundalini,

00:09:30.964 --> 00:09:34.224
means She is the Virgin.

00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:38.954
She is untouched,

00:09:39.155 --> 00:09:49.518
the desire to become Spirit is without
any blemish, “nirmala”.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.366
There is no blemish.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.887
Its waiting is pure.

00:10:06.354 --> 00:10:15.028
There is no other desire but to be one
with the Divine.

00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:21.297
All other desires are finished.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:37.117
It's a very difficult subject for Me
to talk about in the Western country.

00:10:37.324 --> 00:10:44.099
It's embarrassing. I do not want any one
of you, whether men or women,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:49.948
to develop any guilt in your mind.

00:10:51.657 --> 00:10:54.310
Because that is one thing is the greatest
blemish as you know,

00:10:54.511 --> 00:11:03.348
at a later stage this guilt works
in the opposite direction.

00:11:03.906 --> 00:11:06.757
It is of no help.

00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:17.595
But when we understand that we have
these problems,

00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:23.331
we have to be humble about it. Not guilty
but humble.

00:11:28.174 --> 00:11:40.930
If you are not humble about it, and
aggressive about demanding

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:47.272
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga
and complaining about it all the time,

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:55.657
while not seeing what are your own punyas,
what do you deserve?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:05.008
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish,
has been raised.

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:10.675
You know that. You are blessed.

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:16.763
So instead of complaining or being
aggressive,

00:12:16.964 --> 00:12:21.703
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’
to you.

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:32.341
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven
completely,

00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:41.312
that this great blessing has been bestowed
upon you.

00:12:41.513 --> 00:12:48.900
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

00:12:52.554 --> 00:13:00.944
Not to feel guilty about it but to be
humble, to be thankful.

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:09.762
That despite what we have done, played
with ourselves completely,

00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:24.589
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

00:13:26.226 --> 00:13:30.316
The Somarasa, which is the

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:42.691
charna amruta is the water that washes
the Mother,

00:13:42.892 --> 00:13:48.716
only you are allowed to drink it,
only the Devas.

00:13:49.173 --> 00:13:55.675
You are sitting in that category, and how
can you be demanding?

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.085
You have to humble yourself.

00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:05.304
By seeing your past, whatever mistakes
we have committed.

00:14:05.505 --> 00:14:11.621
I am with you in this. Not to feel guilty.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.325
It's very embarrassing as I said to you,

00:14:18.904 --> 00:14:25.032
but please try to face yourself. We have
to face ourselves as we are.

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:34.126
The advantage of the Indians is that
the Kundalini exists there.

00:14:34.327 --> 00:14:42.152
So whatever Indians may do, they are always
aware it is wrong.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.516
For them virtue is virtue, whether they
are not virtuous.

00:14:48.717 --> 00:14:51.077
Righteousness is righteousness, whether
they are not.

00:14:51.278 --> 00:14:54.136
They know, all the time they are aware
of it: “We are doing wrong.”

00:14:54.337 --> 00:15:01.952
They do not say: “What's wrong?”
Nor do they propound things

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.364
which are obviously wrong and against
the virginity, against the sublimity,

00:15:06.565 --> 00:15:14.377
against the divinity. Satanic things,
they never proclaim that this is God.

00:15:14.578 --> 00:15:18.232
They are hypocritical, alright; but they
are aware all the time

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.823
that these things are wrong.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.147
The whole society is like that.

00:15:34.324 --> 00:15:38.816
Because Kundalini stays there.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:45.467
When we lose our innocence and our
virginity, first thing happens to us

00:15:45.697 --> 00:15:59.345
is that we become ego-oriented, and we
start thinking “What's wrong?”

00:16:01.733 --> 00:16:09.404
Your Shakti is your Kundalini and She
is Virginity.

00:16:11.784 --> 00:16:19.844
She is your power. She is your strength.

00:16:23.158 --> 00:16:27.626
Your innocence is your strength, the day
you lost it

00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:36.321
that is the day we have committed
the original sin.

00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:45.427
So for us it is important that we have
to be very humble about it,

00:16:47.761 --> 00:16:51.487
and that we have to achieve something.

00:16:53.744 --> 00:16:56.168
What?

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:04.559
Not the kingdoms and some sort
of a luxurious life,

00:17:07.886 --> 00:17:15.189
but a seat in this holy land of Shiva.

00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:23.598
Shiva is forgiveness. He forgives everyone.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:27.188
Even the rakshasas can be forgiven,

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:31.802
but can they be given Realization?

00:17:38.244 --> 00:17:40.831
Even the pishachas can be forgiven,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.356
but can they be given Realization?
Forgiven is different point.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:53.569
One aspect is forgiveness, so that they
can remain for a longer period,

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:58.600
they may live longer, because of Shiva's
forgiveness. So what?

00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:01.713
But what a wretched life!

00:18:06.712 --> 00:18:12.987
And the people who are not innocent
can never be joy-giving.

00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:18.398
They are themselves miserable creatures
and make everyone miserable.

00:18:27.727 --> 00:18:39.345
The arrogance is not a child-like quality.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.744
We have to be like children.

00:18:49.935 --> 00:18:54.657
And even when you were not you were given
Realization alright.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:05.580
But now you are sitting with the Devas,
even higher than them.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:15.083
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:23.313
It is simplicity. Not cleverness,
arrogance,

00:19:28.456 --> 00:19:37.171
putting others down, showing-off,
but a complete surrender,

00:19:40.299 --> 00:19:44.589
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:51.256
Let the virginity be reborn within you.

00:19:52.774 --> 00:20:02.569
From today you all have to take a vow,
is the New Year's Day for us -

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:15.255
that we all will surrender our horrible
tempers,

00:20:15.456 --> 00:20:20.791
dominating natures, asserting behaviors,

00:20:25.085 --> 00:20:37.640
ego-oriented harshness, domination.

00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:42.243
I don't know what use it has.

00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:48.108
Unless and until you surrender that,

00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:59.619
The Lord of virginity, Shri Ganesha,
will not be able to

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.408
crown your Agnya Chakra.

00:21:20.428 --> 00:21:28.995
Whatever we have done so far should just
give us this:

00:21:30.571 --> 00:21:36.646
if our past could give us the idea

00:21:36.847 --> 00:21:46.491
as to how humble we have to be with each
other, with all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:50.737 --> 00:22:01.468
how kind we have to be, how loving,
how universal.

00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:14.461
Virgin cannot accept ideas which are not
universal, She cannot!

00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:24.046
That's a sign of a Virgin because She is
universal by nature.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.550
All fanaticism, all racialism, casteism,

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:38.128
all these things which artificially
separates man from man,

00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:41.303
woman from woman, nation from nation,

00:22:41.504 --> 00:22:46.537
will all finish off, as soon as you become
innocent.

00:22:48.598 --> 00:22:52.988
But you can't become by brain-washing,
you cannot.

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:58.490
By Kundalini Awakening, of course, you can.

00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:05.576
But to maintain it, your progress should be
inward

00:23:06.925 --> 00:23:13.285
and not outward, to seek your roots.

00:23:13.486 --> 00:23:22.272
She is the "moola". She is the roots
of your being.

00:23:22.473 --> 00:23:26.165
She manifests all your roots.

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:30.855
So your attention should be towards
your roots

00:23:31.056 --> 00:23:35.509
and not towards your shoots, you have
been that.

00:23:35.974 --> 00:23:42.151
Face yourself, and develop your roots now.

00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:48.864
All the Western society is without
the roots, we can see that.

00:23:49.332 --> 00:23:53.799
We have lost our roots; let's face it
as Western people,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.420
as I am also with you today.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.553
We have to find our roots.

00:24:03.754 --> 00:24:08.279
You see, in a tree which does not have
roots,

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.542
it dries out, it doesn't give any shade,

00:24:13.743 --> 00:24:21.357
afterwards it becomes a dry horrible
dying tree.

00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:26.036
When it dies, it falls upon someone.

00:24:27.043 --> 00:24:32.804
It grows thorns, all dried things grow
thorns.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:39.599
It's like a desert, where only thorns
can grow.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:53.462
When the whole society becomes so stupid
as to hate each other, materialistic,

00:24:54.352 --> 00:25:03.758
then roses are not going to grow there,
lotuses are not going to grow there,

00:25:06.082 --> 00:25:10.672
while you are the lotuses of this country.

00:25:10.878 --> 00:25:16.585
You are born in the mud alright, but now
come back to yourself.

00:25:16.786 --> 00:25:28.904
You were beautiful.  You are like lotuses,
fell into this mud, became the mud,

00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:33.589
out of which you came out because
of your true nature.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:40.218
Then you have become now lotuses,
but there is no fragrance.

00:25:41.967 --> 00:25:46.216
Lotus without a fragrance, one can't
understand.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:50.863
Lotus has to have a fragrance.

00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:58.101
The fragrance that will overcome the filth
of this mud.

00:25:58.847 --> 00:26:01.519
You have to grow much more than Indians
can grow.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.360
On the contrary, the arrogance of people,
I am amazed.

00:26:05.561 --> 00:26:08.250
They start complaining about this,
complaining about that,

00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:11.657
complaining about another thing.

00:26:12.836 --> 00:26:17.869
What do they think of themselves?
Who are you?

00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:29.832
Because the roots are not developed.
Once you'll develop your roots,

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:35.183
immediately the humility will start coming
into your temperament.

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:45.152
There is artificial humility, not from
the heart.

00:26:45.611 --> 00:26:52.939
It will only come when you become virgins,
you become innocent.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:58.217
Innocence only doesn't mean morality,
doesn't mean only that.

00:26:58.418 --> 00:27:04.025
Many people think that if you are a moral
person - No.

00:27:04.659 --> 00:27:09.091
It also means non-materialistic attitude.

00:27:13.933 --> 00:27:19.450
For people, carpet is more important
than their children.

00:27:21.412 --> 00:27:24.829
Morning till evening they will be saying
harsh things

00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:31.875
just to save few nonsensical things which
are going to be left here permanently.

00:27:33.902 --> 00:27:43.284
Materialism is the hit, it's the one that
hits you, your innocence.

00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:55.842
If materialism means to make things
to give others happiness,

00:27:56.043 --> 00:28:05.646
to present others, as a cup that carries
the nectar,

00:28:05.847 --> 00:28:15.919
if materialism is that cup which gives
the nectar of love, then it's all right.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:19.695
But you don't eat the cup, do you?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:29.482
To Me, materialism sounds like people
eating the cup, and not the nectar!

00:28:29.683 --> 00:28:33.589
Is cup more important, or the nectar?

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:39.403
Supposing there is a golden cup and
a poison is placed inside that,

00:28:39.604 --> 00:28:41.904
will you take it because it is in golden
cup?

00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:47.131
If you take it, of course, I will have more
value for gold.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:54.393
Will anybody knowingly take a poison
in a golden cup because it is in gold?

00:28:55.604 --> 00:28:59.928
No common sense! There is no common
sense at all!

00:29:00.129 --> 00:29:09.875
That material things cannot give you
happiness is the basic factor of economics.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:18.835
In My own lifetime I have seen, that
anything material

00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:25.356
gives you greatest happiness when you
can give it to someone.

00:29:29.628 --> 00:29:41.703
I have seen that way, always. I enjoy
the giving more than taking.

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:50.550
I mean you try, sometimes, to give away
something, and see how happy you feel.

00:29:50.751 --> 00:29:55.439
Of course, it should not be done because
you want to get rid of it!

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:02.444
Actually it is done for that only, perhaps.

00:30:02.645 --> 00:30:08.579
Because whatever you possess is a headache
in anyway - even the subtlest form.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:16.394
Any possession is like getting possessed.
It's slavery.

00:30:18.114 --> 00:30:21.534
It hinders your freedom to grow.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.625
But it goes hand in hand. You know,
people ask Me,

00:30:26.826 --> 00:30:32.329
“How it is these people, who are
so affluent are so miserly?

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.839
Why are they so miserly?” People can't
understand, you know.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.266
For one 'p' if it is dearer, the whole
England will be ablaze, you see.

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:47.300
All the time what you hear is nothing -
that so much percentage of rise

00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:51.698
in this thing and that, and they are going
for a strike for this.

00:30:51.899 --> 00:30:56.626
I can't understand, how do you keep account
of all that?

00:30:57.894 --> 00:31:01.761
If somebody asks Me what is the price
of the sugar here and there,

00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:06.782
I wouldn't know, but I would just know that
it is cheaper than the other place.

00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:09.773
Because I am innocent.

00:31:10.881 --> 00:31:14.278
I'll get things absolutely cheapest always,
I have seen that.

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:20.779
I always get things cheapest because
I am so innocent.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:28.650
My innocence takes Me to places where
it is cheapest and I get the maximum joy,

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:36.965
because I can give it. I know how
to give it.

00:31:39.286 --> 00:31:44.851
That's how I would say, because of the real
force of your Spirit which is virginity,

00:31:45.052 --> 00:31:48.239
you have lost your, lost the sense
of joy also.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.439
You are joy killers, morning till evening
you are killing each other’s joy -

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.584
to say harsh things, you see, from
this tongue.

00:31:56.931 --> 00:32:01.106
I was folding My hands before you because
I knew it would little bit upset you,

00:32:01.307 --> 00:32:05.585
so I was just keeping it there, that your
mind should not be disturbed so much.

00:32:05.786 --> 00:32:10.780
In My palms, you see, very carefully I was
catching your heart

00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:14.732
to keep it there, so that you should not
feel hurt.

00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:20.475
Because it was not harsh, but it was truth
which was harsh.

00:32:21.698 --> 00:32:26.845
But still, in My Palms I was holding it,
carefully,

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:31.746
so that you should not feel hurt about it.

00:32:33.714 --> 00:32:38.178
So to hurt anyone, just open your tongue
and hurt anyone,

00:32:38.379 --> 00:32:44.211
one doesn't understand how many ripples
of hatred you are creating within yourself.

00:32:44.528 --> 00:32:48.962
Twenty-four hours are not sufficient for Me
to love people.

00:32:50.757 --> 00:32:53.608
Now, I will be sixty years of age,

00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:56.479
I don't think I have done justification
to these sixty years

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.965
because I have not been able to love people
as much as I wanted to.

00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:04.610
The flow is so great that I, My body
suffers with that flow and sometimes

00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:10.213
I curse Myself that, “Why should I carry
such a load of love within Myself?”

00:33:10.414 --> 00:33:16.804
And little excitement with the puja also.
You know what happens to Me, I shudder.

00:33:17.005 --> 00:33:21.905
Sometimes, you are calling Me for puja,
now what will happen?

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.419
Then somebody can ask a question sometimes,

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:39.149
“Mother, did we not suck Your vibrations?”
Is obvious, but I don't want to say that.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:43.463
Because if I say that, your Vishuddhi
will be caught up.

00:33:43.664 --> 00:33:47.939
Again you will suck less.

00:33:51.103 --> 00:34:00.408
It's a very delicate work I have to do.
You are already wounded people,

00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:04.841
because you have wounded yourself.
Nobody has done this harm to you,

00:34:05.042 --> 00:34:09.466
you people have nicely wounded yourself,
very nicely.

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:14.338
Every way possible you have tried to hurt
yourself.

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:16.796
Now because of the hurt, the guilt is
built-in

00:34:16.997 --> 00:34:21.956
and you are hurting others. It is as simple
as that.

00:34:22.157 --> 00:34:27.539
So don't hurt yourself, there is no need
to hurt yourself.

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.432
But remember that we have no business
to be harsh to anyone.

00:34:32.633 --> 00:34:41.223
We have to be sweet people. We have
to be kind people.

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.789
There are also psychologists who have come
forward to give you explanation

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.970
for your harshness, that,  “Your will-power
should be strong.

00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:52.493
If you don't talk like that others will
take advantage.”

00:34:52.694 --> 00:34:58.227
Who can take advantage of the western
people?

00:34:59.353 --> 00:35:02.944
It is absurd, absolutely absurd!

00:35:03.145 --> 00:35:06.796
The ones who have done injustice all over
the world should say such a thing,

00:35:06.997 --> 00:35:12.514
it's absurd, I cannot understand how can
they give an explanation like that!

00:35:18.336 --> 00:35:22.255
But now the time has come.

00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:30.737
You are the people who are going to change
the mind of God

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.251
with your good behavior.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:41.308
The wrathful God, you are going to please
Him.

00:35:41.509 --> 00:35:47.516
You are going to represent that area
which sucks in the compassion of God.

00:35:47.717 --> 00:35:52.420
Ask for His compassion! Do you deserve it?

00:35:53.095 --> 00:35:54.947
If you don't deserve it,

00:35:55.148 --> 00:36:00.980
who is going to deserve it in this western
world - you tell Me - today?

00:36:02.649 --> 00:36:09.317
You are the ones chosen for this, specially
prepared for this, to create an area

00:36:09.518 --> 00:36:20.807
so that the deity of compassion should be
awakened, for the rest of them.

00:36:23.216 --> 00:36:27.779
The arrogance, you have seen in the spread
of Sahaja Yoga, what happened:

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:32.098
we had a program where we had, say,
a thousand people.

00:36:32.299 --> 00:36:38.660
For the next follow up there are only
three. It's typical.

00:36:42.229 --> 00:36:49.902
I have spent most of My precious time
in this country, and in the West.

00:36:52.233 --> 00:37:00.341
Despite that, the arrogance sometimes
baffles Me.

00:37:01.015 --> 00:37:05.419
Arrogance among each other, even towards
Me sometimes they are so arrogant,

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:10.421
I cannot think of anyone being that
arrogant to Me, as the way they are.

00:37:10.622 --> 00:37:13.513
The way they talk to Me, the way they
behave towards Me,

00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:17.224
I just can't understand how can they be
like that.

00:37:23.247 --> 00:37:30.354
It can be anyway, anywhere, anytime,
especially women.

00:37:30.555 --> 00:37:34.195
I was amazed, I went to Belgium,
and I found

00:37:34.396 --> 00:37:38.800
that Belgian housewives were even worse
than Indian… than British housewives.

00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:45.124
Ah! Terrific, terrific women! Ah!
Just horrible!

00:37:45.325 --> 00:37:49.660
Absolutely. You just don't know how to deal
with them, it's terrific!

00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:53.160
They control the whole household into
their hands, I don't know how.

00:37:53.361 --> 00:37:57.950
Only, I don't know how they do it.
There's no ... (interruption in recording).

00:37:59.077 --> 00:38:02.784
So ego-oriented, I am amazed!

00:38:02.985 --> 00:38:09.533
But if you go to America, American women
are baba, they are Amazonic!

00:38:10.282 --> 00:38:17.073
Horrible! You just can't understand,
there's no love, no affection, nothing.

00:38:17.288 --> 00:38:20.983
Showing off, all the time talking about
their material things,

00:38:21.184 --> 00:38:25.050
absolutely dry sticks, I tell you. And they
want Realization,

00:38:25.258 --> 00:38:30.692
and they want to be great, and this and
that. I don't know. What are they?

00:38:35.027 --> 00:38:38.938
Today it's especially the day of virginity.

00:38:40.196 --> 00:38:52.663
I have really great hopes from the women
of this country, especially.

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:56.362
Here the men don't talk at all, you see,
the pattern was worst in Belgium,

00:38:56.563 --> 00:39:02.548
no man would talk a word. They cannot talk,
just poor things are just shut.

00:39:02.749 --> 00:39:06.571
They don't talk, strangled, completely
strangled by women,

00:39:06.772 --> 00:39:13.593
believe Me. Horrible! What is going
to happen to that country, you see,

00:39:13.799 --> 00:39:21.554
where men can't talk and women talk?
It's horrifying, let us face it up.

00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:24.083
What have they achieved, the women there?

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:28.168
At least, in India, our Prime Minister
is a woman.

00:39:28.369 --> 00:39:33.060
What are they? Good for nothing, useless,
just washing utensils in the house

00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:37.019
and showing off. I just don't understand.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.384
What sacrifices they can go up to?

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:43.438
The woman is known by the amount
of sacrifices she makes.

00:39:43.639 --> 00:39:48.615
It's a challenge, I tell you, for all
of you women who are Realized Souls

00:39:48.816 --> 00:39:53.927
to see to it, that you humble down
yourself.

00:39:54.128 --> 00:39:56.943
Your quality cannot improve unless and
until you humble down.

00:39:57.175 --> 00:40:01.230
On everything you assert. For what?

00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:14.307
It's impossible to worship Virgin when we
are so arrogant and so strangling type.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:22.722
The Virgin is a simple woman. She is
extremely simple.

00:40:23.398 --> 00:40:31.878
She does not understand what are your plans
and what is so important, everything.

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:34.592
Her importance is Her virginity,
that She knows,

00:40:34.793 --> 00:40:38.132
and She will not allow anybody
to touch [it?].

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.824
That's Her property, that's Her wealth,
that's Her greatness.

00:40:51.872 --> 00:40:58.226
And She's humble because She is not afraid
of anyone. She is not aggressive.

00:40:59.939 --> 00:41:05.416
But She doesn't allow anybody to aggress;
nobody dare aggress a real Virgin.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.456
A new page has been turned now,
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:21.243 --> 00:41:25.185
I must warn you all about it.

00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:29.949
Don't take liberties too much with
Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:30.825 --> 00:41:36.252
You are not obliging anyone else but
yourself, be careful.

00:41:38.182 --> 00:41:42.297
Take up My warnings always seriously.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.756
You all have to come up very well now.

00:41:51.265 --> 00:41:55.734
It is not only doing My puja is going
to help you, I can tell you this much.

00:41:55.935 --> 00:41:59.702
Now you better worship yourself.

00:41:59.903 --> 00:42:05.656
You have to worship all your Gods
within you. Cleanse them.

00:42:06.426 --> 00:42:12.493
First is the God and the Goddess
of humility,

00:42:12.694 --> 00:42:16.835
of innocence, of simplicity.

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:25.780
Worship that.

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.078
Unless and until you can worship that,

00:42:31.427 --> 00:42:35.055
you cannot go further, you will not be
protected.

00:42:35.256 --> 00:42:40.703
Again I say that a new page has been
turned.

00:42:40.904 --> 00:42:44.663
Don't take liberties with Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:44.864 --> 00:42:52.181
It has bestowed all the blessings upon you.
You have seen the light of the day.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.241
But be prepared for the night.

00:42:59.424 --> 00:43:07.737
Nobody should try to take liberties.
Try to improve yourself.

00:43:10.685 --> 00:43:14.037
No more complaints.

00:43:15.563 --> 00:43:20.672
If you can't live in an Ashram like that,
you better get out of it.

00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:28.431
It's not for your convenience. Nobody is
in need of you. Take it from Me.

00:43:28.632 --> 00:43:33.535
Nobody is in need of you, you have to be
in need of your Self.

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:37.803
If you are seekers, if you want to find
your roots,

00:43:38.004 --> 00:43:41.655
everything is available for you.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:52.992
But you have to be humble, to go down
to the roots, not with arrogance.

00:43:54.812 --> 00:43:59.322
We must understand why we are not
progressing.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:17.644
Actually arrogance comes to people who
lack Self-confidence.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:26.757
Self-confidence is shattered to people
whose Self is not manifesting.

00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:30.801
Let your Self manifest.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:35.656
When the Self is not manifesting, you get
all kinds of problems,

00:44:35.857 --> 00:44:40.804
and then you complain. Actually the problem
resides within you.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.414
It is God who has to complain.

00:44:48.594 --> 00:44:53.306
Think of it. The One who has created
this universe,

00:44:53.507 --> 00:44:58.900
the One who has created you all with
such love and affection,

00:44:59.101 --> 00:45:03.185
the One who has given you everything
under the sun,

00:45:03.386 --> 00:45:08.505
also the One who has given you Realization,
given you light;

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:18.765
everything that is possible and you are
complaining against Him?

00:45:23.498 --> 00:45:28.483
You should not. Complain about yourself,

00:45:28.706 --> 00:45:35.114
that,  “I am not alright, I should be
alright.”

00:45:35.315 --> 00:45:39.144
Complain about it, face yourself.

00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:44.732
Like children, when they face the mirror,
they say,

00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:48.339
“Tthis is somebody else.” But we believe.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.800
They never identify themselves with
their own images that they see.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.654
They are identified with the image
that they 'are'.

00:45:58.855 --> 00:46:02.863
They don't create artificial images
or don't dwell with the images

00:46:03.064 --> 00:46:11.034
which are making them feel ego-oriented.

00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:18.831
They live with reality as it is. We are
made like that.

00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:30.619
You see a camera, if it takes some
photograph under a light

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:40.565
which is not, maybe, some other color,
the photograph could be different.

00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:47.693
Supposing, I am wearing a red thing and
supposing, you put a light that is blue,

00:46:47.894 --> 00:46:51.339
this might start looking green.

00:46:52.421 --> 00:46:57.251
But human eyes will see always the same
thing.

00:46:58.556 --> 00:47:02.985
It won't see something unreal. Camera can
do all that.

00:47:03.186 --> 00:47:07.518
Camera can remove somebody's head
and put somebody's head there.

00:47:07.719 --> 00:47:12.292
All these tricks are possible with camera
but not with human eyes.

00:47:12.493 --> 00:47:14.477
Whatever you see is the thing that.

00:47:14.678 --> 00:47:17.217
Of course, [if] you are drunk, then
[it's] different.

00:47:17.418 --> 00:47:21.078
I mean, I am not... I am saying of normal
conditions, you see.

00:47:21.286 --> 00:47:26.702
In normal condition, you see what exactly
exists.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:34.824
But if you are ego-oriented, you will never
see yourself what exists.

00:47:35.025 --> 00:47:39.788
You will see some sort of a bloated, you
see, you will think yourself to the,

00:47:40.018 --> 00:47:44.191
be the King of God's Heavens, you see.

00:47:44.392 --> 00:47:48.771
You can see, if you want to;
is imagination.

00:47:48.972 --> 00:47:53.160
If you put your imagination like that,
you can see yourself as anything!

00:47:53.361 --> 00:47:56.508
Which is false, is absolute false!

00:47:56.709 --> 00:48:07.609
You are your Self and you must see yourself
as your Self, as your Spirit.

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:18.256
And Spirit is the universal being, is
the innocence, is the Virgin within you.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:24.003
Respect it, respect that part of yours
which is the Virgin - still exists -

00:48:24.204 --> 00:48:28.635
because if it was not there, I could never
have given you Realization.

00:48:28.836 --> 00:48:33.124
Despite every attack, it existed there,
be sure on that point.

00:48:33.325 --> 00:48:38.419
If it had not existed, you could not have
got your Realization.

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.394
So many of them, they are very proud,

00:48:40.578 --> 00:48:44.745
“Oh! I don't feel anything, Mother,
you know, it's nothing.”

00:48:45.191 --> 00:48:49.313
Then there is to be, more to be ashamed!

00:48:51.622 --> 00:48:55.190
Or at least you feel that you are missing
something, isn't it?

00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:57.475
At least, you should feel that you are
missing,

00:48:57.676 --> 00:49:00.884
if something is not alright and you should
be alright.

00:49:01.085 --> 00:49:03.590
At least think like that, “I should be
alright, I am not alright.”

00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:09.558
On the contrary, “No, no, I didn't feel.
Oh, what, I didn't feel, I should feel.”

00:49:13.815 --> 00:49:24.581
So the wisdom. Wisdom is the part
that is innocence. It's complete wisdom.

00:49:26.235 --> 00:49:31.148
You find this among the villagers
or very simple people.

00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:35.727
They are not cunning in any way. You try
to befool them and you will be amazed,

00:49:35.928 --> 00:49:39.989
at the end of it you will find, “I'm such
a big mad fat fool myself.”

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.682
Try that with some rustic people, who are
very simple, matter of fact,

00:49:43.883 --> 00:49:46.059
who live with the Mother soil.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:51.284
You will find that all those so-called
intellectuals,

00:49:52.443 --> 00:49:56.410
if they try to befool a simple man
like that,

00:49:56.611 --> 00:50:04.215
after half-an-hour, this educated and very
M.A.D., Ph. D. style

00:50:04.416 --> 00:50:12.823
will find that he is 'the biggest fool
ever born.'

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:26.519
There is a saying in Sanskrit, which is
very common: “Vidya vinaye na shobhate.”

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:33.921
That is Vidya, even the knowledge,
is decorated.

00:50:34.122 --> 00:50:37.679
Shobhate means gets its decorations or...

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.515
What is shobha? Sahaja Yogi: Glory.
Shri Mataji: Beautified.

00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:45.252
Sahaja Yogi: Beauty.Yes. Shri Mataji:
...is beautified only through humility.

00:50:50.519 --> 00:50:55.437
If there is an educated man, he has to be
a humble person.

00:50:55.638 --> 00:51:01.573
If he is not a humble person, then he is
not educated at all, in any way.

00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:05.978
I don't know if I have told you a story

00:51:06.179 --> 00:51:19.022
about one saint was meditating and
was blind.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:28.988
And a king came there and asked him,
“Did you see some people around?”

00:51:29.189 --> 00:51:35.235
He said, “Yes. Yes, king, my king.
Sit down.

00:51:35.436 --> 00:51:41.907
I saw your servant coming, and then
your minister came in,

00:51:42.108 --> 00:51:47.502
and then the Prime minister came in, and
then now you have come”.

00:51:48.745 --> 00:51:52.186
He said, “You are blind, how did you know?

00:51:52.387 --> 00:51:55.878
Through your meditation?”
He said, “No. Common sense”.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:52:04.660
He said, “What is the common sense?”
He said, “The first, the servant came in.

00:52:04.861 --> 00:52:11.854
He said, “What, you are bogus fellow
sitting down here, wasting your time?”

00:52:12.235 --> 00:52:16.328
He gave me two-three abuses, used
bad language,

00:52:16.529 --> 00:52:24.287
and said, “Have you seen any person here?”
So I said, “No.”

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:34.370
Then the minister came in. He didn't
abuse me, but he just asked me.

00:52:35.324 --> 00:52:39.017
Then the Prime minister came.

00:52:39.218 --> 00:52:45.556
He said, “Sir” to me.” - Must have been
from England.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.177
And might have said also “Thank you”,
perhaps -

00:53:01.953 --> 00:53:07.374
“And then came the king.” And he
(the saint) said that,

00:53:07.575 --> 00:53:11.898
“You were extremely humble. You first
touched my feet,

00:53:12.099 --> 00:53:23.675
you sat down on the Mother Earth,
waited for me to ask you,

00:53:24.053 --> 00:53:30.540
“What do you want?” And in a very humble
way you said,

00:53:31.089 --> 00:53:38.398
“If you have heard of people around you” -

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:48.684
because I am blind, so you didn't say
something that would hurt me,

00:53:48.885 --> 00:53:52.852
in such a humble way - if I could tell you.

00:53:53.053 --> 00:54:00.347
But at least hundred and eight names of the
Guru you took, before you asked me this.

00:54:00.548 --> 00:54:08.292
So I know you are the learned, you are
the humblest, and so you must be the king.”

00:54:08.493 --> 00:54:14.857
Otherwise, in those days, we at least never
had kings or Prime ministers

00:54:15.698 --> 00:54:21.698
who were box-office actors.

00:54:29.394 --> 00:54:37.091
Even the public was so innocent that they
would not accept such nonsense, you see.

00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:40.652
So this was the difference.

00:54:40.853 --> 00:54:53.578
From this story we have to derive that
the more we are learned into Vidya,

00:54:53.779 --> 00:55:02.249
into the technique of Sahaja Yoga,
we have to be humble.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:09.689
That is our decoration, that is our
certificate,

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:19.254
that is the path into the entrance
of every human being,

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:29.439
that is the way we are going to be very
close to the other seekers.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:36.716
To be humble, to find out ways and methods
of being humble.

00:55:40.707 --> 00:55:54.221
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya,
how to be humble.

00:55:56.622 --> 00:56:05.036
By humility you will not ever say, “This is
my bathroom,

00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:09.888
or this is my fruit, or this is my food,

00:56:10.089 --> 00:56:15.703
or this is my table, and this is my glass”.

00:56:18.384 --> 00:56:27.968
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

00:56:30.533 --> 00:56:35.950
everything that is there. I mean, for Me,
sometimes I have to eat with bhoots,

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.124
and sometimes I have to eat bhoots.

00:56:40.698 --> 00:56:48.943
Not only eat with them, but also eat them -
it's the worst part.

00:56:54.227 --> 00:57:01.038
So, you also should not mind if there are
people with bhoots.

00:57:01.239 --> 00:57:08.400
If they are arrogant, try to give them
bandhans

00:57:08.601 --> 00:57:12.659
try to control them through all these
methods.

00:57:12.860 --> 00:57:16.997
But if you think by arguing with them
you will be able to manage them,

00:57:17.174 --> 00:57:26.658
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala
Vidya, and that is humility,

00:57:27.556 --> 00:57:33.185
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

00:57:33.386 --> 00:57:36.321
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath
covering it,

00:57:36.522 --> 00:57:41.902
in the same way is the humility,
is the myelin sheath.

00:57:42.103 --> 00:57:48.681
If you are humble, you will win the battle,
if you are not, we'll be lost.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:56.130
Then the whole thing will become a joke
for you, absolute joke.

00:57:56.331 --> 00:58:02.584
If you are humble, you can see the stupid,
the bhoots

00:58:02.785 --> 00:58:09.926
and all the arrogant as clowns
of this drama.

00:58:10.966 --> 00:58:19.205
Try to be humble with your Self, and
with Me. With Me is very important.

00:58:19.406 --> 00:58:24.125
You must understand that it is one
of the conditions

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:31.748
that Christ has put on you, so be careful.
Dealing with Me,

00:58:31.949 --> 00:58:38.450
I don't want you to be in any way rude
to Me, because I can't help it there.

00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:42.681
Till you are humble with Me, everything
is in My charge.

00:58:42.882 --> 00:58:49.087
But as soon as you are rude to Me,
somebody else and so many of them,

00:58:49.297 --> 00:58:55.179
thousands of them take charge, and then
don't blame Me for that,

00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:02.291
because you are My protégés, you are
under My protection.

00:59:02.492 --> 00:59:06.798
Supposing you try to make holes
in your roof,

00:59:06.999 --> 00:59:11.767
and then say that the rain is coming in.
What can you do about it?

00:59:11.968 --> 00:59:15.128
I mean, the hole... you have already made
the holes in your roof.

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:20.439
The roof that was to protect you, you have
made holes, now the rain has to come in.

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:25.087
Then if you want that the roof still
should protect you from the rain,

00:59:25.288 --> 00:59:32.907
then I must say you lack intelligence.
That's what it is.

00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:37.869
So this is the another warning.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:45.904
It's very embarrassing, but again today
is the day of embarrassment as it is.

00:59:46.105 --> 00:59:50.606
Because the Virgin is in embarrassed
condition always,

00:59:50.807 --> 00:59:55.089
She is a bashful personality. She has
to be bashful, you see.

00:59:55.290 --> 01:00:02.392
She is embarrassed to say things which
She does not want to say.

01:00:02.593 --> 01:00:05.225
Of course, that's a very sweet thing,

01:00:05.426 --> 01:00:10.392
even there She is bashful, to say harsh
thing is a horrible stuff.

01:00:10.593 --> 01:00:20.533
So let us worship our virginity within
ourselves. Let us rise up to that point

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:32.022
to mount that diamond of brilliance
of our virginity,

01:00:33.175 --> 01:00:38.313
in the setting of our humility.

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:48.876
You can be angry with others, not with
Sahaja Yogis, not with Me.

01:00:49.363 --> 01:00:55.175
Even with others, when it is absolutely
required.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.252
But if you fight among yourselves, and tell
people about Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:04.396
nobody is going to believe you.

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:10.428
And that is why today is the day

01:01:10.629 --> 01:01:20.263
when the Virgin Gauri sat down to worship
Shiva.

01:01:21.186 --> 01:01:27.635
She made a Shiva Linga and was sitting
and putting Her sindur on that,

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:34.115
“That you look after this, which is
the mark of My union with You.

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:40.312
I leave it to You to look after, to Shiva.
You look after this.

01:01:40.513 --> 01:01:46.455
I surrender to You.” For this, that’s how
the Gauri,

01:01:46.656 --> 01:01:52.009
your Kundalini, surrenders to the Spirit.
“Now you look after this connection.

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:57.239
I forget everything else. I leave it into
Your hands. Lift me up.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:03.036
You raise me up. I forget all that was
me before.

01:02:03.237 --> 01:02:07.028
Everything I have dropped out. No other
desire.

01:02:07.229 --> 01:02:12.297
But just lift me higher and higher.
Make me Yourself.

01:02:12.498 --> 01:02:17.403
The rest of it is not important. All other
manifestations of these desires are over.

01:02:17.604 --> 01:02:21.583
Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You,
my Spirit.

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:26.862
Lift me higher and higher. Higher
and higher,

01:02:27.063 --> 01:02:34.528
away from all the things that were not
the Spirit.

01:02:36.047 --> 01:02:42.228
Make me complete Spirit, full Spirit.”

01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:46.351
Forget all that was there.

01:02:46.914 --> 01:02:55.368
That elevation, that ascent

01:02:55.927 --> 01:03:07.442
becomes a fast, quick trip, a very fast
ascent.

01:03:07.643 --> 01:03:14.170
Just you can do it if you try at this
moment and every moment

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:20.474
to give up all that was not the Spirit.

01:03:20.675 --> 01:03:24.672
Anything that goes against the Spirit
must be given up.

01:03:24.873 --> 01:03:28.981
And that is what is the pure desire,

01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:33.129
that's what it is the Kundalini,
is the Virgin.

01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:37.393
Is to be absolutely one with the Spirit.

01:03:37.594 --> 01:03:47.603
All the rest has no meaning, has no value.

01:03:50.492 --> 01:03:55.374
This ascent - whatever may be
your position,

01:03:55.575 --> 01:03:59.232
to whomsoever you may be married,
wherever you are working,

01:03:59.433 --> 01:04:03.081
whatever is your situation, whatever
may be your country,

01:04:03.282 --> 01:04:10.661
you are the Spirit. And if you are
raised aloft,

01:04:10.862 --> 01:04:22.798
you will dwell in the beautiful kingdom
of God, where all ugliness drops out.

01:04:22.999 --> 01:04:31.186
Like when the lotus opens out, all the mud
drops out, completely.

01:04:31.387 --> 01:04:36.768
In the same way, let My children become
the fragrant,

01:04:36.969 --> 01:04:41.333
beautiful offerings of Sadashiva.

01:04:41.534 --> 01:04:44.637
May God bless you.
