1
03:18:10,183 --> 03:18:20,473
It is very difficult to describe this inner
joy.

2
03:18:20,682 --> 03:18:25,028
You can only enjoy it, you can only
feel it.

3
03:18:25,229 --> 03:18:36,964
It's something so innate to see that
so many of you

4
03:18:37,165 --> 03:18:41,405
have learnt this difficult music

5
03:18:41,606 --> 03:18:46,076
and all of you have been enjoying it.

6
03:18:48,787 --> 03:18:56,830
I went to various places in the West
and I felt that,

7
03:18:57,032 --> 03:19:01,719
“Why even small little children,

8
03:19:01,920 --> 03:19:08,254
boys and girls, take to something which is
self-destructive? Why?

9
03:19:08,455 --> 03:19:10,746
Why do they take to drugs? Why do they take

10
03:19:10,947 --> 03:19:14,770
Why do they take to all these things which
are self-destructive?”

11
03:19:14,972 --> 03:19:18,651
I mean, you could blame the parents
to some extent

12
03:19:18,852 --> 03:19:24,034
but on the whole, there was something
within them which was troubling them,

13
03:19:24,235 --> 03:19:29,857
which was trying to say that, “That's
not true.

14
03:19:30,058 --> 03:19:33,618
That's not the thing, that's not the thing
that you want.”

15
03:19:33,819 --> 03:19:41,079
And that's what made them go into all kinds
of various types of rebellion, I should say,

16
03:19:41,281 --> 03:19:44,731
against all the accepted truths

17
03:19:44,932 --> 03:19:49,829
or accepted goodness or value system.

18
03:19:50,158 --> 03:19:53,431
And I just thought that, of course,
in India

19
03:19:53,631 --> 03:19:56,365
the parents are rather strict, I must say
'right',

20
03:19:56,566 --> 03:19:58,966
 but there's one more thing in India:

21
03:19:59,167 --> 03:20:02,543
there's a big outlet for them

22
03:20:02,745 --> 03:20:08,780
and I found that outlet was the talent
that they had.

23
03:20:08,981 --> 03:20:12,273
They had lots of talents, all of them,
I felt

24
03:20:12,474 --> 03:20:14,502
when I talked to them and this and that.

25
03:20:14,703 --> 03:20:20,373
I felt that they have lots of talent but
there is no way to express it.

26
03:20:20,574 --> 03:20:31,681
Certain people have been doing some sort
of an haphazard expression, I should say,

27
03:20:32,181 --> 03:20:38,749
and they could not understand themselves
why they were doing it.

28
03:20:38,950 --> 03:20:43,580
And this was the main thing that was
lacking, I think, in the West

29
03:20:43,781 --> 03:20:48,701
that the children had no way of expressing
themselves,

30
03:20:48,902 --> 03:20:51,376
of expressing their talent.

31
03:20:51,577 --> 03:20:55,430
And this talent was making them mad,
I think,

32
03:20:55,631 --> 03:21:01,978
that was making them absolutely rebellious.

33
03:21:02,179 --> 03:21:04,448
It was not their mistake by any chance,

34
03:21:04,649 --> 03:21:11,670
It was an energy within which was bubbling
and had no outlet.

35
03:21:13,233 --> 03:21:20,370
And whatever outlet they had was not
recognized, was not appreciated.

36
03:21:21,196 --> 03:21:26,044
And this made me feel that if these
children are given

37
03:21:26,245 --> 03:21:30,523
an outlet, a means of expressing
themselves,

38
03:21:30,724 --> 03:21:32,858
I am sure they’ll take to it.

39
03:21:33,083 --> 03:21:34,726
They'll forget all these things,

40
03:21:34,927 --> 03:21:41,106
they'll never take to all self-destructive
ideas

41
03:21:41,307 --> 03:21:44,689
because they were angry with them, I think.

42
03:21:44,890 --> 03:21:52,062
And it worked; it worked in the sense that
first I wanted

43
03:21:52,263 --> 03:21:58,183
Yogi (Mahajan) to start a school for small
children.

44
03:21:58,384 --> 03:22:02,616
And I was surprised how these children took

45
03:22:02,817 --> 03:22:06,778
to another kind of lifestyle, very
disciplined style

46
03:22:06,979 --> 03:22:12,861
and... they were very different children.

47
03:22:13,062 --> 03:22:19,201
Like in the West I found a child, supposing
you take him to the shop,

48
03:22:19,402 --> 03:22:23,987
he'll make you mad because he will say,
“Buy me this and buy me that and...”,

49
03:22:24,188 --> 03:22:28,665
not understanding that one cannot
afford it.

50
03:22:28,866 --> 03:22:37,006
And left to himself, I would say, that he
would go on buying the whole of the market.

51
03:22:37,207 --> 03:22:40,559
He was so mad about it.

52
03:22:40,783 --> 03:22:44,002
But I thought that there was some sort
of a thing

53
03:22:44,203 --> 03:22:47,936
that's lacking in him, in satisfaction.

54
03:22:48,143 --> 03:22:56,163
On the contrary, in India if you take one
boy or a girl to the market,

55
03:22:56,365 --> 03:22:58,425
they'll say, “Bas, bas - only one,

56
03:22:58,626 --> 03:23:01,795
one will do.” Big, very big problem.

57
03:23:01,996 --> 03:23:06,483
I had my own granddaughters, I took them
once to Delhi

58
03:23:06,684 --> 03:23:09,665
because they had broken their chappals
[slippers], you know,

59
03:23:09,866 --> 03:23:13,665
and they had only one pair. The parents
have else to do, no problem,

60
03:23:13,866 --> 03:23:17,614
but one chappal of that was broken, I said,
“All right, you come along.

61
03:23:17,815 --> 03:23:21,819
Now in Delhi you can get good ones,
we'll buy from them.”

62
03:23:22,021 --> 03:23:25,682
So they came and I bought for them.

63
03:23:25,884 --> 03:23:29,731
They said, “Nani, at any cost we'll not
take the second one.

64
03:23:29,932 --> 03:23:32,816
We'll just take one.”

65
03:23:33,017 --> 03:23:37,103
But I said, “Supposing this breaks. Then
what will happen?

66
03:23:37,304 --> 03:23:41,047
Then you will come back again to Delhi
to buy chappals?

67
03:23:41,248 --> 03:23:43,335
Have one spare at least.”

68
03:23:43,536 --> 03:23:48,494
They wouldn't listen and they ran away
into the car.

69
03:23:48,697 --> 03:23:52,757
I went there, I said, “What are you doing?
Why don't you buy chappals for yourselves?”

70
03:23:52,958 --> 03:23:55,994
“Why do you want to waste your money, Nani?

71
03:23:56,194 --> 03:24:00,181
You can use it for something else.”

72
03:24:00,383 --> 03:24:04,895
Now, I was surprised the way they were
so satisfied.

73
03:24:05,096 --> 03:24:07,061
Of course, they are born realized,
no doubt,

74
03:24:07,262 --> 03:24:11,115
but also the whole atmosphere.

75
03:24:11,513 --> 03:24:17,113
I felt that this atmosphere if the children
from the West can get,

76
03:24:17,314 --> 03:24:24,424
they will definitely prosper, they'll
definitely express themselves

77
03:24:24,625 --> 03:24:28,406
and they'll become excellent people.

78
03:24:28,607 --> 03:24:31,575
But I didn't know their energy was
so much, you see.

79
03:24:31,776 --> 03:24:38,502
After, my brother - your Babamama -
I asked him,

80
03:24:38,704 --> 03:24:41,714
“Why not start an Academy of music?”

81
03:24:41,876 --> 03:24:45,322
And when they came to music, I was
surprised.

82
03:24:45,523 --> 03:24:51,746
I was really surprised when we had not
expected anything from them,

83
03:24:51,947 --> 03:24:54,757
within three months, within four months,

84
03:24:54,958 --> 03:25:00,070
they picked up such a difficult music
style.

85
03:25:00,271 --> 03:25:06,764
It's impossible, it's impossible for
Indians to do that.

86
03:25:07,073 --> 03:25:10,161
They can never do [it] in four, four
months’ time.

87
03:25:10,362 --> 03:25:15,291
Oh baba, I've seen in my own family, there
were musicians

88
03:25:15,492 --> 03:25:20,731
and my sisters, my brothers, for hours
together...

89
03:25:20,932 --> 03:25:28,259
Every morning they used to get up at about
five o'clock and start their music.

90
03:25:29,221 --> 03:25:34,690
Every day rehearse for three, four hours,
every day.

91
03:25:34,891 --> 03:25:36,704
And I used to think, “Now, when will this
end?”

92
03:25:36,904 --> 03:25:41,913
I mean, after all, if somebody has to sleep
after 5:00, you can't, just can't sleep.

93
03:25:42,114 --> 03:25:46,557
But that's a custom in India to get up very
early in the morning.

94
03:25:46,758 --> 03:25:52,457
But the way these people are learning it
so fast, it is

95
03:25:52,658 --> 03:25:58,538
because that urge to express themselves
was inside very, very strong,

96
03:25:58,739 --> 03:26:03,490
much stronger than Indians. Just imagine!

97
03:26:03,691 --> 03:26:08,245
I can tell you very clearly, I have never
heard of anybody

98
03:26:08,446 --> 03:26:14,646
learning this difficult music in three
months and four months.

99
03:26:14,847 --> 03:26:18,557
For years together they would not learn.

100
03:26:18,758 --> 03:26:23,975
Same about you people: How you have
started appreciating it,

101
03:26:24,152 --> 03:26:27,252
I just don't know.

102
03:26:28,003 --> 03:26:32,671
I mean, it's a different atmosphere that
has started,

103
03:26:32,872 --> 03:26:38,504
so full of hope and joy.

104
03:26:38,706 --> 03:26:43,441
You see now, there was one fellow who
went to Belgium.

105
03:26:43,642 --> 03:26:48,510
He was an Italian, Italian Sahaja Yogi.

106
03:26:48,711 --> 03:26:50,652
He said, “Mother, I was surprised.

107
03:26:50,853 --> 03:26:54,119
There was a nice program with the Indians,

108
03:26:54,320 --> 03:26:58,781
and the Indian Consulate had arranged,
so I went to the program.

109
03:26:58,982 --> 03:27:03,106
And they were talking to each other and
some of them went out,

110
03:27:03,307 --> 03:27:06,809
some of them came in, these Indians.

111
03:27:07,010 --> 03:27:09,529
They never understood that it was Pilu rag,

112
03:27:09,729 --> 03:27:12,304
that one they couldn't recognize.

113
03:27:12,506 --> 03:27:16,491
Even an ordinary Pilu rag they cannot
recognize.”

114
03:27:16,693 --> 03:27:20,297
I was surprised that this Italian,
that he...

115
03:27:20,498 --> 03:27:24,094
What he's saying is really, I've seen it.

116
03:27:24,295 --> 03:27:32,580
The Indians when they go for this kind
of a very deep type of music,

117
03:27:32,781 --> 03:27:37,915
after 15 minutes they start slipping out.

118
03:27:39,401 --> 03:27:44,349
Also they told me that in England they went

119
03:27:44,550 --> 03:27:50,504
to a music centre or we can say for
the buying of the records or something.

120
03:27:50,705 --> 03:27:56,436
So, all the boys who were there, who were
Indians,

121
03:27:56,637 --> 03:28:01,561
were buying pop music, that music.

122
03:28:01,762 --> 03:28:05,466
And they looked at these Sahaja Yogis,
they said, “Are you stupid fools?

123
03:28:05,667 --> 03:28:10,655
Why are you buying this music, this Indian
music?

124
03:28:10,856 --> 03:28:12,961
What is there in this Indian music?”

125
03:28:13,162 --> 03:28:18,278
They said, “It's better not to talk to you
because you are gone cases.”

126
03:28:18,479 --> 03:28:22,386
Now, you see because, somehow or other,

127
03:28:22,587 --> 03:28:25,648
this is a Sahaj trick I think,

128
03:28:25,849 --> 03:28:27,941
that your energy's tuned up

129
03:28:28,142 --> 03:28:33,048
to a very subtle and deep understanding
of music.

130
03:28:33,249 --> 03:28:36,401
Otherwise, it would never have worked
like this.

131
03:28:36,602 --> 03:28:39,976
I mean, is the Kundalini, of course,
no doubt.

132
03:28:40,177 --> 03:28:47,533
But the way she has nourished you
to absorb, to understand, to enjoy.

133
03:28:47,734 --> 03:28:51,658
This is very subtle music.

134
03:28:52,508 --> 03:28:55,505
And it has happened more with the Western
people

135
03:28:55,705 --> 03:29:00,312
than with the Indians, I'm sorry to say.

136
03:29:00,513 --> 03:29:06,766
But Indians don't have that much of
understanding, nor that much of enjoyment.

137
03:29:06,967 --> 03:29:14,126
Westerners may not, may not understand
but they enjoy.

138
03:29:14,564 --> 03:29:21,142
Indians will, those who are, I mean,
a little bit educated in music,

139
03:29:21,343 --> 03:29:25,306
will start finding out faults,

140
03:29:25,507 --> 03:29:28,958
finding out ragas, “This was not good,
that...”.

141
03:29:29,159 --> 03:29:35,924
No, but not Westerners: Western people
are so humble about it.

142
03:29:36,125 --> 03:29:38,384
Isn't it remarkable?

143
03:29:38,585 --> 03:29:45,126
How is it they have picked up so quickly
and have understood?

144
03:29:45,328 --> 03:29:47,167
Because they have become subtler.

145
03:29:47,368 --> 03:29:50,872
This is the only thing I can say: they have
become subtler

146
03:29:51,073 --> 03:29:57,400
and their energies are flowing through
the subtler level.

147
03:29:58,218 --> 03:30:01,742
It's surprising for Babamama, also for me,
for everyone

148
03:30:01,950 --> 03:30:09,105
that in three, four months how can you
play Malkauns rag?

149
03:30:10,010 --> 03:30:15,943
First time I heard, I started wondering,
“How can that be?”

150
03:30:16,144 --> 03:30:24,239
And that gives such a hope to save this
music.

151
03:30:24,769 --> 03:30:29,033
It may be that in India it may be
declining,

152
03:30:29,234 --> 03:30:34,650
but in the West it's rising.

153
03:30:34,958 --> 03:30:41,137
Is the other way round: The Sun rises from
the East and sets on the West;

154
03:30:41,339 --> 03:30:46,694
here is the other way round now for music
and I would request all the Indians

155
03:30:46,895 --> 03:30:51,353
to develop that subtle understanding.

156
03:30:51,555 --> 03:31:02,929
You see, say if you are a honeybee, only
then you can suck in the honey.

157
03:31:04,698 --> 03:31:08,427
The flies cannot.

158
03:31:08,771 --> 03:31:12,177
So you have to develop that sensitivity.

159
03:31:12,378 --> 03:31:15,201
I would say to Indians, I'm sorry to say

160
03:31:15,402 --> 03:31:19,700
that you have to develop that sensitivity
within you,

161
03:31:19,901 --> 03:31:23,150
which is possible through meditation

162
03:31:23,351 --> 03:31:30,799
and through Kundalini awakening and
balancing

163
03:31:31,001 --> 03:31:37,770
and ultimately getting connected with this
all-pervading power of Chaitanya.

164
03:31:37,972 --> 03:31:41,733
Because Sound is the second stage.

165
03:31:41,935 --> 03:31:44,710
First was, of course, they said the Word.

166
03:31:44,911 --> 03:31:49,398
But it was silent, came into Sound

167
03:31:49,599 --> 03:31:57,124
and if you can understand the subtle
of the Sound within you,

168
03:31:58,107 --> 03:32:06,653
if you can get one with it, it gives you
that joy.

169
03:32:06,854 --> 03:32:13,616
But you will be surprised, I have never
studied music, never, all my life.

170
03:32:13,817 --> 03:32:21,821
Because, you see, I don't know why but
somehow I never studied

171
03:32:22,022 --> 03:32:26,718
because I could not have a guru, this is
the problem was.

172
03:32:28,830 --> 03:32:33,666
I couldn't have a guru, so somehow or
other, I never studied music.

173
03:32:33,867 --> 03:32:37,996
But what I have is the same as you have now

174
03:32:38,197 --> 03:32:46,341
is that subtle enjoyment sense of music.

175
03:32:46,542 --> 03:32:49,290
And that's why I say this is divine.

176
03:32:49,491 --> 03:32:51,821
Of course, I also enjoy some pop music,

177
03:32:52,022 --> 03:32:54,741
also enjoy western music very much

178
03:32:54,942 --> 03:32:58,813
and the Western great composers I enjoy,
no doubt.

179
03:32:59,014 --> 03:33:03,287
But this music has one speciality -

180
03:33:03,488 --> 03:33:11,760
that nothing is written down, there is
no composer.

181
03:33:11,961 --> 03:33:19,876
The musician is the composer, he is
the player and he is the book.

182
03:33:20,813 --> 03:33:24,124
It's so individualistic if you see that,

183
03:33:24,325 --> 03:33:27,141
but today I was happy to see all of them.

184
03:33:27,343 --> 03:33:32,922
This is the western side of it

185
03:33:33,123 --> 03:33:36,503
that so many of them put together were
singing, you see,

186
03:33:36,704 --> 03:33:41,219
like a choir but not so bad as that.

187
03:33:43,248 --> 03:33:48,930
And in the choir, you see, because I have
attended many choirs also,

188
03:33:49,131 --> 03:33:53,235
it was too systematic, too disciplined;

189
03:33:53,436 --> 03:33:58,169
this is not. Here it is complete freedom
within themselves.

190
03:33:58,370 --> 03:34:01,058
And the whole thing worked out so well,
I mean,

191
03:34:01,259 --> 03:34:04,940
it's such a good combination of both
the things:

192
03:34:05,141 --> 03:34:10,151
One side is the music, another side is
the collectivity.

193
03:34:10,389 --> 03:34:16,948
So I have never said a word about Baba's
University or Academy,

194
03:34:17,150 --> 03:34:21,946
but I told him that, “I'm very proud
of you.”

195
03:34:29,039 --> 03:34:35,222
He has very lovingly brought up this
Academy

196
03:34:35,432 --> 03:34:44,972
and has that character of our old guru
system which is very important.

197
03:34:45,173 --> 03:34:54,864
That keeps the whole place very holy,
as you call 'pavana'.

198
03:34:55,078 --> 03:34:57,398
And that is working out. He is working
very hard.

199
03:34:57,599 --> 03:34:59,802
I know Baba is working very hard,

200
03:35:00,003 --> 03:35:03,334
and all of you are working very hard
to help him.

201
03:35:03,535 --> 03:35:09,086
But this Academy will definitely, I'm sure,
one day will give

202
03:35:09,287 --> 03:35:15,680
that universal knowledge of that subtle
thing I am telling you about.

203
03:35:23,294 --> 03:35:31,466
I know it is late today and tonight, I
should say, but I am used to this more,

204
03:35:31,667 --> 03:35:35,871
because, you see, in our - when we were
young -

205
03:35:36,072 --> 03:35:39,951
my father was so fond of music and
musicians

206
03:35:40,152 --> 03:35:43,533
that so many times we have slept at about
five o'clock in the morning.

207
03:35:43,734 --> 03:35:46,054
So, [it] makes no difference to me.

208
03:35:46,255 --> 03:35:50,256
Same I find in you, people, that you are,
the way you are enjoying.

209
03:35:50,457 --> 03:35:53,951
So we have great hope of saving our young
people

210
03:35:54,152 --> 03:36:01,725
who are going astray, people who are
frustrated,

211
03:36:01,926 --> 03:36:09,012
people who are unhappy because they have
no satisfaction;

212
03:36:09,213 --> 03:36:16,554
people who are committing suicide
in the affluent countries.

213
03:36:16,755 --> 03:36:20,205
Also in our country people who are
becoming politicians,

214
03:36:20,406 --> 03:36:24,701
I think, that's the worst thing that can
happen to anyone.

215
03:36:25,549 --> 03:36:33,240
Also we have people who are doing all kinds
of criminal things,

216
03:36:33,454 --> 03:36:38,561
doing all kinds of violence and everything.

217
03:36:38,762 --> 03:36:47,402
All that can be completely covered with
the ocean of music.

218
03:36:47,951 --> 03:36:51,199
And if it is done by Sahaja Yogis,

219
03:36:51,400 --> 03:36:57,719
it would be such a great emancipation
for the whole world

220
03:36:57,920 --> 03:37:02,950
which is absolutely due and it is going
to work out.

221
03:37:03,151 --> 03:37:06,198
So I am thankful to Babamama

222
03:37:06,399 --> 03:37:10,988
and to all others who are supporting
him in this

223
03:37:11,189 --> 03:37:19,915
and I hope you all will enjoy this music
on a very subtle level.

224
03:37:20,116 --> 03:37:26,894
Because immediately with the mind which
reacts, one starts discussing,

225
03:37:27,095 --> 03:37:31,864
arguing, condemning also.

226
03:37:32,294 --> 03:37:38,345
That's not the way to understand this
music, but just to enjoy it.

227
03:37:38,547 --> 03:37:44,497
Enjoyment - it hasn't got two sides - is
only enjoyment, single,

228
03:37:44,698 --> 03:37:49,456
and that should happen to you, all of you.

229
03:37:49,657 --> 03:38:00,145
I am so much, so much overwhelmed really
by this beautiful renderings we have had.

230
03:38:00,346 --> 03:38:02,941
For example now we had from Aurangabad.

231
03:38:03,142 --> 03:38:06,108
I mean, I can't believe that in Aurangabad

232
03:38:06,309 --> 03:38:09,309
you could have such beautiful dancing.

233
03:38:09,511 --> 03:38:17,120
This Mr. Aurangzeb, after whom this name
is given - Aurangabad.

234
03:38:17,321 --> 03:38:19,882
[Marathi] -

235
03:38:20,083 --> 03:38:23,137
I don't know why it's called Aurangabad,
whatever it is.

236
03:38:23,338 --> 03:38:26,906
He was such a horribly fanatic man

237
03:38:27,107 --> 03:38:32,977
and every day he used to kill so many
Hindus.

238
03:38:33,178 --> 03:38:36,505
And when... Thank God he was a thin man.

239
03:38:36,706 --> 03:38:41,364
He was weaved in their thread, Janaeu
thread.

240
03:38:41,565 --> 03:38:45,629
How many were killed, you know. Imagine
what a cruel man he was,

241
03:38:45,830 --> 03:38:51,052
and under his name is this Aurangabad.
If you have to change any name

242
03:38:51,253 --> 03:38:55,545
in this country, it should be Aurangzeb
and Aurangabad.

243
03:38:57,932 --> 03:39:00,167
And he had no sense of music,

244
03:39:00,368 --> 03:39:03,427
he never used to listen to music, you know,

245
03:39:03,628 --> 03:39:08,660
but he was extremely honest; that's another
point about honesty.

246
03:39:08,861 --> 03:39:15,516
And he would not take any money for his
survival from the state.

247
03:39:15,717 --> 03:39:23,397
He used to stitch topis [hats] and sell
them. Can you imagine?

248
03:39:23,598 --> 03:39:26,452
If he had not done that and had been

249
03:39:26,653 --> 03:39:29,628
little bit loving person, would have been
much better.

250
03:39:29,829 --> 03:39:33,733
But from that Aurangabad comes this music
and dancing.

251
03:39:33,934 --> 03:39:38,285
I was amazed. I thought, “How can it be?”

252
03:39:38,486 --> 03:39:41,100
How did they call it Aurangabad, I don't
know,

253
03:39:41,301 --> 03:39:45,621
but he's the one who hated music.

254
03:39:47,047 --> 03:39:50,629
How could these people be born there?

255
03:39:50,830 --> 03:39:53,717
And what dancing they showed.

256
03:39:53,965 --> 03:39:56,014
Also you have seen the Kuchipudi

257
03:39:56,214 --> 03:40:02,340
from Baba’s Institute was another one –
I must – just eye-opener, I tell you.

258
03:40:02,548 --> 03:40:07,887
These are girls from, absolutely from
countries

259
03:40:08,088 --> 03:40:10,804
where they have never known all this.

260
03:40:11,005 --> 03:40:15,287
And in such a short time to learn such
a dance like Kuchipudi,

261
03:40:15,489 --> 03:40:19,939
is the most difficult dance, very fast.

262
03:40:20,140 --> 03:40:22,510
“My goodness!”, I thought that,

263
03:40:22,711 --> 03:40:25,895
“What has happened to them?”

264
03:40:26,316 --> 03:40:29,190
And you may say, “Mother, this is due
to Sahaj”,

265
03:40:29,391 --> 03:40:35,952
whatever it is, but Sahaj also is to be
borne by you people.

266
03:40:36,153 --> 03:40:42,541
Now if you have a very small little candle,
how much it can burn?

267
03:40:42,742 --> 03:40:49,080
But these are like the ocean of energies

268
03:40:49,281 --> 03:40:54,671
and the way they are expressing themselves
is remarkable.

269
03:40:54,872 --> 03:40:57,711
Of course, I love you very much

270
03:40:57,912 --> 03:41:02,191
and it is not out of that love and
admiration I am saying this,

271
03:41:02,392 --> 03:41:06,146
but it's a fact, is a reality.

272
03:41:06,905 --> 03:41:13,176
I, I had no idea that one day it will go
that well

273
03:41:14,200 --> 03:41:23,423
and this global movement is going to work
out wonders.

274
03:41:23,625 --> 03:41:28,953
You must spread also the music along
with the vibrations.

275
03:41:29,154 --> 03:41:32,155
I am sure it would be good.

276
03:41:32,356 --> 03:41:38,475
Really, for definite.
(Marathi)

277
03:41:39,786 --> 03:41:44,009
I - you can't believe, I asked Babamama,
“Who is, how is it?”

278
03:41:44,211 --> 03:41:49,497
He said, “Only four months’ time.”
Everybody four months.

279
03:41:51,445 --> 03:41:54,897
Very remarkable. Then we have one from
Spain.

280
03:41:55,098 --> 03:41:57,345
I saw him playing Spanish,

281
03:41:57,546 --> 03:42:00,774
but Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

282
03:42:00,975 --> 03:42:04,054
because it goes hectic, you know.

283
03:42:04,255 --> 03:42:09,812
It is very fast, sometimes very slow, but
it's very rhythmic, but is hectic.

284
03:42:10,013 --> 03:42:14,451
Ours is very much, I should say,
disciplined.

285
03:42:14,652 --> 03:42:18,815
Whatever it is, he also has played so well.

286
03:42:19,016 --> 03:42:23,038
So there are so many examples to show,

287
03:42:23,240 --> 03:42:27,321
that you may be from the Western country.

288
03:42:27,560 --> 03:42:33,609
It's better to be from the Western country
now for music than from this.

289
03:42:36,128 --> 03:42:39,860
I can't understand really, it's a, it's
a miracle,

290
03:42:40,061 --> 03:42:47,071
but why should this miracle work in the
West and not in India I don't understand.

291
03:42:47,272 --> 03:42:50,303
Though I am sure the Indians are enjoying
this music,

292
03:42:50,504 --> 03:42:52,802
no doubt, because they are all Sahaja
Yogis.

293
03:42:53,003 --> 03:42:55,859
But you go to any program -

294
03:42:56,060 --> 03:42:59,574
any other program where there are very
few Sahaja Yogis -

295
03:42:59,775 --> 03:43:05,439
you will see that the way they behave,
without any respect.

296
03:43:05,671 --> 03:43:09,872
The respect that is paid in India to
the musicians has to be

297
03:43:10,078 --> 03:43:16,202
of a very high level - or any talents -
say even art...

298
03:43:16,387 --> 03:43:22,129
See also people who make beautiful things
from their hands.

299
03:43:22,330 --> 03:43:28,204
All these people who are so talented, are
to be respected very much

300
03:43:28,405 --> 03:43:32,360
because it's a special gift God has given
them.

301
03:43:32,561 --> 03:43:36,485
Now in India, we have got a very big
problem also.

302
03:43:36,686 --> 03:43:47,824
All great artists got into the... I should
say, into the influence of the West,

303
03:43:48,025 --> 03:43:56,170
and so many of them take scotch whisky.
What do you say to that?

304
03:43:57,408 --> 03:44:03,767
So many; and their music is finished.

305
03:44:03,968 --> 03:44:06,511
You can't even play cricket with scotch
whisky,

306
03:44:06,711 --> 03:44:10,650
leave alone music.

307
03:44:10,850 --> 03:44:17,651
And this Western influence of taking drinks
and things like that

308
03:44:17,852 --> 03:44:22,027
has ruined our musicians and I don't know
what's going to happen.

309
03:44:22,228 --> 03:44:25,614
I was quite worried that how is it going
to be retained

310
03:44:25,815 --> 03:44:29,484
in this country, but now I have great hopes

311
03:44:29,685 --> 03:44:33,574
because if they see the Western people
doing so well...

312
03:44:33,775 --> 03:44:41,935
You see, for Indians, this goes into their
heads that, “How can they do it?”

313
03:44:42,136 --> 03:44:44,163
Oh, that goes very much...

314
03:44:44,364 --> 03:44:51,584
I mean if they see Western people doing
such good music,

315
03:44:51,785 --> 03:44:57,788
it's very influential. So, instead of
having any Indian artist

316
03:44:57,989 --> 03:45:01,962
on the stage, we should really bring
foreign.

317
03:45:02,164 --> 03:45:07,739
It will have a great effect, I tell you,
on Indians. (Marathi)

318
03:45:09,460 --> 03:45:12,497
It was very shameful the way sometimes
Indians behave

319
03:45:12,698 --> 03:45:19,160
in a classical music programs, very
shameful, for anybody.

320
03:45:19,361 --> 03:45:23,182
They have no sense, nothing and they go
on misbehaving.

321
03:45:23,384 --> 03:45:30,914
They come there for social, social affair,
I think, that's all.

322
03:45:31,501 --> 03:45:35,350
On this point, we Indians as Sahaja Yogis

323
03:45:35,551 --> 03:45:41,575
are to be responsible and to see for
yourself

324
03:45:41,776 --> 03:45:50,882
how much they have achieved, how much
they have understood.

325
03:45:51,643 --> 03:45:53,864
Somebody who saw them said,

326
03:45:54,066 --> 03:46:02,139
“Mother, now even in Indian music if they
go ahead of us, what will happen to us?”

327
03:46:03,868 --> 03:46:07,279
But still, we have very great musicians,

328
03:46:07,480 --> 03:46:11,401
as you have Arun Apte before you.

329
03:46:16,199 --> 03:46:21,517
I must tell you, we had a program in Puna,

330
03:46:21,718 --> 03:46:25,926
that's called as Shere, and I was very
tired.

331
03:46:26,127 --> 03:46:28,823
And so I told Yogi (Mahajan), “What is
in the program, next one?”

332
03:46:29,024 --> 03:46:35,718
He said, “Some musician has come. He wanted
to sing, so he has come.”

333
03:46:35,919 --> 03:46:38,812
I said, “Which musician?” “I don't know
his name...”

334
03:46:39,013 --> 03:46:40,934
But you see, Yogi (Mahajan), I think, was
that time

335
03:46:41,135 --> 03:46:46,525
not so much music-minded. Typical
Indian style.

336
03:46:46,726 --> 03:46:49,523
“So Mother, You go and sleep.”

337
03:46:49,725 --> 03:46:54,537
So I laid down and I heard his voice
and I heard his music.

338
03:46:54,738 --> 03:47:00,721
I said, “Who is this singing?” I came back,
I changed my sari,

339
03:47:00,923 --> 03:47:06,495
I asked Yogi, “Who is he?” They told me
the name.

340
03:47:06,696 --> 03:47:09,590
I said, “He's a great singer!

341
03:47:09,791 --> 03:47:13,844
What do you understand? How much are
you going to pay him?”

342
03:47:14,045 --> 03:47:19,967
He told me such a meagre thing, I said,
“Are you mad, Yogi?

343
03:47:21,597 --> 03:47:27,521
Then I went out and I heard his great
music.

344
03:47:27,730 --> 03:47:29,822
I've heard his guru also before

345
03:47:30,023 --> 03:47:32,565
who was also very great that time,

346
03:47:32,766 --> 03:47:37,461
and also Ajit Kadkade is his gurubandhu,
both of them are.

347
03:47:37,663 --> 03:47:42,947
But I was surprised that none of
the Indians could understand him,

348
03:47:43,148 --> 03:47:45,994
what he was singing.

349
03:47:46,534 --> 03:47:52,852
And this Maharashtra is known for music,
for classical music.

350
03:47:53,053 --> 03:47:59,140
But surprisingly, it's not that level now
that we had seen.

351
03:47:59,341 --> 03:48:07,689
I am happy to see this resurrection
of Indian music through you people.

352
03:48:07,890 --> 03:48:19,735
That was one of my greatest desire to get
the art, handicrafts and music -

353
03:48:19,936 --> 03:48:27,552
all kinds of things which are created
through this talent - should prosper.

354
03:48:27,753 --> 03:48:32,918
And I am very happy to see that despite
it's so late -

355
03:48:33,119 --> 03:48:36,812
I don't know what is the time, oh my God -

356
03:48:37,013 --> 03:48:41,506
you all are still alert and enjoying.

357
03:48:41,683 --> 03:48:49,742
I can't say about other artists who have
very much impressed you and impressed me.

358
03:48:49,943 --> 03:48:55,554
So this is a very good chance -
Ganapatipule - where we can have

359
03:48:55,755 --> 03:49:02,281
a very nice music, beautiful music,
so enjoyable.

360
03:49:02,482 --> 03:49:05,601
Thank you very much.
