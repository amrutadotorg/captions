00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.960
Science and Spirituality.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.880
The debate goes on.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.360
But really, scientists and spiritualists
are both seeking the answers

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.480
to the same question
just in different ways.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.520
They both try to find
the hidden laws of nature,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.840
the higher power
that created everything,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.440
and use their discoveries
to better the life of others.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.200
And with this interview series,
we have tried to learn more

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.680
about the intersection of science
and spirituality with our guest,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.000
who is very unique in being both
a neurologist and a long-standing

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.920
meditation practitioner.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.480
So what better way
than to talk to him

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
and find out more?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.080
I would like to welcome
Dr. Ashish Prathan

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.280
on our program today.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800
Welcome, Dr. Ashish.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.760
Thank you.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.840
Thanks for having me back, Monika.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.640
Definitely.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.480
It's always a pleasure talking to you.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.240
Dr. Ashish, today we're talking
about the seventh energy center

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.960
in the subtle system,
and we'd like to know

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.829
how it is represented
in the human body.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160
The seventh energy center
is the most fascinating,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.480
obviously the most complex.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.400
And it is very much a symbol,
an anatomical, physiologic symbol

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.280
of what spirituality
is really all about,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.280
relative to the introduction
that you just so eloquently made.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.120
So as we have said
from the very beginning

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.160
of this series, adopting
a Cartesian frame of reference,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.280
where we look at each individual
energy center, although convenient,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280
is not how the system functions.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.800
We have adopted this modality
because that helps us to understand

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.840
at a little more granular level.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.600
But the entire system is integrated
right from the first energy center,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.520
right up to the seventh energy center,
which is what we're about to try to answer.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.480
Within that framework,
given the fact that all

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.720
the energy centers are integrated,
the limbic system,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.920
which is the gross representation
of the seventh energy center,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.880
is the epitome
of an integral function.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.880
So what is the limbic system?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.840
The limbic system is something
that governs our actions

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.760
and our behaviors.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.200
It is, one might say,
one of the most primitive forms

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.320
of neurological systems
within the body.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.080
So if you think about it,
the limbic system sits deep

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.840
inside our brain.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.520
If you think of our brain
as a kind of a coconut,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.560
and if you start going
inside the coconut,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.040
it is literally the core of it all
that comprises the limbic system,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.200
whereas the other layers
start developing outwardly.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.560
And if you look at the evolution
of how this has come about,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.240
you find the correspondences
of the limbic system

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.480
as you go downward -
if we consider

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.080
the primate neurological systems

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.280
of which the Homo sapiens
is a part, that is us,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.480
as you go downwards
on the evolutionary scale,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.480
you can find there are aspects
of the so-called limbic system.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.880
So the limbic system in a way
might be referred to as a kind

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.600
of a primitive brain,
but it is anything but primitive.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.360
And the reason is, it comprises
multiple organs within the brain

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.040
or parts of the brain.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.200
To call it an organ
is probably a misnomer.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.520
And we will talk about two or three
of these,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.520
but that probably might be
the next question.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.040
But that is what it is.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.560
The limbic system is situated
deep inside our brain,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.640
and it corresponds
to the seventh energy center,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.240
and it serves as a kind
of a major integrative aspect

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.240
of the sensory inputs
and the motor responses

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.560
that the body provides.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.920
So you just mentioned
different parts of the limbic system.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.960
Could you just elaborate
a little bit more about that?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.000
Sure, happy to.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.560
In the last episode,
we spoke about the hypothalamus,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.000
which is related
to the sixth energy center.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.640
But as we said
just a few moments ago

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.800
that the whole thing is integrated.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.440
There are two or three other parts
of the limbic system

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.840
that I would briefly
like to touch upon.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.480
The first one would be the amygdala.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.080
The amygdala, we have two
amygdalas so to speak,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.680
one in the left brain, another one
in the right side of the brain.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.160
And these are small
almond-shaped structures,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.400
a part of the limbic system of course.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.760
And they relate to our memories
and our emotions.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.120
Say, we see something
that induces fear,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.720
or fear as a memory
that is engraved in us

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.200
is a function of the amygdala.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.080
So in people who have
a hyperactive amygdala,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.760
they tend to be more fearful
and so on and so forth.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.200
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders,
PTSDs, numerous studies

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.800
that seem to demonstrate a connection
between that kind of a state

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.120
and an overactive amygdala.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.800
Amygdala is again,
a very important part

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.480
of the limbic system
because it processes our memories,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.240
it also creates the fear factor,
and so on and so forth.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.480
The other structure
that we would really also

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.080
like to talk about is the hippocampus.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.720
Hippocampus is what is poetically
described as a seahorse-looking structure

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.600
and it relates to our memories.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.600
Hippocampus plays a very
important role in our spatial memories,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.320
in memories that we form
over a lifetime,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.760
but also it relates to our time
and place memories,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
so that's why spatial memory

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.040
plays a very important role in that.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.440
The third structure I would like
to talk about is the thalamus.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.560
The thalamus, again,
we have two thalami,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.280
like we have two hippocampi,
there are two of each one of these,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.640
one on either side of the brain,
but they all sit together.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.560
The thalamus you can think of this
as a massive relay station.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.280
All these sensory inputs
of heat, cold, whatever,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.240
the sensations that we feel
in our body,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.520
they are brought up
through the sensory nerves

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.560
and they then pass
through the thalamus.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.600
The thalamus you can say is like
a major networking junction

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:00.000
and from the thalamus,
the nerves then are projected out

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.680
into other parts of the brain,
particularly the cerebral cortex

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960
or the temporal lobe,
so on and so forth.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.000
And then based on that,
responses are created

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.360
and they once again
pass through the thalamus.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.920
So the thalamus acts as

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.720
a relay center
and that's also part

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.360
of the limbic system.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.840
And then we spoke about

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.680
the hypothalamus
in the previous episode,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.665
just briefly the hypothalamus
again is a very important organ,

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:33.440
very small, very important function
by way of its endocrine functions,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.280
the way it controls the entirety
of the autonomic nervous system

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.280
by secreting and controlling hormones
that govern our blood pressure,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.400
respiration, digestive system,
so on and so forth.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.360
Let's integrate it all together
and the pun is very much intended here.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.692
So through the thalamus,
through the hippocampus,

00:08:53.692 --> 00:08:57.920
through the amygdala,
through the hypothalamus,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.920
through another part
of the limbic system

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.280
called the anterior cingulate gyrus,
which is also responsible

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.280
for judgmental behaviors.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.000
What you can see is that
the limbic system essentially governs

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.480
our vegetative functions.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.040
It is responsible
for 'the state of being'.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.600
This is not a spiritual description.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.320
This is literally
a physiologic description.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.520
Who we are and how we exist
in a second to second,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.600
minute to minute temporal
and spatial existence.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.480
For example,
I am seated in a chair,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.240
I am looking at a camera,
I am processing your words,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.600
those words mean something to me
because they are said

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.656
in the English language
and so on and so forth.

00:09:44.656 --> 00:09:48.160
That is where my cortex comes in,
the higher functions come in.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.600
But all of this I am doing
without having to think

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.040
about my heart rate,
my respiration, so on and so forth.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.720
So my state of being
literally at this point in time

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.080
is a function of the limbic system
and that is allowing me

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.360
not to overreact, to underreact,
to modulate my responses,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.600
not be fearful,
keep my memories kick into place,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.880
and manage millions 
of processes happening

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.760
without me even being aware of them.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.560
That in essence is your limbic system.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:29.440
Therefore, this system
is so critical to our functioning,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.160
it comprises various parts
but these all talk to each other

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.120
which is why we said
if we just look at them

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.760
as individual components,
so here is the thalamus,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.160
here is the hypothalamus,
here is the amygdala,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.040
here is the anterior cingulate gyrus,
that doesn't help us to understand it.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.040
So modern neuroscience,
although it still adopts this breaking

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.480
into its component
parts approach,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.720
it still requires from
a neurological perspective

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.440
but also from a spiritual perspective
to understand how the whole thing

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.240
works beautifully in sync
to come up with the final result

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.660
that is us functioning human beings.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.920
This structure
of the brain,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.560
how does it align
with the interpretations

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.960
or teachings of Sahaj?

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.000
So beautiful,
that's a great question Monika.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.320
So the teachings of Shri Mataji
relate to realization

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.720
or self-realization
to be very precise of an individual,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.760
of what that true self is,
what is the ultimate reality

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.960
of one's own existence,
one's own being

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.000
and this particular aspect
is physiologically possible

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.960
and we'll deal with this
maybe a little later

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.640
but how it aligns with
the teachings of Shri Mataji

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.360
is that the entirety
of our spiritual system

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.440
as we have said repeatedly
is one integrated function

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.960
and it is through this limbic system
or at the level of the limbic system

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.200
is where it all comes together.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.200
Our actions and our emotions,
our behaviors and our responses,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.560
our processing of what is around us,
our upbringing, our conditionings,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.640
our affiliations, social, cultural,
so called religious, political,

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.520
everything comes together
and is processed

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.040
at the limbic system level
and of course with the help

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.800
of the higher centers
which is what allows us to do it

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.680
but that is where it all
comes together vis-a-vis

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.080
the alignment with
Shri Mataji's teaching

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.640
so that we are one
integrated holistic being

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.480
rather than just
a mere sum of our components.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.400
So from the first energy center
with its quality of innocence,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.520
the second energy center
with its quality

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.320
of pure knowledge,
third energy center

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.040
with its qualities
of maintaining boundaries

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.080
or mariadas or dharma
as the expression goes

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.280
in the Sanskrit language
from the sense of security

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.520
and love and compassion
to the feeling of collective consciousness

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.920
to feeling relaxed
about yourself and others,

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.840
having a forgiving disposition.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.240
All these energy centers
that have those qualities

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:44.000
are ultimately made possible
or manifest

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.280
because of the limbic system,
because of the amygdala,

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.160
because of the thalamus,
because of the hypothalamus,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.840
because of the other components
that we have not touched upon

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.440
within the limbic system.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.760
So the limbic system allows us

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.840
to manifest the qualities
of the energy centers

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.360
through this magnificent
evolutionary process

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.080
that has brought us
to this ultimate step

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.440
which is a breakthrough
in our consciousness

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.520
through self-realization.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.960
Does that help?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.120
Definitely it's a breakthrough
in the consciousness

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.400
with the way
that you have explained

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.560
and I think it was a very nice recap
of all the previous topics

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.000
that you have covered in this series
about the different energy centers

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.880
and for those of you who have
missed those episodes

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.760
we would encourage you
to go back and watch them

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:39.520
and this being the final episode
it just brings me to the next question

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.000
about something that you
just mentioned towards the end

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.720
of your previous response
about the consciousness.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.480
What is human consciousness
and can it be influenced

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.680
through internal or external means
and how does it relate

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.520
to collective consciousness?

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.960
So that's a very profound question,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.320
so thanks for asking first of all.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.000
Second I would like to state
very very clearly

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:13.440
one has to approach this
with a very healthy dose of humility.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.920
Not that the previous things
do not require humility

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.160
but this one even more so
if ever there was a need

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.680
and the reason is that we still
do not know from a neurology perspective

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.360
although an enormous amount of effort
has been expended on it.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.040
Consciousness remains
the final frontier

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.320
and what is consciousness
as a function of neural correlates

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.040
of our activity.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.640
In other words if an individual
is subjected to an imaging modality

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.480
such as positron emission tomography
or PET scanning

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.480
and you see what parts
of the brain are activated

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.440
as individuals are put through
various different emotions

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.400
is one way to understand
consciousness.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.960
Consciousness implies two things.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.320
One is internal consciousness
and the other one is external consciousness.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.080
So there is a duality there.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.080
What do we mean
by internal consciousness?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.320
Internal consciousness is about
who I am, what I am feeling,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.520
where I am and my position
in the universe around me.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.760
External consciousness is everything
that is external to me.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.520
So there is a clear dividing line

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.960
that I know or I perceive
or I am aware of

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:49.040
whichever word applies
to what is self and what is non-self.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.840
What is within me that relates to me
and something that does not relate to me.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.960
It affects me but is not me
like for example this camera is not me

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.080
but it is affecting me
because it is recording me.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.120
Something like that.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.840
So consciousness deals
with these two compartments

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.080
and how we begin to process
that information

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.200
is a major part of the study
in neurosciences.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.480
So that is one part.
The external and what is me

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.000
or self or I.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.200
If I look at myself
in my image in a mirror

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.160
I am beginning to look at myself.
I know what I look like

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.960
because from my childhood
I have been looking at myself

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:36.560
and being aware of who I am,
and that awareness is a very important part

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.480
of my consciousness.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.760
One of the challenges
in the study of neurosciences

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.240
is that we are studying the organ
with the help of the same organ.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.880
For example, if you are designing a laptop

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.360
you are not designing a laptop
with the help of another laptop

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.000
you are designing a laptop
with the help of your brain.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.360
Unfortunately with us what is
when you study the brain

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.800
you are studying the organ
with the help of the same organ.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.200
So we are studying the brain
with the help of the human brain

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.440
because everything is human brain
at the end of the day.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:16.000
So likewise if I am seeing myself
my eyes are perceiving a reflection

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.600
that is me but I am using
my eyes to see me.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.560
If there is some other way to see me
that is if I can remove myself

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.640
from myself then I will get
a better picture of who I am.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.560
That is just kind of a basically
a logical extension

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.360
and this is where people
like René Descartes,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.360
the French philosopher
struggled with

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.960
and he came up with this expression
because he thought about this so much.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.920
Cogito, ergo sum
which is I think therefore I am

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.480
and it forms the entire basis
of the notion

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.880
of the dualism of consciousness.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.680
That is what consciousness
essentially is.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.760
There are multiple states
of consciousness

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.480
you know you are aware of,
then sometimes you are asleep

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.760
and you are working.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.880
There is a lot of research
now being done on

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.000
what we are aware of
as the default mode network.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.800
It is a lot that mindfulness deals with.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.480
What is the default mode network?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.720
It is basically the resting state.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.960
If you are just sitting, walking,
not doing anything consciously

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.080
as we call it, that is your
default mode network.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.080
You might say it is kind of
the background of something

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.840
that your brain exists in.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.000
As soon as you start changing
your conscious effort from that

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.680
to a focused action
to a concentrated action

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.760
you are writing something,
writing an email, performing a task,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.560
thinking about something
in very specific terms.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.320
So that shifts your focus
from the default mode network

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.760
to a more conscious effort.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.680
That is a shift in consciousness.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.080
So consciousness is again
a function

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.600
that is both neurological
or physiological

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.040
but probably is something
much more than that.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.960
We are just aware of who we are
as part of a society,

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.720
part of a civilization.
I come from an Indian background.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.240
I am a civilizationally aware
of where I come from.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.320
That is also a part of consciousness
although that isn't me per se

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.600
but it is a part of who
my collective memories are.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.440
So it is a long complex
sort of a topic,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.440
not easily answerable
but that is what consciousness is about.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.640
As far as the neural correlates
of consciousness are concerned

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.200
we might say that study is ongoing.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.920
There are parts of our brain
that become active

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.360
when we switch from what we said
before default mode network

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.320
to an active network
and then back again.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.480
So that is also consciousness
but is there one holistic

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.400
simple definition from a neurological
point of view of consciousness?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.440
It certainly doesn't exist for now
but probably we could say

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.200
consciousness is something
that is the ultimate outcome

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.200
of the entirety of these
84-85 billion neurons.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.960
The synapses within those neurons
that major in their trillions,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:16.160
this entire mathematically
impossible to grasp function

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.800
probably produces what we call
colloquially as consciousness.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.440
Dr. Ashish along this series,

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.280
we have talked about several
different parts of the nervous system,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.984
about the subtle system.

00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:35.280
We have also zoomed out
to talk about evolutionary meanings

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.640
to these energy centers
but for the purposes of having

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.600
an overarching message
for our audiences,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.520
what would you like to say
as a broad message

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.560
which kind of ties in all
the different pieces of information

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.200
that we have brought forth
for our audiences

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.240
and then maybe at the end
you can talk about self-realization

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.480
and what is unique about it?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.920
Thank you. 
That's again a beautiful question.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.640
What I'd like to leave
our audiences with

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:12.880
is that neurology, neuroanatomy
is still relatively in its infancy.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.680
Genomics and proteomics
are trying to understand the differences

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.560
and what makes us
different as individuals

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.480
and also what makes us
one as individuals.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.480
It's a very well-known factoid
that the difference between us

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.560
and primates, our closest primates,
is about 2% of DNA.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.040
So we share about 98%
sequence homology.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.360
If you look at the DNA molecule
with orangutans,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.840
they have about 97.5 to 98%
sequence homology with us.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.360
It's just a 2% variance
but that 2% variance

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.840
potentially produces Einstein's
and Shakespeare's

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.240
versus also unfortunately
the not so wonderful members

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.920
of her species historically speaking
who have brought about

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.560
great death and destruction.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:10.560
But what one tries to say
is science is an eternal quest

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.560
at least for now.
We don't have the answers

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.800
to who we are,
where do we come from,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.920
from a scientific point of view.
Those answers are in the domain

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.720
of spirituality and we'll get
to that in a minute.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.240
But that is what we would like
to leave our viewers with

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.200
at least from my point of view
that this is a journey,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.080
science is on a journey,
we are making tremendous strides,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.200
brilliant minds, lot of effort
and we are closer to finding

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.360
the answers to a lot of questions
but what is beautiful is to see

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.440
that what spirituality
has always been teaching us.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.000
I would not use the word religion
because that can get

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.280
kind of contentious
but certainly the broad thread

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:55.040
of what we have been told
by the so called wise teachings

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.640
through different civilizations,
there is convergence.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.440
There is convergence
between those teachings

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.640
and there is convergence with science
and that is beautiful to see.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.680
That we are an integrated being,
that we are one whole

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.120
and that we are a part
of a larger reality

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.960
and that reality is also
that which sits within us.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.920
And again I would bring it back
to the limbic system.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.280
The limbic system is a great example
of how everything

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.280
comes together and ties together.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.480
So that is what I would like
to leave our viewers with.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.560
Genomics again I would say,
proteomics,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.880
how the protein metabolome
will show us

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.680
how this untold number of proteins
essentially define who we are

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.760
and what we do.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.920
But then that brings us
to the final question

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.960
which is probably the most
important one of this series.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.480
What is self-realization?

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:57.600
So self-realization through Sahaja
and through the teachings of Shri Mataji

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.760
and through the meditative practice
that She has brought forth

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:09.920
as a way of humanity to experience
allows us at a physiologic level,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.280
I am going to repeat that,
at a physiologic level

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:20.560
through the tips of the fingers
we can feel the existence of a power,

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.869
of an energy that
surrounds us in which

00:25:24.869 --> 00:25:28.560
we are bathed all the time
but we are just not aware of it.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.960
So by triggering this inner energy
within us which resides

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.360
in the os sacrum which we dealt with
in the first or the second episode,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.560
its ascent through the so called
energy centers within us

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.000
also called as chakras and its

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.440
ultimate realization or breakthrough
through the seventh energy center

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.240
which means its activation
of the limbic system

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.720
in some shape or form
we cannot define it

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.840
physiologically yet.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.240
Just to be very clear
as we speak here

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.120
on the 8th day of December of 2024,
maybe in the future we might be

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.640
but today we don't know that.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.880
But when that event happens,
when that limbic system

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:17.440
is somehow triggered by this energy
we can feel this as a form of cool breeze

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.560
blowing through and coming
through the tips of our fingers.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:28.240
A physiological phenomenon like this
cannot be explained by anything

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.600
that we know of neuroanatomy
or neurophysiology

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.080
or even pharmacology so far.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:40.640
No drug, no therapy, no state
is able to provide

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.560
this kind of an experience
and when you get that experience

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.920
you can feel as a practitioner,
I can vouch for this

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.960
as having practiced this
for a fairly long time now,

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.320
you get that sense of self.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.120
That last but one question
that you asked Monika

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.680
which is consciousness.
What is consciousness?

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.760
You can feel your true self.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.920
It cannot be described in words.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.520
I am not going to waste
any more time, yours or mine

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.000
trying to explain what that is.
It is what it is.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.440
There is a beautiful expression
in the Sanskrit language,

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.040
it goes as Tat Tvam Asi,
that which exists. That's it.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:30.320
There is no profounder explanation
that is required perhaps.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.440
It is a state that you experience
and that's a state you experience

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.720
for yourself.
Books have been written about it,

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.200
poetry has been composed about it,
paintings have tried to depict it,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.960
it doesn't work.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:51.440
But it is made very easy
and spontaneous by Shri Mataji

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.200
by allowing us to experience
this state within us

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:00.000
and experiencing it physiologically.
That is self-realization

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.760
and that is why we take
the opportunity to proclaim

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.600
literally as much as we can.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.480
Try to get this because this is not
about reading a book

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.360
and forming an idea.
This is not about listening

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:16.000
to someone and forming a concept.
This is about experiencing it

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.920
for your own self
through what resides within you.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.040
It is your power, it is your will
but it is also your own

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:31.200
individual unique experience
which then magically or paradoxically

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.880
leads you to an elevated
state of consciousness.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.760
My personal belief
and I will end with that Monika

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.120
is self-realization is
a physiologically speaking

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.920
supra limbic state.
So it is not even at the level

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.800
of the limbic system.
It is supra limbic. Why?

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.480
Because when you are in that state
you experience

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.160
even for those brief moments
or for some hours

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.440
a state where you don't feel thirsty,
you don't feel hungry,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.840
you don't feel the need for
the external things that you crave for.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.120
And as a doctor,
as a researcher

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.360
I have explained it to myself
that it can only be because

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.080
those impulses that reside
within the limbic system

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.720
that the limbic system
tries to control

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.680
are probably satisfied
and are managed.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.200
Now managing is a big term.
There is no physiologic explanation

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.600
for that management.
But they somehow seem to be managed.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.640
And I have seen this,
I have seen this in group settings

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.360
where people are sitting
for hours together

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.080
without feeling
the need for food

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.840
or for water or for any other
bodily physical comforts

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.720
that one craves.
It can only be described probably

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:58.560
as some kind of a supra limbic state
where the needs of the organism

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.640
are somehow innately satisfied
and those words are important.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.280
That there is nothing external
that is happening.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.280
Something is happening within them
and that is what Sahaj meditation

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.880
is truly about.
That is what I, at least for myself,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.000
believe is self-realization.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.320
I think there are 
definitely certain things

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.000
which are beyond the mind
and as long as we accept that

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.120
we will always be learning
and discovering more and more.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.600
And I do want to say to Dr. Ashish
that you have learnt and practiced

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.440
enough neurology
and meditation both.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.520
You have had the intention
to share that knowledge

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.400
with the wider audiences
and you have put in the time

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.720
and effort to get this message out.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.520
We have no words to thank you
for this contribution

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.120
to this body of knowledge
and we look forward to having

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.600
yet another series with you
sometime soon

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.480
but thanks again
for your contribution doctor.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.000
Thank you again.
Very kind of you.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.800
Kind words. Happy to do so.
Thank you.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.800
And for our audiences
we do want to say

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.440
that even though the series
is coming to an end

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.400
this is not the end of the journey.
This is just the beginning of it

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.760
and you can always continue
to send in further questions

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.680
through comments
in each of the episodes

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.640
and we will do our best
to bring the responses back to you

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.600
whichever way that we can
and we want you to stay on

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.680
to follow the guided meditation video
by the founder of this meditation

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.400
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
and do want to thank Her

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.520
for giving all of this knowledge
and giving it for free to people

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.760
who are now coming out
and sharing it with broader humanity.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.480
Thanks once again to all of you
for joining us on this series.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.166
Thank you very much.

00:31:36.166 --> 00:31:37.761
Thank you.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:52.160
Shri Mataji: When the Kundalini passes
through the five centers

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:59.360
it enters into the area
which we call as limbic area.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:07.040
This area is all surrounded
by thousand nerves

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:16.160
and when these nerves get enlightened
they look like flames of VIBGYOR

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:24.281
colors, seven colors
and very mildly, beautifully shining

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.424
emitting peace.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:42.800
Now the limbic area is connected
to all the areas of the brain

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:55.440
and also to the nerves.
So it starts flowing on to the nerves

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.280
giving you the new awareness
of collective consciousness

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.760
called 'samuhik chetana'.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.320
Keep your eyes closed.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.200
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.200
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:35.520
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.160
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.270
This is a very fundamental question.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:07.520
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.440
in the upper part.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.800
Here press it.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:21.280
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.680
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.000
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.831
Mother, am I my own master?

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:53.760
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:01.440
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.240
all the pure work is done.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.360
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:15.040
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.240
Six times you just ask.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:23.471
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:39.120
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.280
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:52.480
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.160
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.880
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.120
This you have to say ten times.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.160
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.895
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:57.680
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:07.760
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:14.640
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.040
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.440
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.880
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.636
This you have to say twelve times.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:04.240
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.120
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.960
So He forgives.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.600
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:21.280
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:29.760
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.920
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.680
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.960
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.400
Sixteen times.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.763
I am not guilty at all.

00:38:47.763 --> 00:38:55.899
Please say it.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:35.440
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:46.240
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.480
Please say it from your heart.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.560
How many times is not the point.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.960
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.640
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.560
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.440
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:11.440
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:18.428
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:33.040
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:38.080
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:45.440
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:51.920
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.230
please forgive me.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:09.440
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:16.000
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:24.800
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.000
Press it hard.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.520
Press hard your scalp.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:35.760
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.040
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.760
So you have to ask for it.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:52.320
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.614
Slowly saying that.
