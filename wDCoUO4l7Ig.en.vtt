[...] is very money oriented

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.960
and sometimes it becomes very crude also about it.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.920
Like I went to Boston and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.480
there they asked me a question, how many Rolls Royces She has.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.480
[...], how many Rolls Royces, just think of that.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.960
I did not what to say.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.680
[...]

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.840
[...]

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.480
Yes, they have gone through Yog, good idea, started with Yog.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.520
I addressed them, when I was in New York

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.720
They will be very happy to have another program with me.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.400
But I told them where Jung went wrong

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.400
and why couldn’t  achieve much in his lifetime.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.480
But, the people are, at large, very stupid in America.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.520
Extremely stupid, I mean they...

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.920
I talked to them about [...] and all the mistakes

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.960
he must have committed and..., well deep subject.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.760
Then the chairman, an old man of 80 years,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560
wanted to see Me personally.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.080
I said, alright, he came along

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200
and then what he says to me, most surprisingly.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.760
He says he has a keep, and he had this keep for many years.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.040
He?, he this gentleman.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.280
He never told his wife and now the wife is dead.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040
Now, this keep is still not so old as I am,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.160
and now she wants to go away with another man.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.760
That’s his problem, and how can I help him.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.760
And, what to do I said.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.760
80 year old man.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.080
How far could [...] or what to do with him.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.520
Such a stupid question from an 80 year old man [...]

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.840
I said, Sir I’m sorry, can’t help you.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480
Really, what a question to ask.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.000
That he had a keep and the keep is leaving him,

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.120
and his wife is dead now and he never told his wife.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.720
I said, such a stupid thing for an 80 year old man to say.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
When he went away, I was laughing and laughing,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280
they say, why are you laughing? I said, now what should I do,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.280
you see, this gentleman comes to me serious, very serious chairman.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.760
I couldn’t keep my seriousness.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.240
[...]

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.200
In, Rome

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.040
or in Milano they started calling me,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.960
the great mother, the grandeur. [...] Yes.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.720
There, it’s tremendous.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.840
Very well done, this should attract their attention.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.960
But, I mean, for Americans I don’t know how you should start.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.560
From their keeps onwards, I don’t know...

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.960
What they think of Jung here?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.840
I don’t know, not, I think there is, I think a small society, but

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.440
i don’t know if they are very strong or not.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.840
Shri Mataji, the Jungians made a date Theosophical Society.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.440
They mated the Theosophical Society.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.760
So i don’t think there is many of them,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.440
i don’t think they have their own

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.360
rooms as such, must be a small group.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.840
This Theosophical Society, [...]

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.000
But you haven’t given the places where She will be,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.760
and that will be in the newspaper I think.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.480
Yes, this was the poster we handed with it, Shri Mataji.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:51.800
Good, very straight forward, very straight forward.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.800
That will appeal to Australians, because Australians are

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.920
very straight forward people.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.440
Written, "elusive union", elusive, elusive is the word?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.360
That, "still see that elusive union", OK?

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.800
Elusive, elusive means, hard to grasp.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.640
Its a "e", [Hindi? Ne], is it with an "e"?, "elusive"?,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.200
[Hindi?...] "e" is it with an "e"?,  yes yes.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.440
[...] Its difficult to get to, difficult to grasp.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.320
Till now use it, till now, till now.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:23.360
Elusive means [Hindi...]

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.880
This one, is very [...], I mean, you have written so much,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.520
that to digest is going to be difficult.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.600
But, one point could have been that,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.680
this is the age of our ascent, age of ascent.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.160
This is the age of our ascent, is our evolution.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.120
See, that sounds very scientific also,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.600
Because we have reached the human stage,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.960
than we have to ascend after that.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.400
And what is, there must be something.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.720
So, is one of those things that may appeal to the scientist,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.480
lets point.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.400
Done so well, who is this one, Stan Bostoc?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.360
[...], he doesn’t exist.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.800
It was written by Brian Bell

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.120
This gentleman came to see Me?

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.960
No, no, it’s made up Shri Mataji, to get the press interested.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.880
He’s done it, Mister and Brian Bell has not been into my house.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.920
How has he described it so well?

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.960
Brian Bell, Shri Mataji, and Ian Hanky made the story up.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.600
Ah!

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:30.400
In America somewhere it’s to hard to check, so it’s..., helps.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.800
He never came to London, did he?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.800
Brian Bell did, i think, OK no, Brian Bell?

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.120
I think he has been. The press, the press like the article very much.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.400
I think he has been to [...].

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:54.200
Brian Bell has been to London. [...]

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.160
All this you have given?

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.560
Yes Shri Mataji.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.920
Poor things, they must be already having [...] casualty.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.960
It has affect on them, they said it.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.160
It has affect on them Shri Mataji, they...

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.120
Mean what?

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.960
This has an affect on the reporters, they can be very crooked.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.480
So, this is what achieve the TV interview.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.480
Means what?

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.400
This, this press key, plus we had a small video

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.640
[...] interview in England.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.720
I think about Cambridge, Hm, Cambridge color vision interview.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.840
Yes, who is given to the journalist.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.840
Cambridge one, yes.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.360
Was that? You where walking with a reporter, lady reporter

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:24.120
No, no a Sahaja Yogi from Cambridge, [...]

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.800
Jim, a Sahaja Yogi in Cambridge. Jim yes,yes.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.400
You where walking with him and the television.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.000
He came to see Me.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.920
You gave realisation to a lady in a park.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.800
Cambridge television.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.160
I don’t remember.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.840
[...]

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.720
No, there was one thing that happened,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:57.480
That happened in that place Middlesbrough,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.680
is that the name of the place, Middlesbrough? Yes.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.520
You see, there the journalist came and they said:

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.920
Now supposing, who is sick and cannot come to you,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.880
what can you do for that person.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.640
No, not that one. That one was interesting.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:18.960
So the brought Me, I said than let me have the photograph of the lady.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.840
They said, she is the one she cannot get out of her house,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.960
and she is suffering from a disease,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.120
that she doesn’t want to meet anyone, she doesn’t want to go out.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.800
I said alright, let Me see.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.800
So I took the photograph in my hand

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.480
and just gave a bandhan, that’s all, looked at it.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.400
And I was amazed that,

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.920
I told them, don’t worry now for some time, wait for 8 days.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.600
But I was amazed the way they where in a [...].

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.000
So they went to, after all that, they went to see her.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.960
And they found that she had gone out with her husband

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.600
on the [...] for a walk, you see, that one worked.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.520
But I don’t remember the Cambridge fellow.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.480
At the end of the interview you told people

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.720
to put their hands to the television set.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.840
What happened?, I can’t hear.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.080
At the end of the interview on the tape,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.600
that we gave the channel 7,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.040
You asked the people to hold their hands towards the television set

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.440
Alright, to feel the cool.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.840
And then they felt the cool breeze? Yes, Shri Mataji. Really? Yes.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.200
And the reporter,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.840
What will I do with my ears,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.480
just now they are not alright with them [...]

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.360
[...]

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.440
I’m tired. North America.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.400
That’s the story of North America.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.800
After a big lecture we give, yes.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.480
I giving them such a detailed description, ah terrible.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.680
I mean, mental level is, I don’t know what happens,

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.160
the caliber is, just stupid people.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.360
That all sick, sick people, sick.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:28.520
[...]

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:55.760
So we can invent stories and things, but main thing is,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.640
to reach this people.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.440
What is the best way, should find out.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.440
If they are seekers, if they are true seekers,

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:10.560
what is the best way of reaching them.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.920
Lets just find out, what is their problem.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.320
After all, why are they misbehaving and not coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.240
Shri Mataji we having [...]

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.840
I use this machine, because it’s so much of,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.320
this traveling has made my ears absolute, you see, wobbly.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.440
Can hear at time, at the time I don’t, let’s see if it’s working.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.680
So funny thing.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.040
How much traveling I have done, it’s been to much.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.320
[...]

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.080
Done by one doctor, so the doctor has to put it.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.520
Just trying on the right ear more, not so much in the left.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:08.840
Now? Now [...]

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.400
[...]

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.160
Its better, slightly better.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.000
[...]

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.440
This is the better ear. [...]

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:35.480
Try in this one, see, this is meant for this ear.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.800
My one ear is alright according,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.960
[...]

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:52.120
[...]

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.480
Try again, ha.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.040
Something funny.

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.680
The amount of traveling I have done,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.920
you will be really surprised.

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:20.720
Even you did not do with this st buses, it was so much.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.000
Its a little funny [...]

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.880
They said you have to put it underneath this ear here.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.880
First of all and then push it back.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:52.120
First you have to push it underneath this and then push it back.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.280
You have to push it underneath this, first of all.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.440
Underneath that, ha?

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.960
[...]

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.200
Now, [...]

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.280
Is it better?, horrible.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.960
First you travel, then you loose you hearing,

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.240
then you push this in your ears.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:32.400
Its a vicious circle. You have taken all that in that tape, good.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.560
So now nobody will trouble me with traveling.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.280
That cannot be avoided.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:45.480
[...]

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.760
Shri Mataji, we have been receiving lots of fan post,

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.400
people inquiring about the public program.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.320
You had lots of them? Oh I see.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:05.800
So we’ll have a big... turn out, I hope so.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.040
What, this is what you should not feel disappointed.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.400
When I am there you’ll find crowds, always.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.640
It happens also in London, you’ll be surprised.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.440
This time in London I could not walk through.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.120
It was such a crowd.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.800
Half where standing outside, they couldn’t even hear me.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.760
But, next time they had the meeting,

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.840
only 30 people arrived.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.240
And [...] was sitting like this, what to do.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.600
They just want to hear me, all the time.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.200
But at least, you have here ashram.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.120
They don’t have an ashram until the shuddy camp is done.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.760
There is going to be a big problem and

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.640
till then, they are going to have a big problem,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.280
getting people around.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.440
Maybe with shuddy camp I’ll do it [...]

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.320
With the shuddy camp thing they might work out better.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.240
If shuddy camp works out in that way.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.040
[...]

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.480
Its a very short one I think, David Spiro has given us.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.760
[...]

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.320
[...]

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.240
[...]

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.400
[...]

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.800
[...]

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.360
[...]

00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960
[...]

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.280
Perfect now.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.640
Better, I hope so. I hope so.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:23.160
Otherwise I will ask them to shout at me.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.840
It’s better to confess.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.920
But, you see the traveling was like so continuous you see,

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.960
continuous traveling.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.120
And also, keeping awake in the night was,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.080
too much, everyday, everyday.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:53.480
Australia has done very well in Sahaja Yoga, Yoga, I must say.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.560
Has done well. On the whole, if you see. On the whole.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:12.240
Only problem comes in with a,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.600
with the government and all those things, you see.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:23.440
Like in Rome the government has accepted.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.200
Is that... They are helping me.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.480
They paid for the posters, didn’t they in Rome? Paid for the posters.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.760
Lots of proposals,

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.680
and that helping them a lot.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.120
So, there are people very constructive by nature.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.080
First I went to Rome,

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.960
it was in a very bad condition.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.880
The economy had gone down and people did not what to do,

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:56.280
what to make and how to rise, big problem.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.000
I said, it’s alright it will work out

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.920
let Sahaja Yoga be settled down,

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.960
then Sahaja Yoga started settling down.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.080
But I told them, why not people make things which are not

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.760
easily made in other places, handmade things,

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.960
like tiles and things like that.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.560
And now it’s prosper

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.920
Everywhere you go, into any shop, say in Belgium

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.120
or in France, anywhere.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.080
It’s only Italian goods you see,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:30.720
only Italian goods.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.560
Surprising they do printing, also you have ties,

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:39.080
you have clothes, everything from there.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.120
Handmade woods, handmade woods Shri Mataji, all handmade.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.400
That’s the thing, they took to handmade.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.880
Because they are very good at..., very good at.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.360
Furniture they make, beautiful furniture, at a very cheap price.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.880
Very beautiful furniture, in labour an all that,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.160
and they are doing so well.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.400
While, what we are doing is

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.800
going in one line only.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.160
Now, produce with machinery,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.480
[...] people are feed up.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.320
They don’t want to have anything of machinery.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:19.040
Now you can’t get anything here, now cotton is so expensive.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:23.400
Anything natural is so expensive.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.680
So, specially in England

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.800
you can’t get cotton clothes even for children.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.920
I think we have trouble here getting some cotton clothes, don’t we?

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.040
They come from India, don’t they? cotton clothes? ...

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:47.160
I can’t here him still well, better try on this ear, maybe.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.760
I can hear, but not so well as I should hear.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.360
Mind me.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:43:00.280
[...]

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.360
[...]

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.200
It’s to much of vibrations, you see, in the ear [...].

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:24.720
So difficult, takes about a day to settle down.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.560
After Puja Shri Mataji, or after traveling.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.920
And more with the car journey I get, get  more with the car journey.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.840
The whole day today We are traveling, you see.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.920
Whole day Shri Mataji, oh yes, whole day.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.720
[...]

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.560
[...]

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:07.960
[...]

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.240
[...]

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:18.720
Such vibrations, they couldn’t hold my feet

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.280
Now, what are you doing, better stop.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.720
All operation stopped,

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.480
because they will be upset, you see,  to see.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.160
Can we open [...], what is your crusade.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:43.760
What is?, your crusade, crusade.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.520
Crusade?, purpose, crusade, purpose.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.680
[...] , what is your crusade.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.680
Crusade, but there is no crusade at all.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.680
But what you can call it, is a movement.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.800
You see, crusade is rather sharp, isn’t it?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.800
It reminds me of the war of the roses, crusade.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.720
Or i think, well, my definition of crusade is, it means that,

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.840
spiritual revolution, yeah, i know

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.920
[...] to some kind of motivation all through, Yeah.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:22.440
No, it’s a movement, it’s a movement, is a,

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:29.720
the movement is, this is,

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.840
a evolutionary time.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.440
This time is, people are not aware of it,

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.200
but is indicated in many scriptures.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:46.320
That this modern times, people will be

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:53.640
so fed up, that they will ascend.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:00.640
They will ascend to a higher awareness, yes.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:06.480
And I am quite aware of that, that those times are here

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.600
and they have to ascend

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.760
Now, only thing I have done is,

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.240
of course i knew, how one can ascend.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:23.960
That there is an energy within us, which is a residual energy,

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.040
which is called as Kundalini.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.160
A very ancient science,

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.320
but also is used in the Bible,

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:38.520
as said that, I will appear before you like tongues of flames.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.960
Also Christ has promised to send the Holy Ghost.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:49.920
The Holy Ghost reflected within us, is the Kundalini.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.320
People don’t know about Holy ghost, what is this Holy Ghost.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:01.560
But that’s the energy and that’s the energy of Gods desire.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.920
So it’s a pure energy, pure desire within us.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.080
And this is the desire, unless and until it is fulfilled,

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.000
we cannot be satisfied with any other desire.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.800
All other desires are useless,

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.080
because we want a car, then we want a house, they want this,

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.400
we are never satisfied. The reason is, that’s not a pure desire.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:29.880
Now this resides in the triangular bone within us.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:34.760
What you call the Sacrum, see the word Sacrum itself means sacred.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:41.320
This Greeks must be knowing the word, so they call it Sacrum.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.520
So this rises, awakened,

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.520
It rises like a [...] in a seed,

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.200
and pierces through 6 centers,

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.760
which are placed in medulla oblongata,

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.520
in the back part of our head.

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.320
And then, ultimately through the limbic area

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.240
it pierces through the fontanelle bone area.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.040
And then, you get a cool breeze coming out of your own head.

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.800
You feel very relaxed and thoughtless.

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:31.640
Now the question [..], in all [...] to east and west civilization is,

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.320
is the western civilization enslaved by the mammon?

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.160
And if you don’t  know what mammon is, it’s a god of materialism.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.480
What’s it?

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.400
Is the west enslaved by materialism?

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.400
He’s asking, is the west enslaved by materialism, Shri Mataji.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:55.120
Is the west enslaved by materialism.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.360
Makes a god of Materialism, has it made a god of materialism.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:05.280
Yes that’s very true, they are going towards materialism.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.880
But they are realizing that’s not the right path.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.440
They are realizing slowly, you see.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.640
Say you started with plastics,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:19.520
now you know how horrible this plastics is.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.560
You started with other artificial things,

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.760
and you found out they where no good for your body.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:32.760
Then even your live style, when you try to have

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.320
this kind of artificial relationships,

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.720
you found out it did not work out.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.280
Nature took this respite.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:49.720
So, going to unnatural things doesn’t give you

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:54.400
any good results.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.600
Now the Spirit is always trying to fight the matter.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.880
All the time, the Spirit is fighting the matter,

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:07.800
is trying to rise above the matter.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:14.440
Like supposing, we are used to something, we cannot give it up.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:20.240
Any habit formation is coming from the matter.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.120
There is, at the same time

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.720
when people are taking to materialism, at the same time

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.600
there are many people who are thinking,

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.160
that there must be something beyond it.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.280
Is it something beyond materialism. What that?

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.120
Is there something beyond materialism.

00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.320
Is there something beyond materialism.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.400
Of course, much much more.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:02.360
And you see, actually materialism is going down, down the line.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:09.080
Everything is upside down, that is materialism.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:16.800
An upward movement, which is toward the Spirit,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.840
takes you to reality.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.880
What is reality,

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.200
is that you are the spirit, not the matter.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.560
What sort of [...] of advice or help can you give Australian

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.120
to our [...] materialism, who are involved in,

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.520
or should we they obsessed with

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.600
that [...], their videos [...]

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.520
What sort of advice would you

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:55.480
like to give to Australians, who are so much

00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:00.040
bound by their materialism, by their cars, by there videos,

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.160
[...]

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.480
[...]

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:15.360
It’s very simple, as soon as they become the Spirit,

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.960
they give up all these things overnight, you’ll be surprised.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.480
We had drug addicts, in London,

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.080
who came in a condition, we can call it as a coma condition, see.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:36.720
Horribly addicted to drugs, overnight they gave up, overnight.

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:41.840
Because Spirit is the power.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.800
No matter can overpower a person who is spiritual,

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.920
in the real sense of the word.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.600
They just give up.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.160
So many Australians we have now here, it must be at least, how many?

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.680
Oh, there was 400 odd, 400 odd and that was not all of them.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.440
They are the people who are practicing, practicing Sahaj,

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.120
but otherwise we have many more, who just given up

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.160
all these habits.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.760
I don’t tell them anything.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.360
I don’t say, don’t do it, because half of them would run away.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.440
But it happens, and when it happens, then they just give up.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.640
Alright, how do we become the Spirit?

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:28.440
As I told you, that there is this power within you,

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.280
which is to be awakened.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.960
I can awaken your power, he can awaken,

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.880
all of them can awaken.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:40.920
I mean, once they get the light, they can do it.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.360
They become a powerful personality, nothing can dominate you,

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.320
you do not dominate anyone.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.480
You are no more a reactionist,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.880
but you are very substantial.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.120
You see, these days people are just reactionist,

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:05.320
they are nothing themselves.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:13.440
And you can feel

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.840
the divine power,

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:20.960
within and without, you can feel it.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.600
It’s like a cool breeze in the hands,

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.320
you can feel it which surrounds us.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:35.520
What inspires you personally to spread,

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:41.560
[...]

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.240
Sorry, sorry, i was asking, what inspires you personally to,

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.400
What inspires you personally to come out and

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.320
do this, he said, was the question?

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:58.880
So satisfied, once you get it, you will also do the same.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:03.960
It’s like saving people from getting drowned.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.840
Materialism is destructive,

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.560
it will destroy human beings.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.280
This one is the constructive work.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.760
You construct good families, good children,

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:28.720
good people, honest, honorable,

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.440
virtuous, righteous.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:35.920
These qualities shine trough your personality.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.400
Want you have a cup of tea [...], where will you keep.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.760
Ha, the table [...]

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:11.600
Tell me what is the secret the selfrealisation.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.640
What is the secret of the selfrealisation.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.320
Secret is that,

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.280
now, no more a secret.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.840
The secret is no more a secret.

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:30.600
Is a simple thing, that within you, is the, power lies.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:36.280
Somebody who is authorized, by the divine,

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.200
is not that a church, or a temple, or a mosque

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.800
they cannot authorize.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.680
The authority cast must come from the divine.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:49.600
And a person who has that divine authority,

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:53.920
can give selfrealisation.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:03.440
What would you say to people,

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.960
for say, Australians [...]

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.960
I’m dragging this personally, since Australians, but how,

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.760
how can they help for saving those Australians,

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.720
who wake up feeling sorry for themselves each day,

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.640
who have no feel no, further so well in life itself.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.480
He is asking, how can this help Australians,

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.120
who wake up in the morning

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.600
feeling sorry for themselves, so not having anything to,

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.440
inferiority, any purpose,

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.560
or any purpose in their lives.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.800
They wake up feeling that they have no purpose, how can this help.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.120
Yes, that’s what they feel

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.560
But you see, once you become realized soul,

00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:55.000
you start working for god.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:02.440
You have powers to awaken others.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:08.520
You have powers to cure others.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.840
And, you have powers to express yourself.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.600
And I would say, the greatest power a human being gets,

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.000
is the collective consciousness.

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:33.800
Can you explain this enlightened state

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:37.640
that life being struck by a lightning bolt, or what?

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.720
He’s asking, could you please explain it, is it like being

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.080
trucked by a lightning bolt, or what, could you please explain,

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.560
that is what he’s asking. What lightning?

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:51.320
Then it takes, for the Kundalini to rise, little bit.

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:57.200
Sometimes some people do feel, tickling in the hands,

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.600
before feeling the cool breeze.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.480
That suggests that there is something wrong on their centers,

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.760
that’s all.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.320
These, all these pictures they have given,

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.880
or whatever they have written about Kundalini, is all false.

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.280
Because they where not authorized.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.200
You see, a person, who doesn’t know about electricity,

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.280
puts his hands in the plugs

00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.520
and says that, i got a shock.

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:24.800
That means he doesn’t know the job, you see.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.720
They are not authorized, you have to have

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.960
a person who is authorized by divine.

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:35.680
You must have also a character and a caliber.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:41.960
Not only that, but a life which is pure.

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.040
There is

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.880
no hypocracy in Sahaja Yoga, no no hypocracy.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.600
Because whatever you do,

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.680
whatever you say, is the same.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.680
There is no hypocracy. As soon as you try to become, say,

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.960
hypocritical some times, then you loose your vibrations.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.040
It’s automatic, I don’t do it, it’s automatically.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.320
And you don’t what to loose them.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.480
Because all the well being is finished.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:24.680
Is any after life reward for this [...],

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.360
[...] conscience.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:35.080
He’s asking, is any after life reward for this state.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.920
Many, after all you see,

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.800
but may you say after life in the sense, or after dead.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.160
Yes, you mean after death, hm.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.760
You see, first of all,

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.640
when you are not a realized soul,

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.680
we have no decision power.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.240
When to be born, how to be born, to whom to be born.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.760
We have no decision, no direction.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.960
Then when, if you are a realized soul,

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.640
like many children in Sahaja Yoga are realized souls, born.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.120
Many great people are born.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.680
They have chosen their parents, who are realized souls.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.640
They are very beautiful children,

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.560
and very sweet children.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.200
Very well behaved and very intelligent.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:41.280
They top the race everywhere, get all the prices, no problems.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.280
Just going back to the question about

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.960
the afterlife do exist, there is an energy.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:57.040
A positive energy or a negative energy?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.400
But, after life you mean after death, after death.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.800
[...]

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.720
You talk about the present, what is after death why are you worried.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.920
[...]

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:15.320
What is he?, It’s a big question seems to found everywhere.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.800
It’s a big question what happens after death,

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.280
that seems to haunt a lot of people.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:23.960
And so do, how do we exist after death was his first question.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.640
Oh, I see, anyone isn’t it. Yes anyone. You mean anyone?

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.280
So when people die, you see as I told you.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:36.240
There are people who are mediocre, you see.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.040
They just live like, you should say, ordinary people

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.960
with insurances, this, that and then they die.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.800
Such people, when they die,

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.600
their soul remains.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.720
In the sense,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:05.480
the Kundalini and the Spirit

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.480
remains.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.640
Plus, there are 4 elements within us.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.040
The essence of that remains with the soul, 4 elements.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.720
The earth element drops out.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:25.880
So these 4 elements, the essence of that,

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.480
they remain with the soul.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:35.600
Now, if they mediocre, they just hang around you see,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.080
if they are attached to a wife, or this and that,

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:43.520
they may possess also.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:57.000
They go into our collective subconscious area.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.360
Most of them.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:02.280
And are born again,

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.280
without any choice.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.320
But some of them, later on,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.200
say, if there is a politician who is very ambitious

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.920
and he doesn’t want to die very soon,

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.160
and he has to die, goes out of grace, by something.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.920
Then he is born again, in a way,

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.760
that he possesses another politician.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:41.640
and for the time being, that politician appears to be a very

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.240
smart fellow, you see.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.040
As if he is giving some good,

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.600
advices and good proposals.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:55.560
But after some time he’s becoming absolutely useless.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:02.200
They become very ambitious, arrogant,

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:09.840
and we can say, devoid of all collective feelings.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.840
They don’t worry about public

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:15.760
they are only worried about their own ideas.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.680
But such politicians after some time are exposed.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.280
To public, or they themselves feel sick,

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.600
and that’s how they [...], that’s their situation.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.040
Do you expect for the corrupt ones, have to come back in the next life.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.800
Sorry, do you expect for the corrupt politicians have to come back

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.680
to justify their past [...].

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:50.760
He’s asking do very corrupt politicians,

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.200
they get reborn again as,

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:58.240
in a man at, so it’s to justify their past lives.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.880
No, they have first of all possessed someone.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.120
They try their hands on some other corrupt ones, you see.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.760
That’s how we are getting corrupter and corrupter , you see.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.880
First there where not such corrupt politicians.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:14.320
Now we find they have becoming more corrupt.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.120
Then, the reason is the very corrupt ones, you see,

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:24.560
actually are added up by these corrupt ones.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.960
They give them strength.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.280
So these politicians become extremely corrupt

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:40.360
and they are not at all aware

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.080
that by doing such a thing,

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.320
we will be all finished and ousted.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:52.200
Also these

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.080
dead ones, the entities give them ideas,

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.800
how to hide their malpractices.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.640
Will be possible then,

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.800
just judging by your argument that say many ultimate,

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.840
sort of able politician arrow people,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.880
absolute direct it all, or had some [...]

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.880
[...] leader.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:26.320
Was, is it possible then that, was Adolf Hitler was he

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.160
possessed by some other being, or,

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.960
Rather after he died.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.760
or could he, after he died, Of course he could,  possess someone?

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:40.520
He could, he could, but he has to have a strong personality

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.720
to possess, you see, he was a horrid devil.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.120
Do you know who the premier of Queensland is?

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.760
Do you know who the prime minister of Queensland is, the premier.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.880
The premier, premier, of where?, of Queensland. I don’t know.

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:18.560
It’s a man from the [...]

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.640
He has [...] inspired people by his leadership.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.720
[...]

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:29.640
[...] What did he say.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.720
He said, he hasn’t people inspired by his leadership.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.600
This premier of Queensland.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.080
Some may say, he’s turning a state into a mini dictatorship.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.480
Would it be possible that he, He’s turning into?, dictatorship.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.040
Ha, a mini dictatorship is what he has...

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.120
You see, I would not say about one particular one. OK.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.920
That will be this thing. But all those,

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:59.000
who become like that, should know, that they are being possessed.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.240
And they have to be careful.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.920
You see, once you start doing such a thing

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.880
then they can be possessed.

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.840
If you try to do something which is not publicly good,

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.240
and something you become arbitrary, you can call the word arbitrary

01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:27.680
is better, you see, arbitrary.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.320
Then somebody can jump on them, you see,

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.080
waiting for such a character.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.080
But I would not say about anyone particular,  in particular.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.160
But there are some,

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.880
realized soul, who can become prime ministers

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.440
and can do a lot of good.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.160
If they take up a prime minister ship.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.200
But normally they are not so much interested in politics.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.680
That’s the trouble with them.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.800
Can these spirits, he’s a bound spirit, come out and cease to exist.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.160
[...]

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.000
Which the spirit sort of people, who are dead,

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.440
How?, I’m sorry what was the question?

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.560
Can they cease to exist.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:32.440
How can these, or can these spirits cease to exist.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.240
Yes they can,

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:40.760
they can cease to exist if you do not use this black magics

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.240
and all these false gurus

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:49.520
and all kind of this money makers, in the name of god.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.520
It depends on what you want.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.320
If the public wants

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.720
people who make money in the name of god,

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.760
in the name of religion,

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.920
even in the name of yoga.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:19.280
Then they exist, because these people use these spirits only

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.920
to befool.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.960
[...] by Your past,

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:32.280
the past definition that someone who,

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.760
someone say, politician for example who draw,

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.240
who draw that to the negative,

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.120
draw that to the negative spirit or energy.

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.160
[...]

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:46.040
They use them, as what She explained, they can use them.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.400
He’s asking that, can even politician use

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.200
such type of negative spirits.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.160
Of course they do, they want it.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:01.360
Most of the politicians and also you can say bureaucrats,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.080
are more interested by these things.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.280
Than by a thing that is pure and simple.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.720
they are more interested.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.480
Because you see, what they want, say they want a higher power,

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.640
they want to oust someone, they want to defeat someone,

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:23.160
so they use these people.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.200
I’m sorry can You just clarify,

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.960
is it the case of the spirit using the

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:31.080
the person, the flesh or is it the

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.880
or is it the flesh using the spirit.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.280
He’s asking that, is it the question of the

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.880
flesh using the spirit, or the

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:47.080
people who are, the dead spirits in this, using the people.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:52.640
Because earlier You had mentioned something about the person,

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:56.520
the [...] and getting into the politician or so on.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.200
They get in and do they also use them, this is the question.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.600
Yes, yes, they do, they do.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:08.520
You see now, do you know who was the guru of Hitler.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:14.080
Lama, he was a Lama, a Tibetan Lama.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.160
This, same Lamas forefather.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.280
I’m sorry, Dalai Lama.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:24.120
Dalai Lama was the guru of Adolf Hitler.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.520
The guru, ah the guru yes, is like a teacher,

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.280
or a mentor, teacher.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.520
Which Dalai Lama, not, a Lama.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.120
What are the Lamas. No, no Dalai Lama himself, not this one.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.480
His forefathers, the one before, at a time whosoever it was.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.880
Maybe his grandfather,

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080
because they have no fathers or anything, you see.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.080
They are picked up from here and there, like that.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.920
He was his guru.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.080
[...]

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.960
Spiritual guru.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.840
He was a spiritual guru, he had Dalai Lama.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.400
[...]

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.360
Not this Dalai Lama,

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:14.040
at that tine Hitler had another Dalai Lams, who was his guru.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.200
[...], this is a response to your question,

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.600
could Hitler have used these spirits,

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.920
and he had learned all this from the Lamas.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.960
And also the dead bodies,

01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.320
they use dead bodies, those people who practice this

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.000
kind of a black magic, they use dead bodies.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.600
Supposing an evil genius dies, you see,

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.800
they get after that and they try to get his skull, or something.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:49.520
Just to overpower him and they use him.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.760
Did you follow.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.360
Supposing an evil genius dies, yeah, alright.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.720
Some evil genius dies, alright.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.120
So these people come to know that somebody has died like that.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.680
So they’ll get after that body,

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.920
follow that body, is an ancient knowledge in our country,

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.800
this is nothing new I’m telling you, we know all these things.

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.840
That’s why we are out of it.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:18.160
They go, follow that body and get hold of the skull of that body.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:22.520
Because we burn the bodies, you see.

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.200
And then use the, use see bind that fellow,

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:33.320
enslave that evil genius and use him for torturing others.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.240
This is a very old knowledge of our country.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.520
Everyone knows about this knowledge,

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.400
and they know what this people do,

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.960
so nobody likes to go near them, very few.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.840
But the modern people, you see, who have had modern education,

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:57.840
they have no idea, so they go to these people.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.320
In our country also, in Delhi if you see,

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.120
there are lots of these people.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:06.840
Like in Canberra as I came, I said, terrible.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.120
In Canberra there must be many.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:14.440
Because My left side was caught up, I couldn’t even walk.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.400
Horrible people must be there in Canberra sitting down,

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.440
doing this kind of work.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.240
But i think anyone what [...] the point [...]

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.080
He agrees with you.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.240
Oh, I tell you, really. I mean, I couldn’t walk.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.080
I couldn’t walk one step forward.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:36.520
He doesn’t know Shri Mataji, sensitivity to vibrations.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.760
Whenever there is power, they are settled there,

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.960
and they befool these people, these bureaucrats,

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.920
or these politicians, these people.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.560
Just to wound up, a very enlightening interview can this, beg pardon,

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.360
just to wound up to end a very enlightening interview,

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.840
can I ask you, do you have a message for the world.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.360
Do you have a message for the world.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:12.120
The message is, that, take to reality.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.800
Take to reality, that’s what it is.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.840
One has to take to reality.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.520
Seek the reality, and nothing artificial.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:39.560
Nothing superficial and wrong ideas.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.440
These powers are within you, they are all there.

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.320
You have to just get it, that’s all, don’t pay for it,

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.560
you can’t pay for it.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760
In answer to your question,

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.280
yes, you're respectable whether you are a christian or not.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.600
No,...

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.560
I’m just trying to...

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.240
You want to know, whether even if you're a christian,

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.240
whether you can still be possessed, or you get into these things.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.160
He is going back to the middle of the interview,

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.960
he wants to know that if you're a christian,

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.680
means you go to church, or you have been confirmed, or whatever,

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.320
can you still be affected by these dead spirits.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.440
By all means, you are not connected with god.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.880
You are not connected with god,

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:02.880
Christians mean, doesn’t mean, that you are, you are one with god.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:07.440
You have to be connected, that’s what Christ has said.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.440
You have to be connected, isn’t it.

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.040
He said you have to be born again.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.000
You see, we just put a certificate, i'm a christian, so what.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.680
God doesn’t know that.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.800
He has said it in the second chapter Mathews, he said.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.200
In the second chapter in the second verse.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.120
You will be calling me Christ, Christ, I will not know you.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:29.240
That’s really, he has said, he said it in many ways.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:32.800
That Christianity doesn’t lay in, going to the church, at all.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.960
It lies in, becoming connected with god.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.080
Shri Mataji is born christian.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.960
Shri Mataji was born christian, She comes from a christian family.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.680
So many Christians doing this work.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.120
Charismatic movement is what.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.280
This seven, or what you call that.

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.200
Pentecostals, this one, same thing, possession.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:59.080
Pentecostal have you seen, people, Pentecostals. Yes, yes.

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.840
That’s all possession, yes, yes.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.360
Charismatic movement, is all possession.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.320
I find it difficult, to deal with them,

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.240
they are terrible, they shake before me.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.960
So, how can it be.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.400
Christianity can only be achieved, when you are connected with god.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Islam, Mohammed Sahib has said it clearly,

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.640
that you should be connected with god,

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.080
then only you can surrender.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.760
There’s no connection yet established.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:31.840
But you can profess a connection, can’t you.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.960
You can say, you are connected.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.000
What you mean, already you can be connected or just be saying it.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.320
I can tell you i am connected,

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.480
just to impress you Shri Mataji.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.560
Yes, he is saying that,

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:51.040
supposing I want to impress you, I can say I'm connected to god.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:54.160
That is not saying, you get powers.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.880
You see, somebody, somebody says i'm now a twice born.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.200
Alright, you put a certificate there, so you are not.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.520
You see, supposing you are a governor,

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.680
supposing you say i am the governor of this place,

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.320
then you have powers of a governor, isn't it.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:10.720
You must have the powers,

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.360
if you don't have the powers, you cannot raise the Kundalini,

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.600
you cannot give self realisation,

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.560
you cannot feel collective consciousness,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.560
you cannot feel all-pervading power,

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.680
you cannot cure people, how are you, a twice born.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.040
Just a false certificate.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:33.920
That's why there has been problem.

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.400
We are dealing with falsehood, not with reality.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.320
You see the point.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.280
Among Christians also, how many churches,

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.680
how many fights, how many arguments.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.760
Now recently, it was that with mafia,

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.040
and with Vatican and with, what, the Swiss Banks,

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:09.720
and Swiss Banks, are one. Is a connection between.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.200
What do you say to that, this is horrifying.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.720
And if you see the Iraqi and these other Arabs fighting,

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.160
how do you explain.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.880
Yes and the, the...

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.600
That's why the young people have no respect for god,

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.840
no respect for religion, logically.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.160
But, there is god, there is god.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.920
We must proof it now,

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.640
the time has come to proof the existence of god.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.560
Hitler called him as a very big christian himself.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.000
You don't know that, he used to call himself as a big christian,

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:59.760
and he protected all the christian churches in Germany.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.120
He could manage.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:04.120
Didn't he close down the churches [...]

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:07.400
No, he didn't close, he supported all the nuns,

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.120
he supported all the churches,

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:12.960
everything, he called himself as a christian.

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.240
And he was a vegetarian, on top of that,

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.560
what is it, strict vegetarian.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:26.320
Only believed in killing people in gas chambers, that's all.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:29.120
Horrible thing.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.920
All those who go to church, how much they achieved.

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:39.600
How much of righteousness of Christ,

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.280
how much his goodness, nothing.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.920
Why , why it has failed.

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:50.280
Because without connection with god, you cannot.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.400
You cannot understand religion, you cannot understand Christ.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:24:00.960
What we do so to, to try and form a connection, [...] we.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:04.440
What he say, can we, do go to church,

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.120
to try and form a connection with god.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.640
You see, the trouble is the one who gives you the connection,

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:13.200
has not authority.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:19.040
You see, it must come, the authority, must come from god.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:22.840
Those people have no, you are all simple people who go there,

01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:26.880
you see, I see them, because I come from christian family myself.

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:29.960
There are all simple people who go to church, thinking that,

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.480
we are in connection with god, but no

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.640
The person in charge there is a paid employee

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.680
So, we got it all wrong.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:47.800
He wants to know, whether we have got it all wrong.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.800
Have we got it all wrong.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.120
In a way and in a way not, because I will fulfill all the promises.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.000
That of that I’m sure, all the Christians,

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.480
they can be fulfilled with their promises.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.800
Because they have loved God, they have loved Christ.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:06.640
All of them, all those who have loved Christ,

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:10.280
will get their promises fulfilled.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.480
With or without the connection.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.360
You’ll just now get it.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.360
Is such a [...],

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.560
You can't help without the connection to God,

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.040
but Shri Mataji says that, you will have it.

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.880
You get the connection, If you loved Christ,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.160
If you love Christ, you will have it.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.280
If you have loved Christ, you'll get it.

01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.160
[...] of course. Is it nice doing here.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.080
She asked you also, if you would like to have it here.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.120
I love those, who love Christ. He said yes.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.840
[...]

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.840
Is not only in the churches, in all the religions

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.880
it is going on like this.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.840
This priesthood has nothing to do with god,

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.400
has nothing to do with god, that's the problem is.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.120
Some of them maybe good, I'm not saying all of them are like that.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.200
But goodness is not sufficient, they should to have power,

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.120
to connect you with god.

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.560
She ask you, whether you would like to do.

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.080
I give you just now. I think in my own way, i...

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.840
You get it just now, put your hands towards me, just like this,

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.520
and you'll get it, the cool breeze.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.600
You take out your shoes, that's all.

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.920
You can, just one minute, you will get the cool breeze in no time.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.560
If you have loved Christ, you will get it.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.760
Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:37.040
You all should feel it, now put your hands towards me.

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.280
A simple man and why shouldn't you get. Put your hands like this.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:47.320
He's got it. Just see on his head.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:56.200
You feeling the cool breeze in your hand, the sensation.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:58.360
I think so.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.520
Is there, on your head it is there.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.800
Just come out, see now, see for it.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.480
You are absolutely thoughtless now,

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:08.640
you are watching me without thoughts.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.760
But all the Christians must learn this point, that's all.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:18.280
They are not gone wrong, they have loved Christ.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.360
Ha, good.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:24.360
Feeling better now, just put your hands here and  see for yourself.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.560
Little higher.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.520
I think so.

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.880
There, is there. Let's have it also you come along.

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.840
Then you know better to write.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.440
Please take out your shoes for one minute, you can get it in no time.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.840
Ha, see you better now, much better.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.400
[...]

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.480
Please put both the feet.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.920
[...]

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.360
Nabhi blocked, nabhi, liver otherwise.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.640
Are you feeling any cool breeze,

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:21.320
I'm feeling relaxed, but not feel  any cool breeze.

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.760
Just  watch Me here, just watch me here,

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.280
and forgive. Forgive everyone, you have to forgive.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.200
Just say in your heart, that i forgive everyone,

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.000
alright, just say that.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.320
You see, your world is such, that you have to be little futuristic.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.720
That's why there's a little imbalance, that's all.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.280
Which I'm correcting.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.880
Is better, yes this, right vishuddi [...]

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:08.200
What's wrong. Just right here, because you talk,

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.040
you see, and all that, you have to talk all the time.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.360
That's why this is a little bit, put both the feet on the ground.

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:28.800
Left nabhi is, yeah, the heart Shri Mataji.

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.920
[...], is better.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.960
Now, there is no thought in your mind.

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:49.080
Is there any thought, let's see. You are thoughtless,

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.880
absolutely, you got it. Feeling anything in the hand.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:57.560
I feel [...] in my hands.

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.360
What are you feeling.

01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:08.440
I'm feeling nothing. A sensation.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:15.280
A sensation is [...] nothing, sensation, not yet.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.400
Now better, is good now.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:32.040
Cool breeze, or not yet, alright.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.080
You have to forgive, you see, this is the center of Christ.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.560
At this center you have to forgive. Now, You don't do that.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:42.720
He's feeling nervous this gentleman.

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:49.800
[...] You are married? No. Not yet.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.720
You want to marry? No. Is a trouble.

01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:01.920
[...] not to marry, that's what it is catching.

01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:09.280
You have to marry Sir, is important.

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.000
[...]

01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.760
[...]

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:32.960
[...]

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:43.560
Better now.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.960
[...], Hm?, Sushumna doesn't open.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.720
Sushumna. [...]

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.720
You have to ask me, [...] for self realisation,

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:09.200
cannot be forced, alright, I cannot force it on you.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.000
You have to ask for it, just ask for it.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:18.120
[...] my self realisation.

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.080
So important.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.680
[...]

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:54.160
You worked very hard Sir, shouldn't work that hard.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:56.600
[...]

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.200
Just say, I'm the spirit, in your heart. Say that I'm the spirit.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.560
[...] Say, I'm the spirit.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:17.920
Just again say, I'm the spirit. Just again say, I'm the spirit.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.120
Now better.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.760
Heart be catching.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.920
[...], Vishuddi, [...]

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:20.160
So much heat coming out. Now better? Perspiration is better? Yes.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.960
We work on your heart.

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:38.800
Better now. [...]

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.480
You shouldn't have worked so hard.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.480
He himself is a doctor.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.520
And a psychiatrist.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:02.880
Now, is a combination of left and right, both of that.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.600
[...] Left and right combination, Shri Mataji.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.240
It moves between one and the other.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:15.800
[...]

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:26.280
The Agnya, Agnya, come on, now, now it's coming.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:33.080
You want come, feel it? Convince yourself.

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:37.400
Feel the cool coming out on top of his head now.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:42.160
Feel it, it's there. Now you feel it on your left?

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.600
You think to much, don't think, don't think.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.240
We didn't do any wrong, you see,

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:14.200
you love Christ and you got it.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:18.680

Better now.

But what your hands. [...]

Not alright, are you feeling any cool breeze? Not yet.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.600
Can't cool down, perspiration has gone?

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:07.200
Now better.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:15.200
Alright, take this water, this will cool you down, your stomach.

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.080
Special liver is there.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:22.280
Au, [...] terrible liver,

Whatever you like. But only thing is his,

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:01.640
this liver is very bad.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.080
Also Vishuddi, ha, now better, better, the liver is released.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.160
[...]

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.360
Goes up to the heart, liver heat.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.640
You are not married, then you are your mother, father?

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.560
Live alone? Yea [...]. Just imagine, that's why.

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:36.320
Now.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.200
Ha, is better. You feel it here, this?

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.160
[...]

01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.040
Please take the water, please.

01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:00.640
[...] Here it is coming, cool breeze,

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.000

but in the hands, because of this center, is very hot.

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:11.400
This center is just like stone.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.960
[...]

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320
Feel it?

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.200
Move it like this and you will see it.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:30.280
I think so, yes.

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.960
[...]

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:42.400
It goes back you see, comes up here and goes back to liver.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:46.200
Now, what is it, you say.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:48.200
[...]

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.800
[...]

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:53.640
[...]

01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:59.360
Nabhi, he will marry later on.

01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.640
Alright, come along, drink that water.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:10.880
All the Australians have bad livers, that's one thing, very common.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.280
Sun, sun, too much sun.

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.880
Thinking to much.

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.760
Better [...], now he is thoughtless, [...]

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:33.480
What about in your hands, feeling it? Some sort of a breeze?

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.160
Dead, no, not.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:47.680
[...]

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.760
Hands are white Shri Mataji, the hands are white.

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:55.240
Alright I [...]

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.480
Relax.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.400
Left and right, both are catching.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.640
So it catch hold of this, both sides.

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:12.520
[...]

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.920
[...] swadisthana, hot, hot, very hot.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:29.160
You feel very hot all the time, [...]

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.240
[...] most of the time, Ha?

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.880
Most of the time. The skin, the skin is some much heated up.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.480
You sit in the sun? Sometimes.

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:48.280
Oh, too much, too much sun is not good.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.920
That creates terrible problems.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.920
See the heat, oh the ears, everything is heated up.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:11.040
Swadisthana is there.

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:17.640
[...]

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.440
You have liver too?

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.400
Put left hand, left hand on the liver, right hand towards me, yes.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:32.280
Better now?

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.040
How you’re feeling, relaxed? Yes. Cooler? Feel you cooler or not.

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.400
Still not feel it, to much heat. Better now, now, hands are cool.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.280
Hands are definitely cool now, must say. So now let's see.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.400
You must give it liver treatment.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.320
Very simple, you take it for 2 days, this heat will go away,

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.280
you fell very much better. [...]

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:07.960
You have got it now, we can feel it on your head.

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.920
It's coming out, but in your hands I think it's not there because of

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:16.080
the heat of the liver. Liver is very much heated up, is better now.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.960
[...]

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.360
Feel better?

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440
Better now.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:39.560
[...]

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.440
It goes back to here, to Agnya now. To where? Agnya.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:54.560
Alright, [...], there are just, just [...] it off, it will work out.

01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.720
[...], cool down, very much cool down, let's see.

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:06.680
[...]

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.400
It's better Agnya, Hamsa [...]

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:38.960
Alright, better now?

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:44.560
Feeling any cool in the hand? Not yet, nothing.

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.880
Alright, put your hands up in the air, and just ask a question.

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.440
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy ghost,

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:54.600
just ask the question to Me.

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.280
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.160
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.360
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.840
Ha, let's see, now?

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:12.480
Is it? No. Don't doubt yourself, you don't doubt yourself.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.640
You don't doubt, you’re doubting yourself.

01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:20.040
You cool down very much, his face, look at him.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.120
All the redness has gone, it's much cooler.

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:26.400
No? Nothing.

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.200
You been to any one of these people who teach and talk about,

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:34.920
dead things and all that?

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:40.160
No, sure [...] been. Know, you are catching on that chakra.

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.320
To someone, you been to someone who is

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.160
doing this kind of magic and all that. No.

01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.640
I've been to archive, went to a false guru, yeah I'm.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:55.680
I'm not personally myself, but i witnessed a few people who've been.

01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.960
You been reading about it.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:01.200
Who? He has witnessed it, seen something.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.440
[...]

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:09.480
What did you see? I saw,

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:12.880
I've seen a few people who've been

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.760
absorbed by false gurus and who've [...]. [...]

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.880
What did you see, you just tell him.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.440
He seen some people who've been to false gurus, Shri Mataji.

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.760
Interviewed them, you seen them how they have suffered?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.600
No, not how they suffered, but in therapy in some kind of treatment.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.840
He seen them in some sort of a treatment,

01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:40.560
in therapy or whatever they do.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:43.720
Whatever they do together.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.320
They worked on you also? No, but I've seen someone

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:50.800
who's in my family, have a treatment and this [...].

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.880
Have been. He has seen someone in his family

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:56.040
have this treatment, he observed it. I see.

01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:59.520
I see. Of the false gurus.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.040
And they suffered, or what?

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:09.080
Financially, Financially,...

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.720
That's the first, that's the first one.

01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.360
How much money you have in your purse, is the point.

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:19.520
You have, Rustum what you say?

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:22.480
Still on the Vishuddi, Vishuddi, Left Nabhi

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:27.080
is quite strong Shri Mataji, [ [INAUDIBLE] and Left Swadisthana.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.960
Left Nabhi comes from Left Swadisthana.

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.640
It should work out, actually his Vishuddi is

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:37.120
not so bad as his Nabhi is. Yes, Nabhi is very bad.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:39.960
Somebody has told you that you have a liver problem, or no?

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:43.000
Not as yet. Not yet.

01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.840
According to us, your liver is very heated up, alright.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:49.960
And you have to cool it down. Because of that,

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:53.080
you have so much of heat in the body, too much heat.

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:56.200
Heat is not a good thing, is not a constructive thing.

01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.920
And when the heat of the thing starts melting, I mean other things,

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.880
you get all kinds of complications from the liver.

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.880
So, there was perspiration, because it

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:11.960
also affects the heart. It [GOES, MOVES?] the heat.

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.280
You see, makes the heart pump more and into problem.

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.160
And these are all things connected with the liver.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.160
Of course, treatment to liver takes, doesn't take much time.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:23.200
It takes very hardly 2-3 days,

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.400
but you better take your treatment of liver, is very important.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.360
Because if the liver goes out, everything light becomes miserable.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.200
You cannot concentrate on anything and you feel like vomiting,

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.280
you don't feel like eating food and all things happen.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:46.120
And sometimes you feel also giddy and can go into another kind of a,

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:49.080
what you call, perversion of the thing.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:51.280
Can become very serious matter.

01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:55.360
So, right now the best thing is for you to get your liver done.

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.920
Though you have got cool breeze on your head, we can feel it.

01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:00.560
Left hand, [INDIAN WORDS]

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.000
let us see if you can feel on top of your head.

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:05.480
With your left hand, just see.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:10.080
Do you feel anything?

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.520
[INAUDIBLE] feel not anything. No?

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.240
Can't feel it, so, its alright.

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.040
The feelings are according to the nerves, you see, that are there.

01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.920
Now what has happened is, that your Vishuddi, this center,

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.920
is also,  because you talk too much with people, you have to talk

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.240
with them and all kinds of people you have to talk to.

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:31.200
So your right Vishuddi is catching, that is this center is catching.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.880
That's why the feeling is less, but it is there, he has [...] it.

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:38.480
And is there and you are feeling relaxed, now you will sleep well,

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.400
And if you can come sometime,

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.440
I'll treat your liver perfectly alright.

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:47.480
You must take treatment of your liver, alright?

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.440
But Australia is known for liver, bad liver.

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.520
Australia and France, experts on liver treatment.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.880
I think they drink and sit in the sun.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:01.560
All that is necessary to spoil the liver, they think too much.

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:03.560
Australians also think too much,

01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.960
that's why their liver is not alright.

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:09.720
But now you are not feeling better in any way?

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.720
It is more relaxed. Are you feeling relaxed?

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.840
[Acha?] now, are you also feeling cool down?

01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:21.960
Cool and [...]. Feel your hands. Feel cool?

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:26.000
Hands are cool now, cooler? Better.

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.160
I mean there is a trouble that's what is to be cured, you see

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:31.720
and has to be done, which will work out.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:35.040
So, any time whenever you are coming we'll work it out,

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.720
I will get you alright as far as that is concerned.

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.480
And then you will be surprised, that

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.360
your dynamism will be so great.

01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:46.280
Not that in your work, but you'll never be tired,

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.600
you never have this kind of complications,

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:50.560
you will work as much as you like,

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.440
it will be a witness state in which you will be.

01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:57.480
So you will never think about it and you will be very dynamic

01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.960
and very successful.

01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:04.000
But that has to work out, should not just left to be be half done.

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:07.640
Alright you understand. You also come along, establish yourself

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.200
and now give realisation to other Christians.

01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.600
Who are poor thing going to the church all the time,

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:15.640
morning til evening and receiving nothing.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:21.680
What are they receive? What have they got?

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:27.400
So you will be the real Christian. You can cure people.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:30.120
You can have the knowledge, everybody knows what's wrong with it,

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.280
on the fingertips.

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:40.240
On the fingertips, that's what it is reality.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.080
You have to feel it on your fingertips,

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.000
til you feel it they'll be after you. They are all perfectionists.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:49.360
Because now you have to go, its alright, but you come next day,

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.920
you come next to that, they'll work it hard and make you perfect.

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:59.680
Alright, may God bless you, may God bless you.

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:04.520
Thank you very much. May God bless you. Enjoy yourself. Thank you.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:13.480
All the journalist have this problem, you know you are another one.

01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:16.960
[...], most of them.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.800
Their right Vishuddi always catching, they talk too much,

01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:22.720
even the teachers have the same problem.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:26.720
Its alright, when you come next, we'll put you right.

01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:33.520
But now give a little constructive report about us.

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:36.240
So that we are helpful to people, you know this.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:39.200
Only we need you for this kind of thing,

01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:42.080
that you have to give them the right correct thing.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.480
That see, don't go to false gurus, don't pay them money.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:50.280
Don't do all these things, wasteful things, take to your own style

01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:53.880
which is within yourself, just get your own powers.

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:58.640
You don' have to go to somebody for that, just within you it lies.

01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:00.840
And how can you pay, God doesn't understand money.

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:05.040
Does he understand money? No.

01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:09.200
God doesn't understand money. How can you pay for God?

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.920
First thing, the one who says: "I need money for this", then cancel.

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.680
So many will be canceled like this.

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.680
You can't pay for God.

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:27.120
Its alright, I mean now I'm staying with them,

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:31.600
they are looking after me, give me food and all that, that's all.

01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:36.480
My I'm no expense otherwise.

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.720
When they come to my house, I look after them too.

01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:44.680
Ha, thank you very much, very nice meeting you.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:48.640
Oh, now it's cool and nice.

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.800
Alright, may God bless you. Thank you very much.  May God bless you.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:57.360
So, hope to see you some time for your liver trouble.

01:54:57.560 --> 01:55:00.840
We give you a prescription and you will be cured, alright.

01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.320
Will take no time for you to get cured.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.720
All of them had liver, all Australian Sahaja Yogis.

01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:12.120
May God bless you. Thank you very much.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.600
He has been to the false gurus, so he will know now

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:16.760
the value of Sahaja Yoga.

01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:23.960
[INDIAN ...]

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:32.080
He saw some relatives of his, go to some kind of a collective,

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:37.240
some sort of a therapy, with some such false

01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.960
therapists [...]. I think he has seen something horrible.

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:47.200
TM, i don't think it's TM, i think he has seen some [...]

01:55:47.400 --> 01:55:49.480
I think its TM. I think he has seen,

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:52.720
or he has seen something horrible.

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.720
And he also said his,  that relative of his lost out financially.

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.640
[INDIAN ...]

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.400
[INDIAN ...]

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.640
[INDIAN ...]

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.080
[INDIAN ...]

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:14.640
Bhagwan is beyond all this, God is beyond any formal...

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.080
I'm taking you to God. First give me your purse, you see,

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.200
God doesn't understand money, better give me.

01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:25.920
That's the logic.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:32.920
When he was asking you about

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:36.360
all that spirits and after dead and so on,

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:41.960
[INDIAN ...]

01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:46.640
[...] was going up and down, he was asking me about spirits.

01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.240
So many questions.

01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:55.040
He asked if they can possess the politicians, I said: "Yes they can".

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:59.760
He said that Queensland, Queensland Prime Minister

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.000
is becoming like a dictator. Yes.

01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:07.560
Do you think he is possessed. I said: "I can't say what one possess"

01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.360
I don't.

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.920
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer, Shri Mataji.

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.400
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:36.520
[INDIAN...] Rajeesh. What does he?

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.600
Queenslanders have the highest rate of skin cancer in the world.

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.080
[...]

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:46.480
What he said? He said in Queensland, this is the state of Queensland

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.600
Really!?

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.360
We are in Queensland now, that's why he was asking about Queensland.

01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:55.600
Is the capital, right? Brisbane,  Brisbane is the capital

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.360
of Queensland.

01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:01.120
And he said they have very high rate, or highest rate in Australia

01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:06.640
of skin cancer. [INAUDIBLE]

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:10.760
In the world, the highest rate in the world. Highest rate? Yes.

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.640
Of skin cancer. And also suicide I have heard. Oh.

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:17.120
Canberra, that's in Canberra.

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:21.840
But this one is definitely out for a skin.

01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:27.080
Already started it, the spots, you can see spots already.

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.960
Skin [...]. He's out for a skin troubles.

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:36.880
I told him in a way, whom did he go to.

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:42.040
Coming, [...]. He didn't remember the name.

01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:44.560
He said, he didn't remember the name of the people,

01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.720
but it was a Sydney based group

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:51.520
and they used to involve going into past live times. Oh yeah.

01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:54.720
What he's saying? He's saying he doesn't remember who he went to.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.320
It was a [...] it was not TM.

01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:02.200
But it was a group there is based in Sidney.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:07.360
And they go into the past lives of the people and

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:08.920
means all this what You was talking about.

01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:12.680
It's probably this [...] therapy You were reading about today.

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:22.400
I told him not to talk about the dead, they're wanted to know.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:23.760
But I told him, doesn't matter.

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:27.160
I told him this is all old knowledge to us.

01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:38.440
Its alright, he was quite impressed at it. I think so.

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.360
What did he say? Shri Mataji i told him to look in the mirror,

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.080
i told him his face looks different

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.720
and his friend said, "Yes it does".

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:51.560
He said, "Your complexion is better and your eyes look different".

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:53.400
So i told him to look in the mirror.

01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:56.680
You see this skin trouble as he say it's skin cancer,

01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.360
definitely [...].

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:11.360
They want to sit in the sun, oh yes, that must be the.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.440
Madness.

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:22.560
I really don't.

02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:29.040
They say, that a mad dog and an English man...

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.480
But the Americans are worse than English.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.240
Shri Mataji would you like dinner now?

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.280
Alright I'll have dinner now.

02:00:46.680 --> 02:00:49.240
I worry I can't hear much today.

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.200
Tomorrow I'll be alright.

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.120
We all have dinner now?

02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:04.960
[...]
