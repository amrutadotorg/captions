00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:11.712
Today we all have assembled here

00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:26.212
to pay our respect to Shri Ganesha.

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:39.253
Ganapatipule has a special significance

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:51.378
because He is Mahaganesha.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:57.378
The Ganesha at Mooladhara

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.795
becomes Mahaganesha

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.170
in the Virata, that is the brain.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.086
That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:18.170
That means Shri Ganesha governs

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:28.795
from that seat the principle of innocence.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:35.420
As you know very well it is placed at the back

00:01:41.045 --> 00:01:44.629
in the region of optic thalamus,

00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.170
optic lobe as they call it,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:03.754
and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:13.795
When He incarnated as Christ

00:02:14.086 --> 00:02:19.629
which is in here in the front, at Agnya

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:24.128
He said very clearly that

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:28.128
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.378
It's a very subtle saying,

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.795
which people don't understand

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:41.545
what is the meaning of the word "adultery."

00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:48.378
"Adultery" means "impurity" in a general word.

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:54.836
Any impurity in the eye "thou shalt not have"

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.545
it's very difficult.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.253
Instead of saying that you get your realization

00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:04.920
and clear your back Agnya,

00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:07.629
He has said it in a very short form,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.170
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:16.712
And people thought, it's an impossible situation.

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:20.545
Because He was not allowed to live long;

00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:23.337
actually His public life is limited

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:25.587
to three-and-a-half years only.

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:34.253
So whatever He has said has a very great significance,

00:03:34.545 --> 00:03:38.378
that your eyes should not be adulterous.

00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:43.420
When there is innocence there is no adultery:

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.920
it means there's no impurity.

00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:50.795
For example, with our eyes

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.920
we see something and we want to possess it.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.253
We start thinking.

00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:05.754
The thought starts

00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.754
like a chain, one after another.

00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:22.420
And then we get into the web of horrible thoughts,

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:27.420
and then we become slaves of those thoughts.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.045
Without even our knowledge,

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:33.504
our eyes are turned to things

00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:38.378
which are very gross

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.795
and take you downward.

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:50.378
As Shri Krishna has said that the Tree of Awareness

00:04:52.045 --> 00:04:55.420
grows upside-down,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.961
that the roots are in the brain

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.420
and the branches grow downward.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.795
Those who have gone towards materialism

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:09.920
have grown downward.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:14.712
Those who have gone towards Divine

00:05:14.712 --> 00:05:17.878
have grown upwards, towards the roots.

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:22.587
The main root, as they call the taproot,

00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:30.462
the main root is innocence, is Shri Ganesha.

00:05:31.128 --> 00:05:36.128
And He becomes Mahaganesha in Ganapatipule.

00:05:37.794 --> 00:05:42.045
Here He's surrounded

00:05:42.878 --> 00:05:46.253
by the Father Principle, the Guru Principle

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:59.670
of the sea, the ocean - the Indian Ocean.

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:12.587
That is, here He becomes a Guru.

00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:17.545
When a Sahaja yogi

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.045
establishes his Shri Ganesha Principle,

00:06:21.045 --> 00:06:23.253
he's still a child.

00:06:27.337 --> 00:06:33.462
Of course his eyes start becoming purer and purer,

00:06:34.003 --> 00:06:37.712
and powerful and glistening.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.961
You must have seen when the kundalini gives you

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:47.212
the realization

00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:53.878
then your eyes start gleaming,

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:56.712
like a spark is there in the eyes,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.712
you can make out a spark.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.337
With ego it gets covered,

00:07:09.086 --> 00:07:17.878
with ego it blinds.

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:24.712
With superego it is covered with tears.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.378
But when they are clear

00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:34.795
you see the beauty of the eyes,

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:45.378
Shri Ganesha shining through your glances.

00:07:53.378 --> 00:07:56.670
The attention now starts flowing

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.295
through the window of Shri Ganesha's temple.

00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:06.670
But when you mature,

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:14.086
you become Mahaganesha.

00:08:15.545 --> 00:08:18.462
Then Mahaganesha is established in you

00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:22.712
and you become a satguru,

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.212
you become a divine guru, you can teach others.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.712
Even a child could be that

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.795
even a grown-up person may be stupid.

00:08:38.295 --> 00:08:46.587
It has nothing to do with age, color, creed or caste.

00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:52.754
It is a state to which one can reach at any time.

00:08:53.128 --> 00:08:56.253
Like we can say here we had Gyaneshwara,

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:58.754
who at a very young age

00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:07.545
composed the great Gyaneshwari.

00:09:09.754 --> 00:09:11.212
As you have seen yesterday,

00:09:11.504 --> 00:09:14.170
at the age of twelve years Gorakhnath

00:09:15.128 --> 00:09:18.795
established his Mahaganesha.

00:09:23.836 --> 00:09:28.045
But if you do not try to ascend,

00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:30.253
then you'll remain at the same stage

00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:32.378
even when you grow old.

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:37.420
So maturity is the indication.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.295
Here, as we see in Ganapatipule,

00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:47.712
Shri Ganesha is in its complete, matured form

00:09:52.128 --> 00:09:56.712
so that we develop also our Mahaganesha

00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:58.378
within ourselves,

00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:09.295
and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.

00:10:16.795 --> 00:10:19.420
With proper working out,

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:30.128
I am sure we can establish that state within ourselves.

00:10:33.878 --> 00:10:39.212
Today we came to Ganapatipule, it has a great significance,

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:41.337
among the Asthavinayaka (eight Swayambhus of Shri Ganesha),

00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:44.836
It is the place of Mahaganesha.

00:10:46.878 --> 00:10:52.378
Mahaganesha is Pithadhish (Governor of all pithas)

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.795
and sitting on this pitha,

00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:02.961
he protects all the Ganesha Swayambhus.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.670
He has the knowledge of all the Omkaras,

00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:13.794
as he has attained the Guru Tatwa (Guru Principle).

00:11:16.003 --> 00:11:19.504
If we see in the surroundings,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.504
the ocean, so beautiful and clean

00:11:23.378 --> 00:11:26.045
is washing the feet of this Ganapati,

00:11:27.545 --> 00:11:36.212
because the ocean represents the Guru Tatwa,

00:11:37.378 --> 00:11:42.545
and with that Guru Tatwa, he washes the feet of Shri Ganesha

00:11:45.794 --> 00:11:49.587
that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.754
Ganesha Stuthi is done and then Shri Ganesha is established

00:11:54.504 --> 00:11:58.378
and thereafter with the Mahalaxmi Tatwa

00:12:01.794 --> 00:12:04.212
you have to become Mahaganeshas.

00:12:07.003 --> 00:12:10.670
This state can be achieved by children small and big,

00:12:11.587 --> 00:12:15.504
elderly people, ladies and everyone,

00:12:16.337 --> 00:12:22.920
if they can attain the straight forward behaviour,

00:12:24.003 --> 00:12:28.836
which we call as   Saralya  in Marathi, or they say Abhodita

00:12:29.462 --> 00:12:35.253
or innocence, when it is once imbibed in us,

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:38.754
we can achieve the Guru Principle.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.086
Whichever Guru, who does not have this straight forward nature

00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:46.961
and innocence, he can never be a Guru,

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.295
he is a Aguru (false Guru).

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:52.754
The person, whose attention is always on the Divine Power,

00:12:53.754 --> 00:12:55.754
only he can become a real Guru.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.754
The attention of normal human beings is perverted,

00:13:03.795 --> 00:13:07.961
it is not clean. For this Christ has said,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.128
there should be no adultery in your eyes,

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:17.378
means that if we put our attention on something,

00:13:18.045 --> 00:13:22.003
we start thinking a lot and strange thoughts come to our mind,

00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:24.003
as to how I can acquire this thing

00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:25.754
and why I did not get this thing,

00:13:25.961 --> 00:13:27.378
and other thoughts as to why and why not.

00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:30.504
If we see something and start thinking, then

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:35.253
you have not yet crossed the Agnya Chakra.

00:13:36.794 --> 00:13:38.629
Whatever object you see, you should become thoughtless,

00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:44.836
especially in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity

00:13:45.045 --> 00:13:49.836
there are numerous Gods and Goddesses

00:13:50.086 --> 00:13:52.253
at least by seeing them, one should become thoughtless.

00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:53.712
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:13:54.045 --> 00:13:55.961
no perversion will remain in our attention any more.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.545
The thoughts perverting the mind will not come anymore,

00:13:59.128 --> 00:14:00.794
so how will perversion influence you.

00:14:03.045 --> 00:14:04.670
That means like Christ said,

00:14:04.754 --> 00:14:07.337
thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:10.878
They should be so pure, like the rays of the sun,

00:14:11.253 --> 00:14:16.670
when they fall on trees, they do no absorb the dirt,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.045
they nourish and nurture them, not only that

00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:24.795
but they also give them strength.

00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:28.045
In a similar way,

00:14:28.337 --> 00:14:32.337
the Sahaja Yogis should have such radiance in their eyes, that

00:14:32.545 --> 00:14:40.920
they can create a very pure atmosphere in the whole world.

00:14:41.545 --> 00:14:45.712
Purity in the atmosphere is what we need today, everywhere,

00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:55.253
so that peace, joy and divine power can prevail in this world.

00:14:58.878 --> 00:15:02.795
Only singing the praise of Shri Ganesha may not be sufficient,

00:15:03.003 --> 00:15:05.003
Shri Ganesha needs to be awakened within us

00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:07.878
and he should evolve to the state of Mahaganesha.

00:15:08.462 --> 00:15:10.712
Only after attaining the state of Mahaganesha,

00:15:10.795 --> 00:15:14.629
can our country benefit and also through our country,

00:15:14.794 --> 00:15:16.795
other countries can benefit from this state.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.128
We are going to lead the others,

00:15:19.212 --> 00:15:24.545
but if we do not take up this responsibility,

00:15:25.003 --> 00:15:28.712
then I cannot say, what will happen of this whole world.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.003
I have a request to you all,

00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:35.086
to remove all the adultery in your eyes.

00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:40.504
For this we have the mantra of Nirvichara in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.504
Do not allow the thoughts to dominate you,

00:15:42.587 --> 00:15:44.545
if thoughts come, then say

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:49.170
  Yen Neti Neti Vachane  (it doesn't exist)

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.212
or say   Kshama Keli, Kshama Keli   (I forgive, I forgive),

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.128
so that this thought is destroyed

00:15:54.212 --> 00:15:55.878
and once thoughtlessness is attained,

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.629
then the perversion of the mind stops.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:04.295
Everybody should make an attempt,

00:16:04.504 --> 00:16:07.045
that your eyes are not adulterous.

00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:09.794
 "If there is perversion in the mind because of my eyes,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.128
then I do not want to have such eyes ", said Saint Tukaram,

00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:17.462
 "then, it is better to be blind ".

00:16:17.712 --> 00:16:22.961
In one way, it is better being blind,

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:25.003
than have perversion in the mind.

00:16:25.128 --> 00:16:27.629
Rather have inner eyes to see Divinity.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.961
When these two principles come together properly,

00:16:30.504 --> 00:16:33.337
then one can say that

00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:35.754
the Sahaja Yogi has attained the Guru Principle.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:42.170
I bless you all, that here at Ganapatipule,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.670
the place of Mahaganesha, with his special grace,

00:16:47.086 --> 00:16:50.253
you all can attain your Guru Principle as soon as possible.

00:31:34.212 --> 00:31:40.378
First they will take the twenty-four names of Shri Vishnu,

00:31:40.795 --> 00:31:45.378
so that this Sushumna Nadi will open out.

00:31:45.712 --> 00:31:47.920
Then they will say the Shri Sukta,

00:31:48.212 --> 00:31:52.128
is the one to awaken the energy within you.

00:31:52.462 --> 00:31:58.920
Then they will say the 108 name of Mother Gauri.

00:32:00.545 --> 00:32:05.003
After that pujan, when this puja is over,

00:32:05.253 --> 00:32:08.462
then we will be doing a

00:32:16.587 --> 00:32:19.961
Eleven kundas we have got,

00:32:20.378 --> 00:32:26.712
and we'll be doing the havana on eleven kundas.

00:32:27.212 --> 00:32:32.378
Because the Mahaganesha is the ruler,

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.337
is the ruler of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:32:37.836 --> 00:32:40.045
So that has to be done with great devotion

00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:41.629
and dedication.

00:32:42.003 --> 00:32:45.670
I would suggest that first is finished this puja,

00:32:46.003 --> 00:32:47.670
you can have your food,

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.128
and afterwards we'll sit down for the havan.
