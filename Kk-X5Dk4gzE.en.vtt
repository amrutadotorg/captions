00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:12.880
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.445
That’s one of the things.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:19.160
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.289
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.413
because we make a mental projection.

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:30.813
Mentally we calculate something.

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.153
This has to be.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:37.166
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:41.472
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:46.018
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:49.408
The one who is not worried.

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:51.994
So we worry because of two things.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:01:00.060
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:05.020
Future doesn’t exist.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.734
If you have made up your mind that this
should happen in the future, then you get upset.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:12.140
That’s one thing.

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:15.783
But you have not made any mental picture,

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:18.101
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.834
You’ll watch whatever appears.

00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:28.243
Then you’re not worried, because you’re
anxious to see what’s going to happen.

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:33.879
That’s one way, that you
feel hurt, that you’re worried.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.328
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:43.450
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.517
So if you become flexible,

00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:50.374
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:54.108
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:57.411
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:01:57.491 --> 00:02:00.220
And you can never enjoy it,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.266
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:07.532
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:10.472
You see it is all your own creation.

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:14.466
The mental projection is your creation,

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:20.894
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.733
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:29.528
After some time you will find that
it’s impossible to do something,

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:33.045
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:37.337
Because whenever you will try to do
something, you will find it will frustrate you,

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:39.577
it will upset you.

00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:43.300
If not, then it will make you realize

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.088
what is important, what you’ve missed.

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:55.577
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.379
that you’re not going to
lose that quality of the Spirit,

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.547
at any cost.

00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:09.242
Then that acts as a guide

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:15.413
and you understand the flexibility

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:20.323
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:22.395
They are all changeable,

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:26.028
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:33.206
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:39.976
He has a head with a trunk.

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:42.546
He accepts it.

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:45.816
Of course, is important, He should have that.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:49.074
Because head of the elephant suggests

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:54.339
that He is not like a human being who
develops ego, superego, conditionings, but

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:01.596
He is just all the time one with the Divine.

00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:08.259
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.106
that He is made of.

00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:18.754
He doesn’t aspire to something –
some entrepreneurs put some ideas

00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:23.188
and He wouldn’t go run after them.

00:04:23.268 --> 00:04:30.176
He won’t try to change Himself; He
won’t try to create that fashion and all that.

00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:34.227
He is what He is,

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:43.961
because He is a satisfied soul.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:52.168
The Kundalini on the stomach
shows a complete, self-contented,

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:58.018
satisfied personality of Shri Ganesha.

00:05:00.471 --> 00:05:08.361
When you have all the powers
within you, you know you are powerful,

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:12.981
then you don’t hanker after all these things

00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:20.722
and you don’t try to make a
position or an impression of others.

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:28.266
So now, as you are created in
the same image of Shri Ganesh,

00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:34.507
you have to understand that you have
to accept whatever God has given you,

00:05:34.587 --> 00:05:39.052
whatever position He has given you. Same with Christ.

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:44.292
Christ accepted His father who was just a carpenter.

00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:50.832
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

00:05:50.912 --> 00:05:57.058
because He was so powerful –
what more power can He have?

00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:10.028
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:15.783
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

00:06:15.863 --> 00:06:18.176
He knew what it was.

00:06:18.256 --> 00:06:28.347
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first
thing is to be self-contented.

00:06:28.427 --> 00:06:36.630
As I told you, the fundamentals of
the western life is to see and to be seen.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:48.087
Both things were missing completely
in the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:56.512
You don’t have to change anything outwardly

00:06:56.592 --> 00:07:02.717
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

00:07:02.797 --> 00:07:10.460
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:19.600
Though there were so many clouds on His being,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.543
though many people insulted Him,

00:07:23.623 --> 00:07:27.944
tortured Him, hanged Him, crucified Him,

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:33.947
still the Eternal Being didn’t bother.

00:07:34.027 --> 00:07:42.184
So the first and foremost thing
for a Sahaja Yogi is to accept,

00:07:42.264 --> 00:07:47.447
go on accepting things.

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:51.197
But when I say accept, I must say the other side also:

00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:57.557
that doesn’t mean you start accepting
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

00:07:57.637 --> 00:08:03.487
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:05.367
“What’s wrong?

00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:08.842
You have said it already.”

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:13.449
Whatever I say has another side, always.

00:08:13.529 --> 00:08:19.831
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.” So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:28.461
Everything can be corrected by Paramchaitanya,

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:33.327
if you know how to leave it to That,

00:08:33.407 --> 00:08:38.664
if you understand how you are
one with that Paramchaitanya,

00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:47.121
you are a part and parcel of that. And
that Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:52.039
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:55.387
there’s no need to have very conscious effort.

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:58.058
Accept life as it is.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:01.436
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.

00:09:01.516 --> 00:09:06.284
Don’t retaliate, don’t get angry,
don’t get upset. Just accept.

00:09:06.364 --> 00:09:11.304
And you’ll enjoy the same
life which was irritating you!

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:17.577
You will see the enjoying part
of that, and it will be so beautiful

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:22.127
the way you will see that
you’ll get over all your problems,

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:24.806
you’ll get over all your enemies.

00:09:24.886 --> 00:09:32.266
And a kind of a very fresh,
beautiful existence you’ll have.

00:09:35.262 --> 00:09:44.518
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:56.129
but you are experiencing and enjoying the silence,

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:02.908
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

00:10:02.988 --> 00:10:09.524
of your being as well as whatever is around you.

00:10:11.898 --> 00:10:17.064
You don’t have to force yourself to break this habit,

00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:24.397
but just to be on the watch-out.

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:33.176
It’s not necessary to talk too much about it also,

00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:40.502
nor it is necessary

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.609
to think about anything.

00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:56.148
Because supposing you see a tree – so it’s a tree only.

00:10:56.228 --> 00:10:59.919
What are we going to think about it?

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:04.115
And whatever we may think
about it, it’s going to be the tree!

00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:08.352
So to judge others, to think of others,

00:11:08.432 --> 00:11:14.301
what they are doing, what’s wrong with them,

00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:25.947
about anything whatsoever you may
think is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:32.144
Like I know some people who are specially bureaucrats,

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:36.609
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

00:11:36.689 --> 00:11:44.316
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

00:11:44.396 --> 00:11:49.438
or “I think it would have been nice if
this house was facing the other way” –

00:11:49.518 --> 00:11:57.114
but it’s not, you see? It is
not going to face [that way].

00:11:57.194 --> 00:12:04.813
It is going to be the way it is, so
what is the use of wasting your brain,

00:12:04.893 --> 00:12:14.402
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

00:12:14.482 --> 00:12:18.130
and never going to work out either.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:24.093
So when we start like, “I think

00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:30.354
these trees should have been
little taller” – but they are not!

00:12:32.722 --> 00:12:35.287
“I think

00:12:39.976 --> 00:12:47.836
that the crows should stop
their noise” – they will not.

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:52.647
So just accept it.

00:12:52.727 --> 00:13:01.539
Acceptance is the way we are going to enjoy.

00:13:01.619 --> 00:13:04.311
But acceptance doesn’t mean tolerance,

00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:10.399
because tolerance means you have to work very hard

00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:14.554
to accept that the trees are of the same height –

00:13:14.634 --> 00:13:17.780
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:24.040
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

00:13:30.128 --> 00:13:36.950
So acceptance as it is whatever you see, acceptance.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.075
And that is how people grow I
have seen, those who start accepting.

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:48.713
That’s the sign. That’s the sign
of their strength and their depth.

00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:55.021
So the witnessing and awareness develops

00:13:55.101 --> 00:13:59.585
when we start just accepting things as they are.

00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:02.238
May God bless you.
