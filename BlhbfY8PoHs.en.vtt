00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:10.903
Sadhna didi: She used to travel so much, I
mean, that was a time when I was not so

00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:15.055
much with Her because I was in my home and
She was in Europe and She used to Bulgaria,

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:20.228
Romania, I'm hearing She's here, there. She went
to South America. How She managed, I tell you,

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:25.757
I can't tell you this! Lately, I was
travelling more with Her. We went to Dubai

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:29.375
and, while leaving the leader of Dubai
collective, he was sitting like this,

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.181
very quiet. We said, "What's happened?"
He said, "You know didi, now that Mother

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:39.207
is going out of my hands, I'm feeling
sad." So, I told that to somebody else who

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:43.013
was also, like this, feeling sad because
She was leaving from another place. I said,

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:47.850
"You know, this is like a cycle and Mother
leaves and departs and the people behind

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.246
are feeling sad and Mother is sad too to
say, bye and then She's getting ready to

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:57.277
arrive with a lot of smiling faces waiting
for Her - She goes from there to there."

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:05.134
Though everybody asked Me this that, "How, how
could you, you know, as a Mother share Her?"

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:08.825
and of course you, you're as a child you
want your Mother all the time, it's natural.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:15.102
But then She timed it as such when, I 
think, I was engaged to be married already

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:20.905
once She was... It was 1970, right? That
is the date, so I was already engaged to

00:01:20.905 --> 00:01:27.410
be married, my sister was already married,
so as they say, Her worldly duties were,
kind of over.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.120
Kalpana didi: I never found it very
different except, you know, when I saw Her

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:43.158
posters all over and I said, "Oh, my God!"
so, She sort of, She became renowned

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:47.561
all over the world but to me
always a Mother.

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:51.855
Sadhna didi: Ho, She was a strong Mother,
very strong and She was, She was very keen on,

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:57.086
you know, we were being correct and right and
very dharmic, you know that, that emphasis was

00:01:57.086 --> 00:02:02.370
very strong, that you must never do anything
wrong and it was easier in those days

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.447
because, I think, dishonesty was not at
all a common thing. So you had to live

00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:12.094
within your budget. So, automatically, you
became a kind of person and you know,

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:15.996
attention did not go on to many luxuries.
Also we did not have consumerism in those

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:18.218
days, I mean, we lived simply.

00:02:29.913 --> 00:02:35.023
The majority of people were of the same
type of thinking. It was not so difficult,

00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:39.031
you didn't have peer pressure, most of the
girls were being brought up well, you know

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.341
Also, I don't think there was that
much of conflict in generations -

00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:45.347
- it was more flowing - you
know, family used to flow well.
