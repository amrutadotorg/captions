00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.243
You see,sickness comes to you, as I told
you, through our centers getting exhausted.

00:00:08.323 --> 00:00:12.705
As this is one center, all right, on the left
side, left sympathetic, and right sympathetic,

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.963
and they join together, this is the center.

00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:20.371
So we are using the energy of this center
that is limited, for our purpose, anything.

00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:25.827
Supposing, I’ll give an example, of a very
good example of our Swadisthan chakra.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:31.354
It’s the second center which looks after
the aortic plexus in the medical terminology,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.527
but it’s not complete, I mean it’s one of the parts.

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:37.455
Now the work of the Swadisthan chakra,

00:00:37.535 --> 00:00:41.920
according to Sahaja Yoga, which has worked
of course, wonders with this theory,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.486
that it gives energy for the replacement of the brain cells.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:51.075
Because we never think about it, we are using
the brain all the time,

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:55.830
we don’t think how it is replaced, even
within the medical art they don't think about it.

00:00:55.911 --> 00:01:01.080
So one of the work it has got, it moves here
and also it has to look after your liver,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.958
it has to look after your pancreas,
it has to look after spleen,

00:01:05.038 --> 00:01:06.778
it has to look after your kidneys,

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:13.160
it has to also look after the lower
part of your large intestines. Alright?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.519
Now. But all the time a person is thinking,

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:20.727
these days every body thinks too much and very futuristic.

00:01:20.807 --> 00:01:25.345
As a result, it cannot pay attention to all other things.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:30.444
So what happens, the first thing which is affected it the liver.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:35.712
Now, liver gets all the heat from the all body and eliminates it -

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:41.142
it’s poison for the body you can say - eliminates
it into the blood circulation,

00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:43.662
it goes into the blood.

00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:50.492
Now when, you see, liver is not attended to
or doesn’t get sufficient energy,

00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:57.860
starts working very hard, so it becomes an
over active liver and this heat cannot be removed,

00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:01.556
so the heat starts rising upward and downwards.

00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:08.242
As a result, your - these, what you call - the lungs are made as you know,

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:18.175
they are made like a sponge, so it becomes
coagulated and you develop asthma.

00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:22.094
We cure asthma through liver.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.780
Incurable.

00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:28.943
Then it descends down, when it descends down,
it affects your kidneys.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:31.005
By that you get high blood pressure.

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:36.875
Also, another thing you get is constipation.

00:02:36.955 --> 00:02:40.684
Then your pancreas is neglected.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:45.136
When pancreas is neglected you get diabetes.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:51.886
Only the people who are thinking, sitting,
planning for future get diabetes, never a villager.

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:54.176
In India, if you go to a village,

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:58.719
they’ll say : “you have to put sugar as
much as the spoon must stand at a right angle.”

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.629
They take so much sugar, nobody gets diabetes,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.436
because they earn in the morning, nicely go home and sleep off.

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:09.518
When we think and think, and think of the future.

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:15.013
So the neglect of the pancreas gives you diabetes.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:19.272
Now we have many people who have cured diabetes also.

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:23.864
Then the third one is the worse, is the spleen,

00:03:23.984 --> 00:03:28.714
that the spleen is like, you say rhythm, gives the rhythm,

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:31.076
it’s a in speedometer in us.

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:35.523
And supposing you are eating the food and
suddenly you have to run,

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:39.858
then you get a pain because it has to produce
red blood corpuscles.

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.453
But if you are always in an emergency in modern
times,

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.341
as you are, first of all you read the newspaper,

00:03:45.422 --> 00:03:49.770
you are under shock, because newspaper must
shock you, you see.

00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.011
So, then another shock, then another shock.

00:03:53.092 --> 00:03:55.391
Then in the traffic, you get a shock.

00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:58.153
So this poor spleen doesn’t know how to behave

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:01.887
in this crazy world and it becomes very crazy
and vulnerable.

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:05.027
And with the slightest shock, it can get blood
cancer.

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:08.843
I must tell you that we have cured really
blood cancer patients.

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:11.182
Absolutely cured, completely cured,

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:14.681
without any medicine or anything, absolutely
cured.

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.313
We have certificates and everything about
them.

00:04:17.393 --> 00:04:21.399
And surprisingly, all of them were architects.

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:23.863
This is one.

00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:27.715
Then, another thing that I told you, it affects
the kidneys

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:30.572
and it affects also the lower intestines.

00:04:30.652 --> 00:04:36.619
So, only one center, if you use it too much for one purpose,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.840
can give you all these troubles.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.970
And ultimately the heat might rise to the
heart and you may have a massive heart attack.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.934
Specially, if young people, if they are drinking
too much,

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:54.801
if they are playing tennis or which is very – I
mean any game which is like football or tennis,

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:57.021
drinking too much and thinking too much,

00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:00.703
they might get a massive heart attack

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:04.801
and die very young, at a very
young age. I mean it’s absolutely fatal.

00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:10.981
If you get this attack at a young age, it’s
fatal, you cannot save them.

00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:15.601
The other way round, if you are - if you have
inactive organs also,

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:19.631
you can have inactive also due to that,
also you get troubles.

00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:25.661
So when you treat somebody on his roots, it’s
very easy to solve the problem.

00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:31.891
See, supposing you have to treat a tree and
you start treating all the leaves, it’s very difficult.

00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:35.811
But if you can go to the roots, it’s so
easy, it’s simple.
