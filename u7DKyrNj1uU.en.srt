1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,280
In India we celebrate the changing of the
Sun’s orbit.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:19,820
So now he turns away from Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,380
Is it so, now?

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:37,270
So, now the heat is going to come more in
this country.

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:49,210
So to prepare for the heat and to prepare
people for that they give a little jaggery

6
00:00:49,210 --> 00:01:03,720
and sesame seeds or sugar and sesame seeds
and say that “We give you sweet so you also

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,070
speak sweetly”, because the heat makes people
rather bitter.

8
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,579
And, if there’s heat inside you, then you
start talking very bitterly to each other.

9
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:22,909
So to pacify that heat they give the sugar
or the jaggery for your livers.

10
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:28,130
But you can’t just give that, so with that
there is ‘teela’ (sesame) which is also

11
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,899
a soothing oil.

12
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:30,899
Now.

13
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,210
It’s very symbolic, that’s all.

14
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,749
It’s a symbolic thing.

15
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:48,499
And it is done every 14th of January in this
country.

16
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:53,810
It is called as ‘Makar Sankranti’.

17
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,279
It’s the change to ‘makar’ – means
Capricorn.

18
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:01,750
And it’s surprising!

19
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:11,009
Like in the ancient times Cancer was called
as ‘karka’ (कर्क) in India and

20
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,459
you also call this thing as cancer since long.

21
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:14,290
Now, the disease cancer is also called ‘cancer’.

22
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,799
Just see how it is related.

23
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:21,510
And in Indian language also it is called as
the disease of the Cancer, in the sense karka,

24
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,360
they call it karka roga (कर्क रोग),
you see – two words.

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:36,329
They also call it due to the ‘karka roga’
and that also called ‘karka roga’ means

26
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,400
– heat producing.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,159
It produces heat first of all.

28
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:50,450
And secondly it had another meaning, that
in cancer, cancer stands for the Mother.

29
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,020
So when you commit sins against the Mother
cancer is produced.

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,440
Sin against the Mother.

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:06,860
Cancer sign is the sign of the Mother only;
and when you try to commit sins against the

32
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,829
Mother this starts.

33
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:15,159
And since my advent this disease has become
very prevalent because sin against the Mother

34
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,170
is the biggest sin in the modern times.

35
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:28,790
So, one must know that the sin against the
Mother will lead, equal, to cancer.

36
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,610
So it started from Ganesha tattwa.

37
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:38,709
Many people who have this problem, Ganesha
problem, they may be very good in other things

38
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:43,859
but still, if there is the left Ganesha problem,
they should be very, very careful.

39
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:49,099
It’s like a hole in your being.

40
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:55,010
And to overcome that problem you may cover
up with something else.

41
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,609
Like such people may say, “Oh, I am so great.

42
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,769
I will never feel like this."

43
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,409
That’s not a good thing.

44
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,470
Just overcome your Ganesha problem with which
you are perverted.

45
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:14,049
So all these perversions must be sucked in
just like a tortoise sucks in the four limbs

46
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,640
within themselves.

47
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,930
That is how you must suck in those things.

48
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,370
And do not try to overcome by Right Vishuddhi,
by saying that you are great or you are this

49
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,830
or you are that.

50
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,720
Some people I have seen also try to show off
about it and try to say things which looks

51
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,950
quite big, but ultimately I find that they
have a Left Mooladhara.

52
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,850
It’s a serious thing it is, very, very serious.

53
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,009
So be careful.

54
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:45,569
Don’t deceive yourself.

55
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:47,139
Anyone of you.

56
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:56,810
Those who have Left Mooladhara problem have
to be extremely careful not to be tempted

57
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,500
to any supraconscious behaviour or talking.

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:15,259
Try to overcome it by complete surrendering,
say “I do not know anything Mother."

59
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:25,270
[That’s the] first mantra for them.

60
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:34,550
“Mother, I do not know anything”.

61
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,240
If you surrender.

62
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,640
Because it’s a Mother.

63
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,110
Like Shri Ganesha.

64
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,550
He never shows off anything.

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,500
He’s just surrendered, completely.

66
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,430
He says, “I do not know!”

67
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,340
Like Adi Shankaracharya, “I do not know
Mother."

68
00:05:50,340 --> 00:06:00,560
The more you 
try to sort of express yourself logically

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,710
or with your brains, then know that you are
deviating from that point because that’s

70
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,150
the only way you compensate.

71
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,000
So be careful.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,700
I am telling all of you.

73
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,570
It’s very common in the West, I have seen.

74
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:33,020
Suddenly they become all Sahaja Yogi experts
and then they fall down hard!

75
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:49,970
So those who think they are great Sahaja Yogis
must know there is something seriously wrong

76
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:57,169
with them, first of all.

77
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:03,860
You all have to grow together, nobody should
try to show off.

78
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:18,940
I know who is where.

79
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
That’s very important.

80
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:47,680
And you need not feel jealous of such people
or enamoured of such people.

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,259
Know that you have to deal with Reality.

82
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,820
So Left Mooladhara is a very serious problem.

83
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,980
Be careful of it.

84
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,680
It can be infectious.

85
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,810
It can be just catch over.

86
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,400
Sahaja Yoga has only that very delicate point
among Western Sahaja Yogis.

87
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,189
Only on this point – Left Mooladhara – so
be careful.

88
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:22,379
Try to keep your attention clear.

89
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,810
Perversions – keep it away.

90
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,810
Try to keep yourself, your chakras alright.

91
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:40,990
Better thing is to look after your chakras
than to discuss it.

92
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,740
Who are coughing?

93
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,680
There’s something definitely wrong.

94
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,000
All this, why are you coughing?

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,690
You are not paying attention properly.

96
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,329
(Coughing stops immediately) You have to look
after yourselves.

97
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:10,260
You are disturbing me when I am talking – is
something wrong.

98
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,540
You’d better look after of yourselves.

99
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,510
You have to say, “Allah hu Akbar,” sixteen
times, morning, evening.

100
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,399
Put yourself to test.

101
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,430
Try to avoid eating things which are not good
for your throat.

102
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,480
You may gargle.

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:42,060
You see, sometimes people feel proud of it
sometimes, the way they look at it.

104
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I am surprised.

105
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,870
One should be ashamed.

106
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,930
So, please, see that you look after your throats
and don’t disturb me.

107
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:57,160
I have done much more travelling that you
have done.

108
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
You know that.

109
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,170
I have gone through too much.

110
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:06,680
And apart from that you know that I sleep
very late, compared to you.

111
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,950
If your throats are not alright, please, look
after them.

112
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,990
There must be something wrong.

113
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
What’s it?

114
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,990
Some bhoots are there.

115
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,990
It is that.

116
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,990
How is it it’s not coming now?

117
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,990
Better do your dhuni and everything; everything
that you want to do.

118
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,990
It’s nothing!

119
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,990
It’s important .

120
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,320
How can it be?

121
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,120
How are you getting this all the time, all
the time?

122
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,360
So, now, I give you dhunis, this, that – finished!

123
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:46,800
I have suffered much more, in the sense that
I have gone through a lot of sufferings in

124
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,490
the way that I am raising their Kundalini,
everything.

125
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,490
You know that.

126
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,410
But to say even that, “There was too much
dust,” and all that: you must get used to

127
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,410
it.

128
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,410
It’s possible.

129
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:08,610
On the contrary, the more you try to do it
(coughing), the better you feel.

130
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:20,329
You feel are doing a contribution to my talk.

131
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:23,150
You are saints.

132
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,340
Behave like saints.

133
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,880
That’s important.

134
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,910
But first, give them, those who have coughs,
put something in the mouth.

135
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,790
And you should not cough.

136
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,160
Give them something to eat.

137
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,079
Look after yourselves.

138
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,490
I should look after such big, big boys?

139
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,360
You better look after yourself.

140
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,949
Do you find any one of the Indian Sahaja Yogis
coughing?

141
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,310
No one!

142
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,360
You must look after yourselves!

143
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,680
Moving your hands too much also you do it.

144
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:17,839
All the time you talk like this.

145
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
Don’t do all that.

146
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,709
Keep your hands steady.

147
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,019
Respect them!

148
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,620
Try to steady your hands.

149
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:44,940
All the time jerkiness, shifting your hands
too much also is not good.

150
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:57,310
There’s something one must understand: we
have to get into Sahaja Yoga.

151
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,620
To work it out in a serious way.

152
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,089
Work it out!

153
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:12,440
No use carrying on with the nonsense.

154
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:19,839
There’s no use getting angry with yourself.

155
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:37,790
No use also sort of saying that “I, I, I”
“I don’t know” “I am this thing”.

156
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,959
It’s a nonsense.

157
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:51,519
“I am this,” “I am that,” “I can
feel it."

158
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,709
All this is nonsense!

159
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,050
It’s supraconscious nonsense going on.

160
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,790
Be careful!

161
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,820
You should not try to impress others by your
nonsense at all.

162
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:32,170
Then there’s another thing I will tell you
about.

163
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:40,500
Rustom, did you say that you have to learn
Sanskrit to know Sahaja Yoga?

164
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,050
Not at all.

165
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,600
It’s absolutely wrong.

166
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,850
Please take it from me.

167
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,160
Again mental activity [that] you started.

168
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
Better stop it!

169
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:05,000
All these wrong ideas you should not get into
your head.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,190
Dhumal does not know a word of Sanskrit.

171
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,910
Not a word of Sanskrit.

172
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,740
What is there?

173
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:24,900
It is all borrowed feathers?

174
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:35,190
Even why borrow from Adi Shankaracharya?

175
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:47,190
What is all your depth, your feelings?

176
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:55,760
Why to borrow from others?

177
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:18,050
Develop your own feelings, your depth, your
sources instead of borrowing from anyone.

178
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:24,910
Why to learn Sanskrit?

179
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,060
There’s no need.

180
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:49,209
You may know something about Shankaracharya
but not about Sahaja Yoga and not at all about

181
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,319
me.

182
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:58,089
So don’t go into all these tricks.

183
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:08,490
Now you stop making any names or anything!

184
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,130
Please stop it!

185
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:27,050
Otherwise you’ll get into supraconscious,
I am telling you.

186
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:33,240
Just don’t do it.

187
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:53,380
All these mental activities you all must stop
because the main problem is your left side.

188
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:08,520
And tomorrow is the day when you have to decide.

189
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:28,320
Tomorrow is the day when we worship the Surya,
tomorrow is the day we worship the Saraswati,

190
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:38,160
so that the Saraswati should give you your
exhausted energy that has passed out and now

191
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,000
don’t exhaust Her more.

192
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,840
Use your Left side.

193
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,970
Surrender to your Mother, be good mothers,
be good daughters.

194
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,970
Alright?

195
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,810
Surrendering is the way.

196
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:01,060
And don’t think too much about Sahaja Yoga.

197
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:10,450
Talking, “chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck”
about Sahaja Yoga is not the way.

198
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,360
All such people rise nowhere.

199
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,700
I know that.

200
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:30,780
I know everyone, I know people who just think
too much of Sahaja Yoga; I know them very

201
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
well.

202
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,250
They don’t know anything about me.

203
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,040
On the feet I know.

204
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,280
On the vibrations I know.

205
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:55,810
On their development I know.

206
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:21,530
There’s no need at all to know Sanskrit,
it’s true, but it is the need to know your

207
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:39,550
Mother; through your love, through your pure
understanding.

208
00:20:39,550 --> 00:21:09,820
Because it will take you because you are used
to that kind of a thing.

209
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:20,840
You 
want to know the whole of Sanskrit, the whole

210
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,560
of this and the whole of that.

211
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,860
You’ll read the whole of Vedas.

212
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:30,481
I mean so many are like this here in this
country – useless for me, good for nothing.

213
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:31,481
Just forget it!

214
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:32,481
Don’t go into that trip of knowing through
your brains.

215
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:33,481
Know through your heart.

216
00:21:33,481 --> 00:21:45,490
And that’s the reason [you do that] is because
it’s not available to you.

217
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:53,050
That’s the base.

218
00:21:53,050 --> 00:22:11,320
The Left Mooladhara is harmed so you turn
to another thing!

219
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,910
That’s not available.

220
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:20,460
That innocence is not available.

221
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Try to go to that.

222
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:32,790
Try to awaken that within you and then you
will be amazed [that] you will know me better.

223
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,170
And yesterday only I told you how these complications
have created a barrier.

224
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:45,970
They just see me.

225
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:56,720
And just see their faces.

226
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,730
In the same way.

227
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:17,270
Still you look so sometimes miserable, sometimes
look lost.

228
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,570
No?

229
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:35,720
Because still you are using your brains.

230
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:47,780
Using your brains is not the way to get to
Sahaja Yoga, please.

231
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
Better now your throats?

232
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,110
You are not coughing?

233
00:23:52,110 --> 00:24:00,020
These were all bhoots.

234
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:09,920
What has happened to you?

235
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:22,000
Now try to cough! (laughter but no coughing)

236
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,770
But if you want to know Sanskrit, you can
know.

237
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:44,920
But that’s not the end.

238
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:53,630
And that’s not the way.

239
00:24:53,630 --> 00:25:06,870
Of course, on your way you can know it, but
that’s not the way.

240
00:25:06,870 --> 00:26:33,910
I mean, I don’t want you to get to things
where you are diverted from your own surrendering

241
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,780
and ascent – that’s more important.

242
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,340
What Shankaracharya has said ultimately is
already translated in English.

243
00:26:39,340 --> 00:28:16,120
If you see that he has just talked of surrender,
nothing [else].

244
00:28:16,120 --> 00:29:15,660
Has he talked of anything else Rustom?

245
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,960
That’s it.

246
00:29:19,960 --> 00:30:41,781
All these names, also, that you have given
me are just a part of it, Sahaja Yoga is also

247
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:42,781
part of it.

248
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,300
When I am with you, why should you care for
these things?

249
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,090
Try to establish that.

250
00:30:47,090 --> 00:31:00,200
Because of that you use your brains too much.

251
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:12,230
Establish to your Left Mooladhara.

252
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,040
Better now?

253
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:29,650
Be in Nirvichara.

254
00:31:29,650 --> 00:32:30,470
See, where is your coughing gone?

255
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:40,610
Finished!

256
00:32:40,610 --> 00:33:04,270
They have run away.

257
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:14,300
In the same way you should control them.

258
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,780
Tell them off.

259
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:25,440
Also you speak too much, while travelling
be in a meditative mood.

260
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Don’t speak.

261
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
There’s no need to speak.

262
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Be in meditative mood.

263
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,180
You are with me, I am with you.

264
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,170
Keep in meditative mood.

265
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:41,140
It will help you; very much help you.

266
00:33:41,140 --> 00:34:12,889
It is here you should keep quiet – absolutely
– and feel it.

267
00:34:12,889 --> 00:36:00,350
No discussions, no talkings, not using your
brains.

268
00:36:00,350 --> 00:38:28,110
You have come here to gain something within
for your altering.

269
00:38:28,110 --> 00:39:21,849
Be responsible about it.

270
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,200
Some people definitely, Mathias, improved
a lot.

271
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Tremendous!

272
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,660
I was amazed!

273
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,290
He improved.

274
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:47,190
But some are just the same.

275
00:39:47,190 --> 00:40:01,080
I asked them, “How are you?”

276
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:08,030
Still like that.

277
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:19,610
I mean, what to do?

278
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:25,870
Try to pacify yourself.

279
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,950
Be peaceful.

280
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:34,020
Be peaceful.

281
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:42,170
Tell yourself, “Be peaceful.

282
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,240
Be careful.

283
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,320
Be peaceful."

284
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:15,230
And just imagine, before I started my lecture,
nobody was coughing and suddenly, as soon

285
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:21,490
as you sat down, one after another there was
a competition.

286
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:31,460
Look at the bhoots how they are acting through
you.

287
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,320
Even if the rakshasas want, they cannot cough
before me; know that.

288
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,150
Only because you are my children you can have
audacity to do that.

289
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,150
Alright?

290
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,150
Now don’t try to disturb me.

291
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,810
So, before tomorrow’s puja we have to arrange
our baths properly, whatever it is.

292
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,350
I am going to have the puja starting at ten
o’clock, not earlier.

293
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:55,540
But you need not go out or anything; have
your bath and all that, and then I am going

294
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,400
to come down here.

295
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Clear cut?

296
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Keep yourself aloof with others.

297
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Don’t get entangled with anybody else.

298
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Keep quiet.

299
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Don’t talk.

300
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Have the maximum now for this puja at least.

301
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,400
And it’s going to be Saraswati puja for
the first time.

302
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,400
Actually I wanted to do Ekadasha but to do
Ekadasha is not an easy thing.

303
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Then I thought, let it be.

304
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Not tomorrow.

305
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
But one day we’ll have to do that, also,
but we have to prepare ourselves.

306
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
Now, don’t talk.

307
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
Keep quiet.

308
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Just keep quiet.

309
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
And then sit down here for meditation.

310
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
All of you come quietly.

311
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,160
Actually you don’t have to do anything.

312
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,360
You don’t have to organise, or nothing.

313
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,940
You don’t have to do that.

314
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,970
Now those Indians who are organising are in
meditative mood!

315
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:22,970
It’s surprising!

316
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,080
Those who are organising, who are running
about, managing this, managing that.

317
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:35,870
It’s not an easy thing, you know, to manage
for so many people’s food, morning, evening,

318
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,250
every time.

319
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:44,120
They are in meditative mood.

320
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:54,040
So keep yourself in meditative mood tomorrow.

321
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Try.

322
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,910
Tell yourself, “Be peaceful.

323
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,060
Be peaceful.

324
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,350
My mind, be peaceful.

325
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:01,500
Be still.

326
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,640
Be still."

327
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,520
Tell your mind to be still.

328
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
Alright?

329
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
And you will be amazed [that] it’s all within
yourself.

330
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,520
Try to merge your stillness within you.

331
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
If you don’t allow it you will get supraconscious
which is very dangerous.

332
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Better now?

333
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Just keep to your source of peace.

334
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,810
Sit down, sit down for one minute.

335
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,640
That’s the trouble!

336
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,440
Let her sit down, Linda.

337
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,850
Can’t you make her sit for a while?

338
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,850
Sit down straight!

339
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:21,850
Make your children understand.

340
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,850
They will never sit.

341
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,850
Sit still within yourself.

342
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,850
Sit down still within yourself.

343
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:25,850
Just sit still.

344
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,850
It’s all inside you.

345
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:33,560
You know, you don’t have to go anywhere,
create anything, it’s all within.

346
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,140
Nothing is to be created.

347
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,210
It’s all within you.

348
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,210
Better?

349
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,210
Sit still.

350
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,210
“Be still, my mind."

351
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:45,640
This stillness business, to establish, is
what I want you to establish within you.

352
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,570
That’s an escape.

353
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,830
All perversions are escapes.

354
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:09,270
And I am quite happy with your progress, I
must say.

355
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:17,670
This time, it was a very good collectivity,
which was good.

356
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,830
Everybody is coming up very well.

357
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,510
Everybody, I must say, has progressed well.

358
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:27,790
Every one of you has improved a lot.

359
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,450
But try to know where is the problem.

360
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,460
Everybody has individual problems.

361
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,930
At a point you stop it.

362
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,230
Just stop it.

363
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,540
You can.

364
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,490
It’s all bhoots.

365
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,490
You know.

366
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,490
Perversions come through bhoots.

367
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:55,490
I mean, there is nothing to be explained any
more.

368
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,490
Anything, any diversion, any, I should say,
bending away from Sahaja Yoga or from the

369
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,490
centre.

370
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,490
Be in the centre.

371
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,490
And don’t pay attention to others.

372
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:01,830
Pay attention to yourself.

373
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,560
Every one of you is great.

374
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,960
Nobody is greater or less greater.

375
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,410
So just don’t worry about anybody.

376
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,120
Don’t talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

377
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
In India you be peaceful.

378
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,000
There’s a lot of time for you to discuss
it in your own countries.

379
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,140
Just here be quiet.

380
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,140
Take it.

381
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
Take it.

382
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,140
Take it.

383
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,930
There is a bird in India, it’s called as
‘chakwa’ and ‘chakwi’, and they are

384
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,440
the ones who just live on the rays of the
moon, and they go on sucking the rays slowly.

385
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,910
They don’t need anything; that’s all.

386
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,910
Still your mind.

387
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,400
Whatever mantra we say, if it is mechanical
it will have no effect.

388
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,660
We say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena
samsthita."

389
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,820
Say nicely.

390
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,990
Still it.

391
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,940
But you must do it with complete understanding,
full deliberation.

392
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:56,470
We have come here to gain something, tremendous
depth.

393
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:07,200
And some of you are at the end of your trip.

394
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,620
Better?

395
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,470
Yogini: (Unclear)

396
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:16,860
Shri Mataji: Got a Centre Heart [catch]?

397
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,660
Do not force it, the Kundalini is working
it out.

398
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,660
Just be still!

399
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,660
You are futuristic.

400
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
Still thinking about (??).

401
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,660
Don’t be futuristic.

402
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,660
At this moment.

403
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,660
Be there.

404
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
I know what your mind is working on.

405
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,660
Don’t be.

406
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,660
Just don’t think I am sitting before you,
that’s all.

407
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,660
Don’t think of time or anything.

408
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,660
Just be still.

409
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,660
Just be still.

410
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,660
Still thinking.

411
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Keep your eyes open.

412
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Don’t think.

413
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
You watch me!

414
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,660
As you are the foundations still your minds.

415
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,660
The cement is working it out but still it
should be.

416
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,660
Just by stilling you can get over all your
diseases.

417
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,660
Just by stilling your mind.

418
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Seen that?

419
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,660
Better?

420
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:46,660
Just see in your head.

421
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,660
Better!

422
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:48,660
Also, I think, another way to put your Mooladhara
alright is to see how long you can remain

423
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,660
without blinking.

424
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,660
Better?

425
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,660
Put your hand.

426
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Lift it.

427
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,660
Again.

428
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Try it.

429
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,660
You practice it; again and again.

430
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Now just ask, “Mother, take us deep into
our stillness."

431
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,660
Don’t close your eyes.

432
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,660
You need not say loudly, just say it in your
heart.

433
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,660
At Sahasrara.

434
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Still at Sahasrara.

435
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,660
Can you imagine?

436
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,660
This talking leads you to nowhere else but
to your Sahasrara.

437
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,660
Just see your Sahasrara.

438
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,660
How clear it is?

439
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,660
Can you feel it?

440
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,660
It’s like a stone.

441
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,660
Just see yours.

442
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,660
I mean it is your own Sahasrara.

443
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,660
Don’t worry about others, worry just about
your own Sahasrara.

444
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,660
See?

445
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,660
It’s like a stone.

446
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,660
Can you follow?

447
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:13,660
So, surrender.

448
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,660
Just in your heart, surrender.

449
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,660
Surrender.

450
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,660
Put me down there – your Sahasrara will
open.

451
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,660
The great journey.

452
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Forget about everything else.

453
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,660
Just do that.

454
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,660
Better.

455
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,660
Sahasrara better now?

456
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,660
Alright?

457
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,660
You are my children.

458
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
You are my sons and daughters – alright?

459
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,660
Better now?

460
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,660
See on your Sahasrara.

461
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,660
Mother, You are God.

462
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,660
“Make us like Shri Ganesh."

463
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,660
Hmm.

464
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,660
Opening up.

465
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,660
Opening up.

466
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,660
Something’s happening?

467
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,660
Come up.

468
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,660
Let it come up.

469
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Also some of you unnecessarily worry about
me.

470
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,660
Better worry about yourself!

471
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,660
Also that’s another escape.

472
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,660
So it’s like Himalayas, one has to [be].

473
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:39,660
Raise your Kundalini!

474
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,660
Just do it slowly, slowly.

475
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,660
Higher, put it higher, very much higher.

476
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,660
Do it properly.

477
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,660
With full attention.

478
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,660
Not in a small way.

479
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,660
Push it back.

480
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,660
The whole hand, up there.

481
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,660
Again.

482
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,660
With all your earnest attention.

483
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,660
In a knot, three times.

484
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,660
One, two…

485
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,660
Things should be done fully and properly,
not half way.

486
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,660
I have seen the way people give bandhan, the
way people raise their Kundalini.

487
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,660
It’s not the way!

488
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Do it properly.

489
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,660
You are saints!

490
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,660
You are archbishops of saints.

491
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,660
You are the foundations of all the saints
that have to come.

492
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,660
Have we all the powers of those prophets?

493
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Ask a question.

494
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,660
Know you are not that.

495
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:11,540
Are we are really Realised Souls, Mother?

496
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:18,462
Are we the epitome of human civilisation?

497
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:19,462
Are we the epitome of God’s creation?

498
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:20,462
Alright?

499
00:48:20,462 --> 00:48:21,462
Good.

500
00:48:21,462 --> 00:48:22,462
Much better now.

501
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:23,462
Also don’t turn your heads too much or turn
your eyes too much.

502
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:24,462
Keep them still.

503
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:25,462
Try to keep them still.

504
00:48:25,462 --> 00:48:26,462
Just be still, relaxed.

505
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:27,462
Now, I would suggest that all of you should
ask each other to give a proper aarti to your

506
00:48:27,462 --> 00:48:28,462
Mahaganesha.

507
00:48:28,462 --> 00:48:29,462
Alright?

508
00:48:29,462 --> 00:48:30,462
So your Ganesha will be awakened.

509
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:31,462
All of you should give a aarti.

510
00:48:31,462 --> 00:48:32,462
Every one of you should ask somebody else
to do it.

511
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:33,462
And you will be amazed how nice you will feel.

512
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,462
And that will relieve, relieve the thing – Mahaganesha.

513
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:35,462
That’s the quality you have to achieve.

514
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:36,462
It’s not easy, you must know.

515
00:48:36,462 --> 00:48:37,462
Whenever I touch the point I find a big, huge
mountain on the head.

516
00:48:37,462 --> 00:48:38,462
Gradually you must face it.

517
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:39,462
Take it out.

518
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:40,462
Clear it out.

519
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:41,462
Slowly and steadily.

520
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:42,462
Better now?

521
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,462
Much better.

522
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,462
This mountain has to be cleared out.

523
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:45,462
Clear it out.

524
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:46,462
I think you better give bandhan to yourselves.

525
00:48:46,462 --> 00:48:47,462
I am giving a bandhan to myself so that everybody
gets a bandhan.

526
00:48:47,462 --> 00:48:48,462
Alright.

527
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,462
Done?

528
00:48:49,462 --> 00:48:50,462
Better?

529
00:48:50,462 --> 00:48:51,462
Cleansing?

530
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,462
Got to learn all these mechanisms.

531
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,462
Alright?

532
00:48:53,462 --> 00:48:54,462
How many times you give bandhan to yourself,
in a daytime?

533
00:48:54,462 --> 00:48:55,462
At least five times.

534
00:48:55,462 --> 00:48:56,462
Make five namazes.

535
00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:57,462
Seven times is the best way.

536
00:48:57,462 --> 00:48:58,462
See how much you are clearing out yourself?

537
00:48:58,462 --> 00:48:59,462
We have to give ourselves a bandhan as well
as we can give it to other.

538
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:00,462
Let’s use it for ourselves sometimes, our
powers.

539
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:01,462
Hmm?

540
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:02,462
She has cleared it out, can you see that?

541
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:03,462
All your sickness, all your illness.

542
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:04,462
Better?

543
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:05,462
Everyone, everyone.

544
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:06,462
Let’s give bandhan.

545
00:49:06,462 --> 00:49:07,462
Phil, give your bandhan to yourself.

546
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:08,462
Yourself.

547
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:09,462
Now left Nabhi.

548
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:10,462
Now you are clearing out, just see that.

549
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:11,462
You would like to do it because you feel so
clear!

550
00:49:11,462 --> 00:49:12,462
Hmm!

551
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:13,462
All this back side is opening.

552
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:14,462
Alright?

553
00:49:14,462 --> 00:49:15,462
You’ve never tried like this?

554
00:49:15,462 --> 00:49:16,462
First time?

555
00:49:16,462 --> 00:49:17,462
A hundred and eight times it’s the best
way, sometimes.

556
00:49:17,462 --> 00:49:18,462
Haaa!

557
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:19,462
See?

558
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:20,462
Leave it, She’ll clear it out.

559
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:21,462
Are you are feeling better?

560
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:22,462
Aren’t you?

561
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:23,462
I thought you have already tried this.

562
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,462
Never?

563
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,462
It’s like telling you how to eat!

564
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,462
That’s the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

565
00:49:26,462 --> 00:49:27,462
Yogi: Really?

566
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:33,160
Shri Mataji: Better?

567
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:48,210
You’ll remove all your heat.

568
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:57,250
Look at that!

569
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,970
You all thought we should never take out our
own problems like this?

570
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,190
Heat from the left.

571
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,190
Good.

572
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:05,190
You may do it whenever you feel like.

573
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,190
It’s so enjoyable you’ll go on doing it.

574
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,190
You’ll like that! (laughing)

575
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,190
It’s so relieving, you know!

576
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,190
Instead of clearing others, better clear yourself!

577
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,190
Others are cleared automatically.

578
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,190
Just try.

579
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,190
Go on doing it.

580
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,190
Left Swadishthana.

581
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:17,830
In the samashti (समष्टि – collective)
you see.

582
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:18,830
Somebody has left Swadishthana?

583
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:19,830
Linda, why aren’t you doing it?

584
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:20,830
Do it properly, with proper care.

585
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,830
Hmm.

586
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:22,830
The whole head is improving.

587
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:23,830
Can you believe it?

588
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:24,830
That you never knew this.

589
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,830
This is protection from yourself to yourself.

590
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,830
Good.

591
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:27,830
Still Left Swadishthana.

592
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,830
Give it a bandhan to Left Swadishthana.

593
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,830
Right Vishuddhi now.

594
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,830
Right Vishuddhi.

595
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,830
Right Vishuddhi.

596
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,830
Left Swadishthana, Right Vishuddhi.

597
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,830
Baap re baap!

598
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:34,830
(Oh my God!).

599
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:35,830
Most dangerous combination.

600
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,830
Aha!

601
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:37,830
Right Vishuddhi burning.

602
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,830
Burning right Vishuddhi.

603
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,830
Better.

604
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,830
Alright?

605
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,830
Now, leave it to me.

606
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,830
Everybody is enjoying now.

607
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:43,830
Do at every finger!

608
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:44,830
Good.

609
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:45,830
Much better.

610
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:46,830
Rub this finger.

611
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:47,830
Right Vishuddhi.

612
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:48,830
Talk too much.

613
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:49,830
Right Vishuddhi!

614
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:50,830
English don’t talk much, I think.

615
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:51,830
It’s a good quality; good quality.

616
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:52,830
As long as they don’t sulk and blame themselves.

617
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,830
It’s a good quality.

618
00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:54,830
Try to listen.

619
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,830
Haaa! better?

620
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:56,830
Now the Right Side has started flowing.

621
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:57,830
Little tricks here and there!

622
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:58,830
Good.

623
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,830
Yogi: Mother, You’re like driving your chariot
and we are all your horses.

624
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:00,830
Shri Mataji: You see, to drive My chariot
I must have at least horses which do not cough!

625
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,830
(laughter) Otherwise I’ll be getting all
the jerks.

626
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:02,830
Already I have had enough of it!

627
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:03,830
We have to be smooth.

628
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:04,830
Very good.

629
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,830
Better.

630
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,830
Much better.

631
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:07,830
Ekadasha also.

632
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,830
Little bit.

633
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,830
Rub it off.

634
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:10,830
Ekadasha.

635
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,830
Rub it hard.

636
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,830
It’s good.

637
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:13,830
Better?

638
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,830
Much better.

639
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,830
So preparations for tomorrow’s [puja].

640
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,830
Always rub your hands!

641
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,830
Conditioning goes out.

642
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:18,830
Rub your left hand.

643
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,830
Now, now Devi prasanna bhave.(Goddess is pleased)

644
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:20,830
Alright?

645
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,830
Good now.

646
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:22,830
Alright?

647
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,830
So this is you have done your own puja and
tomorrow your Mother’s puja.

648
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:23,835
May God bless you all.
