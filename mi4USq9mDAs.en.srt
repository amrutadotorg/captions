00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Public Program

2
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:32,420
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

3
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:48,870
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
Truth is what it is.

4
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:51,500
You cannot change it.

5
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,660
You cannot describe it.

6
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,210
You have to experience it.

7
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:00,790
And you cannot pay for it.

8
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:08,690
You can only discover it through the last
breath of your evolutionary process which

9
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:15,850
is a living process into a new awareness,
into a new dimension.

10
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:22,010
Now whatever I am telling you, please don’t
accept blindfold.

11
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:27,230
We have had enough problems with the blind
faith.

12
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:39,430
If you do experience, if you do get the results
of whatever I am saying, you have to accept

13
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:47,860
is as honest people, because it is for your
good, for the good of the family, for the

14
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:53,020
good of your country, for the good of the
whole world.

15
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,020
We talk of peace.

16
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,600
Now where does this war come in?

17
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:06,630
From where the ideas of fighting and quarrelling
come in?

18
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,610
It comes from your mind.

19
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,520
Now look at this mind.

20
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,270
What it is.

21
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,360
I say it is a myth.

22
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:22,470
Mind is a myth created by the reaction of
your ego and your conditioning.

23
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:30,390
It’s like the fog or you can say like the
bubbles on the shore of the ocean, which are

24
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:35,360
brought forth by your thoughts and your reactions.

25
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,940
But you can’t stop it.

26
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:54,350
When this mind is created, it again substantiates
and support your ego and your conditioning.

27
01:06:54,350 --> 01:07:05,120
It’s like this as create a computer and
then the computer itself starts controlling

28
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,120
us.

29
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,030
In the same way, this mind starts creating
us.

30
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:14,860
Or we can say we create the watch and then
this watch starts controlling us.

31
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:25,860
Now all these thoughts are born through this
mind of ours which is nothing but the garbage

32
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:30,790
we have gathered around by reacting to things.

33
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:41,750
When we see very grotesque type of creation
of things and films, handsome also, very so

34
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:49,790
called art, we are surprised from what brain
it comes.

35
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:58,360
There must be some rotten brains that are
bringing it, but brain is reality, not the

36
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,360
mind.

37
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,020
They come out of the mind.

38
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:10,110
So one has to understand that to get peace
we have to go beyond this mind.

39
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:16,020
This mind if the one which reacts and creates
problems for us.

40
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:19,560
Makes us believe into things and, we are conditioned.

41
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,690
We are not free.

42
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:29,190
Free people to understand what is reality.

43
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:34,190
Reality is beyond the mind.

44
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:39,420
Now how to cross the limit of mind.

45
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:45,260
Like once a doctor in Switzerland said, mother,
you do what you like you can cut my throat,

46
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,850
but stop these thoughts they’re bombarding
me.

47
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:53,280
You cannot stop.

48
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:59,230
Because a thought rises and falls off, another
thought rises and falls off.

49
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:05,160
These thoughts come to us from the past or
the future.

50
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,440
You’re not in the present.

51
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,250
You cannot be in the present.

52
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:18,760
But when this power that is described to you
already known as the kundalini, rises, then

53
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,040
she takes your attention beyond the thought.

54
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,360
Beyond the mind.

55
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:33,930
And that is the place where resides the present
reality.

56
01:09:33,930 --> 01:09:41,910
Now this special thing as called as kundalini
is not to be discarded because it is coming

57
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:42,920
from India.

58
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,540
It has been described in every Scripture.

59
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:52,000
Even in the Bible it is described that I will
appear before you as tongues of flames.

60
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:00,180
These are the tongues of flames you see along
the path of the kundalini.

61
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:07,500
Also Mohammad sahib has said very clearly
in his Koran, that if you want to know God,

62
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,470
you must known yourself.

63
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,100
Christ has said ‘Know Thyself’.

64
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,840
All of them have said the same thing.

65
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:23,570
If you see the Zen system, or Lao Tse or Confucius,
anyone of them.

66
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:31,620
They all said that unless and until you know
yourself, you are not there, you have no identity.

67
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:42,410
But knowing yourself is very important, because
you are the treasure of knowledge, you are

68
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:45,310
the wisdom and divine discretion.

69
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:48,160
It’s all within you.

70
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:53,430
Which you should know without any effort.

71
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:54,430
Effortless.

72
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:55,430
Sahaj.

73
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:59,480
‘Sah’ means with, ‘ja’ means born.

74
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:07,650
Born with you is the right to get your self-realisation.

75
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:16,380
It’s your birth right to have it and in
these modern times it has been made very very

76
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:21,350
easy somehow to get this realization.

77
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:31,980
In our country also, all the saints have described
about achievement of yourself.

78
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:44,470
Sahaj word has been used by so many saints,
esp by Guru Nanak who says, ‘sahaj samadhi’.

79
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:54,150
Whatever you have to get in your awareness
(Samadhi is awareness), has to be in a sahaj

80
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:56,800
(means spontaneous) manner.

81
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,880
So for this you don’t have to stand on your
head.

82
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,320
You don’t have to run away from your families.

83
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,910
You don’t have to starve or fast.

84
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,120
You’ve done it.

85
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,930
You’ve done it in your last lives.

86
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:18,400
In this life, you should have the fruits of
your hard work that you’ve put in to express

87
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,500
your desire to be one with the divine.

88
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:29,760
The first truth is that you are not this body,
this mind.

89
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:36,860
These conditionings, this ego, these emotions,
but you are the pure spirit.

90
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:43,900
The second truth is very much evident but
we’re not bothered to know.

91
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:51,500
For example, you see these beautiful flowers,
beautiful trees all around.

92
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,690
It’s a miracle.

93
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:56,410
See everything is different.

94
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:59,290
Every seed is different.

95
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,470
And all flowers are different.

96
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:02,840
Their fragrance is different.

97
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:08,720
IT’s a miracle that is created but we take
it for granted.

98
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:12,310
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart.

99
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:15,900
He’ll say it the autonomous nervous system.

100
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,460
But who is this auto?

101
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,460
Who is the one?

102
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:20,460
Who does it?

103
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:21,540
They don’t know.

104
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:28,460
At the most they will say it is the autonomous
nervous system.

105
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:34,640
Beyond these systems, we have this system
here of these three channels.

106
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:44,720
And these three channels, left and right channels,
look after your right and left sympathetic

107
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:52,470
nervous system, which are responsible on the
right side for your physical and mental activity.

108
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:56,020
On the left hand side, for your emotional
activity.

109
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:05,900
In the centre, these two sympathetics, they
form a loop like this and the chakras, the

110
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,260
centres are created.

111
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:18,540
These centres are responsible for our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual being.

112
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:26,470
But when we start exhausting whatever limited
energy it has then we start developing either

113
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:31,050
physical, mental, emotional or spiritual problems.

114
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:39,100
If somehow we can save these centres from
state of jeopardy we can solve the problem

115
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:52,410
of physical problem, of mental problem, and
also emotional, spiritual problems.

116
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:58,110
Now we must tell you that we have cured through
Sahaj Yoga.

117
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:05,060
I shouldn’t say we have because it is your
own Kundalini that has done the job.

118
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:13,260
People who suffered from blood cancer; people
who have suffered from lots of incurable diseases;

119
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:19,270
we don’t have to go through the rigmarole
of horrible diagnoses.

120
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:23,020
You can diagnose a person on your finger tips.

121
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:29,120
Because these fingertips, 5,6 and 7, are denoting
your centres within yourself.

122
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:30,120
They get enlightened.

123
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:42,080
So with the light of the spirit when you are
enlightened, you really become an enlightened

124
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,080
person.

125
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,870
It is not just a certificate, I am this , I
am that.

126
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:50,740
It is something that happens to your awareness.

127
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:57,800
The first thing that happens as I told you:
you go beyond the mind that you become thoughtlessly

128
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,800
aware.

129
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,710
In Sanskrit, we call it ‘nirvichar samadhi’.

130
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:05,970
It is an instant happening.

131
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:11,050
Maybe the modern times are such that Kundalini
rises like a jet.

132
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:15,270
And in thousands of people, it has worked.

133
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:21,300
But to establish that situation of thoughtless
awareness, you have to meditate at the most

134
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,240
for 10 minutes, in the evening.

135
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:27,470
But immediately you will feel absolutely peaceful.

136
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:34,370
You’ll feel like witness of the whole drama
that is going on, and with that drama you’ll

137
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:41,510
be able to see that there’s nothing to be
afraid of, nothing to be worried, because

138
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:45,860
you are out of that problem, you can solve
it.

139
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:53,500
Like if you are standing in the water, in
the sea, and it is turbulent, you see the

140
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,280
waves rising higher and higher, you’re frightened.

141
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:08,480
But supposing you can get into a boat then
you can watch the same scene with such attention

142
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:13,460
and with enjoyment because you know it cannot
hurt you.

143
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:20,890
But supposing you can jump into the sea because
you are a great swimmer, you can save many

144
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:21,890
others.

145
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:33,690
So in the second state where you become doubtlessly
aware, you become all powerful, because you

146
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,500
can give realization to others.

147
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:43,230
Its like one enlightened light or a candle
can light many candles, you can give realization

148
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,480
to many people.

149
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:51,220
They say that Sahaj Yoga is working in 108
countries where I’ve not been.

150
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,820
I’ve been to many but not so many.

151
01:17:53,820 --> 01:18:01,850
Only the people who got their realization
went down to all these places and have given

152
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,640
awakening to so many people.

153
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,000
It’s something that is within you.

154
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,720
This kundalini is your own mother.

155
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,770
She’s your individual mother.

156
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,290
She knows everything about you.

157
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:19,500
She’s very anxious to give you your self-realisation.

158
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:27,090
As your mother took all the pains when you
were born, she takes all the pain.

159
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:37,900
She’s so anxious that if she knows that
there is a atmosphere that she can awaken

160
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:45,490
your inner being, she spontaneously rises
and doesn’t give you any trouble whatsoever.

161
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:51,260
It’s a living process of evolution as I
told you.

162
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:58,250
We cannot explain any living process in a
very scientific method because supposing you

163
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:06,040
have a seed, and you plant it in the mother
earth, it sprouts.

164
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:16,160
Because the mother earth has got power to
sprout it and the seed has got power to be

165
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,230
sprouted.

166
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:21,780
It is no effort.

167
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:32,090
The seed is to be treated with respect and
it has to be planted inside the mother earth.

168
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:35,650
It is a very simple thing.

169
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:40,750
Now, people think that how can it be so simple.

170
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:44,910
For them it should be a very difficult thing.

171
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:47,840
But everything vital in this world is simple.

172
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,440
For example, our breathing.

173
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:58,930
Supposing for our breathing we had to do some
or take some lessons, or consult some books,

174
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,740
what would have happened?

175
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:07,770
It’s a very vital thing which has to happen
and that’s why it is very simple.

176
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:17,500
I think these are the times I call them as
blossom time, where suddenly so many seekers

177
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,790
have come and the Kundalini is taking this
form.

178
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:29,210
Of course, it is predicted also by Kundalini
long time back that such and such thing will

179
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:30,210
happen.

180
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:38,870
But still it will happen in such a big proportion
I could never have guessed.

181
01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:41,720
What happens to you when the Kundalini rises?

182
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:47,780
First of all you feel the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost.

183
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:51,470
Now what is this cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

184
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:57,390
It is the all pervading power of Divine Love.

185
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:02,410
This Divine Love is the one which gives you
these flowers.

186
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:07,360
Is called also as ‘ritambara pragya’ by
Patanjali.

187
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,730
It is also called as ‘param chaitanya’.

188
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,860
It is also called as ‘rooh’.

189
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:19,590
Also it is called as ‘nirakaar’.

190
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,300
You can call it by any name.

191
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,920
in the Bible it is called the all-pervading
power of divine love.

192
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:28,640
Whatever you may call it.

193
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:36,310
It is something which is an energy around
us which is a very subtle energy.

194
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:44,940
Which works into every atom and molecule,
into everything, penetrates into anything.

195
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:50,500
This special energy we have never felt before.

196
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,630
For the first time tonight, you are going
to feel it.

197
01:21:54,630 --> 01:22:02,530
Also this is called as the Last Judgement
because there are people who like to go to

198
01:22:02,530 --> 01:22:10,240
people who can be bought whom they can pay
money for self-realisation.

199
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,420
People who can deceive them.

200
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:22,860
People who can tell them stories something
artificial, and they get bound by those permissive

201
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:27,050
marketing ideas.

202
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:31,090
If they’re permissive people like them because
it supports their weaknesses.

203
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:35,710
If it is ego-related, they like it because
it boosts their ego.

204
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,120
So, the judgement is now.

205
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:44,510
It is for you to judge whether you want the
absolute truth or not.

206
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:51,190
The difference between Truth and Absolute
Truth is this that Absolute Truth is felt

207
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:57,090
by everyone on the Central Nervous System
which we called as ‘bodh’.

208
01:22:57,090 --> 01:23:00,460
From where the word Buddha has come.

209
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,820
Another one is ‘ved’.

210
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:09,240
Veda is to know it on your CNS not mentally.

211
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,970
Not on mental level.

212
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:13,180
On your fingertips.

213
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:20,910
And on your fingertips you can find out what
is the Absolute Truth and what is the Relative

214
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:21,930
Truth.

215
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:30,940
Supposing you have 10 children who are realized
souls and you tie up their eyes and ask them

216
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:34,910
to say what is wrong with the person who is
standing before you.

217
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:43,010
They will all raise the same finger or fingers
which will mean maybe that he has a bad heart

218
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:45,940
or he has got mental problems.

219
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,760
It can be easily found out what’s wrong
with that person.

220
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:58,160
Now if you know how to correct your centres,
you can also correct the centres of others.

221
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:02,830
And thus, you can help the whole world.

222
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:07,350
To get emancipated, it’s the thing by which
you are resurrected.

223
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:13,010
Again I would say Mohammad Sahab has said
though he didn’t write Quran but there are

224
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:19,920
lots of things left behind somehow, that your
hands will speak at the time of resurrection,

225
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,980
at the time of ‘qiyamah’.

226
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:26,670
This is exactly what happens that you can
feel on your ends of your fingertips your

227
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:30,870
centres and centres of others.

228
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:39,010
Because you get into a new dimension of your
awareness which we call as collective consciousness.

229
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:42,340
Become collectively conscious.

230
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:50,030
Sitting down here you can know the vibrations
of another person.

231
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,200
You can know what’s wrong with that person.

232
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,100
Even if he’s dead, you can know about it.

233
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:02,670
It’s very interesting how you become full
knowledgeable and after some time you will

234
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:08,440
be amazed that you can even tell the future
of a person.

235
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:17,940
It’s very simple because if you become a
saint of that level, what is future and what

236
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:19,210
is past.

237
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:23,620
it’s all absolutely in your brain already
built-in.

238
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:30,900
Only thing is that you are not open to it
so far, but with the light of the spirit everything

239
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,460
opens up in your brain.

240
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:38,200
I’ve seen children who are very dull in
class who were brought today because they

241
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,600
were hopelessly bad, failing all the time.

242
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,240
Stood first, got scholarships.

243
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:51,050
And most of the students from Sahaj Yoga I’ve
seen are always breaking the records everywhere.

244
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:55,160
If this is the advantage only, I would have
said it’s all right, it’s alright, it’s

245
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:56,160
nothing great.

246
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:06,450
But the greatest advantage I think is that
your personality moves to totality, you get

247
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:08,280
your identification.

248
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,610
See people have no identity.

249
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:17,570
Why these people paint their heads and wear
funny dresses because they want to express

250
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:19,340
their identity.

251
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:26,790
Your identity is within yourself, is your
spirit and once you know your spirit you will

252
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:29,690
be amazed how dynamic you are.

253
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:37,170
I’ve known many artists who were very ordinary
artists in India specially.

254
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:40,860
You know Amjad Ali was a ordinary artist.

255
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:44,430
After coming to Sahaj Yoga he has become such
a great artist.

256
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,830
Safat, Hussain, so many of them.

257
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:52,260
Because I am telling you, you don’t have
to believe it, you can ask them.

258
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:56,810
There are so many people like this who have
achieved a lot.

259
01:26:56,810 --> 01:27:01,480
There are many who could never speak a word
on the stage that the stage fear.

260
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,530
They have become great orators and speakers.

261
01:27:04,530 --> 01:27:08,430
They’ve become free to express themselves.

262
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:15,410
Then we have people who have become Chartered
Accountants, who have never known what is

263
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:23,010
language is, what is the beauty of poetries,
they’ve become great poets.

264
01:27:23,010 --> 01:27:27,900
Like this so many things have happened to
people but we don’t want to publicize and

265
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,470
we don’t want to give it in the newspapers.

266
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:39,450
We don’t allow people to talk about it because
that is not the main thing you have to achieve.

267
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,700
Firstly, you are collectively conscious.

268
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:48,120
But when you become collectively conscious,
you don’t react, because you know if a person

269
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,090
is trying to be harsh with you, you know why
he’s harsh.

270
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:57,640
If a person is trying to be nice with you,
you know why he is; because you know you do

271
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,840
not react, you just watch.

272
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:06,430
And this watching is something like your attention
being directed towards the problem.

273
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:11,450
This attention when directed towards that
problem, acts.

274
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:12,450
It acts.

275
01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:19,740
It’s not just an attention that goes out
but it works out things.

276
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:26,890
So many miracles have taken place in Sahaj
Yoga that it is impossible to understand this

277
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:30,100
all-pervading power how it is working.

278
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:34,640
As I say it is ruta yuga.

279
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,120
Kalyug is about to finish and ruta yuga has
started.

280
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:47,790
Rut Yuga means the one in which this Param
Chaitanya, this all-pervading power is acting.

281
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:53,930
It is acting, it acts in so many ways that
you are surprised at the miracles it has created.

282
01:28:53,930 --> 01:29:00,050
It’s not the time I could tell you about
this but those who are here who have got their

283
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:05,690
realization have been blessed by Sahaj Yoga
can tell each one of them lots of things that

284
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:13,050
they have seen that has happened to them,
and how their lives were transformed.

285
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:16,360
This transformation is very important today.

286
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:23,450
With this transformation, people lose the
sense of greed.

287
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:29,280
You know nowadays this greed has brought politicians
to such a level.

288
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,840
It is so stupid to have this greed.

289
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,090
The satisfaction part comes in through Sahaj
Yoga.

290
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:45,740
As you know there is a law of economics that
in general wants are not satiable.

291
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:49,710
Today I want to buy a car, then I don’t
enjoy it.

292
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:52,870
I want to have a house, I don’t enjoy it.

293
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:59,350
Then I want to have an aeroplane, I don’t
enjoy it.

294
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:03,480
Because, we don’t know what we want!

295
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:09,060
We run after these things one after another
like mad and the greed starts working to such

296
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:18,790
a stupid limit that people want to put all
this money into the vaults, they want to have

297
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:20,120
vaults of money.

298
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:28,690
And the stupidity goes to that limit, not
only greed, then also the jealousies we have.

299
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:38,040
Because we think that the people who are with
us are not the people who should be there,

300
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:44,600
or we should supersede them or we should be
at a higher position.

301
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,690
Actually, there is no love, no compassion.

302
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:50,210
There’s no understanding of another person.

303
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:57,340
But when Sahaj Yoga takes place, I have seen
thousands of people whether they are from

304
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:04,670
Russia, from England, America, Australia,
anywhere, I’ve seen them thousands together,

305
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:12,190
they live together, they feel each other,
they understand each other, and the love they

306
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:15,500
have for each other is tremendous.

307
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:21,650
If something happens to someone anywhere in
the world, the whole society you can call

308
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:30,220
it, you can call the nations where Sahaj Yogis
are there, they are so concerned, as they

309
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:34,090
would not normally be even about their brothers.

310
01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,370
All kinds of help.

311
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,810
All kinds of suggestions come in.

312
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:40,310
Doctors will run through they’ll come up.

313
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:43,440
IT’s such a big society.

314
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,410
Such a big moral relationships that starts.

315
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:49,210
Every body helps.

316
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:52,570
But that doesn’t mean one will become…

317
01:31:52,570 --> 01:32:05,420
(Only possible in Australia I tell you.

318
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:13,730
If you’re interested in your well-being,
in your transformation, you must have some

319
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:20,430
patience, otherwise how is it going to work
out.

320
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:26,590
On the contrary, I have seen in Russia, there
are never less than 16-18 thousand people,

321
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:29,180
and not one person would leave.

322
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,560
After all what is so great about that.

323
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:32,680
I can’t understand.

324
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:41,050
We are in a democratic country and we have
got freedom to do whatever we like all right!

325
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:45,300
But what about the freedom to wisdom.

326
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,980
To understanding.

327
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:53,610
Russians I think are people, of course communism
or anything I am not very much for favour

328
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,610
of it.

329
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:55,610
But one thing.

330
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:57,110
They haven’t developed that possessiveness.

331
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,700
They’re not possessive.

332
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:07,420
They’re so sweet that their government gave
them their houses.

333
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,790
And they said you can have these houses.

334
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:12,290
These flats you can have them your own.

335
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:16,590
We don’t want to have it, you can have it.

336
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:22,090
Apart from that, you see once I was there,
there was a coup, and I asked them aren’t

337
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:23,090
you worried?

338
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:24,090
There’s a coup on!

339
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:25,090
And all these things happening.

340
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:26,650
They said, Mother, Why should we?

341
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:30,650
We are in the kingdom of God.

342
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:36,930
I was surprised at their positive understanding
of themselves.

343
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:40,200
That’s what you are.

344
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,820
You’re so powerful within.

345
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:44,360
You’re so dynamic within.

346
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:47,580
It’s such a treasure within you.

347
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:52,460
You’ve not known your glory which you have
to.

348
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:57,690
Once you know that you become satisfied with
yourself to begin with.

349
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:02,050
but that doesn’t mean that you become poor
or financially disturbed.

350
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:03,420
Not at all!

351
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:10,610
On the contrary, I have seen now in Australia
itself, people who have come to Sahaj Yoga

352
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:15,280
are all very well employed, very happy people.

353
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,220
It all works out because your attention becomes
enlightened.

354
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:22,410
Attention becomes concentrated.

355
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,580
Doesn’t flit around.

356
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:27,340
Doesn’t take your mind here and there.

357
01:34:27,340 --> 01:34:30,830
And you see the right thing at the right time.

358
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:36,040
You become a personality of great penetration.

359
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:42,170
You don’t do anything as such in the sense
that you don’t react, but the attention

360
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:45,930
itself acts and works for you.

361
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:52,060
You must know that we’re not only ordinary
human beings.

362
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:57,770
And as great saints, they’re nothing, they
were not even some of them educated people,

363
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:04,680
but what was so great about them that they
were one with the divine power.

364
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:10,430
They had this power flowing through you and
they were so dynamic, and you could see the

365
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:12,540
dynamism in them.

366
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:18,180
This is with your attention it happens.

367
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:20,720
You know the absolute truth.

368
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,150
If you know the absolute truth, then how can
there be a quarrel.

369
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:28,860
Supposing all of you know I am sitting down
here, now you won’t fight on that issue

370
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,280
whether I am here or not.

371
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,690
Because everyone is seeing the same thing.

372
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:41,120
So if you all know absolute truth you see,
then there is no question of argument.

373
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:44,120
No question of discussion.

374
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,700
But everybody will know the same thing.

375
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:55,030
That’s how there cannot be any wars if all
the people believe in the same thing.

376
01:35:55,030 --> 01:36:01,170
Of course in every country we have lots of
Sahaj Yogis, I must say.

377
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:06,690
And there are also some politicians in Sahaj
Yoga.

378
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:07,690
Some.

379
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:16,910
If it reaches the helm of affairs, I’m sure,
a day will come that people will give up the

380
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:20,200
idea of war completely.

381
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:27,580
No question having any war or any struggle,
any fight, or anybody putting up atomic bombs

382
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:30,490
around.

383
01:36:30,490 --> 01:36:38,730
It all comes from the ignorance and the blindness
of people who do not see that we are part

384
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:41,330
and parcel of the whole.

385
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:49,150
But when it happens to you that you become
one with the divine, then you’re like a

386
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,730
little drop dissolved into the ocean.

387
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:55,030
Ocean of joy.

388
01:36:55,030 --> 01:37:02,080
Now joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

389
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,510
It is singular.

390
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:11,490
Once we jump into the ocean of joy everything
is a joy.

391
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:14,760
If it ridiculous, you laugh at it.

392
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,170
If it is sublime, you enjoy it.

393
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:28,830
And the whole personality becomes so beautiful
and vibrant that it absorbs everything that

394
01:37:28,830 --> 01:37:29,950
is constructive.

395
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:32,960
All that is destructive is dropped off.

396
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:40,170
You’ll be amazed that in Sahaj Yoga 50%
people in the West who had taken to drugs,

397
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:41,390
have dropped off.

398
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:45,810
who had taken to destructive methods, have
finished with it.

399
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:50,680
So many destructive habits which they could
not give up, have been completely given up

400
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,520
by them.

401
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,800
This is not because of any compulsion.

402
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:04,080
Without any discipline, or force but your
own power of spirit makes you your own master

403
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:11,030
your own Guru and you see in the light of
the spirit what is good for you what is bad

404
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:12,030
for you.

405
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:13,590
Nobody has to tell you about it.

406
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,990
It just happens.

407
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:18,990
Now you saw these people these western people
singing.

408
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:27,510
It’s a Marathi song written by Ramdeva,
in the 16th century all over villagers also

409
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,510
sing

410
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:33,420
The way they were pronouncing you’ll be
amazed I mean nobody can pronounce.

411
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:38,350
It is very difficult for Western people to
pronounce our difficult tongue twister languages,

412
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:44,620
but they are the ones who have picked up not
only the language but also the music.

413
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:52,700
We’re surprised from Romania, three boys
came in 2 months’ time they started singing

414
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,670
qawwali just like Nusrat Jahan.

415
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:58,170
We were surprised how good they take to it.

416
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:59,170
So easily.

417
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,390
I mean you just become like a genius.

418
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:06,090
In every walk of life it becomes so different.

419
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:13,230
Your stress and strain all these things drop
off because now you are connected with the

420
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:21,910
all-pervading power of Divine Love which guides
you, which works for you, which helps you,

421
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,280
all the time.

422
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:30,580
It’s a blissful existence which is your
birth right which you should have.

423
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:38,670
In one lecture of course you cannot tell all
about you because it’s very very deep down

424
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:39,670
within you.

425
01:39:39,670 --> 01:39:43,090
All these things are sprouting and existing.

426
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:48,550
But once you get your realization you have
to know that now you have become a collective

427
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:53,680
being for which I must say that you can’t
do as you are doing meditation at home.

428
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,200
You have to come to the collective.

429
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,960
Today it’s a collective happening.

430
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,810
I’m talking of global transformation.

431
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:04,380
For that this collective happening has to
take place.

432
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:14,250
Thus we can avoid all the struggles, all the
strife, and all the horrible wars completely.

433
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,510
There is no compulsion for anything.

434
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:23,480
You yourself know what is good for you and
what is bad for you.

435
01:40:23,480 --> 01:40:29,390
I hope today you all get your realization
, you will, if you desire.

436
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:31,900
Definitely you’ll all get your realization.

437
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:32,900
No doubt.

438
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:41,630
But then you should not allow yourself to
be just blown off for a while and then again

439
01:40:41,630 --> 01:40:43,230
you don’t develop yourself.

440
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:47,100
It’s like a seed that grows into a tree.

441
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:51,410
You all have to grow into a tree which is
not difficult, especially Australians have

442
01:40:51,410 --> 01:41:01,040
a speciality I have seen, they can grow very
fast into their ascent in very simple way

443
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:07,130
and luckily we have very good centres here,
very very good Sahaj Yogis.

444
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:14,150
It’s working very well and I’m sure you
are all going to enjoy your realization and

445
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,150
your growth.

446
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:17,580
For that you have to come to collective.

447
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:24,730
Of course we don’t have elaborate arrangements
and things like that because we don’ believe

448
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:26,550
in publicity or marketing.

449
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:34,100
It is your desire that you have to come humbly
and get to know all about it.

450
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:42,140
It is not mental knowledge but it is the knowledge
on your Central nervous system.

451
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:44,060
So many things are happening here.

452
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:51,480
I was told also that a wing has been given
in some hospital in Australia, maybe in Sydeny,

453
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:56,260
where people could be treated by Sahaj Yoga,
for which you don’t have to take medicines,

454
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:59,950
you don’t have to pay to the doctors, nothing.

455
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:05,030
That’s one thing one should know you can’t
pay for God.

456
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:06,030
You can’t.

457
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:07,090
God doesn’t understand money.

458
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:09,800
He doesn’t understand bank.

459
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:16,400
He has no idea about what all these things
we have done to ourselves.

460
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:23,540
So best thing is to remember that only you
have to give some respect to your self-realisation.

461
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,540
Respect yourself.

462
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:29,510
Love and compassion for yourself And forgive
yourself.

463
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:37,740
That’s one of the ways we can really understand
that we are human beings at the epitome of

464
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,820
evolution and we have to achieve this in our
lifetime.

465
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:48,020
It is such a tremendous luck that at this
time at this juncture you are here.

466
01:42:48,020 --> 01:42:57,480
To get your realization and grow into it.

467
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:12,200
May god bless you!

468
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,460
it will hardly take 10 minutes.

469
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:20,980
Hardly 10 minutes to get your realization.

470
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:22,780
But I would request those who want to go to
go now.

471
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:27,510
You should not disturb others later on.

472
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:32,590
It will be better that they go now.

473
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:43,240
If you want Sahaj Yoga, you want to have your
ascent, then please you should not disturb

474
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,660
others.

475
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:51,470
Stay here and follow few things that I am
going to tell you.

476
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:54,000
It’s very simple as I told you.

477
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,200
IT has to work fast.

478
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,350
It has worked very fast these days.

479
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:08,670
I was amazed, that in Shivaji Park there were
60-70 thousand people and it worked out in

480
01:44:08,670 --> 01:44:09,670
5 minutes.

481
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:12,890
I was amazed how things work out these days.

482
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:16,570
It is getting faster and faster.

483
01:44:16,570 --> 01:44:36,380
First, it used to take hours together, but
not now.

484
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:40,600
There are conditions which are very simple.

485
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:46,410
First as I told you please forgive yourself.

486
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:50,080
People must have told you that you are a sinner
or that this is wrong that is wrong and we

487
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,090
develop guilt.

488
01:44:51,090 --> 01:44:57,670
Also it is a fashion I think to develop a
guilt for everything.

489
01:44:57,670 --> 01:45:02,210
Now supposing we do not follow any norms of
modern life.

490
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:05,030
There are also some stupid norms you see.

491
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:10,370
And if you don’t follow anyone of them,
then you start feeling guilty.

492
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:12,930
I should have done this, I should have done
that.

493
01:45:12,930 --> 01:45:17,630
But we don’t know how we harm ourselves
by feeling guilty.

494
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:22,970
The centre on the left hand side, gets into
problem.

495
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:30,460
When this centre gets into problem minimum
of minimum you might develop spondylitis on

496
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:32,660
the physical side.

497
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:38,810
Then we might develop the disease called hearts
disease, angina.

498
01:45:38,810 --> 01:45:48,310
Then also we might get all our organs in the
viscera, all the organs can become very lethargic.

499
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:55,700
So to feel guilty is also a nonsense if you
see because whatever mistake you have committed

500
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:56,870
is past.

501
01:45:56,870 --> 01:46:02,740
At that time you should have corrected it
but what sense of now feeling guilty about

502
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:08,000
it and torturing yourself.

503
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,710
Whatever you have done is finished and gone.

504
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:15,680
At least for Mother, the son is never guilty.

505
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:25,420
In the same way, in the eyes of god you are
not guilty.

506
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:30,500
So you have to say in your heart – you can
call me Mother or Sri Mataji, Mother I am

507
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,100
not guilty at all.

508
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:42,770
The another simple thing to do is as you have
forgiven yourself forgive everyone.

509
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:48,220
Even without thinking about them.

510
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:53,460
Because logically whether you have forgiven
or not you have done nothing.

511
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:56,070
I don’t forgive means what.

512
01:46:56,070 --> 01:47:05,740
Means that I am torturing myself all the time
all my life for somebody who is enjoying himself.

513
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:12,310
We play into wrong hands if we don’t forgive.

514
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:14,210
But by that what happens to our chakras.

515
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:23,560
That this centre in the crossing of the optic
chiasm is like this is absolutely constricted.

516
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:24,870
Absolutely constricted.

517
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:29,680
And unless and until you don’t forgive it
won’t open at all and the Kundalini cannot

518
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,680
cross over.

519
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:34,730
This is the last barrier we have.

520
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:42,680
So just forget and forgive all the people
in general if you want.

521
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,860
Don’t think about them.

522
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:48,710
Because that is also a headache to remember
whom you have to forgive.

523
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:51,250
They don’t deserve that attention.

524
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:57,350
So just forgive altogether, you will feel
lighter even now immediately if you just forgive

525
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:58,670
everyone.

526
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:02,710
These are the two conditions.

527
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:05,110
I don’t think are so difficult.

528
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:10,740
Third one is you have to take out your shoes.

529
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:18,030
But I hope you don’t mind because in England
first time when I said you have to take out

530
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:24,840
your shoes half of them walked out.

531
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:28,540
Why shoes because this Mother Earth helps
us a lot.

532
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:30,380
She sucks in our problems.

533
01:48:30,380 --> 01:49:01,210
When you’re your socks on it doesn’t matter.

534
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:03,620
Now you know that these five are sympathetic.

535
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:24,010
Now you please put these hands towards me
like this.

536
01:49:24,010 --> 01:49:32,870
Just like this.

537
01:49:32,870 --> 01:49:48,760
Please put your right hand towards me like
this and the left hand on top of the fontanel

538
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:56,550
bone area (tadu) which was the soft bone on
top of your head.

539
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:58,420
Now put down your head.

540
01:49:58,420 --> 01:50:03,230
Now please don’t put it on top.

541
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:06,520
But away from it.

542
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,330
Now see for yourself.

543
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,900
Please put down your head.

544
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:19,840
If you want you can take out your spectacles.

545
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:29,450
Now see for yourself if there’s a cool or
hot breeze like vibrations are coming out

546
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:33,060
of your fontanel bone area.

547
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:35,240
Some people get it a little far away.

548
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,280
Some get it quite close.

549
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:38,640
Now don’t feel guilty.

550
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:46,030
I can feel your centres out of which this
guilty business is quite a lot.

551
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:52,870
If it is hot then you should know that you
have not forgiven yourself and or you have

552
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:54,610
not forgiven others.

553
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:57,250
So please forgive now.

554
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:58,430
You can move your hand.

555
01:50:58,430 --> 01:51:00,520
It may be close to your head.

556
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,310
It might be away from it.

557
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:03,310
Depends on.

558
01:51:03,310 --> 01:51:07,860
And move your hand and see for yourself.

559
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:10,840
Now please put left hand towards me.

560
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:21,140
And please put down your head and see for
yourself on top of your head on the fontanel

561
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:25,530
bone area which was the soft bone in your
childhood.

562
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:30,490
See for yourself if there is a cool or a hot
breeze coming out of your head.

563
01:51:30,490 --> 01:51:32,990
Out of your head.

564
01:51:32,990 --> 01:51:43,200
Here again I will request you to forgive yourself
and to forgive others.

565
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,370
Please.

566
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:49,090
That will definitely help.

567
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:50,270
Now.

568
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:53,350
Please take your right hand towards me.

569
01:51:53,350 --> 01:52:00,660
And now see for yourself with your left hand
on top of your head if there’s a cool or

570
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:16,030
a hot breeze like vibrations

571
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,030
are coming.

572
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:18,030
Actually, you have to desire it.

573
01:52:18,030 --> 01:52:21,340
It is not meant for arrogant people.

574
01:52:21,340 --> 01:52:24,890
But meant for humble who want to have their
self-realisation.

575
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:34,490
You have to humble down.

576
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:41,920
Now please put both your hands towards the
sky like this and put back your head.

577
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,150
Push back.

578
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:48,750
Here you have to ask a question in your heart
three times.

579
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:52,230
Any one of these questions you can ask.

580
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:53,230
Three times.

581
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:57,290
Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost?

582
01:52:57,290 --> 01:53:02,130
Or Mother is this the all-pervading power
of Divine Love?

583
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:07,810
Or Mother is this the Param Chaitanya?

584
01:53:07,810 --> 01:53:14,300
Ask any one of these questions three times.

585
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,730
In your heart.

586
01:53:16,730 --> 01:53:22,400
Push back your head and your hands.

587
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:27,280
Now please take down your hands.

588
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:35,620
Now, if you can put both your hands towards
me like this and watch me without thinking.

589
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:43,250
Just watch me without thinking.

590
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,500
Some people are getting it here.

591
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:47,930
So you can push it up if they are getting
down here.

592
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:52,610
Just push it up.

593
01:53:52,610 --> 01:54:00,790
Watch me without thinking.

594
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:06,960
All those who have felt cool breeze on the
fingertips or in the centre of the palm or

595
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:16,460
out of the fontanel bone area, whether hot
or cool, please raise both your hands.

596
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:22,360
My goodness!

597
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:31,770
I bow to you all of you have felt it which
is very great experience for me.

598
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,850
So may God bless you all.

599
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:37,140
Now your saintly life has started.

600
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:39,120
So be careful.

601
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:44,450
You don’t have to give up anything outside.

602
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:47,930
You don’t have to renounce anything.

603
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:54,730
Everything there and you have become a saint.

604
01:54:54,730 --> 01:55:03,580
So please respect your self-realisation and
develop it so that you can help yourself and

605
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:07,280
help everyone around.

606
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:14,620
I must tell you I was surprised that there
was a good centre started in Israel.

607
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:19,290
And the people who started were Germans and
Austrians.

608
01:55:19,290 --> 01:55:29,850
IT was such a feeling of joy for me that look
at these Germans they feel responsible for

609
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:34,830
the Jews they have gone to Israel to give
them their realisation.

610
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:37,650
Such love and such compassion.

611
01:55:37,650 --> 01:55:44,740
Such transformation that you will enjoy your
virtues you will enjoy yourself.

612
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:53,380
May God bless you all.

613
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:59,570
I will like our school children to sing one
song so that they will see for themselves

614
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:14,280
how they have picked up if there are here.

615
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:19,560
Are there our school children here?

616
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,730
Have we got?

617
01:56:22,730 --> 01:56:25,890
No not here.

618
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:26,950
Any?

619
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:30,120
Come here then.

620
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:42,800
‘Sabko aane nahi diya shayad’ (Perhaps
they were not allowed to come).

621
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:47,020
Yes yes come along.

622
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:50,180
Nothing like children.

623
01:56:50,180 --> 01:56:53,810
We have to learn so much from them.

624
01:56:53,810 --> 01:56:55,260
Alright.

625
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:59,600
Come and join.

626
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,510
Come forward.

627
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:09,460
All the little girls should sit in front.

628
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:13,060
And the little boys.

629
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:17,560
‘Samne aao’ [Hindi] (come forward).

630
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,560
Yes.

631
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:19,360
Good.
