1
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:11,250
..blind folded.

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:17,584
But you have to keep your mind open like a scientist

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,083
to understand

4
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:25,626
we have not yet found out the absolute truth.

5
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,626
We live in a relative world

6
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:34,209
and that's why we have problems.

7
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:39,083
So many problems we face today,

8
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:43,667
ecological problems are there, drug problems, sickness, this, that.

9
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:48,125
And as if we feel

10
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:54,751
there is a kind of a destructive force that is working

11
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:02,083
and we are really bothered,

12
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:05,918
some are frightened

13
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:12,083
who understand the devastation that is possible.

14
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:19,250
The reason for all these problems

15
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:22,000
is very simple

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,292
and if we can just go

17
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:33,459
into the scriptures of all the religions,

18
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,000
there is one common point about them.

19
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:41,876
The common thing,

20
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:46,667
all of them have said in essence one thing,

21
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:52,209
and they have said that you have to seek the eternal.

22
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,918
Seek the eternal!

23
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:58,542
Not take it for granted that you have got it.

24
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:01,417
Seek the eternal

25
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:05,959
and the transitory is to be used

26
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,042
in its own limitations and understanding.

27
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:13,876
Here we have gone wrong

28
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:19,834
because we have worried too much about transitory things

29
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:23,584
and nothing about the eternal.

30
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:28,959
The transitory things are transitory

31
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:36,959
because it has got the build in quality of getting destroyed.

32
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,959
That's why they are transitory

33
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:43,042
otherwise they would have been eternal.

34
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:47,876
This build in quality in the transitory things

35
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,959
brings in all kinds of problems.

36
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:01,876
When we look at these problems

37
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,834
we have to look back and see

38
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,334
that by seeking eternal, how the solution can come.

39
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:18,292
It's said in all religions that you have to be born again.

40
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:28,167
That means they have indicated that we have to have

41
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:35,209
a more - greater dimension,

42
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:39,000
a more awakened state

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,501
or a greater dimension of awareness.

44
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:48,834
Not that to certify yourself as "we are born again".

45
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,501
If you just want to certify yourself

46
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,918
and want to live in ignorance

47
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:58,209
and a blind following another blind, is not going to work out.

48
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:03,334
One has to accept that so far

49
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,167
we have not found the absolute

50
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,000
and that to find that absolute

51
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:21,375
we have to actualize the second birth.

52
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:28,000
Is not some sort of an artificial baptism that is going to work out:

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,250
Our fathers were baptised and their fathers were baptised

54
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,792
and we have been baptised and baptised and baptised.

55
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,667
In every religion they have some sort of

56
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,542
an artificial method of baptism,

57
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,501
whether it's Hindu, Christian, Muslims, everybody has.

58
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:48,083
But nobody has actualized

59
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,918
and that actualization has to take place,

60
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:59,000
for which the Creator must have

61
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,709
created something great within us.

62
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,834
When we see the civilisation outside

63
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:14,792
and then we realize that there is something wrong in it,

64
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:21,250
we have to know that this outside growths

65
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,542
is like a tree growing outward.

66
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:29,626
But the roots must be nourished, we must know the roots.

67
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:34,000
And this is the knowledge of the roots.

68
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:39,250
Now you have to take it as a hypotheses whatever I am saying to you.

69
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:41,667
Not to take it for granted.

70
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,417
It's a hypotheses.

71
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:50,626
If it works then in all your honesty you have to accept it.

72
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,667
It is being said

73
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:58,125
by Jung, has said it clearly

74
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:02,918
that you have to get your Self-realization

75
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:09,042
by which you will have collective consciousness,

76
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,292
a new dimension to your awareness.

77
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,292
Or we say, we are all brothers, alright,

78
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:22,709
every country is one country, God has created one world,

79
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,125
they talk of United Nations and all that,

80
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:30,334
but they are not.

81
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,167
Let something happen and you will find

82
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:37,501
all of them are hither and thither.

83
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:46,042
Why? Why it happens this way that we cannot

84
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:51,209
see that unity in people who talk about it?

85
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:55,250
We cannot feel that peace about which they talk?

86
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,751
They have got peace foundations and

87
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,209
they have got all kinds of organisations,

88
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,292
talking of big, big things, but we don't find that

89
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:09,542
those who are running them have any peace within themselves.

90
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:15,334
So with unreal things we cannot create reality.

91
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:22,250
Thus we have to realise that

92
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:26,959
the time has come for us to take our second birth.

93
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,167
If we want to have any meaning to our life,

94
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:36,584
to our human life, we have to have our second birth.

95
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,417
If we cannot have our second birth

96
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,751
our life is a waste, it has no meaning.

97
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:47,042
Now the second birth is -

98
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:51,876
I would say that in India, in Sanskrit language

99
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:58,792
we call a person who is twice born as "vijaha", is the born twice.

100
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:04,167
And the one who is born again also is called "vijaha",

101
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:08,334
Self-realized. A person who is born again is "vijaha".

102
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,751
And also a bird is called as "vijaha",

103
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,334
means the bird which is an egg first and it has a second birth

104
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:26,709
and by that second birth he becomes the real bird.

105
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:30,167
First the egg and then the bird.

106
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,042
This kind of second birth

107
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:39,918
has to actualize within us.

108
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,250
You try anything else - lecturing, sermoning,

109
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:51,334
doing all kinds of things that people do-

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,292
is not going to work out.

111
00:08:54,626 --> 00:09:00,375
Because it's a living process of living energy of God.

112
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:07,501
The living process works spontaneously, as like a seed,

113
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:12,626
you have to just put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself.

114
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:16,584
It sprouts - you can't say how,

115
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:21,792
because the Mother Earth has got the potential

116
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:24,876
and the seed has got the build in power.

117
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,250
In the same way we all are build in to be that.

118
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:38,250
Now Sahaja Yoga -" saha" means with, "ja" means with you is born -

119
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:43,501
is the right to be united with the Divine Power

120
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,542
which is all pervading.

121
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:50,918
Now when I talk of all pervading power of divine love

122
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,250
people might say, Mother is talking something

123
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,000
which we don't believe in.

124
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,292
You believe in it or not - it is so.

125
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,334
Now see these flowers, it's a miracle.

126
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:06,375
We can't create even one!

127
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,584
Who does this work?

128
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:13,709
And the choice - the roses will have roses,

129
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,709
jasmin will have jasmin,

130
00:10:17,042 --> 00:10:19,417
chrysanthemums will have chrysanthemums.

131
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,292
Who does this choice?

132
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,501
Done by this divine power

133
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,918
which is very subtle and all pervading.

134
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:34,292
Only after realization you can feel that power

135
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,209
as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

136
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:40,501
because that power is the Holy Spirit.

137
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:45,834
That power is the one which we call it in Sanskrit language

138
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,250
as Brahmachaitanya.

139
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,083
That power acts and works out all these wonderful things.

140
00:10:56,584 --> 00:11:01,125
Now in our evolutionary process we have reached the human stage.

141
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:05,000
We have to go little further to achieve it.

142
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,542
It's a very easy thing to do,

143
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:13,918
it can be easily done, takes hardly any time.

144
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,083
And I have to say that no amount of arguments

145
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:25,792
can bring forth this happening, it has to work out within yourself.

146
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:33,667
As a result of that you yourself in that enlightenment

147
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,209
know so many things

148
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:40,417
and that in that enlightenment

149
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:46,375
you know what is the Absolute and what is not.

150
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,584
In a way we can say, you become a saint.

151
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,584
A saint, who doesn't give up his family, his houses, anything.

152
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,667
He lives as he has to live with his own status,

153
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:02,209
with his own family life, with whatever it is.

154
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:06,209
Supposing Christ was born in a rich family,

155
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:09,918
He would have lived like a king, in complete detachment.

156
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:16,542
And if He was born in a poor family, as He was born,

157
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,125
He lived like a carpenter's son.

158
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,042
Because such a person has no attachment to things

159
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:30,375
and is not bothered as to what is important to other people.

160
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,083
What is the most important thing for such a person

161
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,876
is the benevolence of others.

162
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,542
He looks after the benevolence.

163
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:46,542
And the benevolence is done not by money,

164
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:51,375
by talking sweetly

165
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:57,083
but actually through the power that He has

166
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,167
of vibratory awareness.

167
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,167
Such a person has such innocent eyes

168
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:11,834
that even a glance of that eye can do wonders.

169
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:16,292
Now through your Kundalini awakening

170
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:21,250
people have been cured definitely of cancer

171
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:23,584
and of so many diseases.

172
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:27,667
And in Delhi University for your information there are three doctors

173
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:32,417
who have done their MD

174
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:36,417
with the theses on three subjects:

175
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:42,834
one with the physical abilities in Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:48,375
second epilepsy cured by Kundalini awakening

177
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:54,417
and third for psychosomatic diseases.

178
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:58,918
Psychosomatic diseases means

179
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,751
so many diseases which are supposed to be incurable

180
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:08,876
like Parkinson, cancer, aids.

181
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,959
And they have got their MDs.

182
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,584
Now in America as you know there is a law that

183
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:22,417
nobody can cure without the permission of your associations.

184
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,083
But you don't do anything.

185
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:28,167
Actually your Kundalini itself rises,

186
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:31,501
it's your own power that rises!

187
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,709
And you get just cured.

188
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:40,792
And how you get cured that I'll be telling you tomorrow,

189
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,000
how it works physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually,

190
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:50,501
and how you become a different personality,

191
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:53,334
a special personality,

192
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:57,000
who is endowed with collective consciousness

193
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:01,083
that you can feel the centres of another person and your own centres

194
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,792
and that you can raise the Kundalini of another person.

195
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,501
All these things can happen to you

196
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:14,042
and you can become that powerful person

197
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,959
as been described in the scriptures.

198
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,667
So today for the time being

199
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:26,459
let us think of getting your realization.

200
00:15:26,918 --> 00:15:32,417
And tomorrow again I'll tell you how these diseases can be cured

201
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:35,584
if we can get these centres

202
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:40,167
enriched and nourished by Kundalini awakening.

203
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,626
Talking about Sahaja Yoga and Kundalini

204
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,542
is very easy and anybody can talk about it.

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,417
But the main thing is to get your Self-realization.

206
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:57,542
I must have spoken in various places

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,709
and thousands of lectures I must have given.

208
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:08,292
But that is of no avail because

209
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,083
by lecturing you cannot get your realization.

210
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:15,918
There is no end to this knowledge

211
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:20,501
but as for opening these lights you have to just switch on one light,

212
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:22,209
one switch,

213
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:25,834
in the same way it's all build in within you,

214
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:28,918
only thing - you have to get it

215
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:32,834
and you have to feel this all pervading power.

216
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,792
So now I think let's have the experience,

217
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:38,709
will be the best idea.

218
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,542
And if you have any questions

219
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:46,459
you may write them and give it to us.

220
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,584
Tomorrow I hope to answer all your questions.

221
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:55,918
So I hope you like to have your realization first.

222
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:58,709
Is it all right?

223
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,125
I think those people who are very much far away could come forward,

224
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,334
would be better idea, this side.

225
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,709
Today is a very good day with Father's Day and

226
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:49,751
is also the day of our Creator.

227
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,000
Anyone can come here just to show?

228
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:42,584
All right.

229
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,125
You'll have to show where to put hands and things like that.

230
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,959
Is a very simple thing is that

231
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,459
first you have to take out your shoes

232
00:18:56,584 --> 00:19:00,292
because Mother Earth helps us a lot to take out our problems.

233
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:10,125
Now, it's a very simple method,

234
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,876
you don't have to do much.

235
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:18,459
But on the very outset there is one condition

236
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:26,959
that you have not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

237
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:32,083
Forget the past and please don't feel guilty.

238
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:37,667
Please don't feel guilty.

239
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,417
Forget the past.

240
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:42,626
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself

241
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:47,626
because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

242
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:52,417
And we should not condemn ourselves.

243
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,584
After all we are human beings, we are not God.

244
00:19:56,918 --> 00:20:00,918
And if we have done any mistakes

245
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:07,167
the Divine Love has power to dissolve everything.

246
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:12,375
So please be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

247
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,709
Not to feel guilty is very important.

248
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,584
And it's a fashion also these days

249
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:22,722
just to feel guilty for nothing at all.

250
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:28,709
After all, if you have done something really serious

251
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,959
we would be in jail, we would not have been here.

252
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,667
So please do not judge yourself.

253
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:40,417
Please do not judge yourself

254
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:44,417
and have that respect for yourself.

255
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,209
Another request is that

256
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,918
as we have to forget the past,

257
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:01,876
we have to forgive everyone.

258
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,626
That's something difficult I think.

259
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:08,292
In the west I found, wherever I had programs,

260
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:14,667
every time I had to attend to them to see that they forgive.

261
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:20,083
But logically, what do we do?

262
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:24,667
Wether we forgive or we don't forgive,

263
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:28,209
we really don't do anything, do we?

264
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:32,959
So why to

265
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:37,834
go on pondering about something which bothers you?

266
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:43,083
If you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

267
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:48,542
So please try to forgive every one.

268
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,751
Just forgive, just a lip-service call it.

269
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,834
Just say, I forgive everyone.

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,501
In your heart you have to say it.

271
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,626
Please forgive.

272
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,375
And don't remember whom you have to forgive.

273
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:10,751
Just take out that from your mind completely.

274
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:20,042
Let no such memory which makes you unhappy be there lingering.

275
00:22:20,959 --> 00:22:22,417
All right.

276
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,292
These are the only two things we have to do

277
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:30,959
as far as your own attitude is concerned.

278
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,375
Now we have to know that it is all build in within us,

279
00:22:35,584 --> 00:22:39,751
it's all your own and it will work out on its own.

280
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,083
So

281
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:50,042
we don't have to put in much effort, only thing,

282
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:55,334
I would like to tell you how we can raise our own Kundalini

283
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:59,292
and how

284
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,792
we have to release our own centres,

285
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:06,709
which is a very simple method, even a child can do it.

286
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,417
So first of all we have to put the left hand towards Me like this,

287
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:19,834
because left hand is symbolically suggesting that

288
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,375
we desire to have our Self-realization.

289
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:27,167
So just put your left hand towards Me - all of you please do it.

290
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:30,626
Just put your left hand towards Me.

291
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:34,626
And put both the feet on the ground separately

292
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,459
because these are two powers, left and right power,

293
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,709
which I will tell you tomorrow exactly what it is.

294
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,626
Now, put your left hand just like this.

295
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:51,626
And the right hand represents the action.

296
00:23:52,042 --> 00:23:55,918
So with the right hand we have to

297
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,209
touch our different centres,

298
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:06,125
just to release any blockade if there is.

299
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:15,125
First thing will be to put your right hand on your heart.

300
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,626
This I am showing you just now

301
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:24,501
and then we'll have to close our eyes and do the same thing.

302
00:24:24,918 --> 00:24:29,292
So first is to put your hand on your heart.

303
00:24:33,459 --> 00:24:37,000
This is the centre where resides the Spirit.

304
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,042
The Spirit - Atma.

305
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:46,834
Now you have to put down your right hand

306
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,334
in the upper portion of your stomach

307
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:55,918
on the left hand side. We are working on the left hand side.

308
00:24:57,417 --> 00:25:02,083
So put it on the left hand side,

309
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,709
your right hand.

310
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:09,918
This is the centre of your mastery,

311
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:16,876
mastery which is created by many prophets,

312
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,375
by which you master the art of divine love,

313
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:28,834
by which you become your own master.

314
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,250
Then you have to take this hand

315
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:38,876
in the lower part of the abdomen on the left hand side.

316
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:43,709
And here

317
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:48,292
is the centre of pure knowledge,

318
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:54,083
pure knowledge that manifests

319
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:57,083
through your central nervous system.

320
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:02,083
It becomes your own knowledge

321
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:05,501
as you can feel cold, hot

322
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:10,000
you can feel the good and bad.

323
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,375
Then again you have to take back your hand

324
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:21,167
onto the upper portion of the abdomen,

325
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:26,292
and then again to your heart.

326
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:34,876
Then you have to take your right hand

327
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:39,334
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

328
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:43,083
and place it

329
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,375
as much as possible

330
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:47,918
towards the spinal cord.

331
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,250
And turn your head to your right.

332
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:57,834
This centre catches when we feel guilty.

333
00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:01,292
And which is a very dangerous thing

334
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:06,501
because by this centre blocked

335
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,417
we get horrible diseases like angina,

336
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:16,125
spondylitis and all kinds of negative thoughts come into our mind.

337
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:21,792
So please put your right hand on

338
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,125
the corner of your neck and your shoulder

339
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,459
and turn your head to your right.

340
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:29,751
Now

341
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,250
put your right hand on top of your forehead across

342
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:40,918
and bend your head and press it on both the sides.

343
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,751
This is the centre of forgiveness.

344
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:50,000
Now, take your right hand and put it back

345
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:52,584
on the backside of your head.

346
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:56,959
And put your head on it to rest,

347
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,292
take it upward.

348
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:08,250
This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness

349
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:11,959
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes.

350
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,834
Then you have to stretch your hand fully.

351
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,334
Now stretch your hand please.

352
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,918
The centre of your palm

353
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,918
you have to put it on top of

354
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,209
the soft bone which you had in your childhood,

355
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:32,042
called as the fontanel bone area.

356
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:34,042
Press it hard,

357
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,125
push back your fingers,

358
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:39,083
put down your head

359
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:44,667
and move your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly.

360
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,667
That's all.

361
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,792
Very slowly you have to move it.

362
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,542
Seven times.

363
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:07,000
That's all we have to do. Now please close your eyes.

364
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:13,626
You can take out your spectacles. Be comfortable and

365
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,042
don't open your eyes please 'till I tell you

366
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:22,292
because your attention has to be sucked in.

367
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,709
So please don't open your eyes.

368
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,834
There will be no problem,

369
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:29,417
there will be

370
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:36,918
no funny happening as some people fear,

371
00:29:37,334 --> 00:29:41,584
is absolutely the smooth moving of the Kundalini

372
00:29:41,918 --> 00:29:44,250
'till you will start feeling the cool breeze

373
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:47,334
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

374
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,417
And also you will start feeling

375
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:52,792
this all pervading power of cool breeze.

376
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,626
This is the beginning

377
00:29:56,167 --> 00:30:00,167
but later on we'll have to make this connection all right.

378
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:06,626
So please put your left hand towards Me

379
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:09,125
and close your eyes

380
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:13,751
and put the right hand on your heart.

381
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,250
Here

382
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,542
you have to say within your heart,

383
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:29,626
or you have to ask Me a very fundamental question,

384
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:37,459
you may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you.

385
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,501
Please ask the question three times,

386
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:48,209
Mother, am I the Spirit?

387
00:30:48,751 --> 00:30:52,501
Please ask this question three times.

388
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:13,626
Now if you are the Spirit,

389
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,959
also you are your master, you are your guide.

390
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:25,459
So please take down your hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen

391
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,792
and press it hard.

392
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:37,626
Here again ask Me a question three times,

393
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:47,417
Mother, am I my own master?

394
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:54,459
Ask this question three times.

395
00:32:08,334 --> 00:32:12,751
Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,

396
00:32:15,209 --> 00:32:17,626
on the left hand side.

397
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:25,083
Here is the centre of pure knowledge.

398
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:29,709
But I cannot force on you.

399
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:32,918
I respect your freedom.

400
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:37,626
In your freedom and glory you have to ask for it.

401
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,709
So please say,

402
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,667
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

403
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:48,375
I want pure knowledge.

404
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,417
You have to ask for it.

405
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,751
Say it six times

406
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,751
because this centre has got six petals.

407
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:08,209
Now, when you say that,

408
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:11,542
your Kundalini starts moving upwards

409
00:33:11,918 --> 00:33:19,751
and so we have to now open the higher centres.

410
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:26,959
So raise your hand, right hand,

411
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:33,209
and put it in the upper part of the abdomen and press it hard.

412
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:42,167
Now here

413
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:46,751
we have to help to open this centre.

414
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,501
So with full confidence you say ten times,

415
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:56,792
with full confidence you have to say ten times,

416
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:02,000
Mother, I am my own master. Please say it.

417
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:08,125
Mother, I am my own master.

418
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:29,292
Now raise your hand

419
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,709
on your heart

420
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:46,167
which is the most important

421
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:51,042
centre because the Spirit resides in it.

422
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:56,167
You are not this body,

423
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:59,459
you are not this mind,

424
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,542
you are not this intellect,

425
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:09,501
you are not the conditioning,

426
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,501
you are not your ego,

427
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:16,626
but you are pure Spirit.

428
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,501
So here you ask,

429
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:30,167
twelve times you have to say it here,

430
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:38,042
with full confidence twelve times,

431
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:42,250
The greatest truth about yourself,

432
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:47,876
Mother, I am the Spirit.

433
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:53,626
Mother, I am the Spirit.

434
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:21,918
We have to know that the Divine is the ocean

435
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:28,584
of love and compassion.

436
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,375
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

437
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,167
But above all

438
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:40,667
it is the ocean of forgiveness.

439
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,375
So we cannot commit any mistakes

440
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:49,834
which cannot be dissolved by this great ocean of forgiveness.

441
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:57,250
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your

442
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:03,459
shoulder and your neck and press it hard.

443
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,792
Turn your head to the right.

444
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:17,709
Here with full confidence please say sixteen times, sixteen times,

445
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,375
Mother, I am not guilty.

446
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,918
Please have confidence in yourself

447
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,501
and say it, Mother I'm not guilty.

448
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:31,531
All these ideas that you are a sinner, you are this,

449
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,918
please forget it! That's all nonsense!

450
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,834
You are a human being

451
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,918
and you have to become a Self-realized personality.

452
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,709
That's what it is.

453
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:50,459
So please say sixteen times, Mother, I' not guilty at all.

454
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,417
As I have told you that

455
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,834
whether we forgive or don't forgive,

456
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,667
we do not do anything. It's just a myth.

457
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,625
So we should forgive

458
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:24,626
because if we don't forgive we play into wrong hands

459
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,292
because of this myth.

460
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:28,542
We think that we have not forgiven,

461
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:31,792
how can we forgive, it is rather difficult.

462
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:34,584
But there is nothing difficult about it.

463
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:42,292
Now please raise your right hand

464
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:46,709
onto your forehead across,

465
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:49,626
place it across and bend it down

466
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:53,042
and press it on both the sides.

467
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,542
Here is the centre where you have to forgive.

468
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,667
So please from your heart,

469
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:03,167
please from your heart forgive everyone.

470
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:07,626
Please from your heart, otherwise it doesn't work out,

471
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:10,959
Realization doesn't work out,

472
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:15,959
the Kundalini stops at this centre which is very important.

473
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,542
Please, please forgive!

474
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:22,751
Forgive everyone, I request you again and again,

475
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,792
please forgive everyone, very important!

476
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,876
That's the biggest blockade I think, I faced.

477
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:45,792
Now, take back your hand and put it on the backside of your head

478
00:39:46,375 --> 00:39:51,292
and push your head on it.

479
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,501
Here now you have to say,

480
00:39:55,709 --> 00:40:01,375
O Divine if I have done any mistakes, please forgive!

481
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:06,334
But you are not to feel guilty,

482
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:10,584
you are not to count your mistakes. It's for your satisfaction.

483
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:15,459
Just say, If I have done any mistakes, please forgive!

484
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:20,584
From your heart, how many times is not the point.

485
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,167
Now stretch your hand please,

486
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,334
put left hand towards Me.

487
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:39,334
Stretch your hand and the centre of your palm

488
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:45,876
please carefully put it on the fontanel bone area

489
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:50,375
or the soft bone which you had in your childhood.

490
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,459
The centre of your palm.

491
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,918
Push back your fingers as much as you can.

492
00:40:56,375 --> 00:41:00,792
And now you have to move your scalp very slowly,

493
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:04,125
very slowly clockwise,

494
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:07,834
very slowly clockwise seven times.

495
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:13,876
Here again I cannot force Self-realization.

496
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,501
I cannot force that on you.

497
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,209
So you have to say,

498
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:22,792
Mother please give me my Self-realization.

499
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:27,501
I cannot disrespect your freedom.

500
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:33,542
So please say it seven times, moving your hand very slowly,

501
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,834
pressing your scalp, moving your scalp,

502
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:42,542
pressing back your fingers. Please do it carefully!

503
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:49,876
(Shri Mataji blows into the micro).

504
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:22,626
Now please take down your hands

505
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:30,125
and open your eyes.

506
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:34,667
Just watch Me without thinking - you can do it!

507
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:37,584
Just watch Me without thinking.

508
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:48,584
Now put the right hand like this and bend your head

509
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,459
and see for yourself

510
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:53,918
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

511
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:03,918
Some people might feel a little heat coming out,

512
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:07,667
it's all right because heat has to come out first.

513
00:43:10,584 --> 00:43:16,000
Now put your left hand towards Me, bend your head

514
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:19,918
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out.

515
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:23,959
It's already very much cooled down, but don't doubt it, just feel.

516
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:27,209
Sometimes it comes quite ahead

517
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:31,626
but try to put it next to your head

518
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:36,250
but not on top,  above it

519
00:43:36,459 --> 00:43:41,417
and then move further to see if there is a cool breeze coming out.

520
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:52,667
Now put back your right hand please.

521
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:58,918
And see for yourself again if there is a cool breeze coming out of.

522
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:08,292
Don't get upset if it is not there, it will work out.

523
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:11,000
Don't get upset, just watch!

524
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:22,542
Now push back, push back your hands like this towards the sky,

525
00:44:22,751 --> 00:44:24,250
push back your head.

526
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:30,584
And here you ask a question three times,

527
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,834
anyone of these questions:

528
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:38,501
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

529
00:44:40,209 --> 00:44:46,501
Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love?

530
00:44:46,792 --> 00:44:49,626
Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?

531
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:52,584
Ask this question three times.

532
00:44:52,876 --> 00:44:56,792
Anyone of them, just ask it three times.

533
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:05,584
Now take down your hands please.

534
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:14,375
Now see, there is no breeze around.

535
00:45:14,542 --> 00:45:18,792
The trees are silent, they are just watching us.

536
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,501
But you'll feel the breeze in your hand

537
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,459
and you must have felt the breeze out of your head also.

538
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:34,792
Those who have felt cool breeze coming out of their head,

539
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,751
the fontanel bone area or from your fingertips,

540
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:43,834
will you please raise your both the hands?

541
00:45:44,792 --> 00:45:47,250
Please raise higher!

542
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:50,459
O my God!

543
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:54,584
Practically the whole of San Diego has felt it!

544
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:59,501
Tremendous place! Thank you, thank you!

545
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,417
May God bless you!

546
00:46:06,584 --> 00:46:10,626
Now don't discuss about it because it is beyond thought.

547
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:13,584
You are in thoughtless awareness.

548
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:18,959
But tomorrow when you will come then we'll again see about it,

549
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:25,751
as I would say, the connection has to be properly fixed.

550
00:46:26,626 --> 00:46:29,626
For that tomorrow you'll be here

551
00:46:29,792 --> 00:46:32,792
and I hope there will be a follow on program.

552
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:35,876
One must know that you cannot pay for it.

553
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,417
One must know that you cannot think about it.

554
00:46:39,626 --> 00:46:42,751
It just happens and is there.

555
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:50,626
So enjoy this night and every night

556
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,751
and every moment of your life!

557
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,209
May God bless you! May God bless you all!

558
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:12,918
What does he say?

559
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:25,918
They should write it down, questions later, tomorrow morning,

560
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:27,501
tomorrow when we come

561
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:30,042
because today what I am saying that let them go home,

562
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,792
tomorrow let them come and  then we'll see about it.

563
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:34,167
Today let them go.

564
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:38,292
So I would say tonight you can go home, just stressed.

565
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:41,584
Don't talk about it, just be in silence.

566
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:46,292
This is the thing you have been seeking, which has happened,

567
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:49,292
it has worked out but

568
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:53,125
we have to understand each and every thing about it,

569
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,083
the whole knowledge will be given to you.

570
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,209
Absolutely you will know the whole thing.

571
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:02,292
And tomorrow I'll be meeting you, people,

572
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:04,876
I will give much more time,

573
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,042
I will start much more earlier in a proper way.

574
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:15,667
I hope you enjoy this new life

575
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,375
which is starting now

576
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,250
and the transformation that will take place,

577
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:25,042
you'll be amazed at yourself! Complete transformation!

578
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,459
Tomorrow we'll talk about it more.

579
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:29,876
May God bless you all!

580
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:34,167
Now inform your friends and call them here

581
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:37,792
and let them also receive this Self-realization.

582
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:41,918
It is your own and you all should have it.

583
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,375
You have a right to have it.

584
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:47,167
So may God bless you all!
