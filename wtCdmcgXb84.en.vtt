00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.327
In the Kundalini awakening itself
there are inherent defects.

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:15.181
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:19.268
because of your previous karmas.

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:23.838
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.160
Because, the things that you have accepted as

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.349
reality, which is just a concept.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.972
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:39.675
whatever you will be doing,

00:00:39.756 --> 00:00:43.756
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.893
Whatever you have done in darkness

00:00:45.974 --> 00:00:49.870
will have a particle of darkness in it.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.502
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

00:00:55.828 --> 00:01:00.786
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:09.262
They are looking towards good but have
 something hanging on to them,

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:11.595
which is not so good.

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:15.866
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

00:01:15.947 --> 00:01:19.280
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:25.361
The first of them is bad health,

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:30.302
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:34.139
in the same way according to the countries,

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.572
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:40.132
Like in our country we have some problems;

00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:42.402
like in your country you have certain problems.

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:46.622
So, the physical problems are according to the country

00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:48.537
where you have taken your birth.

00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:53.413
Every country has a variety by which you suffer

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.681
a certain amount of setback in your health.

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:00.533
So for a Sahaj Yogi

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.470
one should know that health is a very important thing.

00:02:04.797 --> 00:02:07.547
Because this body is the temple of God,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.252
and one has to look after your health.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.433
And you know also when the Kundalini rises
the first thing that

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.933
happens that your health improves.

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:18.847
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

00:02:18.928 --> 00:02:25.104
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:29.589
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.275
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:38.402
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

00:02:41.246 --> 00:02:47.079
And the bodily element also
should not take you down too much.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.995
If we have some problem, forget it.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.453
Gradually it will improve, with some people
it takes time to get all right.

00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:59.203
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:04.637
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.975
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:11.517
and you will be cured automatically.

00:03:11.647 --> 00:03:15.647
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:18.353
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:20.554
Little more time.

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.718
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:29.386
But attention should be on your spirit.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:34.450
Attention should be on your spirit,
because it is the attention,

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:38.547
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:42.206
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

00:03:42.287 --> 00:03:51.633
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

00:03:51.891 --> 00:03:59.933
Osnath, they call it. Means a person…
does not want to work it out.

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:01.975
Of course those people who are useless,

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:05.098
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.096
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:14.428
with people that they do not want to work it out.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:19.923
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.962
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga
when people come here:

00:04:25.043 --> 00:04:29.531
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,
and is lost again.

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:32.749
The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.033
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.233
Then, when it is lost, after one year
they’ll come back “Mother?

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:43.939
We don’t believe in it, but I have got
some pain in the stomach,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.294
will You cure me?”

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.715
These powers are all within you.

00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:52.974
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:57.890
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.907
because of certain hurdles that you accept,
that it does not.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.721
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:12.214
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:15.087
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

00:05:15.168 --> 00:05:18.335
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:25.247
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:28.538
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:30.995
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:34.701
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

00:05:34.782 --> 00:05:38.143
you see suddenly the light comes in,
you don’t want to open your eyes.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.030
Because too much we have been sleeping.

00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.650
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

00:05:43.731 --> 00:05:45.565
You don’t want to face the light.

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:48.480
Because you are identified with that state,

00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:52.561
you do not want to open your eyes.

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:57.708
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt,
but again you close it down.

00:05:57.873 --> 00:06:03.620
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:09.065
Now this is also, can be very collective,
I can tell you this much.

00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:12.673
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:15.587
Even if you are in the moon,

00:06:15.668 --> 00:06:19.126
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:25.623
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:31.791
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

00:06:31.872 --> 00:06:36.110
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

00:06:36.203 --> 00:06:41.650
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:43.691
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

00:06:44.554 --> 00:06:46.593
…have come out with the second day

00:06:46.593 --> 00:06:51.885
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:58.068
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:03.425
What have you found out so far?

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:07.000
From where does this come?

00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:12.621
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given
lectures after lectures.

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:16.274
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

00:07:16.447 --> 00:07:18.781
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

00:07:18.862 --> 00:07:22.278
You are identified with your Ego,

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.942
and you do not want to find it because,

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:28.357
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:32.438
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:39.517
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

00:07:39.677 --> 00:07:41.458
Sit down then.

00:07:41.518 --> 00:07:44.630
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.464
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:49.921
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:54.335
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

00:07:54.416 --> 00:07:58.416
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:01.441
What have you known so far about yourself?

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:04.919
Now, humble down yourself at this point.

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:06.827
Humble down in your heart.

00:08:06.908 --> 00:08:13.390
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:17.302
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:19.299
With what instruments I am doubting?”

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.964
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:27.796
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

00:08:27.877 --> 00:08:31.752
The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:38.375
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:42.412
Foolish questions.

00:08:42.492 --> 00:08:44.905
I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:47.092
if you are going on the road you see,

00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:50.377
you are used to say continental driving,

00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:54.502
so always you turn on the wrong side,

00:08:54.583 --> 00:08:58.125
but in London you will be arrested.

00:08:58.206 --> 00:09:02.206
In the same way so far
you have been doing continental driving.

00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:09.474
Now you are in London, so you better
take to the ways of Londoners

00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:15.470
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:20.451
that are needed, and try to follow them.
But you are doubting it.

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:25.587
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:27.851
These two things go hand in hand –

00:09:27.932 --> 00:09:31.840
doubting and pramad is the mistakes
that we commit throughout.

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.112
Because we are doubting, that’s why
we do not take it up seriously,

00:09:35.193 --> 00:09:41.097
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –
and we just start driving.

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:45.206
And then we have accidents.

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:50.402
And then when we have accidents
we blame Mataji for that.

00:09:52.755 --> 00:09:58.692
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

00:09:58.773 --> 00:10:02.191
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

00:10:02.272 --> 00:10:04.939
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.964
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

00:10:07.045 --> 00:10:10.226
that “No, I must have done this mistake.
” All right, doesn’t matter,

00:10:10.307 --> 00:10:14.307
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:19.718
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:22.166
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:24.958
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:28.037
you should go this way instead of
that you have gone that way,

00:10:28.118 --> 00:10:31.885
so rule of the road is to be understood.

00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:36.877
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

00:10:36.877 --> 00:10:41.928
After that, we have another inherent problem

00:10:42.015 --> 00:10:47.716
is called as Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

00:10:47.716 --> 00:10:50.757
We start seeing hallucinations,
specially with people who take

00:10:50.757 --> 00:10:52.841
LSD and all such things.

00:10:52.974 --> 00:10:56.974
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:02.682
Or any such hallucinations you see
of the future or of the past.

00:11:02.682 --> 00:11:04.432
They may see Me as something else

00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:06.275
and they may see Me as something else.

00:11:06.437 --> 00:11:08.603
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

00:11:08.684 --> 00:11:10.851
or see something in dreams is all right.

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:17.167
But you start seeing some things,
that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:22.544
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

00:11:22.691 --> 00:11:27.817
But the worst part of it is that people
start telling lies about it.

00:11:27.898 --> 00:11:34.607
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

00:11:34.688 --> 00:11:39.245
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

00:11:39.245 --> 00:11:46.445
Then the another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

00:11:46.612 --> 00:11:50.238
In which the attention is attracted by objects

00:11:50.319 --> 00:11:54.038
of your previous identification.

00:11:54.085 --> 00:11:57.566
Like your attention has been,
“You see I’m very found of cricket,”

00:11:57.566 --> 00:12:03.112
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:06.930
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.713
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:13.585
for all practical purposes you are dead.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:19.976
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:23.518
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

00:12:23.599 --> 00:12:26.391
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:29.305
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:34.975
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

00:12:34.975 --> 00:12:37.897
sustaining our realization.

00:12:37.977 --> 00:12:42.225
Which is very important to understand.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.438
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:51.134
apart from that the people get possessed

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:53.688
and get ideas into their heads,

00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:56.445
they start singing songs, this that.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:59.683
Sometimes I am so embarrassed, I don’t know what to say,

00:12:59.763 --> 00:13:02.034
I can see a devil speaking through them,

00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:05.031
but I just don’t know how to tell them that
“Oh please stop.”

00:13:07.144 --> 00:13:10.686
Then there are two more stages in which,

00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:15.124
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:19.632
This is an inherent danger in a person.
Many people have asked Me

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.278
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:26.454
It does stay, part of it.

00:13:26.534 --> 00:13:28.698
Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:34.227
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

00:13:34.227 --> 00:13:37.279
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.639
It comes through many problems

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:45.193
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

00:13:45.193 --> 00:13:52.648
and doing all black magic and, also bowing
before people who are not

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:58.773
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities
and also doing

00:13:58.854 --> 00:14:01.454
mad rituals.

00:14:02.814 --> 00:14:09.109
Last danger that we have which
one should know that you start feeling

00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:13.942
that you have become God
or some like an incarnation or something.

00:14:13.942 --> 00:14:16.150
This is the biggest danger.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:22.712
And then you start taking law into your
own hands and start rebuking others or…

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:27.878
doing all kind of highhanded
business.

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:33.016
Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

00:14:33.016 --> 00:14:35.562
This is a very big danger.

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:42.864
Humility is the only way, to know
that there’s an ocean before you.

00:14:42.864 --> 00:14:48.194
You have got into the boat all right,
 but you have to know a lot,

00:14:48.194 --> 00:14:51.130
you have to understand a lot,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:54.405
and you have to still attend to your attention,

00:14:54.485 --> 00:14:58.173
to your chitta, to your awareness.

00:14:58.173 --> 00:15:02.572
And you have to still work it out in such a way

00:15:02.572 --> 00:15:09.550
that you really establish your self,
as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:13.613
by which collectivity becomes
a part and parcel of your being.

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:17.207
By which you have no doubts left.

00:15:17.207 --> 00:15:21.498
From thoughtless awareness
you jump into doubtless awareness.

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:25.496
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:28.577
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

00:15:28.658 --> 00:15:31.299
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:35.977
And that’s why it is important that
don’t get bloated with the idea

00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:39.534
that you have all the powers of the world,
already manifesting.

00:15:39.534 --> 00:15:40.783
Never.

00:15:40.864 --> 00:15:45.695
When these powers really manifest,
you are really not aware of them.

00:15:45.695 --> 00:15:47.542
Absolutely.

00:15:48.943 --> 00:15:55.485
May God bless you, all.
