00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:24.519
Today, I'm going to speak in general
about Sahaja Yog and Kundalini
awakening.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:34.112
Sahaja, as you know, means, 'Saha'
means with and 'ja' born with you

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.966
but perhaps people do not realize
what Sahaja actually means.

00:00:42.664 --> 00:00:52.494
It is spontaneous but what is
spontaneous? Spontaneous is not that

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:58.192
supposing I'm going in the car and
suddenly I meet somebody I say,
'I spontaneously I met the person.'

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:09.182
Spontaneous means, that happening
is a living happening.

00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:16.527
It has to be a living thing which is
spontaneous; It's a very mysterious
word

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:26.606
that cannot be explained and that
happens without any understanding
about it,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.590
which is not possible for a human
being to understand, that is Sahaja.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:38.732
Sahaja may mean, it's very simple,
very easy - it is, it has to be.

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:46.174
For example, God has given us these
eyes. These wonderful eyes that
human beings have got,

00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:51.631
that not that they can see the color
but can also appreciate it.

00:01:53.187 --> 00:02:02.257
God has given them a nose, which is so
well developed that it can feel the filth -

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:11.251
animals cannot feel it. You have become
a human-being, I have become a
human-being,

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:22.611
and everybody has become a human
being - become - from a amoeba stage
spontaneously.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.310
Can you explain that how it has
happened? Further we can see,

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.028
everyday we see so many spontaneous
things happening.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:42.410
Today you go in the forest you'll see
lots of flowers there in the forest,
in the wilderness

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:50.734
and tomorrow you'll find lots of fruits
produced by these flowers.

00:02:50.734 --> 00:03:03.076
Who has done it? Effortlessly the Nature
has done it. It's a living happening -
it won't happen in a dead thing.

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:10.886
For example, this hall I've been visiting
now every year, is just the same.

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:18.019
The size is just the same, except that
some people have put some other color
or put some appendages - that's all.

00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:28.391
Dead cannot grow by itself. There's no
growth. It is not a spontaneous growth -

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:37.309
it is a growth of effort - that you have
to put in things on top of all dead
things to make it look bigger.

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:50.316
In all the living things, whatever has
been the living work by the living God,

00:03:52.818 --> 00:04:00.048
has been miraculous, you cannot explain
but we have taken everything for
granted.

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:05.365
For us it doesn't surprise us, that today
we see a flower, tomorrow a fruit.

00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:15.941
We see a little seed growing into a huge
big tree and we are not surprised at it
- not at all - is being taken for granted.

00:04:20.103 --> 00:04:25.603
This is the living work . See the system,
the whole system of nature -

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:36.600
is in such a balance, such a balance is
maintained. It creates different types
of seasons, one after the another.

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:44.962
The Sun moves from one tropic to
the another - it creates seasons.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:52.824
The trees are laden with leaves and
suddenly the trees are left without
them.

00:04:56.452 --> 00:05:01.962
All the leaves fall off automatically
because the Sun is going on the
other tropic

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:05.285
but the leaves have to fall down
on the ground - why?

00:05:05.344 --> 00:05:11.664
Because the nutrition of nitrogen has
to go to the Mother earth to be
resucked by the tree.

00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:17.601
All this circle has been built up -
you see in the Universe.

00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:23.682
How things are happening, we never
even bother to see.

00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:28.401
We have been taking full advantage
of God's love for us.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.040
Out of His spontaneity He has created
us and also He has created us in such
a way,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.765
that we can enjoy His spontaneous
love all around us.

00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:45.984
But we try to seek God, we try to
seek God in dead things.

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:52.506
If somebody has a big house, people
think, God has blessed him.

00:05:55.216 --> 00:06:00.696
If somebody gets a big position,
they think, God has blessed him.

00:06:02.308 --> 00:06:08.608
But we never realize that these things
which are not spontaneous, which
are through effort,

00:06:08.696 --> 00:06:18.496
have been achieved, are of no
consequence, as far as the
joy is concerned.

00:06:20.643 --> 00:06:28.393
You give some money to a person who
is not used to money, immediately
you'll find,

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:33.398
he will go to the racecourse or he will
start drinking - he can't bear it.

00:06:34.863 --> 00:06:39.043
When the riches grow too much,
you see what happens.

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:46.019
Affluence creates such a problem, you
have known that now, you are very
aware of it,

00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:53.731
how affluence has ruined the
spontaneity of Western people,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:03.640
how their society has become
malignant now, how they are unhappy
- there is no love.

00:07:07.766 --> 00:07:14.566
This spontaneity within us, is worked
out through the living force that is
within us and not through the dead.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:29.755
Whatever dies within us, is pushed
aside. Sahaja yoga is the culmination
of that living work

00:07:31.073 --> 00:07:37.343
by which you have become a human
being and now the time has come

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.765
for you to become a Self-realized
personality - the time has come.

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:51.460
Many people asked Me today in the
press conference, "What is Your
purpose, what is Your mission?"

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.320
It's most surprising. As they ask all the
political leaders, they were asking Me.

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:05.629
The time has come. The time has come
for you to get your Self-realization.

00:08:06.177 --> 00:08:13.817
You are ready for it now. This is the time,
when the chaos is at it's maximum level,

00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:28.958
where people understand that these
pursuits of wealth, of power,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:35.650
and other emotional possessions,
are of no value.

00:08:36.477 --> 00:08:43.797
Where the pressures and the tensions
are so great that man is seeking.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:50.912
In every country I find thousands and,
thousands and thousands of people
seeking.

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:59.521
Even in our country there are people
who are seekers; That's a category now
developing - it's a category.

00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:08.923
Like a flower is a category on the
trees, different from other parts
of the tree,

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:15.716
in the same way, a seeker is a category,
which is different from the other parts
of the world.

00:09:15.716 --> 00:09:23.450
He is not satisfied with what he has and
he has started seeing through that there
must be something beyond -

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:29.402
this is not the end of it. Only such
people are welcome in Sahaja yog.

00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:33.659
Those who are not seekers cannot
be forced into it.

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:36.103
It's a spontaneous thing

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:49.050
Now, this has been promised in various
scriptures that this has to happen.

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:55.669
As old as Nal Purana - I don't know
if you have read it or not,

00:09:55.669 --> 00:10:01.830
because we, modern people, don't
read all these Puranas, you see - we
think, it's all too ancient for us to read.

00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:13.365
It was said that, 'When Kalyuga will at it's
worst harass the human beings, at
that time, those people

00:10:13.365 --> 00:10:25.281
who are seeking God today in the hills
and dales, will be born again and they
will get their Self-realization.'

00:10:26.464 --> 00:10:31.364
You'll be amazed, that in England, which
we don't think in any way spiritually
rich country -

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:38.545
Indians at least don't think so. At least,
they feel that they are very spiritually
rich - I wonder if they are really!

00:10:38.572 --> 00:10:44.352
But if they are, I'm not surprized at it
because you have such a great heritage.

00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:48.351
If you have not forgotten it, you are the
best to get your realization.

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:52.543
You are the best suited for that, you
have that sukrut behind you,

00:10:52.582 --> 00:11:01.432
you have that big right to get it - how far
Indians are seekers, that's what
one has to see.

00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:05.293
[ASIDE -MARATHI]

00:11:06.563 --> 00:11:12.893
Now, the problem is

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:30.586
[ASIDE - Let it be]
when you are a seeker, when you
are seeking God,

00:11:32.502 --> 00:11:35.612
which is the way to do it, how to do it?

00:11:36.513 --> 00:11:42.213
Because your parents told you that you
are a Muslim or a Christian or a Parsi
or a Sikh or something,

00:11:42.591 --> 00:11:51.631
you just become that. But by doing any
of the rituals or any of the things that
your parents have told,

00:11:54.673 --> 00:12:03.853
you still feel that there's something
more that has to happen. And

00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:12.778
what is that which is the missing point
that we have to know within ourselves.

00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:19.679
Today, I'm happy, we heard such a great
song by such a great poet Kabira,

00:12:22.229 --> 00:12:28.929
and that, as he has said it and as
everybody has said it, Christ has said it,
Mohammad Sahab has said it,

00:12:28.929 --> 00:12:40.083
all of them have said it, that it is inside
you, is the Lord, is the Rama, is the Shiva,

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:52.774
is the Paigambara or is the, what they
call, the Allah - then seek Him.

00:12:56.113 --> 00:13:03.063
Now we start singing the song. We
better seek and you better seek
and we must seek.

00:13:03.712 --> 00:13:14.492
By singing the song, are you going to
seek Him? "Now how you seek then,
Mother?" they ask Me.

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:19.194
"How are we to seek God, is there
a way and method?"

00:13:20.287 --> 00:13:27.577
How did you become human beings?
- effortlessly, without any effort.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:34.229
Only thing was that you exposed
yourself to Nature and Nature created it.

00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:43.514
You call it Nature or God - it's just the
same. In the same way, it is the job of
God Almighty, who has created you,

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:55.829
to give you your meaning. If I make an
instrument like this, it is My job to tell
the person what to do with it,

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:58.716
how to put it to the mains
and how it is to be used.

00:14:01.036 --> 00:14:06.916
In the same way, it is the job of God
Almighty to do it and He knows
how to do it.

00:14:10.592 --> 00:14:17.072
So, one may say, "What should we do
about it? What is the way to
achieve that?"

00:14:18.897 --> 00:14:28.617
Again we are on the effort. Actually what
we have to do, is to be in the centre.

00:14:31.591 --> 00:14:36.481
You must lead a moderate life.
You should not go to extremes.

00:14:37.279 --> 00:14:47.669
If you go to extremes too much, then
you are taking your attention
away from the Spirit.

00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:54.661
You have to keep in the centre, you
have to lead a very normal life

00:14:54.661 --> 00:15:04.699
as Kabira has very clearly said that, 'I do
not go anywhere.' He was a married
man, he keeps in the centre.

00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:14.045
Don't have to use any extreme or
exterior things to express your
spirituality.

00:15:14.275 --> 00:15:20.155
It is within yourself that you will
find it, keep to the centre.

00:15:21.726 --> 00:15:32.856
It is absolutely practical, it's common
sense. Think of a car which is not

00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:37.119
having it's center of gravity at it's
center but is moving at a tilt.

00:15:37.315 --> 00:15:44.725
Think of a boat which is tilted. Anything
that is tilted too much, gives
an imbalance.

00:15:46.755 --> 00:15:54.855
So, to keep a balanced life, to keep a
moderate life, in the center, be very,
very normal

00:15:54.888 --> 00:16:04.728
- that's what everyone has said
because that's what it is.

00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:09.767
By keeping in the center only, we
have achieved our evolution.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.530
Always, if you see a tree, you will find
the sap of the tree rises in the center.

00:16:18.673 --> 00:16:29.823
All living work takes place in the center.
Even your social and economic
activities take place in the center.

00:16:31.253 --> 00:16:35.893
Even as we call it, Delhi, as the
Central Government.

00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:49.191
So you have to keep to the center of
your behaviour, of your living, of your
styles, of your thinking.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.330
Do not go to extremes - this is first
thing they have told us.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:03.949
Today they asked Me a question that,
"Mother, you have cured so many cancer
patients," - I have, no doubt

00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:08.758
and cancer can be easily cured, so
many diseases can be cured by
Kundalini awakening.

00:17:08.782 --> 00:17:13.632
"But how do you get cancer?" -
is the question they asked Me. I said,
"By going to extremes."

00:17:16.185 --> 00:17:20.535
By going to extremes only, you
develop all the problem.

00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:26.898
Even in your religious duties,
you go to extremes.

00:17:30.238 --> 00:17:40.288
When you go to extremes, you go away
from the center path. That's how

00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:44.705
you get caught up on the left or the
right hand side, which is shown here

00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:49.514
- I don't know if you all can see it,
which is very important to see.

00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:54.001
Sahaja yoga has been described
by all the saints,

00:17:54.035 --> 00:17:58.935
especially after Adi Shankaracharya
has very clearly talked about it.

00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:03.771
Before that it was kept as a very
sacred and a secret science

00:18:03.771 --> 00:18:07.081
because there were very few people
who could be given realization

00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:15.252
but today, it is not that I'm talking to
only Arjuna or to few people here and
there, to selected

00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:23.142
but it's an open invitation to all the
people, to open their eyes to this
subtler knowledge,

00:18:23.142 --> 00:18:27.957
to this, the real power of your Self,
that is within you.

00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:37.137
Now, when we have become human
beings, we have gone through
various stages.

00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:50.721
All these stages are built within us, as
centers. These various centers lie
within us, some, in our spinal cord,

00:18:51.241 --> 00:19:00.551
one, out of the spinal cord and
two of them in the brain.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:12.790
These centers are there, who are the
milestones of our evolution.

00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:19.641
When we were just a Carbon atom,
we were at the first center.

00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:27.159
Carbon. I wonder how many people, who
know Chemistry, know the beauty
of Carbon.

00:19:32.508 --> 00:19:42.508
Carbon is made by Mother Earth
and that is very important because
it has a balance.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:51.200
Carbon has 4 valencies, plus or minus
both - I know if you know Chemistry,
you will know about Carbon very well.

00:19:51.666 --> 00:19:58.536
So, it can give four or take four - It's
such a balanced thing - just in the
center of the periodic table, is Carbon.

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:05.879
Without the Carbon, life could not come
on this Earth, so Carbon was to be
created first

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:12.319
and when we were Carbon, we were
innocent, complete innocent people.

00:20:14.374 --> 00:20:22.074
Innocence is the first thing that was
created on this earth and this
innocence is represented within us,

00:20:22.212 --> 00:20:33.512
at a material level or at a matter level,
as Carbon, in the first center,

00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:40.761
about which I'll tell you tomorrow what
more things this center has and which
is a very important center.

00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:46.361
Luckily in our country, this center
is very, very strong.

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:56.978
Basically, we are innocent people - is a
fact. You might think that Mother is
trying to pamper our ego.

00:20:58.154 --> 00:21:04.944
We are innocent but we have taken to
ways of other people who came here

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:12.534
and we thought that material
development is the only way our
country can improve

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:23.310
and then we took to so many ways and
methods, by which our innocence is lost
or is at least at stake.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:32.889
This innocence is within us - that's
the beginning of our evolution.

00:21:34.629 --> 00:21:43.429
Now while evolving gradually, we have
got so many qualities within us,

00:21:43.715 --> 00:21:54.595
also we have something very special
compared to other animals and that
thing is the ego.

00:21:57.293 --> 00:22:04.713
First of all, if you see the left side,
from the right to the left side,

00:22:05.476 --> 00:22:15.486
is the power within us, which you can
call as the power of desire, by which
we desire - ichcha shakti.

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:27.504
You may desire anything - we desire so
many things but we have to put in
concrete action to achieve the results.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:36.040
So the other power we have on the left
hand side going to the right hand side,
is the power of action.

00:22:38.386 --> 00:22:45.166
The left hand side channel which
carries the power of desire, is called
as Ida Nadi

00:22:45.648 --> 00:22:49.358
and the right hand side one which you
see, which actually starts from the left

00:22:49.358 --> 00:22:53.304
goes to the right, is called as
the Pingala Nadi.

00:22:53.752 --> 00:22:59.662
The first one is called as the Chandra
Nadi, the second one as Surya Nadi.

00:23:01.036 --> 00:23:07.446
the first one creates your 'mana' -
Sanskrit is better to say, 'manas' -
you understand what mana is

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:15.698
and the second one creates ahankara.
So the second one which is the
ahankara,

00:23:15.698 --> 00:23:22.598
which has come to us through our
efforts, through our kriya, is like a
balloon on our heads

00:23:22.598 --> 00:23:28.988
and that is the problem of today the
human-beings have to face, of which
they are not aware.

00:23:31.112 --> 00:23:44.270
The first power of mana is very simple -
you desire something. You go on
desiring and pining for it

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:51.196
desiring and pining for it, thus you harm
yourself. You start harming yourself

00:23:51.196 --> 00:23:56.687
when you start desiring, when you start
using this power of desire.

00:23:57.901 --> 00:24:08.721
When you desire too much, you become
affected by it. When you get affected

00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:14.597
you get all kinds of problems like
depression and other mental problems,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:20.000
I mean, people can become mad and all
the psycological problems that are
developed,

00:24:20.007 --> 00:24:29.644
which is described by Freud, the great.
Now Freud being a scientist, I would say,

00:24:29.644 --> 00:24:36.492
a human being, he was a blind man. So
he found something, he said, "This is
the thing is the Truth,"

00:24:36.492 --> 00:24:44.246
that a person who suffered from any
mental trouble, is suffering because
of his conditioning - is a fact

00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:49.510
but he only dealt with mad people - he
never dealt with normal people.

00:24:50.326 --> 00:24:55.136
If you meet mad people, that doesn't
mean that all the rest of the world
is mad.

00:24:58.929 --> 00:25:04.179
The mad people are mad because of
too much of conditioning - is agreed

00:25:04.604 --> 00:25:08.784
but for that the another extreme
could be, that you should have

00:25:08.784 --> 00:25:14.590
no conditioning at all, you go ahead
with whatever you like. Thank God, in
India he never settled down.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.310
Many people tried to settle down here,
they did not. Somehow, this country

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.499
has a method by which it throws
away all non-sensical things.

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:27.916
So Freud was not so much accepted
except for some, so called pseudo-
intellectuals, who call themselves
Westernized.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:36.770
But, in the West, they are so naiive, they
accepted it, they accepted Freud
out and out.

00:25:36.903 --> 00:25:43.323
So the question is, 'What's wrong?'
Supposing, you do this, 'What's wrong?"

00:25:43.323 --> 00:25:47.983
This is the question they'll ask, 'What's
wrong in this, what's wrong in that?"

00:25:47.983 --> 00:25:52.732
In doing anything, 'What's wrong?'
They cannot even understand
what's wrong

00:25:52.732 --> 00:25:56.963
if there's a bad relationship between
brother and sister - can you imagine?

00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:05.976
Indian persons can understand it. When
you tell to an Indian man, he will just
laugh at this [UNCLEAR] stupidity.

00:26:06.294 --> 00:26:10.694
So what has happened when they said,
'What's wrong in it and what's wrong it,'

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:17.092
they started developing their right side,
their ego side. So, if you neglect
your conditioning

00:26:17.092 --> 00:26:24.658
or if you try that there should be no
conditioning at all, people can become
extremely ego-oriented

00:26:24.658 --> 00:26:31.898
and all the West is drawn into it. They
are so ego-oriented that you cannot
talk to them

00:26:31.898 --> 00:26:38.845
- they really bark, they do not talk.
Only when it is the matter of money,
they talk softly

00:26:38.845 --> 00:26:45.055
otherwise they just bark. They are so
ego-oriented you can't imagine!

00:26:45.092 --> 00:26:52.572
And you'll be amazed we think that
they're very united and they're - no,
they fight all the time.

00:26:53.093 --> 00:26:58.443
Husband will fight with the wife, wife will
fight with the children, children will
fight with the parents,

00:26:58.443 --> 00:27:04.678
parents will fight with the parents - it's
all going on. They're all the time fighting,
quarreling and arguing.

00:27:05.231 --> 00:27:10.691
You see any picture or drama that they
make these days - is only a quarrel
between husband and wife -

00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:19.989
you get fed-up. The whole system
works how to fight each other.

00:27:23.028 --> 00:27:31.308
No wonder they start wars also. So, this
ego-orientation has gone to another
extreme now.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.570
We had to develop our ego to a point
when it came up to this point,

00:27:36.612 --> 00:27:43.492
where the Kundalini can be easily
pierced through because first the
superego was too much,

00:27:43.492 --> 00:27:48.107
so the ego developed and they have to
meet in the centre like this.

00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:58.201
If you keep a moderate life, then you
develop your ego properly and a
superego - you are in the center.

00:27:59.835 --> 00:28:04.415
And traditionally, thank God, Indians are
better off - that's why I say they
are innocent

00:28:04.444 --> 00:28:09.444
but there are people in India, I have
seen, who are incharge of affairs,

00:28:09.444 --> 00:28:14.493
who are supposed to be very educated
and learned and professors and
this and that,

00:28:14.493 --> 00:28:23.957
they say the same thing, "What's
wrong?" Now in India, we know what
is su-sanskara is.

00:28:23.957 --> 00:28:29.968
Su-sanskar - there is a word like 'su',
which I don't know in English language
if it is but 'su' is good.

00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:35.628
We must have good sanskaras, we must
have discipline of our mind.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:41.260
The concept of Indian life is chitta
nirodh - you must control your
attention.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.809
Shouldn't allow your attention to pass
out, shouldn't allow your attention
to spill out.

00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:51.888
From childhood we ask our children,
"Where is your attention? Where is your
attention? Where are you lost?"

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:59.115
Then, Indian personality knows that your
attention is not to be frittered.

00:28:59.115 --> 00:29:08.528
For example, in India nobody would
boast of something wrong, as like a
theft. Will anybody boast of that?

00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:17.469
But I've seen with my own eyes, you
won't believe, that in Paris there
was a relay of a man,

00:29:17.616 --> 00:29:27.386
who did a burglary in a big bank, you
see, he burgled the whole bank
and this fellow was on the TV

00:29:27.386 --> 00:29:34.523
and he was trying to show off as if he is
a big hero. He's saying, "[UNCLEAR] Sir,
I did like this and I did like that,"

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:39.040
and he was explaining all this to the
magistrate and while talking to the
magistrate,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.925
you saw it happening also, with your
own eyes because the TV was on him.

00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:48.281
That he said, "How did you go to the
window?" He just went to the window
and jumped out and disappeared.

00:29:48.281 --> 00:29:54.441
Now I was surprised that he's made
a hero there. People wear,

00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:01.650
the children wear his photograph, as a
hero. Can you imagine, we wearing

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.618
somebody's thing as a hero, who is
a thug well known?

00:30:04.922 --> 00:30:12.662
Who has taken away the money of the
people, who have put it there through
the hard-earned money of people?

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:18.281
That's what happening there. Now we
are also trying to develop ourselves.

00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:23.210
Develop - we are getting sophisticated,
you see. So we may take to their ways

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:30.539
and may one day land up in the same
situation where they do not recognize
and realize where have they gone,

00:30:30.588 --> 00:30:36.018
where have they reached? At that time, I
would say, that you must see,

00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:41.228
that you must have your su-sanskaras
and the su-sanskaras come to you

00:30:43.311 --> 00:30:50.911
by listening to people like Kabira and
Nanaka, listening to people like
Tukarama and Gyaneshwara

00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:54.659
but not extreme people, who teach
something of extreme.

00:30:54.999 --> 00:31:01.389
They were all married people, they led a
very simple life. Gyaneshwara was not
married - he died very young.

00:31:02.631 --> 00:31:07.271
And we have got the greatest thing, is
Adi Shankaracharya, who has said it,

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:15.720
that you reach a certain stage, where
you do not need anything but the
Grace of Mother.

00:31:16.157 --> 00:31:21.917
The Grace is of Mother, is only
possible, if you are a moderate person.

00:31:21.917 --> 00:31:27.925
If you are an extremist, you are away
from Her and that's how it does
not work out.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:38.610
Christ has said that, "A rich man cannot
enter into the Kingdom of God,"
because he's an extremist.

00:31:39.241 --> 00:31:51.811
He said, "A camel can pass through
the eye of an needle but a rich man
cannot enter into the Kingdom of God."

00:31:52.274 --> 00:31:59.434
Why He said so? Because they are
extremes. They will go to wrong type
of people,

00:31:59.434 --> 00:32:06.652
where they can purchase a guru, when
they can show off their money or they
can use the guru as a liason officer

00:32:07.294 --> 00:32:11.680
or some sort of a thing like that, which
gives them ego-orientation.

00:32:12.094 --> 00:32:17.294
Among them there will be some few,
of course, who will realize the futility

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:21.680
of money and will come to God and I
feel now,

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.765
the modern generation in the West
is that type - are the saints born there.

00:32:27.765 --> 00:32:35.831
These are the saints born in that
country, who are seeking God but we
have exported all our thugs from here

00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:40.749
and also we are trying to enjoy the
money that they lavish on our gurus

00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:44.844
because we think we are earning foreign
exchange but this is the kamai
of adharma

00:32:44.949 --> 00:32:52.339
and unless and until we check this, our
country can never progress. We are not
to be soft on this point.

00:32:52.347 --> 00:32:58.627
This is the thagai of other nations. They
did it to us, doesn't matter but we
should not do it.

00:32:58.627 --> 00:33:02.443
If the whole world tries to cheat us,
doesn't matter, we should not cheat

00:33:02.443 --> 00:33:07.692
and we know for definite that this is
cheating, still, we are soft on this point

00:33:07.739 --> 00:33:10.939
because we think that's how we can
earn foreign exchange.

00:33:10.939 --> 00:33:14.733
You don't know with such a kamai what
can happen to this country.

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:23.501
Now, in Sahaja yoga which is described
by all the great saints,

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:26.982
today the time has come for it to
become a Mahayoga.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.770
It has to become a Mahayog.
Gyaneshwara has described it that,

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:37.970
"A day will come when Sahaja will
become Maha," means you'll have
a mass realization.

00:33:38.104 --> 00:33:44.264
En masse - thousands of people can get
realization, which I've seen happening
in the villages.

00:33:44.264 --> 00:33:51.492
In a Kadoos village - there's a place
called Kadoos near Satara, where
people gathered -

00:33:51.991 --> 00:33:56.911
they were about six thousand, above
six thousand and there were
newspaper people also

00:33:56.911 --> 00:34:04.003
and all of them got realization - most
surprising. All of them got their
realization - it's most surprising.

00:34:04.003 --> 00:34:09.667
It is going to happen in thousands,
especially in the villages because
city people are Westernized.

00:34:11.097 --> 00:34:14.967
Difficult people, they think no end of
themselves, too much of ego.

00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:21.779
When I came here, I found, the whole of
Delhi is suffering from ego, tremendous
ego, the Agnya chakra.

00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:25.364
I had to ask people to take out
vibrations to put that down.

00:34:26.444 --> 00:34:29.798
I don't know from where this kind of a
myth is working

00:34:29.798 --> 00:34:35.346
but we have to face ourselves as we are,
we have to get ourselves corrected
through Kundalini awakening.

00:34:35.346 --> 00:34:42.187
Now this Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous
growth, is a living growth. The Kundalini
rises by itself

00:34:42.187 --> 00:34:45.951
and pierces the Brahmarandhra, as
described by all these people

00:34:45.955 --> 00:34:50.895
'Shunya shikhar par anahad baaji re'.
It's all described, I mean, I don't
have to tell you

00:34:50.895 --> 00:34:53.983
because you do not read these
things, you see, you just sing.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:35:00.800
This is what they have said I'm doing
today. I'm doing the job of Kabira,
Nanaka, of Gyaneshwara

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.447
and all the Nath Panthis who have
preached that you have to get
your realization -

00:35:04.447 --> 00:35:09.035
of Christ, of Mohammad and all these
people put together, of Buddha,
of Mahavira.

00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:15.913
Of all these people, this work has to be
finished today - this is the time
that has come.

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:22.477
Most surprising, that in a place like
England, which I said you don't
consider to be very spiritual,

00:35:22.563 --> 00:35:28.643
about hundred years back, a great
poet was born. I must say he was great,
because he was such a prophet

00:35:28.884 --> 00:35:34.614
and he said that, this Mahayoga time is
going to come. The most remarkable
thing is,

00:35:34.614 --> 00:35:38.217
that he has even mentioned the place,
where I was staying.

00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:43.556
What's the matter with you Sir?
Why don't you sit down, disturbing
everybody else? Please sit down.

00:35:43.556 --> 00:35:46.980
You shouldn't do like this. You see, you
cannot come to this place and disturb.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:52.332
It's a question of your Kundalini. I'm
trying to raise the Kundalini of the
people and suddenly you should talk.

00:35:52.332 --> 00:35:57.587
There is no need to do it, you see,
it's a very delicate work. It's the
Brahmashakti

00:35:57.587 --> 00:36:00.885
and I have to take it through the
Brahmanadi. I'm trying. When I'm talking

00:36:00.885 --> 00:36:05.596
it's not talking, I'm raising your Kundalini
and please don't disturb. If you have
to go, you should go before.

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:13.390
It's not a cinema, it's not a show - it is a
living work, so please help Me. Don't
disturb each other, please.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:20.394
It's a very serious thing and one has
to understand one's own value

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:26.620
that I'm here to give you what is the
most precious thing within you
- is your Spirit

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:33.136
so please, do not just walk off or
because you're not entertained or
something. Try to put your attention.

00:36:33.136 --> 00:36:39.573
It's not such a difficult subject I'm telling
you but try to understand that this is
a very important time.

00:36:39.573 --> 00:36:43.306
If you have come here, it's a great
chance, you better get your realization.

00:36:43.306 --> 00:36:48.506
As a Mother, I've to tell you, that this is
The thing you have been seeking.

00:36:48.644 --> 00:36:54.464
Now I was talking about William Blake.
Hundred years back he has written
about this Mahayoga.

00:36:54.464 --> 00:37:01.692
He said that, "The men of God, the
seekers," - I'm saying it's a category -

00:37:01.692 --> 00:37:08.952
"Seekers will become prophets, they'll
get realization. But these prophets,

00:37:09.056 --> 00:37:13.736
these prophets will have a special
quality in them," and what is the quality?

00:37:13.822 --> 00:37:18.062
that they will be transforming
others into prophet state.

00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:22.041
There will be many prophets which
will be created on this earth.

00:37:22.041 --> 00:37:28.599
But most surprising is that he has
written it in such details that he has
even mentioned the place where I lived.

00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:32.235
He said that, "First beacon will be lit on
Surrey Hills," where I lived first

00:37:32.235 --> 00:37:38.366
and about the ashram that we're having
that, "Lambethvale is the place where
the foundations will be laid in the ruins."

00:37:38.366 --> 00:37:43.542
We bought a place which was all ruins.
To that extent he has said

00:37:43.542 --> 00:37:50.835
and he has said that, "London will be a
Jerusalem," England will be a Jersulaem,
means a kshetra, means a pilgrimage.

00:37:51.176 --> 00:37:56.016
Imagine hundred years back an
Englishman has written about this.

00:37:57.477 --> 00:38:01.627
That means it's something is going to
work out in that country, no doubt.

00:38:01.627 --> 00:38:11.387
But what about [NO SOUND] hundred
years back an Englishman has written
about this.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.170
That means it's something is going to
workout in that country, no doubt

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:23.160
but what about this great country of
ours which is a yoga bhumi. You're
born in a yoga bhumi, do you know that?

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:29.933
You have a responsibility towards God.
Where are you, where are you wasting
your attention?

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:36.503
The whole world is looking at you for
guidance, you're not interested,
you're not bothered.

00:38:37.197 --> 00:38:42.117
Now, people might say, "Mother, if it is a
yoga bhumi, why is it a poor country?"

00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:48.961
It is better that it is poor than to
be rich like these stupid people abroad.

00:38:50.174 --> 00:38:55.614
Krishna has said that, 'Yogakshema
vahamayam'. First have the yoga
and then the kshema.

00:38:56.167 --> 00:39:01.647
He didn't say 'kshema yoga', He said
'Yogakshema'. First you must get yoga,

00:39:01.647 --> 00:39:11.069
you must get your realization, then the
kshema. That is the way it looks nice,
it glorifies you.

00:39:11.623 --> 00:39:20.373
In Hindi we can say, 'Raajta hai'.
Otherwise it's odd, it's funny. You look as
if two horns have come out of you.

00:39:20.373 --> 00:39:25.756
You elect somebody as a Member of
Parliament. Immediately you know
he must be something -

00:39:25.756 --> 00:39:30.169
the way his nose is, the way he talks, the
way he walks brushing everyone else.

00:39:30.169 --> 00:39:33.004
You make him a Minister - had it
- never see his face again.

00:39:35.878 --> 00:39:42.278
The cursed man would go there - it is
like that. A very good man can be
ruined with a power.

00:39:42.545 --> 00:39:47.935
A very good man can be ruined with
money. You have seen people who
get money suddenly;

00:39:47.935 --> 00:39:51.159
They forget their parents, they forget
their country, they forget everyone.

00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:58.061
All kinds of horrible things done
in the name of money.

00:39:58.975 --> 00:40:03.745
Bribery, corruption, everything is done
because we are not realized souls.

00:40:03.745 --> 00:40:12.244
If we are realized souls, we'll not just do
it at any cost. All your efforts

00:40:12.244 --> 00:40:17.387
to improve the honesty of this country
is not possible unless and until you
get your Self-realization

00:40:17.387 --> 00:40:22.751
through Kundalini awakening, by which
a transformation takes place and
person develops his own personality.

00:40:22.846 --> 00:40:28.156
Then he has no such temptations and
his whole being changes and he
becomes 'samarth'.

00:40:28.156 --> 00:40:36.010
'Sama' 'arth' - he becomes the meaning
of what he is. He's no more misidentified
with anything.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:45.616
He's not bothered and then the Lakshmi
tatwa is also enlightened and his
material problems also get solved

00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:54.872
to an extent - not too much a gain; You
do not become a 'lakhonpati' because
that's foolishness and tomfoolery

00:40:54.872 --> 00:40:59.799
but you become so well off that you're
absolutely satisfied with yourself,

00:40:59.799 --> 00:41:03.390
with your matertial being and you
do not ask for anymore.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:08.030
The whole thing changes completely
when you are sitting before Me or asking,

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:15.362
then you change your form - you're here
you're giving. Like the light, when it is
enlightened, what does it do?

00:41:15.362 --> 00:41:21.116
It just gives light. Till it is enlightened,
is the seeking, once it get light,
it gives the light.

00:41:21.116 --> 00:41:27.092
Like all the great saints have done it. The
only difference is, that these saints were
born at such a great height,

00:41:27.092 --> 00:41:32.938
that whenever they talked, nobody
listened to them, nobody recognized
them and everyone tortured them.

00:41:32.938 --> 00:41:37.123
When they died, now we have big, big
organizations, big, big religious cults
and religious things,

00:41:37.123 --> 00:41:43.259
and big, big churches and temples
and all that we have built in their
names - when they died.

00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:46.896
When they lived, nobody bothered
about them - nobody.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:55.740
So, today the time has come for you to
get this Absolute within you by which
you'll recognize the real and the unreal.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:02.195
Not only that, but your powers of your
Spirit will manifest by which you can do

00:42:02.195 --> 00:42:09.305
wonders and wonders, about which I'll
tell you later on in other programs
which we're going to have.

00:42:09.305 --> 00:42:16.389
I hope you'll continue to come and bring
more people for it. Everytime I'll try to
raise your Kundalini and try to establish.

00:42:16.652 --> 00:42:25.682
After realization, when the germination
has taken place, when the seed has
sprouted, you have to be careful.

00:42:25.682 --> 00:42:33.393
Atleast for seven days you have to be
really careful about it, so that you do
not get into your mess again.

00:42:33.472 --> 00:42:38.372
And after that, if you follow it properly,
there's an education you need for it.

00:42:38.372 --> 00:42:43.378
The effort is not needed before,
afterwards you have to little bit educate
yourself to understand

00:42:43.378 --> 00:42:51.944
what does the chakras mean, where
they go, what are the points where they
catch, what diseases are caused by this,

00:42:51.944 --> 00:42:57.429
what problems are caused by this, how
to get rid of them - all this knowledge
you should have.

00:42:57.429 --> 00:43:01.664
Now we have, you see here, we have lots
of beautiful people from Australia

00:43:01.904 --> 00:43:10.218
and England and from France and other
places - they all have got their
realization and they have established it.

00:43:10.218 --> 00:43:14.942
Many people get realization. Last time
also we had lots of people who got
realization.

00:43:14.942 --> 00:43:19.282
I meet some of them on the street. They
say, "Mother, we're alright but the
vibrations are lost."

00:43:19.282 --> 00:43:25.764
We do not have the value - it's amulya, it
is invaluable, you cannot pay for it.

00:43:25.764 --> 00:43:32.241
That is one thing you must know, you
cannot pay for God. It's an insult. Can
you pay for your Mother's love?

00:43:33.151 --> 00:43:40.781
It's an insult and all those who have
erected huge big places taking money
for God.

00:43:42.001 --> 00:43:47.768
Alright if you want to build a house, you
can build it - call it ashram , call it
anything

00:43:47.768 --> 00:43:56.579
but it's a dead stuff. But you cannot pay
for your realization, you cannot pay for
your realization -

00:43:56.579 --> 00:44:02.829
that is one thing is definite. Now what all
the things happen to you, I will tell you

00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:13.451
from tomorrow onwards and I'm here for
sometime. Please, little bit, try to have
your self-esteem.

00:44:13.451 --> 00:44:20.420
You are not ordinary people to be born
in this country and that you have to
achieve your depths.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:29.042
When you go deep into it suddenly you'll
find, that within you lies the great
power of your punyas

00:44:29.042 --> 00:44:33.822
that you have achieved in last lives.
You have to just go up to that point.

00:44:33.822 --> 00:44:39.543
First Self-realization and then your own
depth you have to seek. Once you get
into it, you just get it,

00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:45.063
you're there and you start manifesting it.
You will become the guru yourself,

00:44:46.715 --> 00:44:53.015
you will know everything by yourself -
this is the promise of this Mahayoga.

00:44:53.065 --> 00:45:01.615
I hope Delhi people will understand it
and will be able to achieve their
Self-realization in this visit of Mine.

00:45:01.615 --> 00:45:06.211
It is very important, time is very
important, it is running short, I think,

00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:10.367
and people have to realize it, this is the
Last Judgment that is being promised.

00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:13.865
Only through Kundalini you're going to
be judged otherwise there's no way out.

00:45:13.865 --> 00:45:19.620
This is the Last Judgment and don't
miss it. The time is running short
- I'm telling all the people

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:26.005
that please be careful. Bring all your
friends, tell all your people, get it for
yourself and be established

00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:33.002
and enjoy the beauty of the Spirit and
enter into the Kingdom of God, Who is
your very, very loving Father,

00:45:33.002 --> 00:45:36.305
Who wants to give you this.
May God bless you all!

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:50.140
The Kundalini will rise by itself. Don't
believe in people who say that it
cannot be done.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.014
Ofcourse it cannot be done, it's very
difficult, I accept it but maybe

00:45:54.014 --> 00:45:57.637
I know the job very well or I have the
authority perhaps, maybe and tomorrow

00:45:57.637 --> 00:46:02.051
you will also have the authority to raise
the Kundalini. You all will have the same.

00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:06.055
It's coming, isn't it? Now you were going?
Haan, put your hands like this.

00:46:08.806 --> 00:46:11.736
Don't disturb others, alright, please.
Put just your hands.

00:46:11.736 --> 00:46:21.472
Now I would say, that on collective
being, I find that your right side is over,
overactive so you have to put it down.

00:46:21.683 --> 00:46:25.693
First of all, before doing anything else,
please put your left hand towards Me.

00:46:25.693 --> 00:46:32.047
Left is frozen but the right is ... put left
hand towards Me, like this, left only.

00:46:32.435 --> 00:46:39.375
Now you take from the left. Raise your
right hand like this, put it up on the head

00:46:39.375 --> 00:46:47.729
and put it this side. Throw it away. Again
do it twice - throw it away.

00:46:48.321 --> 00:47:06.475
Again do it - thrice and throw it away.
Four times and throw it away. Five times,
six times and seventh time.

00:47:09.605 --> 00:47:13.445
It's alright. Now put your hands
towards Me. It's much better.

00:47:14.346 --> 00:47:17.526
See. There is no question in this,
there is no answer in this.

00:47:17.559 --> 00:47:20.479
This will happen to whomsoever it has
to happen, not happen to someone if
it doesn't want to happen.

00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:24.527
There can be no argument, no quarrel,
no discussion in this.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.640
This is God's thing, it will happen when
it has to happen, it will happen to
whomsoever it has to happen.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.941
And for some it will happen today, for
some it will happen tomorrow, for some
it will happen the day after tomorrow.

00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:37.519
It should happen, this should be asked
from God. You can't fight about this.

00:47:37.956 --> 00:47:41.856
There can't be any kind of conflict in
this, nothing will be achieved by talking,

00:47:41.856 --> 00:47:44.425
nothing will be achieved by doing
anything.

00:47:44.425 --> 00:47:46.607
What is the point of wasting time
unnecessarily?

00:47:46.717 --> 00:47:50.767
The most important thing here is that
people here do not even know
about Kundalini.

00:47:51.145 --> 00:47:55.125
Therefore, it becomes a big problem
that with you have to start from the
very base.

00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:59.734
Otherwise everyone in Maharashtra
knows. People there know what
kundalini is.

00:47:59.734 --> 00:48:04.241
They know about chakras, know who
Dattatreya is. People here don't
know anything.

00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:09.270
It's a very difficult task, so you people
should first get realization and then
I will explain.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:14.474
Suppose you have come into this room
and it is dark. First put on the lights,
then we will talk. Is it okay?
