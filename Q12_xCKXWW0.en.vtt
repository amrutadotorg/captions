00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:10.755
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis who
have found the Truth.

00:08:14.799 --> 00:08:23.647
There has been, from ages, the seeking
for the Truth.

00:08:23.848 --> 00:08:33.040
And when people discovered that there’s
no other way

00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:42.306
but to surrender to the Divine that you
can find the truth,

00:08:42.507 --> 00:08:47.964
they did not know how to do it, how
to work it out.

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:53.782
There have been seekers all over the world.

00:08:53.983 --> 00:08:56.225
I went to Turkey and I was amazed

00:08:56.426 --> 00:08:59.646
there have been lots of Sufis,

00:08:59.847 --> 00:09:03.697
but their disciples were not realised
souls.

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:05.876
Because the Sufis also did not know

00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:08.836
how they got their Realisation.

00:09:09.037 --> 00:09:17.102
Such darkness existed around people who
were seeking.

00:09:17.303 --> 00:09:24.491
All over the world, I find, when I was
a little girl,

00:09:24.692 --> 00:09:34.074
that they are completely ignorant about
how to find the Truth.

00:09:34.275 --> 00:09:38.700
So many were lost in all kinds

00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:44.129
of so-called religions and rituals.

00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:47.329
All kinds of rituals they used to do.

00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:52.977
Morning till evening, some sort of a ritual
they would do.

00:09:53.178 --> 00:09:56.889
Whether they were Hindus, Christians,
Muslims,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.641
they all believed that by doing all these
rituals

00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:05.181
you will achieve something, that you will
know the Truth,

00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:08.459
that you will get your Self-realisation.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:16.273
All such seekers went to wrong people

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:19.613
and to wrong directions

00:10:19.814 --> 00:10:24.338
because they were really seeking from
their heart.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:30.540
So they were very misleading, misleading

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:41.428
and they were misled into such horrible
black areas

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:43.720
that they did not know what they were
seeking,

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:49.115
what they are supposed to seek, what they
have to have.

00:10:51.136 --> 00:11:00.216
It has been prophesised that when Kali
Yuga will come,

00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:03.807
people will find themselves.

00:11:04.008 --> 00:11:10.330
There is a story about Nala and Kali,

00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:22.935
who had taken away the wife, Damayanti,
of Nala.

00:11:23.136 --> 00:11:34.214
So, once Nala caught hold of him, and he
said that: “Now I’m going to kill you,

00:11:34.415 --> 00:11:41.512
because you are a very mischievous man,
and you have done such a harm to me.”

00:11:41.713 --> 00:11:48.551
So the Kali said: “You can kill me, but
before that you should know

00:11:48.752 --> 00:11:52.938
what is my importance, what is my Mahatmya.

00:11:53.139 --> 00:12:00.444
And my importance is that when my time
will come –

00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:03.511
when Kali Yuga will come –

00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:08.249
then all those people who are seeking
the Truth

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:19.857
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,
in the Himalayas,

00:12:20.058 --> 00:12:23.834
will become ordinary householders,

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:29.456
they’ll be householders – they won’t be
sanyasis going about –

00:12:29.657 --> 00:12:35.189
they’ll be householders, and they will
find the Truth”.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.019
This has been prophesised long time back,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:43.143
and also there’s a book about it, a big
book (Nala Purana)

00:12:43.344 --> 00:12:47.330
as you must have read in the book, which
says that:

00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:54.601
“The time has come for people to know
themselves.”

00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:57.467
Every religion has said one thing,

00:12:57.668 --> 00:13:01.129
that – “You must know yourself.”

00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:06.779
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:12.227
Christians say the same, Hindus say
the same.

00:13:12.428 --> 00:13:22.255
So, till then, they go on doing all kinds
of acrobats,

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:28.975
but [finally] they realise that – we
haven’t found the Truth.

00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:35.769
So it came to my lot,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.572
from my childhood I knew I had to do it.

00:13:39.773 --> 00:13:42.894
But when I saw the human beings,

00:13:43.095 --> 00:13:48.354
how much in darkness they were about
themselves,

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:54.471
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

00:13:54.672 --> 00:14:03.791
all their style was so cruel that it was
unbelievable.

00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:08.256
That was the time also I saw Hitler
coming up.

00:14:08.457 --> 00:14:17.022
And our country also was in complete
bondage.

00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:24.568
So the first thing was to make our country
free,

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:31.977
was very important, and that’s why
I took a very, very active role

00:14:32.178 --> 00:14:38.196
in the movement that was for the freedom
of our country;

00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:42.486
same with my father, mother.

00:14:42.728 --> 00:14:46.529
But when we got the freedom, somehow,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:51.564
after some time we got lost.

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:58.289
People started taking to all kinds of
modern things which were wrong,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.968
which were so-called entertaining.

00:15:03.975 --> 00:15:09.218
With all that, I found (that) all over
the world

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:14.540
there was a big seeking force,

00:15:14.741 --> 00:15:19.149
and some false people took full
advantage of it.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.725
They went out and made lots and lots
of money,

00:15:23.926 --> 00:15:26.511
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.935
I don’t know what they did to them.

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:32.671
So many seekers were lost like that.

00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:37.437
Despite that, I went to America and I was
shocked

00:15:37.638 --> 00:15:42.352
how the things were going on there.
But I couldn’t help it,

00:15:42.553 --> 00:15:49.374
because they were so mentally ill-equipped,

00:15:49.575 --> 00:15:54.231
they could not understand what they have
to have,

00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:58.400
and you can’t pay for the Truth.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:10.074
Then it happened that I had started it
after the Sahasrara was broken.

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:16.573
And you know the story of how I broke
the Sahasrara,

00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:23.860
and how, from one person, I started
giving Realization.

00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:27.649
But from America I got very disappointed.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:32.909
I was thinking: “How will it grow? How will
it work out?”

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:41.040
We had about 25 people who were realised
souls by then, in India.

00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:46.852
But they realised what they have got
by Realization,

00:16:47.053 --> 00:16:52.852
they realised that they had become
very good people.

00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:56.240
They had given up all bad habits,

00:16:56.441 --> 00:17:04.525
and they were wanting to worship me.
I said: “No, no. Don’t worship me

00:17:04.726 --> 00:17:11.894
because people will not understand”. But
one day they forced me.

00:17:12.095 --> 00:17:16.133
So on our terrace of the house they came
and worshipped me

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:21.300
because somebody had told them, “This is
the Goddess.”

00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:28.369
So, what had happened was after
the programme

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:32.188
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

00:17:32.389 --> 00:17:39.102
And she came and she started calling me
by the name of ‘Goddess’.

00:17:39.303 --> 00:17:42.143
So people said: “What are you saying?”

00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:45.852
She was a woman but talking like a man.

00:17:46.053 --> 00:17:48.810
So she said: “I’m telling you the truth,

00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:53.305
She is the Goddess who has come to save
us.”

00:17:53.506 --> 00:17:57.699
Her language was not that of a maidservant,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.437
but of a very well-educated Brahmin

00:18:04.638 --> 00:18:08.692
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s
stotras.

00:18:08.893 --> 00:18:13.661
It was very surprising! So they asked her
several questions

00:18:13.862 --> 00:18:19.761
and then she just fainted. So I told them:
“Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

00:18:19.962 --> 00:18:21.887
But they would not agree, and they said:

00:18:22.088 --> 00:18:27.810
“Mother, we have to worship you.” So
somehow I agreed to that

00:18:28.011 --> 00:18:33.977
and they got hold of seven Brahmins to do
that.

00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:39.146
They were afraid because to do that Puja,

00:18:39.347 --> 00:18:45.534
it’s very dangerous and it could harm you
if it is not the Truth.

00:18:45.735 --> 00:18:50.406
But on the contrary, when they were doing
the Puja, they got their Realization,

00:18:50.607 --> 00:18:54.009
and they just said: “Now, this is
the Truth!”

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.849
They felt the cool breeze in their hands.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.765
All the symptoms told about a realised
soul started.

00:19:03.596 --> 00:19:10.705
But I didn’t want to say everything at that
time, because

00:19:10.906 --> 00:19:14.844
there were many others saying: “I am this…
I am that…”

00:19:15.045 --> 00:19:19.316
So I didn’t want to expose it altogether.

00:19:19.517 --> 00:19:23.636
But gradually I had found that people got
attracted

00:19:23.837 --> 00:19:27.286
and they used to come to my programme.

00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:31.343
And then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

00:19:31.544 --> 00:19:37.387
all over, in a very interesting manner.

00:19:37.588 --> 00:19:42.098
So this Sahasrara Day or, we can say,

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:45.859
on the day the Sahasrara was opened out,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:51.546
is a very important one, it’s very subtle.

00:19:51.747 --> 00:19:57.341
We just know about the Kundalini, that
She’s coiled up in three and a half,

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:04.284
and She’s lying in the triangular bone
known as Sacrum.

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:11.353
But we don’t know what She works, how She
works, what happens to us.

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:18.592
She rises in six centres and breaks
the seventh…

00:20:18.793 --> 00:20:21.850
I should say She breaks the sixth centre,

00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:26.522
because Ganesha’s centre doesn’t play
any role.

00:20:26.723 --> 00:20:34.061
So when She breaks the sixth centre, which
is the Sahasrara,

00:20:34.262 --> 00:20:41.714
then She connects you to the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love.

00:20:43.018 --> 00:20:53.769
But what is this Divine Love? What does
this do?

00:20:53.970 --> 00:21:01.679
It is the energy of the Mother.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.644
We can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti,

00:21:06.845 --> 00:21:14.345
which is all over, works through
vibrations.

00:21:14.546 --> 00:21:18.186
But what are these vibrations?

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.507
It’s a very subtle energy

00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:27.618
that starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:33.840
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara
get slowly enlightened

00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:38.102
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

00:21:38.303 --> 00:21:44.810
throughout your hands, feet, throughout
your body.

00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:53.311
And the more you are… I mean your attention
is, on the Sahasrara,

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:56.977
the more it works faster.

00:21:57.178 --> 00:22:01.732
Now in the science I’ve read that they
have discovered

00:22:01.933 --> 00:22:06.319
an energy called, they call it… what you
call that?

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:12.856
I don’t know, because it was the scientists
that...

00:22:13.088 --> 00:22:17.480
Forget it, is the… (From the audience:
“Quantum”)

00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:22.884
What energy? Quantum ha! Quantum Energy.

00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:25.850
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it
Quantum,

00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.935
because Quantum is four.

00:22:30.136 --> 00:22:35.349
So it might be meaning the energy of
Ganesha, maybe, I don’t know.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.666
Because scientists are blind people,

00:22:37.867 --> 00:22:40.332
I don’t know what they call what.

00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:43.525
So they are saying there is a quantum
energy.

00:22:43.726 --> 00:22:50.830
Now this Quantum Energy, according to them,
flows, in a very subtle manner

00:22:51.031 --> 00:22:57.151
and it is normally not visible, but it has
light.

00:22:57.352 --> 00:23:02.783
You have seen that in so many of
photographs of mine,

00:23:02.984 --> 00:23:06.414
there’s light of all kind.

00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:09.311
This energy moves in a light.

00:23:09.512 --> 00:23:13.557
So this is the Quantum Energy I think
again, I am not very sure,

00:23:13.758 --> 00:23:17.905
because scientists, I have always found
them little bit vague.

00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:21.168
But this quantum energy they are talking
about

00:23:21.376 --> 00:23:24.018
is something like the spiritual energy

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:28.820
or the energy of love, which flows around.

00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:35.059
And this Quantum Energy, they do not know
what it does,

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.019
but they have seen it has got light.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.601
They call it Quantum because, according
to them,

00:23:41.802 --> 00:23:48.061
it flows in bundles, and every bundle is
a quanta, according to them.

00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:54.274
Now this energy, when it flows, as you have
seen yourself, it works.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:58.282
It works in every direction, in every
dimension.

00:23:58.483 --> 00:24:01.810
For example it works physically.

00:24:02.011 --> 00:24:05.108
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:08.311
you have seen many people get cured
in my presence –

00:24:08.512 --> 00:24:12.318
just in my presence. I need not do anything
to them.

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:17.685
Or also, as soon as I see somebody, I know
what he is suffering from.

00:24:17.886 --> 00:24:21.437
That’s also, I must say, my connection

00:24:21.691 --> 00:24:26.151
with the Divine, and that tells me what’s
wrong

00:24:26.352 --> 00:24:29.633
with what person and what should be done.

00:24:29.834 --> 00:24:32.464
And it can be cured in no time

00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:35.305
because that also comes to me just like
that.

00:24:35.506 --> 00:24:37.572
I mean, I don’t ask any questions,

00:24:37.773 --> 00:24:40.834
I don’t try to find out, I do not analyse,

00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:43.206
but it just says: “Do like this.”

00:24:43.407 --> 00:24:48.193
Or, it also doesn’t say, it just does.

00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:52.499
It just works automatically. It is very
difficult

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.894
to explain how this energy works.

00:24:56.095 --> 00:24:59.019
But all of you who have got Realisation

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.831
can also work out your own energies. How?

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:11.755
By releasing it, by feeling it,

00:25:11.956 --> 00:25:17.153
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

00:25:17.354 --> 00:25:22.057
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because
of you only.

00:25:22.258 --> 00:25:25.593
You are the people that have brought people
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:25.794 --> 00:25:30.693
But that’s not the end of it. We have
to save this world.

00:25:30.894 --> 00:25:37.565
For that at least I feel 40% of people
should get their Realisation.

00:25:37.766 --> 00:25:44.402
Whatever may be their nationality, whatever
may be their education, anything.

00:25:44.603 --> 00:25:49.169
They are to be given Self-realisation.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:56.515
In our Indian scriptures it is clearly
written:

00:25:56.715 --> 00:26:00.762
“Without Atma Sakshatkar, your life is
useless.”

00:26:00.963 --> 00:26:05.476
But what is Atma Sakshatkar? It’s
the knowledge about yourself.

00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:07.598
How can you have that knowledge,

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:13.406
unless and until you become one with this
All-pervading Power?

00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:16.539
So it was a very great thing I felt

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:24.178
that this Sahasrara I could open in 1970.

00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:28.168
I realised I was overwhelmed,

00:26:28.369 --> 00:26:31.738
because I knew this is the only trouble,

00:26:31.939 --> 00:26:35.398
it is the only obstacle human beings are
having.

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:38.480
Because their Sahasraras are not open,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:45.702
that’s why they are going in the darkness,
that’s why they are having wars,

00:26:45.903 --> 00:26:49.444
that’s why they are having all kinds
of problems.

00:26:49.645 --> 00:26:52.440
But if their Sahasrara opens

00:26:52.641 --> 00:26:56.205
and if they become one with the Divine
Power,

00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:59.310
all their problems will be solved,

00:26:59.511 --> 00:27:02.102
every type of problem will be solved

00:27:02.303 --> 00:27:04.619
and they will be very happy people.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.179
I realised it and I was very happy, I was
over-joyous,

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.715
but nobody understood me.

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:17.244
I don’t know, they thought I must be
talking something nonsensical.

00:27:17.445 --> 00:27:19.754
Nobody understood it, what it is.

00:27:19.955 --> 00:27:26.001
Because even in the Shastras it’s not
written

00:27:26.914 --> 00:27:29.645
about Kundalini so clearly.

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:33.883
Only one great saint called Jnaneshwara

00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:38.727
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter
about the Kundalini.

00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:43.057
It’s not so clear, only he said that: “With
the Kundalini,

00:27:43.258 --> 00:27:45.670
you can get your awakening.”

00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:48.729
Also you sing that song always [“Jogawa”,
“Ude bai”] I’ve heard,

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.727
which says that: “Oh, Kundalini Mother,
please be awakened!”

00:27:53.928 --> 00:27:58.111
But nobody knows that what this Kundalini
is

00:27:58.312 --> 00:28:01.061
and why are you singing that song.

00:28:01.262 --> 00:28:05.574
It was all in our country, people used
to sing in the village.

00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:10.809
So clearly, but nobody understood
the meaning of it.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.330
Just they used to sing as a, some sort
of a bhajan,

00:28:14.531 --> 00:28:18.178
or could be some sort of a music concert,

00:28:18.379 --> 00:28:21.629
but nobody knew what it was talking about.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.687
It was such a misunderstanding about
everything.

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:29.685
And [for] all these poets, also, who have
written

00:28:29.886 --> 00:28:35.685
clearly about awakening, about Realisation,

00:28:35.886 --> 00:28:39.179
everything was just in the books.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.845
They would read one line of the book, then
stop there.

00:28:43.046 --> 00:28:45.376
Another person would start another line,

00:28:45.577 --> 00:28:50.061
then he stops at another point – like that
they were just reading.

00:28:50.262 --> 00:28:54.361
Same thing about all the scriptures.

00:28:54.562 --> 00:28:59.991
There was big misunderstanding created
and was used

00:29:00.192 --> 00:29:04.752
for the purpose of their own self-interest.

00:29:04.953 --> 00:29:08.297
That is how we couldn’t get people

00:29:08.498 --> 00:29:11.721
who understood what was Self-realisation.

00:29:11.922 --> 00:29:18.356
It was just for some money, or for some
certain type of a position to get,

00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:25.769
people started big, big organisations,

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:30.649
very big religious organisations –

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:36.390
I don’t know what to call them – but none
of them were realised souls.

00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:44.843
For example, there was a great saint called
Viditama who went to China (Japan),

00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:49.067
and he started a religion called Zen.

00:29:49.268 --> 00:29:51.445
Zen means dhyana.

00:29:51.646 --> 00:29:57.543
And he wanted to put Zen in such a manner

00:29:57.744 --> 00:30:01.769
that people become thoughtless.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:11.475
He made a big tank full of sand with
patterns, and put some stones

00:30:11.676 --> 00:30:17.441
and he had said that: “You sit on the edge
of this pond

00:30:17.642 --> 00:30:24.703
and just see but don’t think.” But people
didn’t understand what it was.

00:30:24.904 --> 00:30:27.186
Normally anybody would go there and say,

00:30:27.387 --> 00:30:32.759
“Oh, this looks like some ships in
the sea,” or all kinds of things.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.061
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

00:30:37.262 --> 00:30:39.464
And I told some of them that, “This is for

00:30:39.665 --> 00:30:44.609
thoughtless awareness”, but they
couldn’t understand.

00:30:45.084 --> 00:30:50.865
Then we have also in Japan (China) – Tao.

00:30:51.066 --> 00:30:55.409
He talked about the All-pervading Power,
which is Tao.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:01.555
And Lao-Tse was the one who did… He had
described saints,

00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:07.287
how the saints are, how they behave,
how they talk,

00:31:07.488 --> 00:31:11.144
what is their mannerism, everything.

00:31:11.345 --> 00:31:15.137
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:19.141
I think, throughout, there has been no
description

00:31:19.342 --> 00:31:26.926
how to make a person into a saintly
personality.

00:31:46.562 --> 00:31:55.685
So also in the twelfth century, Jnaneshwara
was in the twelfth century [i.e. 1200s],

00:31:55.886 --> 00:32:00.289
he talked about it, and he said about it
in his book everything.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:04.164
Because it was a kind of a style

00:32:04.365 --> 00:32:08.186
that a guru should have only one disciple,

00:32:08.387 --> 00:32:12.627
who should give to one disciple
Realisation, not to many.

00:32:12.828 --> 00:32:17.552
I don’t know why, what made them such
a law, or a rule.

00:32:17.753 --> 00:32:24.011
And then it started in the twelfth century,
there were many saints

00:32:24.212 --> 00:32:30.033
who sang the praise of Realisation.

00:32:30.234 --> 00:32:33.598
And all of them thought that these rituals
are no good,

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:36.573
so they discarded rituals and this –

00:32:36.774 --> 00:32:41.609
but what was the thing that had to happen,
nobody knew.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.790
I have read all their lives,

00:32:45.991 --> 00:32:51.102
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who
were there,

00:32:51.303 --> 00:32:56.852
but it seems nobody knew how to raise
the Kundalini.

00:32:57.053 --> 00:33:02.481
This was the basic problem – they didn’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:33:02.682 --> 00:33:05.739
While, I think, they didn’t have that
power,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.242
or maybe they had no knowledge.

00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:11.005
They talked about Kundalini, alright,

00:33:11.206 --> 00:33:16.328
but they did not know how to raise
the Kundalini.

00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:21.509
This is a very special power
of spirituality.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.762
None of them have been able to say

00:33:24.963 --> 00:33:27.897
or tell you how to raise the Kundalini.

00:33:28.098 --> 00:33:30.927
Now you all have got this power,

00:33:31.128 --> 00:33:35.210
which is such a rare thing. All of you have
got it.

00:33:35.411 --> 00:33:40.593
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that
power to raise the Kundalini.

00:33:40.794 --> 00:33:44.899
You may not [use it], you may be contented
with yourself,

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.269
but that’s not a very good thing.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:52.242
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out,

00:33:52.457 --> 00:33:55.194
and if you know how to raise the Kundalini,

00:33:55.395 --> 00:34:00.311
you must go all out to give Realisation
to people.

00:34:00.512 --> 00:34:06.032
Nothing is going to benefit people more
than Self-realisation.

00:34:06.233 --> 00:34:11.974
No use doing other charities, giving money,
giving this – is of no use.

00:34:12.196 --> 00:34:15.830
Best thing is to go all out to see people

00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:20.020
who want their Realization and to give
them Realization.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:27.030
I was very happy to see that they have
started working it out on the Gypsies.

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:29.779
I have a special feeling for Gypsies.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.141
For no fault of theirs, they are leading
a very miserable life.

00:34:34.342 --> 00:34:38.566
And how the Gypsies got the Realization,

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:45.783
you can see that you can give it to anyone
who wants to have it.

00:34:45.984 --> 00:34:49.316
One thing is there, you cannot force
on anyone.

00:34:49.517 --> 00:34:54.839
If they have a desire, a pure desire,
they can get Self-realization.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.398
So this day, I have to just say now so many
years have passed.

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:03.633
I’ve worked quite hard, day and night,

00:35:03.834 --> 00:35:07.780
and my only desire was that you people

00:35:07.981 --> 00:35:11.771
should take it seriously and work it out.

00:35:11.972 --> 00:35:14.708
Don’t keep your Realisation to yourself.

00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:18.355
As many as people you can give
Realisation (to),

00:35:18.556 --> 00:35:24.708
the greatest obligation will be on me, and
on God Almighty.

00:35:24.909 --> 00:35:29.804
Only thing is you should try to give
Realization to others.

00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:32.204
You will never make a mistake.

00:35:32.405 --> 00:35:35.979
You can never make a mistake, because
the Kundalini knows.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.235
She knows you, She knows you are
a realised soul.

00:35:39.436 --> 00:35:42.801
She’ll respect you. Even if you make
mistakes,

00:35:43.002 --> 00:35:48.680
She’ll correct it and She’ll help you in
every way.

00:35:48.881 --> 00:35:59.153
I’m just a, I should say, a housewife who
had no support from anyone.

00:35:59.354 --> 00:36:06.731
But I was sure that it’s my job to find out
how to break the Sahasrara.

00:36:06.932 --> 00:36:10.180
Whatever way it is, outside doesn’t matter,

00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:16.416
my job was to find out the breaking
of Sahasrara, which I did.

00:36:16.617 --> 00:36:20.828
Now you also know that. So this is your
job.

00:36:21.029 --> 00:36:24.957
And the scientists now will be coming round
you to ask you questions,

00:36:25.158 --> 00:36:28.520
because they don’t know what they are
talking about

00:36:28.721 --> 00:36:33.872
is what we are already doing. So, you are
so powerful all of you.

00:36:34.073 --> 00:36:39.186
But how many of you are really doing this
work, is the point?

00:36:39.387 --> 00:36:43.061
Today is a very important day. I want
to tell you

00:36:43.262 --> 00:36:49.019
that you have to strengthen my hands.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.280
They say the Goddess has one thousand
hands,

00:36:52.481 --> 00:36:56.227
but even the one thousand hands are now
asking

00:36:56.428 --> 00:37:00.550
that you come along with your two hands
and work it out.

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:03.736
Is very important what you have to do.

00:37:03.937 --> 00:37:10.186
All kinds of problems in this world – they
come because of ignorance,

00:37:10.387 --> 00:37:13.780
take it politics, take it any problem.

00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:22.102
And how it is solved is also is your power
with the Divine.

00:37:22.303 --> 00:37:25.061
I will give you one simple example,

00:37:25.262 --> 00:37:30.624
that the Turkish people came and were
begging of me,

00:37:30.825 --> 00:37:33.124
“Mother, You must come, You should not
postpone.”

00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:35.631
And my passport was a problem.

00:37:35.832 --> 00:37:40.090
I said, “The passport is not ready, how
will I come?”

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:43.810
But then I thought: “Why not? We’ll have
the passport also done.”

00:37:44.011 --> 00:37:46.202
So passport was ready.

00:37:46.403 --> 00:37:49.043
And they wanted me to go to Turkey, because
they said,

00:37:49.244 --> 00:37:51.511
“The financial condition has gone down
very much,

00:37:51.712 --> 00:37:55.559
the economy has gone down absolutely.
We are ruined.”

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.402
I went there, I didn’t do anything
about it,

00:37:59.603 --> 00:38:07.392
within two days, they announced ten billion
dollar help from the World Bank.

00:38:07.593 --> 00:38:09.640
Now I didn’t talk to the World Bank,

00:38:09.841 --> 00:38:13.554
I had nothing to do with them. I don’t
know.

00:38:13.755 --> 00:38:16.546
Then I said, “No, maybe, you see, they are
helping

00:38:16.747 --> 00:38:19.128
because you people are in such trouble.”

00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:21.144
They said: “But so many countries are,

00:38:21.345 --> 00:38:24.269
why have they helped us only?”

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.227
I said: “That’s the point!”

00:38:26.428 --> 00:38:29.300
So now, I was surprised in Turkey

00:38:29.501 --> 00:38:33.554
there are only ladies, mostly, who are
leaders, mostly,

00:38:33.755 --> 00:38:36.203
and they have done such a big job.

00:38:36.404 --> 00:38:40.935
Now, I want to see what you people are
doing in your country.

00:38:41.136 --> 00:38:45.108
You may say that: “In my country,
the people are hopelessly bad.”

00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.504
Maybe, I don’t say no.

00:38:47.705 --> 00:38:51.970
But, still there are places, there are
pockets

00:38:52.171 --> 00:38:55.469
where you can go and talk to them, tell
them.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.120
Especially the media you must handle.

00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:05.759
It is something you have to do and find out
why you can’t do it.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:11.904
I was not supported by anybody, not helped
by anybody,

00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:15.657
and how I managed to break the Sahasrara,

00:39:15.858 --> 00:39:19.268
you can also break the Sahasraras
of others.

00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:23.054
It is not difficult, because my vision is

00:39:23.255 --> 00:39:28.154
that this world at least should have 40%
people

00:39:28.355 --> 00:39:35.102
who are realised souls and who are
practising Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:35.303 --> 00:39:42.857
who are giving Realization to people and
trying to change the people.

00:39:43.058 --> 00:39:46.162
Anybody you can go and tell, anybody.

00:39:46.363 --> 00:39:50.988
There’s no need to discriminate or to find
out or sit down with their…

00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:59.068
I mean people take sometimes the copy
of their education and this and that –

00:39:59.269 --> 00:40:03.695
that’s not needed. Whosoever it is.

00:40:03.896 --> 00:40:07.835
I’m not saying to give it to dogs or
to animals,

00:40:08.036 --> 00:40:12.949
but to human beings, wherever they are.
They may be anything.

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:24.344
They may be English, or they could be
Germans, they could be Italians, anywhere.

00:40:24.545 --> 00:40:29.907
I am told also some people are doing lots
of seminars and working very hard,

00:40:30.108 --> 00:40:33.220
on all levels, and it is working out.

00:40:33.421 --> 00:40:36.409
Among Muslims also, we have started
working.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.527
And even in India it has worked.

00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:44.585
You don’t know, people have not lost all
their heads, so it can work out.

00:40:44.786 --> 00:40:49.230
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset
about it.

00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:51.157
Gradually it will improve.

00:40:51.358 --> 00:40:59.040
I think the greatest enemy of our
Self-realisation is the drinking.

00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:03.272
Drinking, if people take to drinking, they
become such slaves

00:41:03.473 --> 00:41:06.873
ki (that) their brains are not alright.

00:41:07.074 --> 00:41:11.766
So I think Sahasrara also must be spoilt
with drinking.

00:41:11.967 --> 00:41:15.279
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.149
And if you could find anybody drinking,

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:23.017
if you could help that man to give up
drinking itself, it will work out.

00:41:23.218 --> 00:41:28.214
Of course, we have other enemies also,
like false gurus are there.

00:41:28.415 --> 00:41:33.388
Also we have other enemies who are having

00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:40.403
some sort of religious manipulations, but
that’s not so important.

00:41:40.604 --> 00:41:44.064
If you can get hold of people who are
drinking,

00:41:44.265 --> 00:41:46.452
I tell you it will change.

00:41:46.653 --> 00:41:51.075
And they will now understand that what they
have been doing so far,

00:41:51.276 --> 00:41:55.635
drinking, running away – now they’ll come
to the fields,

00:41:55.836 --> 00:41:58.371
and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:58.572 --> 00:42:04.144
So you are like very gentle soldiers
of love,

00:42:04.345 --> 00:42:08.899
and that’s what you have to spread and talk
to others,

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.426
give them that joy that you have.

00:42:11.627 --> 00:42:17.035
Not [to] be satisfied if you have got it
only or [a] few of you have it.

00:42:17.236 --> 00:42:20.039
You have to spread it very fast, and you
can do it.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.448
Because it doesn’t require money, it
doesn’t require any show,

00:42:24.649 --> 00:42:28.019
it is just inside it works. It’s already
there,

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.935
it’s present there, everybody has it.
I knew all that.

00:42:32.136 --> 00:42:35.311
Of course, I knew it. But now you also
know it,

00:42:35.512 --> 00:42:39.226
so you should work it out, and work it out
in a manner

00:42:39.427 --> 00:42:45.321
that I am sure one day this world will be
a changed place.

00:42:45.522 --> 00:42:48.406
Thank you very much.
