08:02.053 --> 08:10.755
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis who
have found the Truth.

08:14.799 --> 08:23.647
There has been, from ages, the seeking
for the Truth.

08:23.848 --> 08:33.040
And when people discovered that there’s
no other way

08:33.241 --> 08:42.306
but to surrender to the Divine that you
can find the truth,

08:42.507 --> 08:47.964
they did not know how to do it, how
to work it out.

08:48.541 --> 08:53.782
There have been seekers all over the world.

08:53.983 --> 08:56.225
I went to Turkey and I was amazed

08:56.426 --> 08:59.646
there have been lots of Sufis,

08:59.847 --> 09:03.697
but their disciples were not realised
souls.

09:03.898 --> 09:05.876
Because the Sufis also did not know

09:06.076 --> 09:08.836
how they got their Realisation.

09:09.037 --> 09:17.102
Such darkness existed around people who
were seeking.

09:17.303 --> 09:24.491
All over the world, I find, when I was
a little girl,

09:24.692 --> 09:34.074
that they are completely ignorant about
how to find the Truth.

09:34.275 --> 09:38.700
So many were lost in all kinds

09:38.901 --> 09:44.129
of so-called religions and rituals.

09:44.329 --> 09:47.329
All kinds of rituals they used to do.

09:47.531 --> 09:52.977
Morning till evening, some sort of a ritual
they would do.

09:53.178 --> 09:56.889
Whether they were Hindus, Christians,
Muslims,

09:57.090 --> 10:00.641
they all believed that by doing all these
rituals

10:00.842 --> 10:05.181
you will achieve something, that you will
know the Truth,

10:05.382 --> 10:08.459
that you will get your Self-realisation.

10:08.660 --> 10:16.273
All such seekers went to wrong people

10:16.474 --> 10:19.613
and to wrong directions

10:19.814 --> 10:24.338
because they were really seeking from
their heart.

10:24.539 --> 10:30.540
So they were very misleading, misleading

10:30.778 --> 10:41.428
and they were misled into such horrible
black areas

10:41.629 --> 10:43.720
that they did not know what they were
seeking,

10:43.921 --> 10:49.115
what they are supposed to seek, what they
have to have.

10:51.136 --> 11:00.216
It has been prophesised that when Kali
Yuga will come,

11:00.417 --> 11:03.807
people will find themselves.

11:04.008 --> 11:10.330
There is a story about Nala and Kali,

11:10.531 --> 11:22.935
who had taken away the wife, Damayanti,
of Nala.

11:23.136 --> 11:34.214
So, once Nala caught hold of him, and he
said that: “Now I’m going to kill you,

11:34.415 --> 11:41.512
because you are a very mischievous man,
and you have done such a harm to me.”

11:41.713 --> 11:48.551
So the Kali said: “You can kill me, but
before that you should know

11:48.752 --> 11:52.938
what is my importance, what is my Mahatmya.

11:53.139 --> 12:00.444
And my importance is that when my time
will come –

12:00.645 --> 12:03.511
when Kali Yuga will come –

12:03.712 --> 12:08.249
then all those people who are seeking
the Truth

12:08.450 --> 12:19.857
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,
in the Himalayas,

12:20.058 --> 12:23.834
will become ordinary householders,

12:24.035 --> 12:29.456
they’ll be householders – they won’t be
sanyasis going about –

12:29.657 --> 12:35.189
they’ll be householders, and they will
find the Truth”.

12:35.390 --> 12:38.019
This has been prophesised long time back,

12:38.220 --> 12:43.143
and also there’s a book about it, a big
book (Nala Purana)

12:43.344 --> 12:47.330
as you must have read in the book, which
says that:

12:47.531 --> 12:54.601
“The time has come for people to know
themselves.”

12:54.886 --> 12:57.467
Every religion has said one thing,

12:57.668 --> 13:01.129
that – “You must know yourself.”

13:01.361 --> 13:06.779
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

13:06.980 --> 13:12.227
Christians say the same, Hindus say
the same.

13:12.428 --> 13:22.255
So, till then, they go on doing all kinds
of acrobats,

13:22.456 --> 13:28.975
but [finally] they realise that – we
haven’t found the Truth.

13:30.538 --> 13:35.769
So it came to my lot,

13:35.970 --> 13:39.572
from my childhood I knew I had to do it.

13:39.773 --> 13:42.894
But when I saw the human beings,

13:43.095 --> 13:48.354
how much in darkness they were about
themselves,

13:48.555 --> 13:54.471
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

13:54.672 --> 14:03.791
all their style was so cruel that it was
unbelievable.

14:03.992 --> 14:08.256
That was the time also I saw Hitler
coming up.

14:08.457 --> 14:17.022
And our country also was in complete
bondage.

14:17.605 --> 14:24.568
So the first thing was to make our country
free,

14:24.769 --> 14:31.977
was very important, and that’s why
I took a very, very active role

14:32.178 --> 14:38.196
in the movement that was for the freedom
of our country;

14:38.397 --> 14:42.486
same with my father, mother.

14:42.728 --> 14:46.529
But when we got the freedom, somehow,

14:46.730 --> 14:51.564
after some time we got lost.

14:51.765 --> 14:58.289
People started taking to all kinds of
modern things which were wrong,

14:58.490 --> 15:02.968
which were so-called entertaining.

15:03.975 --> 15:09.218
With all that, I found (that) all over
the world

15:09.419 --> 15:14.540
there was a big seeking force,

15:14.741 --> 15:19.149
and some false people took full
advantage of it.

15:19.350 --> 15:23.725
They went out and made lots and lots
of money,

15:23.926 --> 15:26.511
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

15:26.740 --> 15:28.935
I don’t know what they did to them.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.671
So many seekers were lost like that.

15:32.872 --> 15:37.437
Despite that, I went to America and I was
shocked

15:37.638 --> 15:42.352
how the things were going on there.
But I couldn’t help it,

15:42.553 --> 15:49.374
because they were so mentally ill-equipped,

15:49.575 --> 15:54.231
they could not understand what they have
to have,

15:54.432 --> 15:58.400
and you can’t pay for the Truth.

16:00.220 --> 16:10.074
Then it happened that I had started it
after the Sahasrara was broken.

16:10.275 --> 16:16.573
And you know the story of how I broke
the Sahasrara,

16:16.774 --> 16:23.860
and how, from one person, I started
giving Realization.

16:24.061 --> 16:27.649
But from America I got very disappointed.

16:27.850 --> 16:32.909
I was thinking: “How will it grow? How will
it work out?”

16:33.110 --> 16:41.040
We had about 25 people who were realised
souls by then, in India.

16:41.241 --> 16:46.852
But they realised what they have got
by Realization,

16:47.053 --> 16:52.852
they realised that they had become
very good people.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.240
They had given up all bad habits,

16:56.441 --> 17:04.525
and they were wanting to worship me.
I said: “No, no. Don’t worship me

17:04.726 --> 17:11.894
because people will not understand”. But
one day they forced me.

17:12.095 --> 17:16.133
So on our terrace of the house they came
and worshipped me

17:16.334 --> 17:21.300
because somebody had told them, “This is
the Goddess.”

17:21.501 --> 17:28.369
So, what had happened was after
the programme

17:28.570 --> 17:32.188
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

17:32.389 --> 17:39.102
And she came and she started calling me
by the name of ‘Goddess’.

17:39.303 --> 17:42.143
So people said: “What are you saying?”

17:42.344 --> 17:45.852
She was a woman but talking like a man.

17:46.053 --> 17:48.810
So she said: “I’m telling you the truth,

17:49.011 --> 17:53.305
She is the Goddess who has come to save
us.”

17:53.506 --> 17:57.699
Her language was not that of a maidservant,

17:57.900 --> 18:04.437
but of a very well-educated Brahmin

18:04.638 --> 18:08.692
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s
stotras.

18:08.893 --> 18:13.661
It was very surprising! So they asked her
several questions

18:13.862 --> 18:19.761
and then she just fainted. So I told them:
“Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

18:19.962 --> 18:21.887
But they would not agree, and they said:

18:22.088 --> 18:27.810
“Mother, we have to worship you.” So
somehow I agreed to that

18:28.011 --> 18:33.977
and they got hold of seven Brahmins to do
that.

18:34.178 --> 18:39.146
They were afraid because to do that Puja,

18:39.347 --> 18:45.534
it’s very dangerous and it could harm you
if it is not the Truth.

18:45.735 --> 18:50.406
But on the contrary, when they were doing
the Puja, they got their Realization,

18:50.607 --> 18:54.009
and they just said: “Now, this is
the Truth!”

18:54.210 --> 18:56.849
They felt the cool breeze in their hands.

18:57.050 --> 19:02.765
All the symptoms told about a realised
soul started.

19:03.596 --> 19:10.705
But I didn’t want to say everything at that
time, because

19:10.906 --> 19:14.844
there were many others saying: “I am this…
I am that…”

19:15.045 --> 19:19.316
So I didn’t want to expose it altogether.

19:19.517 --> 19:23.636
But gradually I had found that people got
attracted

19:23.837 --> 19:27.286
and they used to come to my programme.

19:27.487 --> 19:31.343
And then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

19:31.544 --> 19:37.387
all over, in a very interesting manner.

19:37.588 --> 19:42.098
So this Sahasrara Day or, we can say,

19:42.299 --> 19:45.859
on the day the Sahasrara was opened out,

19:46.060 --> 19:51.546
is a very important one, it’s very subtle.

19:51.747 --> 19:57.341
We just know about the Kundalini, that
She’s coiled up in three and a half,

19:57.542 --> 20:04.284
and She’s lying in the triangular bone
known as Sacrum.

20:04.485 --> 20:11.353
But we don’t know what She works, how She
works, what happens to us.

20:12.069 --> 20:18.592
She rises in six centres and breaks
the seventh…

20:18.793 --> 20:21.850
I should say She breaks the sixth centre,

20:22.051 --> 20:26.522
because Ganesha’s centre doesn’t play
any role.

20:26.723 --> 20:34.061
So when She breaks the sixth centre, which
is the Sahasrara,

20:34.262 --> 20:41.714
then She connects you to the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love.

20:43.018 --> 20:53.769
But what is this Divine Love? What does
this do?

20:53.970 --> 21:01.679
It is the energy of the Mother.

21:01.880 --> 21:06.644
We can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti,

21:06.845 --> 21:14.345
which is all over, works through
vibrations.

21:14.546 --> 21:18.186
But what are these vibrations?

21:18.430 --> 21:21.507
It’s a very subtle energy

21:21.708 --> 21:27.618
that starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

21:27.819 --> 21:33.840
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara
get slowly enlightened

21:34.041 --> 21:38.102
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

21:38.303 --> 21:44.810
throughout your hands, feet, throughout
your body.

21:45.011 --> 21:53.311
And the more you are… I mean your attention
is, on the Sahasrara,

21:53.512 --> 21:56.977
the more it works faster.

21:57.178 --> 22:01.732
Now in the science I’ve read that they
have discovered

22:01.933 --> 22:06.319
an energy called, they call it… what you
call that?

22:06.694 --> 22:12.856
I don’t know, because it was the scientists
that...

22:13.088 --> 22:17.480
Forget it, is the… (From the audience:
“Quantum”)

22:17.681 --> 22:22.884
What energy? Quantum ha! Quantum Energy.

22:23.085 --> 22:25.850
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it
Quantum,

22:26.051 --> 22:29.935
because Quantum is four.

22:30.136 --> 22:35.349
So it might be meaning the energy of
Ganesha, maybe, I don’t know.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.666
Because scientists are blind people,

22:37.867 --> 22:40.332
I don’t know what they call what.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.525
So they are saying there is a quantum
energy.

22:43.726 --> 22:50.830
Now this Quantum Energy, according to them,
flows, in a very subtle manner

22:51.031 --> 22:57.151
and it is normally not visible, but it has
light.

22:57.352 --> 23:02.783
You have seen that in so many of
photographs of mine,

23:02.984 --> 23:06.414
there’s light of all kind.

23:06.615 --> 23:09.311
This energy moves in a light.

23:09.512 --> 23:13.557
So this is the Quantum Energy I think
again, I am not very sure,

23:13.758 --> 23:17.905
because scientists, I have always found
them little bit vague.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.168
But this quantum energy they are talking
about

23:21.376 --> 23:24.018
is something like the spiritual energy

23:24.219 --> 23:28.820
or the energy of love, which flows around.

23:29.021 --> 23:35.059
And this Quantum Energy, they do not know
what it does,

23:35.260 --> 23:39.019
but they have seen it has got light.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.601
They call it Quantum because, according
to them,

23:41.802 --> 23:48.061
it flows in bundles, and every bundle is
a quanta, according to them.

23:48.262 --> 23:54.274
Now this energy, when it flows, as you have
seen yourself, it works.

23:54.475 --> 23:58.282
It works in every direction, in every
dimension.

23:58.483 --> 24:01.810
For example it works physically.

24:02.011 --> 24:05.108
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

24:05.309 --> 24:08.311
you have seen many people get cured
in my presence –

24:08.512 --> 24:12.318
just in my presence. I need not do anything
to them.

24:12.519 --> 24:17.685
Or also, as soon as I see somebody, I know
what he is suffering from.

24:17.886 --> 24:21.437
That’s also, I must say, my connection

24:21.691 --> 24:26.151
with the Divine, and that tells me what’s
wrong

24:26.352 --> 24:29.633
with what person and what should be done.

24:29.834 --> 24:32.464
And it can be cured in no time

24:32.674 --> 24:35.305
because that also comes to me just like
that.

24:35.506 --> 24:37.572
I mean, I don’t ask any questions,

24:37.773 --> 24:40.834
I don’t try to find out, I do not analyse,

24:41.035 --> 24:43.206
but it just says: “Do like this.”

24:43.407 --> 24:48.193
Or, it also doesn’t say, it just does.

24:48.394 --> 24:52.499
It just works automatically. It is very
difficult

24:52.700 --> 24:55.894
to explain how this energy works.

24:56.095 --> 24:59.019
But all of you who have got Realisation

24:59.220 --> 25:03.831
can also work out your own energies. How?

25:04.040 --> 25:11.755
By releasing it, by feeling it,

25:11.956 --> 25:17.153
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

25:17.354 --> 25:22.057
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because
of you only.

25:22.258 --> 25:25.593
You are the people that have brought people
to Sahaja Yoga.

25:25.794 --> 25:30.693
But that’s not the end of it. We have
to save this world.

25:30.894 --> 25:37.565
For that at least I feel 40% of people
should get their Realisation.

25:37.766 --> 25:44.402
Whatever may be their nationality, whatever
may be their education, anything.

25:44.603 --> 25:49.169
They are to be given Self-realisation.

25:49.390 --> 25:56.515
In our Indian scriptures it is clearly
written:

25:56.715 --> 26:00.762
“Without Atma Sakshatkar, your life is
useless.”

26:00.963 --> 26:05.476
But what is Atma Sakshatkar? It’s
the knowledge about yourself.

26:05.677 --> 26:07.598
How can you have that knowledge,

26:07.799 --> 26:13.406
unless and until you become one with this
All-pervading Power?

26:13.607 --> 26:16.539
So it was a very great thing I felt

26:16.740 --> 26:24.178
that this Sahasrara I could open in 1970.

26:24.379 --> 26:28.168
I realised I was overwhelmed,

26:28.369 --> 26:31.738
because I knew this is the only trouble,

26:31.939 --> 26:35.398
it is the only obstacle human beings are
having.

26:35.599 --> 26:38.480
Because their Sahasraras are not open,

26:38.680 --> 26:45.702
that’s why they are going in the darkness,
that’s why they are having wars,

26:45.903 --> 26:49.444
that’s why they are having all kinds
of problems.

26:49.645 --> 26:52.440
But if their Sahasrara opens

26:52.641 --> 26:56.205
and if they become one with the Divine
Power,

26:56.406 --> 26:59.310
all their problems will be solved,

26:59.511 --> 27:02.102
every type of problem will be solved

27:02.303 --> 27:04.619
and they will be very happy people.

27:04.820 --> 27:09.179
I realised it and I was very happy, I was
over-joyous,

27:09.380 --> 27:12.715
but nobody understood me.

27:12.916 --> 27:17.244
I don’t know, they thought I must be
talking something nonsensical.

27:17.445 --> 27:19.754
Nobody understood it, what it is.

27:19.955 --> 27:26.001
Because even in the Shastras it’s not
written

27:26.914 --> 27:29.645
about Kundalini so clearly.

27:29.846 --> 27:33.883
Only one great saint called Jnaneshwara

27:34.084 --> 27:38.727
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter
about the Kundalini.

27:38.928 --> 27:43.057
It’s not so clear, only he said that: “With
the Kundalini,

27:43.258 --> 27:45.670
you can get your awakening.”

27:45.871 --> 27:48.729
Also you sing that song always [“Jogawa”,
“Ude bai”] I’ve heard,

27:48.930 --> 27:53.727
which says that: “Oh, Kundalini Mother,
please be awakened!”

27:53.928 --> 27:58.111
But nobody knows that what this Kundalini
is

27:58.312 --> 28:01.061
and why are you singing that song.

28:01.262 --> 28:05.574
It was all in our country, people used
to sing in the village.

28:05.775 --> 28:10.809
So clearly, but nobody understood
the meaning of it.

28:11.010 --> 28:14.330
Just they used to sing as a, some sort
of a bhajan,

28:14.531 --> 28:18.178
or could be some sort of a music concert,

28:18.379 --> 28:21.629
but nobody knew what it was talking about.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.687
It was such a misunderstanding about
everything.

28:24.888 --> 28:29.685
And [for] all these poets, also, who have
written

28:29.886 --> 28:35.685
clearly about awakening, about Realisation,

28:35.886 --> 28:39.179
everything was just in the books.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.845
They would read one line of the book, then
stop there.

28:43.046 --> 28:45.376
Another person would start another line,

28:45.577 --> 28:50.061
then he stops at another point – like that
they were just reading.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.361
Same thing about all the scriptures.

28:54.562 --> 28:59.991
There was big misunderstanding created
and was used

29:00.192 --> 29:04.752
for the purpose of their own self-interest.

29:04.953 --> 29:08.297
That is how we couldn’t get people

29:08.498 --> 29:11.721
who understood what was Self-realisation.

29:11.922 --> 29:18.356
It was just for some money, or for some
certain type of a position to get,

29:18.557 --> 29:25.769
people started big, big organisations,

29:25.970 --> 29:30.649
very big religious organisations –

29:30.850 --> 29:36.390
I don’t know what to call them – but none
of them were realised souls.

29:36.591 --> 29:44.843
For example, there was a great saint called
Viditama who went to China (Japan),

29:45.044 --> 29:49.067
and he started a religion called Zen.

29:49.268 --> 29:51.445
Zen means dhyana.

29:51.646 --> 29:57.543
And he wanted to put Zen in such a manner

29:57.744 --> 30:01.769
that people become thoughtless.

30:01.970 --> 30:11.475
He made a big tank full of sand with
patterns, and put some stones

30:11.676 --> 30:17.441
and he had said that: “You sit on the edge
of this pond

30:17.642 --> 30:24.703
and just see but don’t think.” But people
didn’t understand what it was.

30:24.904 --> 30:27.186
Normally anybody would go there and say,

30:27.387 --> 30:32.759
“Oh, this looks like some ships in
the sea,” or all kinds of things.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.061
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

30:37.262 --> 30:39.464
And I told some of them that, “This is for

30:39.665 --> 30:44.609
thoughtless awareness”, but they
couldn’t understand.

30:45.084 --> 30:50.865
Then we have also in Japan (China) – Tao.

30:51.066 --> 30:55.409
He talked about the All-pervading Power,
which is Tao.

30:55.610 --> 31:01.555
And Lao-Tse was the one who did… He had
described saints,

31:01.756 --> 31:07.287
how the saints are, how they behave,
how they talk,

31:07.488 --> 31:11.144
what is their mannerism, everything.

31:11.345 --> 31:15.137
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

31:15.338 --> 31:19.141
I think, throughout, there has been no
description

31:19.342 --> 31:26.926
how to make a person into a saintly
personality.

31:46.562 --> 31:55.685
So also in the twelfth century, Jnaneshwara
was in the twelfth century [i.e. 1200s],

31:55.886 --> 32:00.289
he talked about it, and he said about it
in his book everything.

32:00.490 --> 32:04.164
Because it was a kind of a style

32:04.365 --> 32:08.186
that a guru should have only one disciple,

32:08.387 --> 32:12.627
who should give to one disciple
Realisation, not to many.

32:12.828 --> 32:17.552
I don’t know why, what made them such
a law, or a rule.

32:17.753 --> 32:24.011
And then it started in the twelfth century,
there were many saints

32:24.212 --> 32:30.033
who sang the praise of Realisation.

32:30.234 --> 32:33.598
And all of them thought that these rituals
are no good,

32:33.799 --> 32:36.573
so they discarded rituals and this –

32:36.774 --> 32:41.609
but what was the thing that had to happen,
nobody knew.

32:41.810 --> 32:45.790
I have read all their lives,

32:45.991 --> 32:51.102
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who
were there,

32:51.303 --> 32:56.852
but it seems nobody knew how to raise
the Kundalini.

32:57.053 --> 33:02.481
This was the basic problem – they didn’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

33:02.682 --> 33:05.739
While, I think, they didn’t have that
power,

33:05.940 --> 33:08.242
or maybe they had no knowledge.

33:08.443 --> 33:11.005
They talked about Kundalini, alright,

33:11.206 --> 33:16.328
but they did not know how to raise
the Kundalini.

33:16.529 --> 33:21.509
This is a very special power
of spirituality.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.762
None of them have been able to say

33:24.963 --> 33:27.897
or tell you how to raise the Kundalini.

33:28.098 --> 33:30.927
Now you all have got this power,

33:31.128 --> 33:35.210
which is such a rare thing. All of you have
got it.

33:35.411 --> 33:40.593
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that
power to raise the Kundalini.

33:40.794 --> 33:44.899
You may not [use it], you may be contented
with yourself,

33:45.100 --> 33:47.269
but that’s not a very good thing.

33:47.470 --> 33:52.242
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out,

33:52.457 --> 33:55.194
and if you know how to raise the Kundalini,

33:55.395 --> 34:00.311
you must go all out to give Realisation
to people.

34:00.512 --> 34:06.032
Nothing is going to benefit people more
than Self-realisation.

34:06.233 --> 34:11.974
No use doing other charities, giving money,
giving this – is of no use.

34:12.196 --> 34:15.830
Best thing is to go all out to see people

34:16.031 --> 34:20.020
who want their Realization and to give
them Realization.

34:20.220 --> 34:27.030
I was very happy to see that they have
started working it out on the Gypsies.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.779
I have a special feeling for Gypsies.

34:29.980 --> 34:34.141
For no fault of theirs, they are leading
a very miserable life.

34:34.342 --> 34:38.566
And how the Gypsies got the Realization,

34:38.767 --> 34:45.783
you can see that you can give it to anyone
who wants to have it.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.316
One thing is there, you cannot force
on anyone.

34:49.517 --> 34:54.839
If they have a desire, a pure desire,
they can get Self-realization.

34:55.040 --> 34:59.398
So this day, I have to just say now so many
years have passed.

34:59.599 --> 35:03.633
I’ve worked quite hard, day and night,

35:03.834 --> 35:07.780
and my only desire was that you people

35:07.981 --> 35:11.771
should take it seriously and work it out.

35:11.972 --> 35:14.708
Don’t keep your Realisation to yourself.

35:14.909 --> 35:18.355
As many as people you can give
Realisation (to),

35:18.556 --> 35:24.708
the greatest obligation will be on me, and
on God Almighty.

35:24.909 --> 35:29.804
Only thing is you should try to give
Realization to others.

35:30.005 --> 35:32.204
You will never make a mistake.

35:32.405 --> 35:35.979
You can never make a mistake, because
the Kundalini knows.

35:36.180 --> 35:39.235
She knows you, She knows you are
a realised soul.

35:39.436 --> 35:42.801
She’ll respect you. Even if you make
mistakes,

35:43.002 --> 35:48.680
She’ll correct it and She’ll help you in
every way.

35:48.881 --> 35:59.153
I’m just a, I should say, a housewife who
had no support from anyone.

35:59.354 --> 36:06.731
But I was sure that it’s my job to find out
how to break the Sahasrara.

36:06.932 --> 36:10.180
Whatever way it is, outside doesn’t matter,

36:10.381 --> 36:16.416
my job was to find out the breaking
of Sahasrara, which I did.

36:16.617 --> 36:20.828
Now you also know that. So this is your
job.

36:21.029 --> 36:24.957
And the scientists now will be coming round
you to ask you questions,

36:25.158 --> 36:28.520
because they don’t know what they are
talking about

36:28.721 --> 36:33.872
is what we are already doing. So, you are
so powerful all of you.

36:34.073 --> 36:39.186
But how many of you are really doing this
work, is the point?

36:39.387 --> 36:43.061
Today is a very important day. I want
to tell you

36:43.262 --> 36:49.019
that you have to strengthen my hands.

36:49.220 --> 36:52.280
They say the Goddess has one thousand
hands,

36:52.481 --> 36:56.227
but even the one thousand hands are now
asking

36:56.428 --> 37:00.550
that you come along with your two hands
and work it out.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.736
Is very important what you have to do.

37:03.937 --> 37:10.186
All kinds of problems in this world – they
come because of ignorance,

37:10.387 --> 37:13.780
take it politics, take it any problem.

37:13.981 --> 37:22.102
And how it is solved is also is your power
with the Divine.

37:22.303 --> 37:25.061
I will give you one simple example,

37:25.262 --> 37:30.624
that the Turkish people came and were
begging of me,

37:30.825 --> 37:33.124
“Mother, You must come, You should not
postpone.”

37:33.325 --> 37:35.631
And my passport was a problem.

37:35.832 --> 37:40.090
I said, “The passport is not ready, how
will I come?”

37:40.291 --> 37:43.810
But then I thought: “Why not? We’ll have
the passport also done.”

37:44.011 --> 37:46.202
So passport was ready.

37:46.403 --> 37:49.043
And they wanted me to go to Turkey, because
they said,

37:49.244 --> 37:51.511
“The financial condition has gone down
very much,

37:51.712 --> 37:55.559
the economy has gone down absolutely.
We are ruined.”

37:55.760 --> 37:59.402
I went there, I didn’t do anything
about it,

37:59.603 --> 38:07.392
within two days, they announced ten billion
dollar help from the World Bank.

38:07.593 --> 38:09.640
Now I didn’t talk to the World Bank,

38:09.841 --> 38:13.554
I had nothing to do with them. I don’t
know.

38:13.755 --> 38:16.546
Then I said, “No, maybe, you see, they are
helping

38:16.747 --> 38:19.128
because you people are in such trouble.”

38:19.329 --> 38:21.144
They said: “But so many countries are,

38:21.345 --> 38:24.269
why have they helped us only?”

38:24.470 --> 38:26.227
I said: “That’s the point!”

38:26.428 --> 38:29.300
So now, I was surprised in Turkey

38:29.501 --> 38:33.554
there are only ladies, mostly, who are
leaders, mostly,

38:33.755 --> 38:36.203
and they have done such a big job.

38:36.404 --> 38:40.935
Now, I want to see what you people are
doing in your country.

38:41.136 --> 38:45.108
You may say that: “In my country,
the people are hopelessly bad.”

38:45.309 --> 38:47.504
Maybe, I don’t say no.

38:47.705 --> 38:51.970
But, still there are places, there are
pockets

38:52.171 --> 38:55.469
where you can go and talk to them, tell
them.

38:55.670 --> 38:59.120
Especially the media you must handle.

38:59.321 --> 39:05.759
It is something you have to do and find out
why you can’t do it.

39:05.960 --> 39:11.904
I was not supported by anybody, not helped
by anybody,

39:12.105 --> 39:15.657
and how I managed to break the Sahasrara,

39:15.858 --> 39:19.268
you can also break the Sahasraras
of others.

39:19.469 --> 39:23.054
It is not difficult, because my vision is

39:23.255 --> 39:28.154
that this world at least should have 40%
people

39:28.355 --> 39:35.102
who are realised souls and who are
practising Sahaja Yoga,

39:35.303 --> 39:42.857
who are giving Realization to people and
trying to change the people.

39:43.058 --> 39:46.162
Anybody you can go and tell, anybody.

39:46.363 --> 39:50.988
There’s no need to discriminate or to find
out or sit down with their…

39:51.189 --> 39:59.068
I mean people take sometimes the copy
of their education and this and that –

39:59.269 --> 40:03.695
that’s not needed. Whosoever it is.

40:03.896 --> 40:07.835
I’m not saying to give it to dogs or
to animals,

40:08.036 --> 40:12.949
but to human beings, wherever they are.
They may be anything.

40:13.150 --> 40:24.344
They may be English, or they could be
Germans, they could be Italians, anywhere.

40:24.545 --> 40:29.907
I am told also some people are doing lots
of seminars and working very hard,

40:30.108 --> 40:33.220
on all levels, and it is working out.

40:33.421 --> 40:36.409
Among Muslims also, we have started
working.

40:36.610 --> 40:39.527
And even in India it has worked.

40:39.728 --> 40:44.585
You don’t know, people have not lost all
their heads, so it can work out.

40:44.786 --> 40:49.230
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset
about it.

40:49.431 --> 40:51.157
Gradually it will improve.

40:51.358 --> 40:59.040
I think the greatest enemy of our
Self-realisation is the drinking.

40:59.241 --> 41:03.272
Drinking, if people take to drinking, they
become such slaves

41:03.473 --> 41:06.873
ki (that) their brains are not alright.

41:07.074 --> 41:11.766
So I think Sahasrara also must be spoilt
with drinking.

41:11.967 --> 41:15.279
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.149
And if you could find anybody drinking,

41:18.350 --> 41:23.017
if you could help that man to give up
drinking itself, it will work out.

41:23.218 --> 41:28.214
Of course, we have other enemies also,
like false gurus are there.

41:28.415 --> 41:33.388
Also we have other enemies who are having

41:33.589 --> 41:40.403
some sort of religious manipulations, but
that’s not so important.

41:40.604 --> 41:44.064
If you can get hold of people who are
drinking,

41:44.265 --> 41:46.452
I tell you it will change.

41:46.653 --> 41:51.075
And they will now understand that what they
have been doing so far,

41:51.276 --> 41:55.635
drinking, running away – now they’ll come
to the fields,

41:55.836 --> 41:58.371
and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

41:58.572 --> 42:04.144
So you are like very gentle soldiers
of love,

42:04.345 --> 42:08.899
and that’s what you have to spread and talk
to others,

42:09.100 --> 42:11.426
give them that joy that you have.

42:11.627 --> 42:17.035
Not [to] be satisfied if you have got it
only or [a] few of you have it.

42:17.236 --> 42:20.039
You have to spread it very fast, and you
can do it.

42:20.240 --> 42:24.448
Because it doesn’t require money, it
doesn’t require any show,

42:24.649 --> 42:28.019
it is just inside it works. It’s already
there,

42:28.220 --> 42:31.935
it’s present there, everybody has it.
I knew all that.

42:32.136 --> 42:35.311
Of course, I knew it. But now you also
know it,

42:35.512 --> 42:39.226
so you should work it out, and work it out
in a manner

42:39.427 --> 42:45.321
that I am sure one day this world will be
a changed place.

42:45.522 --> 42:48.406
Thank you very much.
