WEBVTT

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.540
I welcome
all of you from abroad, and this Kolhapur

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:22.800
is regarded as one of the deities’ temple,
which have three-and-a-half deities, or you

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:30.820
can say three-and-a-half coils of the Kundalini,
so it is said that, in this triangular bone

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:43.930
of Maharashtra - because it is surrounded
by, on all three sides by mountains, and the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:56.120
plateau is in the center so the all the three
sides make a nice triangle - is the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:10.769
Kundalini of the whole universe, of the whole
world, is expressed by Mother Earth in Maharashtra.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:17.549
These are three-and-a-half energies, which
are coiled together.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.839
The first one is of Mahakali.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:36.570
This Mahakali power is expressed in Tuljapur
as Bhavani, and Shivaji Maharaj used to come

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:45.350
on a horse all the way for miles together,
to get the darshan of this Bhavani at Tuljapur:

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:53.839
he knew this; and he had a sword which was
called as Bhavani talwar, and people said

00:01:53.839 --> 00:02:02.359
that the Goddess Herself has given this sword
to him.

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:08.770
Now the second one is Mahasaraswati, is at
Mahurgadh.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:22.570
We always sing Mahurgadawari song, that is
the one is Mahasaraswati, which is

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.469
also called as Renuka Devi, that’s the right-sided
Mahasaraswati.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:36.529
Then the third one is Mahalakshmi, that is
at Kolhapur.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:50.309
Here a very bad demon called Kolasur was killed
by the Mother, so this place is specially

00:02:50.309 --> 00:03:01.999
very holy for all of us; because you got your
Realization as the Kundalini went through

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:10.120
your Sushumna nadi, which is being nourished
by Mahalakshmi principle.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.700
So in the Temple they sit down - it’s a
Mahalakshmi’s Temple, but they sing that:

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.279
“Oh Ambe, please rise, please rise, please
rise.”

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:32.279
This comes with the full understanding of
the Sushumna nadi, but ninety-nine-point-nine

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:43.570
percent people don’t know, because all the
knowledge about Shakti is being lost due to

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.139
the different timings, and people never worried
about it.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:04:16.820
So, one has to realize that in Indian shastras,
scriptures, Shakti is the most important thing.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:31.210
It is to be understood why: because, say now,
if you have a light or if you have fire, what

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.940
is the power of fire?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.080
The power of fire can be that it can give
you light, it can burn away things, but supposing

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.020
it does not have its power, then who’ll
care for fire?

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.850
Nothing.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:05:03.770
So anybody who hasn’t got the power of being
the Spirit, it is useless.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:13.200
So this power, this Shakti, has to be awakened
within us, because we do not have the power

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.370
of the Spirit.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.460
We have to have the power of the Spirit.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.880
That’s only possible if you get your Self
Realization.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.400
That is the reason it is very important that
we should pay attention to our power.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.370
Now this power is made as the power of a Mother.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:45.440
Mother is the most loving relationship, and
through that relationship all the love is

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.580
expressed.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:06:00.260
That is why the Shakti is that of a Mother,
and the affection, the love, the patience

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.920
that Mother has for Her children, the Shakti
too has the same powers, you see, and that

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.560
is how this Shakti never can harm you.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:21.920
Out of all these Shaktis, all these powers,
highest of all is what we call as the Kundalini,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.890
because without Her you cannot get Realization.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.190
But also we can say, higher than that, or
complementary to that, is Mahalakshmi power.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.950
Without the Mahalakshmi you cannot rise.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.170
This is the ladder through which this power
of Kundalini can rise.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:51.340
So both the powers are very important and
very much related to each other.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.990
Mahalakshmi principle starts when we have
finished with Lakshmi principle.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.250
Like in the West, people are fed up with affluence,
fed up with all the riches and all that, so

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.281
they are thinking: “What have we achieved?

00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:08.070
We have gone into imbalances, so what should
we do?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.140
We have to balance ourselves.”

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.780
So how do we balance ourselves?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.910
We have to have the knowledge of the Spirit.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.700
That is called as aadhyatma.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.630
You have to know what is the knowledge of
the Spirit, and to know the knowledge of the

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:30.480
Spirit Kundalini has to be awakened, and that
you are to be connected to this all-pervading

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.280
Power.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:44.560
Once that happens, you just become one with
that energy and you get transformation within

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:51.770
yourself, because there is light and in the
light you can see all your problems, all your

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:57.040
defects; and also if you know how to correct
it, is the easiest thing to do is to get transformation

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.600
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.950
All of you have been very much transformed,
and now I find it difficult even to recognize

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:10.610
you, because all your faces are changed, your
attitudes are changed, you look so different,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.550
so beautiful.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:27.100
Today it seems to be a special day for Me,
here in Mahalakshmi Temple, that Mahalakshmi

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:35.710
is being awakened, and I’m feeling really
in that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:43.180
I don’t know how I’m talking; and I am
merged just in the meditative mood, absolutely

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.470
into meditative mood.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:54.220
Because when you are in the center you don’t
think, you are in meditation.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.210
That is why Mahalakshmi is very important.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:07.830
So when you are fed up, you can feel there’s
something missing, and then you take to Mahalakshmi

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.260
principle.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.970
But in India because of so many saints, we
feel that we should short-circuit it.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:27.140
First let us develop our own aadhyatma, let
us develop our knowledge of atma and then

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:34.270
take to science, so there is no more imbalance
within us; because without the foundation

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:41.110
of aadhyatma, knowledge of the Spirit, you
take to any kind of progress, you can topple

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.110
down.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:48.940
That’s why all the Western entrepreneurs,
enterprises and also projections of religion

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.620
have gone to waste, because there has been
no balance.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.130
It is important that we must have the balance
within ourselves.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:10.020
Now in India we have people who have this
idea, at least that you have to rise higher

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:20.990
than materialism and that you have to become
one with the Virata, part and parcel of the

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.990
whole.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.890
This they know, and that’s what, by knowing
that, once they get to Sahaja Yoga, they grow

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:35.600
very deeply; the depth, the depth they have
achieved with this faith, that we have to

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.460
be self-realized, and that we have to feel
the all-pervading Power.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.510
This conviction itself gives them the depth
and so when they achieve Realization, they

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.230
just go down very deep.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:58.190
But most surprising, people who have never
heard about Ganesha, who have never heard

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:05.440
about Kolhapur, have never heard about Mahalakshmi
are sometimes much, much better, much more

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.030
deeper than the people who know all these
things by heart.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:20.730
So one can deduct that those who know outwardly,
those who know through their books, or through

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:26.920
some gurus who teach them something, are absolutely
outside.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:38.650
They have nothing in them to tell us because
they have had no experience of the Self, no

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.680
experience of the Self.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:51.170
That’s only possible when your Kundalini
rises and breaks your Brahmarandra.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:57.539
That is the time the first experience comes
to you of this all-pervading Power.

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:06.800
So all those people who have been only just
praying to Mahalakshmi, have been going to

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:16.120
Her, doing a lot of penances, fasting, this,
that, have no idea as to what Mahalakshmi

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:22.990
wants, and they always complain to Me: “Mother,
we have done this, we have done that.”

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.200
People are very religious.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:30.010
They are doing all kinds of ritualism, what
we call as karmakanda, but with that you do

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:35.010
not reach where you have to reach.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:42.910
So one has to understand that whatever has
been written and told about all these great

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:52.130
things in India, people may know in words,
but in experience they do not know.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:58.390
So Sahaja Yoga is very important to give them
this experience, so that they can really verify

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:10.720
whatever is said in the science of spirituality
about getting Realization, is absolutely true.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.849
Not only that but it’s very practical, and
every person who gets Realization can understand

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:21.800
it very well.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.000
So we are here in a very holy place, full
of unholy people.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:39.210
But still there are some very, very good people
here also, and because of Mahalakshmi, they

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:48.730
make very good ornaments because these ornaments
are offered to the Goddess.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:59.250
You can feel there a kind of a subdued feeling
for God, feeling for spirituality, but they

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:06.700
do not have the experience that you have got,
so you are much higher than all of them.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.800
And those who have the experience can feel
more, once they go to the Temple, if you can

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:17.450
go to the Temple to see the place also; but
give yourself a big bandhan because I have

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.680
seen it, next to the deity there are very
funny people sitting.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.710
They’re doing all kinds of commercial activities.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.250
They are selling flowers, they are selling
this, selling everything.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.980
So you have to be careful, with a bandhan
you can go and see for yourself.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:43.590
Now they say that this Temple is made because
it’s a swayambhu – it’s the one that

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:51.320
has come out of Mother Earth – you can see
yourself if there are vibrations and moreover,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:59.050
you must know that this puja of these deities
are done by people who are not at all in any

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:05.980
way religious, but are just commercial people.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:15.770
Commercialism can never give you any satisfaction,
can never give you at all any satisfaction.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:26.800
Apart from that it can take you to something
unknown, of dangerous shores.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:38.880
But if your faith is pure, without any greed,
without any demands, then you develop your

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:48.150
depth within yourself; which is very helpful
after Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:16:01.230
It’s a remarkable thing how this Shri Chakra
is here and how they have made the complete

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.250
calculation of Shri Chakra.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:14.390
I met a scientist in Russia, in Moscow, who
has done a research, very much big research

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.810
on this Shri Chakra.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:23.460
Now, so we have Shri Chakra on the right side,
on the left-hand side we have Lalita Chakra,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:36.120
so all the things that we do with hands after
Realization are worked through, on the right-hand

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.370
side Shri Chakra, on the left-hand side Lalita
Chakra.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:47.930
Now how it works is a very complicated thing,
but we don’t have to worry about that.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:54.390
As soon as you put your hand on somebody,
the chakra knows how to work it out.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:02.659
It works by itself, as if it is a built-in
mechanism within us, which knows what sort

00:17:02.659 --> 00:17:08.319
of vibrations to be given to a particular
person for a particular cause, or a particular

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.620
purpose.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:19.049
If that person has certain defects also, these
chakras know what is to be emitted, how to

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:21.069
work it out.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:31.059
So it is not that we have the Kundalini awakening
only, these chakras are awakened, we also

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:36.919
have these two chakras awakened within us
because of Kundalini.

00:17:36.919 --> 00:17:42.809
But if you have Vishuddi problem, then you
can find that your hands are stiff and you

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:57.049
cannot feel guidance, or you can say, the
Divine intentions of Realization; because

00:17:57.049 --> 00:18:01.309
when you start using your hands you don’t
feel any vibrations, so how will you know

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:02.549
what’s happening?

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:09.920
It’s a very complicated thing, and for that
complicated thing these instruments are made

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.319
already, are prepared already; they are quite
equipped with all the knowledge that is necessary,

00:18:16.319 --> 00:18:23.889
like a feedback as you call it, or we can
call it a complete programming is there.

00:18:23.889 --> 00:18:31.549
So as soon as you put your hand on a person,
the programming starts working it out.

00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:38.200
Because it is programming is done by God Almighty,
it can never be wrong.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:51.439
It cannot be two different things, as far
as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:18:51.439 --> 00:19:04.740
I have been thinking about writing about all
these big, big peethas that are in India,

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:12.600
so it will be helpful to you as well as to
others in India.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:20.019
But here the atmosphere is so bad, as if to
think of God, to talk of God is absolutely

00:19:20.019 --> 00:19:23.850
wrong, you cannot say.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:32.899
The people are in illusion, and they think
that all these talks has brought us nothing.

00:19:32.899 --> 00:19:47.500
To them it is the progress of the West is
more effective, more apparent, that they can

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:55.480
see how you have progressed in materialism,
and they can’t understand how we could progress

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:08.299
with aadhyatma very much in the area of physical
development or mental development.

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:15.210
So now we come to a point where we realize
that it is very important for all the Western

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:22.340
people to have the foundation of aadhyatma.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:31.889
For that it is important to give up some of
your conditionings, because this knowledge

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:35.399
is coming definitely from India.

00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:40.960
I mean the Indians had all the knowledge of
your medical science, this science, that science,

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960
that science.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:52.450
But God’s science is in India, and for that,
what are you going to do?

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:58.789
When the question of God’s science is concerned,
what are you going to do about it?

00:20:58.789 --> 00:21:05.529
How are you going to work it out, that this
is the science of God, and the God’s science

00:21:05.529 --> 00:21:15.960
has to be understood with full dedication
and devotion?

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:23.769
Because of the conditioning of the Western
influence, the Western progress, sometimes

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:33.559
we just do not know how to grasp this knowledge
within ourselves; very difficult.

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:41.010
But if you can understand that, as for science
we had to accept it fully from the West, you

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:50.510
have to accept the knowledge of your Spirit
from the East, East has the knowledge of the

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:56.730
Spirit: for that you have to be ready to receive
it.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:02.220
But if you are still in your arrogance, if
you are still in your own conditionings, then

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.340
you cannot do it.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:13.639
Like a boy who comes from a village, who has
never known about science, and you suddenly

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:17.669
put him in a science college, he’ll say:
“What is this nonsense, what’s all this

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:18.669
all?

00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:19.799
I have never known these things.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:23.559
Why should I use a test tube, why should I
go in the laboratory?”

00:22:23.559 --> 00:22:29.620
All kinds of things he can start saying, and
this conditioning is there.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:34.929
Then he’ll run away from school within one
year or two year, maybe earlier, and that

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:48.419
is what I find is their conditioning, which
turns away many people from Sahaja Yoga after

00:22:48.419 --> 00:22:51.639
some time.

00:22:51.639 --> 00:22:56.429
So we must watch our conditionings, what sort
of conditionings we have; while the Indians

00:22:56.429 --> 00:23:03.249
have conditionings of so-called religious
beliefs and this ritualism, this, that, they

00:23:03.249 --> 00:23:06.929
are very much conditioned also.

00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:12.429
But is easy to overcome that when you realize
that whatever your worship: for example, in

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:21.309
India everybody has a kuladevata, means the
family’s goddess, everybody has; they must

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:25.549
worship that goddess, particular goddess,
everybody has.

00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:33.619
So they have to, if they just ask: “Mother,
are You that Goddess?” the vibrations start

00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:34.619
flowing.

00:23:34.619 --> 00:23:53.029
So the conditioning gets very easily eradicated,
but the mental acceptance of something is

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:55.549
very difficult to go.

00:23:55.549 --> 00:24:03.179
And I’ve seen also when they get married
or marriage is arranged, they go mental.

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:04.179
They go mental.

00:24:04.179 --> 00:24:12.319
If you go mental, then you cannot understand
many things.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:15.569
But if you are spiritual, then you can understand.

00:24:15.569 --> 00:24:20.659
For example, we see Mother Earth giving us
these flowers and all that, how can we go

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:21.659
mental about it?

00:24:21.659 --> 00:24:22.659
It’s a living process.

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:26.019
For any living process we cannot get mental.

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:30.490
So now you will say: “All right, this is
because of seed has got this, and the seed

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:34.159
is planted”; but how, why?

00:24:34.159 --> 00:24:36.269
That you can’t answer, can never answer.

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:37.639
Then you’ll keep quiet.

00:24:37.639 --> 00:24:44.619
But say if there’s a sage, he’ll say:
“All right, this is Mother Earth, She wants

00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:53.360
to give to Her children, these flowers, fruits,
these trees, so She’s working it out.”

00:24:53.360 --> 00:25:01.939
So one has to jump from one conditioning of
materialism.

00:25:01.939 --> 00:25:07.710
Now you should see in matter, energy never
moves.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:12.909
Energy is stationary, it never moves.

00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:20.649
And also energies which are moving, so-called,
like electricity, this, that, are absolutely

00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:22.129
blind.

00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:26.910
Supposing there is electricity here flowing,
all right, well and good, but supposing somebody

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.470
stops it, it will stop.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.409
It has no mind, it is a mindless thing.

00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:36.749
So in materialism you become mindless.

00:25:36.749 --> 00:25:41.760
You start seeing also that within yourself,
that you have become mindless; and becoming

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:53.059
absolutely, absolutely, I should say, like
robots sometimes, which is mindless, which

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:56.400
is fixed, fixed quantity.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.659
And I see very much clearly, in the West I’ve
seen, that people have very fixed ideas.

00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:09.189
It’s difficult for them to get out of it
because they don’t have that movement towards

00:26:09.189 --> 00:26:21.630
the spiritual subtlety, where one can use
the mind to do something.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.419
We would say that Mother Earth has got the
mind.

00:26:25.419 --> 00:26:30.140
Now that nobody can believe in the West, except
for Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:37.319
That the Mother Earth produces these vigrahas,
She produces these deities, nobody will believe.

00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:42.860
How can you believe such a thing, that this
Mother Earth thinks, that this Mother Earth

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.139
produces these things?

00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:48.149
But logically you can see, logically.

00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:49.149
Logically.

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:57.230
Say a tree has a certain height, the fruits
have a certain shape, certain colors, flowers

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:02.960
same: who changes all the seasons, specially
in India is very clear-cut six seasons?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:09.660
It’s called as Ritambhara pragya in the
Hatha Yoga.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:17.110
Now that is the One which is a Lady, which
thinks.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:25.970
She has a mind of Her own, She decides and
She works out everything.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:36.080
This concept was doubly denied in the West,
is first is that they cannot accept a Goddess.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.259
Woman has no part.

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:46.259
Right from Socrates onward, nobody has talked
much about a Woman, except of course there

00:27:46.259 --> 00:27:50.950
is Athena and all that, but it’s very minor
roles they have.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:59.620
Greeks had goddesses who were just like human
beings, so that also gets ruled out, and very

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.759
little was accepted; and when Christianity
came, somehow or other Christians saw to it

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:09.539
that there should be no mention of the Mother
in any way.

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:12.631
But despite that, people worshipped the Mother.

00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:17.710
They worshipped the Mother of Christ as, some
like a Goddess; though in the Bible She’s

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:27.239
talked as a “woman”, in a very derogatory
style She’s addressed.

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:37.029
So the conditioning of people is about the
power of God who hangs somewhere in the air,

00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:48.049
that He’s there and that He gives us everything;
but what is the communication?

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:52.179
What is the justification or what is the logical
thing, how to explain?

00:28:52.179 --> 00:28:54.100
So you have to say: “It is a mystery.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.429
God is a mystery.

00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:57.110
He hangs somewhere in the air.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.110
He does everything.”

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.049
And how can people believe in it?

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:07.009
So the Christian conditioning has been even
worse than, I think, Jew conditioning because

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:11.009
they just took it out, Christ’s Mother,
away; though the painters, artists wouldn’t

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:15.450
do that, they wouldn’t accept: they had
the Mother there.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.353
But despite all that, the Motherhood has not
been respected that should have been, in the

00:29:20.353 --> 00:29:30.179
Bible, which is a very wrong thing, while
Mahalakshmi Herself incarnated as Mother Mary

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:31.179
Herself.

00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:37.439
And to say about Mahalakshmi as “a woman”,
I think is a great insult.

00:29:37.439 --> 00:29:43.249
And where women are insulted like this, where
the Goddesses are insulted, we cannot expect

00:29:43.249 --> 00:29:51.980
any spiritual growth unless and until you
accept that it’s the Shakti, is the Motherhood,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:30:02.080
who is the only thing that’s the communication
between us and the Divinity.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:08.120
So this conditioning, Christian conditioning
has to go out, as far as the Motherhood is

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.120
concerned.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:16.200
It’s very surprising sometimes when I see
how these people have tried to bring down

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:23.080
the level of a Goddess to just a woman.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:31.139
So this is a very big blessing in India, that
they respect Mother as the Shakti, and that

00:30:31.139 --> 00:30:37.200
the whole thing is done by the movement of
the Shakti, by the thinking of the Shakti,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.600
by the coordination and the understanding
and the planning of the Shakti only.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:48.379
It’s not done by God Almighty, He’s just
a spectator.

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.489
She does everything.

00:30:50.489 --> 00:30:57.549
Once that concept can fit into your heads
properly, then you will see so many conditionings

00:30:57.549 --> 00:31:04.009
will drop out; because religion was organized,
and in an organized religion you can put whatever

00:31:04.009 --> 00:31:08.019
you like, the way you want to put it, and
it was such a big mistake.

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:20.759
By that people developed a lot of ego, lot
of things against women, and also the first

00:31:20.759 --> 00:31:28.110
sin they call the “original sin” and all
that is because of a woman, they really ill-treated

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:32.439
women and they have no respect for them.

00:31:32.439 --> 00:31:38.520
So the women have changed their role, and
instead of becoming mothers and goddesses,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:45.359
they have tried to become something like actresses.

00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:54.539
But you can understand that without the power
there is no sense in anything, and this is

00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:59.749
the power of Love and this is the power of
Truth.

00:31:59.749 --> 00:32:10.149
And once you get that power we should humble
down, and know that this power is within us,

00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:16.519
which has given us all this knowledge, which
has given us all this ability to raise the

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:17.799
Kundalini.

00:32:17.799 --> 00:32:21.960
All this is because of energy within us, the
Shakti within us.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.041
Without that we are nothing.

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:34.189
And that too is the Mother who has done it.

00:32:34.189 --> 00:32:45.429
I do not know how much to press this point,
but it’s important; because I find, specially

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:53.580
in England some newspaper people came: “How
do you feel as a guru, as a woman?”

00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:03.970
I mean, it’s a kind of a thing, “a woman”,
as if I am sort of a, that movement where

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:09.169
women are starting a fight with the men, sort
of a thing, and now: “This is another guru

00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:14.289
who is a woman, so She should be supported,”
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

00:33:14.289 --> 00:33:19.750
It’s the only the Mother who does this job,
so there’s no question of asking such a

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.929
question.

00:33:22.929 --> 00:33:30.489
But that’s what it is, that we should first
know that it’s the feminine quality of a

00:33:30.489 --> 00:33:40.129
woman as a mother, is very powerful.

00:33:40.129 --> 00:33:49.710
But we should encourage it and try to develop
it, so that spiritually you can communicate,

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:55.970
spiritually you can imbibe these qualities
for your own children.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:05.419
The mothers who do not have aadhyatma can
never develop good children with proper emotions,

00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:15.700
with proper value system of morality.

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:23.710
So it is very important for every mother to
be very proud that they are mothers, and for

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:29.280
girls who are going to be mothers to be very
proud that they are going to be mothers, and

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.799
that they represent the Shakti.

00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:40.839
So now then, what is the part of the men is
to take full advantage of that power, by understanding

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:46.990
it, by complementing, by looking after that
power.

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.490
I’m not talking only about your wives.

00:34:49.490 --> 00:35:00.760
I’m talking about your sisters, your daughters,
your mothers, and the whole society, where

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.600
women are to be respected, and they have to
be respectable.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:12.109
And women should try to be respectable, to
try to know that they are the powers and they

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:17.410
are the ones who will be used by this Divine
power as channels, more than men.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:24.330
But if they are useless, then of course they
wouldn’t bother about them, they would like

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.760
to bother then about men, much more than what
you are.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.089
So it is important to understand what is your
role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:33.089 --> 00:35:34.970
This is your role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.010
And I am sure you can work it out.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.890
You can manage this part.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:48.030
You can equip yourself for this role, which
is so beautiful and so good.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:54.579
So much can be said about Mahalakshmi, and
there’s no end to it, but I think later

00:35:54.579 --> 00:36:00.280
on we should keep this program on every year,
and you all should come to Mahalakshmi Temple

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:06.980
here, to the, I mean the Kolhapur, and then
I’ll again tell you all about the Mother’s

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.030
qualities, what She is as Mahalakshmi.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:19.180
And today we’ll have the Shri Sukta.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:28.579
Shri Sukta is about Mahalakshmi’s qualities.

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:34.579
I think we’ll have Ganesha Stuthi and then
we’ll have this.

00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:39.379
So seriously you must understand what is it…

00:36:39.379 --> 00:37:01.230
I’m just in meditative mood today, I don’t
know what I’m talking; because this Mahalakshmi

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:07.050
is a thing that goes, finishes everything
else.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.840
Left, right is finished now, you are just
in Mahalakshmi state: what to do?

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:18.710
“Mahalakshmi state” means nirvichar, nirvikalp,
beyond that, I don’t know what stages it

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:19.710
is.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.480
It comes down a little bit, then again it
goes back to

00:37:22.509 --> 00:37:23.509
the same.

00:37:27.279 --> 00:37:57.550
[End of English part of talk]
