00:04.307 --> 00:09.971
Today, I'm going to talk about the mind.

00:10.307 --> 00:14.262
People don't know what is this mind is.

00:14.463 --> 00:18.309
It is very easy to understand for Sahaja Yogis

00:18.510 --> 00:24.622
that we are the ones who react,

00:24.823 --> 00:30.487
react to everything that is outside.

00:31.690 --> 00:37.348
The reason is we have two horrible tendencies,

00:37.549 --> 00:40.879
one which is an ego,

00:41.080 --> 00:46.137
and another tendency is that

00:46.338 --> 00:52.285
we are being trained that way,

00:52.486 --> 00:56.621
or we can call it the superego or the conditionings.

00:56.822 --> 01:00.793
So, both the things, our ego and conditionings,

01:00.994 --> 01:04.543
are all the time acting outside.

01:04.744 --> 01:08.172
This reaction, which is built-in within us,

01:08.373 --> 01:13.219
is just like bubbles in the ocean.

01:13.420 --> 01:18.883
And these bubbles keep us away from reality.

01:19.084 --> 01:21.266
These bubbles are of thoughts,

01:21.467 --> 01:25.368
and they just blast you all the time in your head,

01:25.569 --> 01:28.204
and you don't know why they are coming.

01:28.405 --> 01:32.845
When you depend on this artificial mind of yours

01:33.046 --> 01:35.283
then you have no discretion

01:35.484 --> 01:39.877
as to understand what is good and what is bad.

01:40.078 --> 01:45.822
This mind is the one where all kinds of evil things start,

01:46.023 --> 01:51.595
all kinds of quarrels, fights and possessiveness,

01:51.796 --> 01:54.712
lastly the war also comes there.

01:54.913 --> 02:01.204
It is in this mind only, which is nothing but a myth,

02:01.405 --> 02:06.892
all these concrete, destructive ideas,

02:07.093 --> 02:10.689
somehow or other come up,

02:10.890 --> 02:14.775
and then they start growing and growing.

02:14.976 --> 02:19.041
Then you find people whom you can impress also,

02:19.242 --> 02:24.221
put ideas into their heads - by reading,

02:24.422 --> 02:27.784
they learn, or by their lectures, or by mesmerism,

02:27.985 --> 02:30.097
whatever kinds of things they can do.

02:30.298 --> 02:33.081
They put your mind into such a frame

02:33.282 --> 02:38.151
that you accept these destructive ideas,

02:38.352 --> 02:43.057
for yourself individually, or maybe for the collective.

02:43.258 --> 02:46.073
So this mind is just a myth

02:46.274 --> 02:50.198
and we are working through this mind.

02:50.399 --> 02:54.065
We are all the time satisfying ourselves by saying,

02:54.266 --> 02:58.674
“Oh, that's my mind, my mind wants it.”

02:58.875 --> 03:05.979
You see, like one Indian Sahaja Yogi went to America,

03:06.203 --> 03:09.416
and he told Me that, “Americans are maneuvering.”

03:09.617 --> 03:12.885
Maneuver means they are mad after their mind.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.086
I said, “What do you mean?” He said,

03:15.287 --> 03:19.766
“I gave money to my wife to buy one bush shirt for me.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.719
She went and bought some skirts.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.266
And she has many skirts, but she bought some skirts.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.180
So I asked her, 'Why did you buy the skirts?'

03:29.381 --> 03:32.039
So she said, 'My mind said that,

03:32.240 --> 03:35.469
"you should buy the skirts", so I bought skirts’.”

03:35.670 --> 03:39.472
So, this is what it is, that the mind

03:39.673 --> 03:42.386
can take you to all kinds of wrong things

03:42.587 --> 03:46.003
because it has no connection with reality, firstly,

03:46.204 --> 03:52.597
and secondly it is a mythical thing,

03:52.798 --> 03:55.956
absolutely mythical.

03:56.157 --> 03:58.848
You see, people think that whatever they have created,

03:59.049 --> 04:04.207
it is out of their mind. Is a wrong idea, absolutely wrong idea.

04:04.408 --> 04:08.146
All great scientists, say - Einstein has said that,

04:08.347 --> 04:14.826
“I was tired trying to find out the Theory of Relativity,

04:15.027 --> 04:18.159
very tired.” He had some concept,

04:18.360 --> 04:21.175
like all scientists take up some sort of a concept,

04:21.376 --> 04:24.159
and they tried to build up their research on that,

04:24.360 --> 04:29.136
“And then I thought, it’s a wrong concept that I have taken up.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.136
Suddenly”, he said, “I went into the garden,

04:32.337 --> 04:37.058
I said let’s try and play with the soap bubbles.”

04:37.259 --> 04:40.175
He was playing with the soap bubbles like a small child,

04:40.376 --> 04:45.527
“and suddenly, from somewhere unknown”, he says,

04:45.728 --> 04:50.980
the Theory of Relativity dawned upon him.

04:51.181 --> 04:53.181
Many scientists have said that -

04:53.382 --> 04:57.189
that they don't know from where they get this idea.

04:57.390 --> 05:01.962
From where did they get it? It has a special study now

05:02.163 --> 05:04.163
people are doing to find out

05:04.364 --> 05:07.226
how these scientists got these things.

05:07.427 --> 05:09.968
And in a very Sahaj manner,

05:10.169 --> 05:13.273
even the way penicillin was discovered,

05:13.474 --> 05:16.421
or anything was discovered by these people,

05:16.622 --> 05:21.054
was not through the probing or manipulation of the mind,

05:21.255 --> 05:25.421
but through some unknown force it came into their mind,

05:25.622 --> 05:28.211
and that's what they thought, that

05:28.412 --> 05:31.195
this was from their mind, some, some.

05:31.396 --> 05:33.898
But most of them realized, even Newton realized

05:34.099 --> 05:36.906
that, “It is coming from something,

05:37.107 --> 05:39.562
some source which I am not aware of.”

05:39.763 --> 05:44.984
As Sahaja Yogis you know it is the Source of the Divine Power,

05:45.185 --> 05:49.148
which is all-pervading, the Paramchaitanya.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.687
You know, because you can feel it, you know it is there.

05:52.888 --> 05:56.914
But, even when you know, you must know you have to go

05:57.115 --> 06:01.414
beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness, minimum.

06:01.615 --> 06:03.922
Always I tell you, “Meditate, meditate”,

06:04.123 --> 06:07.094
because you should be in thoughtless awareness,

06:07.295 --> 06:10.094
where you do not react.

06:10.295 --> 06:12.547
So, what happens, you become a witness,

06:12.748 --> 06:16.390
you become the witness of the whole drama, of the whole scene,

06:16.591 --> 06:21.242
and you are absolutely at ease with yourself, no problem.

06:21.443 --> 06:24.953
And what you are doing that you become an instrument

06:25.154 --> 06:28.320
of this Paramachaitanya, of this all-pervading power.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.875
You are just watching, you are a witness,

06:31.076 --> 06:33.641
and as watching everything,

06:33.842 --> 06:39.969
you realize that whatever you watch cannot react on you.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.696
But you know what it is,

06:42.777 --> 06:46.482
and this is what is the state in which you understand

06:46.563 --> 06:49.815
the reality of the whole situation.
