1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It's not in the newspaper, simply.

2
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So you see, I want to explain a trick.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is that now, even in the West, you have humans who have boyfriend, girlfriend.

4
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Like they test the material before deciding whether to marry.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So they think it is chastity, because I love this boy, I want to marry him.

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So if I sleep with him before marriage, it's okay, because he's going to be my husband.

7
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So there is a spiritual trick which is missed.

8
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Because, you see, when such marriage is blessed by the diva.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So if you have sex before and marriage after, you don't have the full combination for the full blast.

10
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You will have sex, you may be happy, but you will not know what you miss.

11
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So if you have sex before and marriage after, you will not know what you miss.

12
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So if you have sex before and marriage after, you will not know what you miss.

13
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Do you think that you will be able to achieve the fullness of marriage?

14
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
No, it's about the depth of the union that you will be able to achieve.

15
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
See, if you discover everything together, you are married, you are blessed,

16
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and then you have the normal dharmic behavior in marriage, which includes sex,

17
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because it's the only place where it is dharmic, then it is good.

18
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
When you discover that after marriage, then you get the blessings.

19
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, what are the blessings?

20
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You see, it's not just that you are going to have better sex, I'm not speaking about that.

21
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's that, you see, a marriage which works is a marriage where each day you give energy to each other.

22
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A marriage which does not work is a marriage where each day you suck energy from the other.

23
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Last time I gave you the example of the sea and the earth, do you remember?

24
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Do you remember? No?

25
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I said, okay, I said, okay, you see the sea, right? You're on the beach.

26
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And you see the sun, and there is one wave, and there is another wave, and it's always the same.

27
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
You are not bored.

28
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You can look at one wave at another wave and you can use it as your joy, it's not boring.

29
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So, you see, a such marriage is like the sea and the earth.

30
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Like man is the ocean and woman is the earth.

31
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And there is this rapport and it's repetitive that it's never boring.

32
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Although it is every day the same, like one wave after the other wave, it is not boring.

33
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000
You wake up in the morning after 40 years of marriage and you look at your wife and you are so happy that she is here.

34
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And vice versa. Because vice versa is to work.

35
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Now, how are you going to achieve this? You can't. You can't achieve it. Translate.

36
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It is a blessing. It is a blessing.

37
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And so, if we want the blessings of Sri Ganesha, we need to understand it.

38
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yes, sir?

39
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Shri Mataji said that we can marriage with no sahaja yogis. What about this situation?

40
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
You can. You can.

41
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And what about blessings within you? What's the difference between sahaja marriage and between marriage with no sahaja?

42
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
What is not allowed in sahaja is that if you meet a girl here, there is no her. And vice versa.

43
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Because you meet the brother and sister relationship and the man and man relationship.

44
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yes, sir. That's very good. Andres said that he is going to marry a non-yogi and he will marry a non-yogi. That's very good.

45
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
He is not allowed to marry a non-yogi. This is not the right thing.

46
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:31.000
If you marry a non-yogi, I give you the reason why it is okay and why the sahaja marriage is better. I give you the reason.

47
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I have a question. I think that we have to have a very good relationship with the sahaja marriage.

48
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.000
If you have a sahaja marriage, you have the same understanding of the value of spirituality in your life. So if you evolve spiritually, you can share this.

49
00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:13.000
If you marry outside of sahaja, it can work like this. But it's a risk because you don't know. Right?

50
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So that's a big difference. And you see, mother wants people to be happy. So there are many more girls than men, many collectivities.

51
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So if the girl can only marry a yogi, many girls will not be married.

52
00:08:48.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So you can find your husband outside of sahaja. And if you do it with the right attitude, somehow it works.

53
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:13.000
You don't behave like a she-woman. But if you do it with some dignity and you find somebody, you are going to be blessed equally because the Divine understands everything.

54
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I want to explain another little bit. Chastity is for the man and the woman. It's not only for the woman. By the way, we are not wrestling with it.

55
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:06.000
If a woman arrives, she is to her marriage and she has not slept with her husband before marriage, then you can say a womb is like a protected house.

56
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Now, when you get a child, how do you know or how can you know who is the child coming in your womb?

57
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:52.000
When you get pregnant, maybe you get a child who will make you happy, maybe you will get a child who will make you very unhappy.

58
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Who makes a difference? Who?

59
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Who is the one who does the traffic control? Who goes to this mother, who goes to this mother? Someone is doing the traffic control.

60
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So, if you have a nice house, protected, clean, you will give the best child.

61
00:11:39.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's not relevant to tell me, but I would also ask as men, please, what do you do if you do fall in love, within your connection with someone and you are fighting it? Anything ticked for that?

62
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
No, but not, because it happens.

63
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:25.000
She said, the fire who cooks your food can also burn your heart.

64
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
When you are young, falling in love is very powerful.

65
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:43.000
The first time I fell in love I was 16. I could not eat, I could not drink, I couldn't sleep.

66
00:12:43.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It was in Germany. Then I went to a place in the lake. Very romantic. And the girl wanted me to kiss her. You know what I did? I was too shy to kiss her.

67
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So I put my raincoat over her head. And I kissed her through the raincoat. And then I told her it was a French trick.

68
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So, you know, it's a very powerful energy, so you need to control it.

69
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Don't let yourself fall in love. Because if you watch, you know when it's happening. And you can stop it. If you let yourself fall in love, then it will be difficult to take it back and then you will be in contradiction with yourself.

70
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Because if you let yourself fall in love, then you will be in contradiction with yourself. And you will be in contradiction with yourself.

71
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It's not your first life. You have fallen in love thousands of times. You have thousands of children.

72
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So in this lifetime, little change. Become your own master. And then from there you will master the thing.

73
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay, please. I want to say what he says is true. Because he played a certain role in my marriage.

74
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And if he tells you this, I can tell you now, many years after, it is true.

75
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Because on the first of April 1981, you were not born then. On the first of April 1981. I was surfing, windsurfing. And when I came to the bank, I just looked at the pair of shoes.

76
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And when I looked up, I saw the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in a girl.

77
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It was not the first time. At some point we came together and we saw a few of them.

78
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And it's so happy that I was very well. I was the one who took care of Oscar at that time.

79
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And our relationship was something that we should not have in such a way.

80
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So he advised us, either you marry or you split.

81
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And he took conjugance with me. Now we take a leave of another 3 or 4 years, maybe 5 years.

82
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Many things happened in the same. And at that time, Shunalaji didn't know the name of it. All the yogis because they were too many.

83
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
But what happened, I was on the marriage list, she was lost.

84
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And although I would have liked her to be on the list, she was lost. I would have liked her to be on the list, but she was not.

85
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So I went to India. And there was an announcement of marriage.

86
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And I was announced to some Indian girl with a very dark picture which I couldn't make out.

87
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And she met her and said, do you like her? Do you marry? I said ok.

88
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So the wedding of Subkhanapati Puri came closer, the girl didn't show up.

89
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
And this girlfriend from then, her name is Sabina. But she was not in India.

90
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So one day before the wedding, Shrimadaji calls me on stage.

91
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And she says, you know this girl from India doesn't work out, she's a bit too small.

92
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But what about this Sabine from Austria? At that time she didn't know our names.

93
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
This erection was very strong.

94
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But then people told me, Shrimadaji, she's not here.

95
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
She said, bring her here.

96
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Then Shrimadaji came and said, bring her here.

97
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
And what came out, she had arrived about 10 minutes before all that happened in Anamatiki.

98
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So they brought her to the stage.

99
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.000
The rest is a long, long marriage. We had our ups and downs as you had in your marriage.

100
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
But whenever you have a down, you know that you went for the beauty.

101
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And there are three beautiful children or grown-ups now like you, maybe even older.

102
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And I have four grandchildren.

103
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Right.

104
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Okay.

105
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You can do what you want. You are so free.

106
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Try to benefit from our experience.

107
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
I have a question.

108
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
You said about transformation.

109
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Yes.

110
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Yes.

111
00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:03.000
As I understand, when we have problems, we should walk inside and everything will be okay.

112
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
No. You go inside, you will be okay.

113
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
First week.

114
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
First week.

115
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Perhaps everything will be okay, secondly. But not always.

116
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Yes.

117
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:27.000
And maybe many yoga and yoga too don't feel when they have transformation.

118
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
So they think that they have it but they don't.

119
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
But they don't.

120
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Yes. It's a very, very good question. It's a good question.

121
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You can make the difference through introspection.

122
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
In the beginning, Sahaja Yogi think that they are Sahaja Yogi.

123
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
In the beginning, Sahaja Yogi think that they are Sahaja Yogi.

124
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Because they got the certificate.

125
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
You got your realization, you are Sahaja Yogi.

126
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
But then you have to become what is written on the certificate.

127
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Okay. And introspection is if you are honest with yourself.

128
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Can you feel total awareness?

129
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Okay. So when you are in total awareness, you are connected.

130
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
How much total awareness do you need a day?

131
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
So this is what we need to do.

132
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
The solution is always try to go into total awareness.

133
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000
When you are seeking that from, when you walk in the street, you know, just try to go into total awareness.

134
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Can I ask you? How long during the day you are in this request for awareness?

135
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
What did she say?

136
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
What was her answer?

137
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Yes.

138
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
No, she said, right? That was your answer.

139
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yes. My answer is the same.

140
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
My answer is the same.

141
00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000
You know how. For me it's the way when I introspect, it's how much do I react.

142
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Somebody tells me something I don't like, how much do I react.

143
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Can I keep smiling in my head? Not swallowing it. Not swallowing it down.

144
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
But how much am I able to just be completely without reaction?

145
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
That's my...

146
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Improspection. With introspection you can find it.

147
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
That's why I'm saying maybe I'm more experienced inside.

148
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
But if I'm honest with myself, these are the criteria I need. Am I reacting or not?

149
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Someone is saying a lie and someone say I am a thief and I am not a thief. Am I upset?

150
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
If I am upset I may not be a thief. You see?

151
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
It's things like that in life. So you look at yourself.

152
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Or you can even say how long are you upset?

153
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Or how long is I a thief?

154
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Or you can ask for how long time have I been a thief?

155
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
This is the sort of thing.

156
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And also the thought process.

157
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Am I thinking all the time?

158
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And when I say now stop, I want to stop thinking, still two minutes later the thought.

159
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
This is where you will judge yourself.

160
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
But without selfishness.

161
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
But it is from this point of view that I'm saying that we are still students.

162
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I am a student of sandwich before you.

163
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
That's all. I'm not a fool.

164
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Because on those things I feel for myself that I still do include.

165
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Because the standards are very high.

166
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So even though we are in a pretty good shape, it's not enough.

167
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
The standards are.

168
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I think you need to say something nice because I'm scaring them.

169
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
I'm coming back.

170
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
We were talking about the criteria.

171
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I was going to trust back.

172
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
So this is about the worst thing.

173
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Then the notice of God I'm reacting.

174
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
You know what I wanted to say?

175
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Just a short story because Wolfgang's story was linked with Sabina.

176
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I had actually a very similar, very happy primary introduction where also Greg and I introduced me to my wife.

177
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
It was just a regular wedding in India.

178
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And she might have said I have a wife for you.

179
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And I met her, it's very short, I met her.

180
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
And it was the girl, kind of the teacher, brown hair.

181
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Who I always liked a lot, you know, as a teenager before.

182
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So I fell in love really first sight.

183
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
I saw her.

184
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
So these things they do happen.

185
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
It's the same thing.

186
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Just wanted to share that because it's really to trust.

187
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
To trust.

188
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
It's not a tapasya you get someone and then maybe hopefully Louis is good looking and this and that.

189
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
But in many cases it works very well.

190
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
In many cases it works very well.

191
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

192
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I'm sorry.

193
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
I'm sorry.

194
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
I'm sorry.

195
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I'm sorry.

196
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I'm sorry.

197
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I'm sorry.

198
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
I'm sorry.

199
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So we have actually some, you guys have some presentations about that after Shomar did you laugh.

200
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And we know that there is a comedy like marriage comedy.

201
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And we kind of know this mechanism but we still have some presentations about the level of those yogis.

202
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Is it like appropriate enough?

203
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Are kind of chances to get not a tapasya high?

204
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Because, yeah, we do have participation.

205
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And it is special rules in terms of age and the stuff that is not a movie.

206
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And there are special criteria for choosing a follow up.

207
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Indeed there is a marriage committee which is working at the moment.

208
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And the marriage committee consists of honorable yogis.

209
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
It was really checked. Honorable yogis from all over the world.

210
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
So the marriage committee is a very special one.

211
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
It is a very special one that is very important to us.

212
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
We are very happy to have you here.

213
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
It used to be for two or three years that it was not satisfactory the way people were.

214
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Like the marriage committee itself was not satisfactory because it was by chance to.

215
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:31.000
What we see now, I mean every year is getting better.

216
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
We had divorces also mentioned other generic people.

217
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
And the reason is because of actual reaction.

218
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
And why did you say that and react to the three brachas?

219
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Nothing ever will save you in a marriage if you don't see the good things in the other ones but see the best ones.

220
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I don't think that the brachas are able to give you a partner and give you a couple of hours.

221
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And also she made it that sometimes she was really upset that people wanted to divorce.

222
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
How to make sure she doesn't divorce?

223
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
How to make sure she doesn't divorce?

224
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
No, I don't think so.

225
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000
What would make sense if you once listened to the people who are in the marriage committee, how they match people?

226
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:40.000
So they are eager to meet you?

227
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And also in Kabela they always give the chance to meet everybody.

228
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
But what I know is that the process itself takes a long time.

229
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And they really, they had so many selection processes.

230
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
First of all the common sense elements but also the vibrational elements.

231
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Many, many different phases.

232
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And what they do not do is if somebody doesn't have a match because it's never really cool then the person doesn't get a match.

233
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
And how do you know that you are not married?

234
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It happened to my eldest daughter.

235
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
And how long does it take to be married?

236
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
She is a Sahaja Yogini since she was born.

237
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000
And she was 25 years old and she really wanted to be on the list and she thought it was a good thing and she prepared herself.

238
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And the whole traffic lights were on green for marriage.

239
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And then she didn't get a match.

240
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And she was really, really on the ground.

241
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So next year she puts her name again.

242
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:35.000
And she got the love of her life.

243
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
And he was not on the list last year.

244
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
So that's why she couldn't get a match.

245
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Her husband was not there.

246
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So when you are on the list you don't get a match because it's for a reason.

247
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Which is good for you.

248
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Because you want to be matched with the person who is your husband and wife.

249
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Especially this year we had so many glamorous marriages.

250
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
So many love at first sight marriages.

251
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
And also you always had the freedom to say better not.

252
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
But we surely get the best results when you say, okay, humanity, I know, I know you.

253
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
When you say that you are not your husband, you say that you are your wife, you say that you are your wife.

254
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And then you will get.

255
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And then you will get.

256
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:19.000
And if I would add to that, at the moment, because we all know how difficult it is to say yes to the list.

257
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:43.000
And in this moment when you really surrender, like you said, it is a very big punya, as they say. It is very auspicious.

258
00:35:43.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Because you can see it from the other side, it is an opportunity to really demonstrate surrender.

259
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
It is not always an opportunity there.

260
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:25.000
And all along, you know, once that has been done, even if the marriage is not working out so well, the moment you surrender, you know, it is so auspicious.

261
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:38.000
It is such a diamond in your life, you can say, you know, that even if it works out anyway, but even if it doesn't, it is a wonderful thing to have with you.

262
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And this is the moment when you say that you are not your husband, you are your wife.

263
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Because you are not your husband, you are your wife, you are your husband.

264
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And this is the moment when you say that you are your husband, you are your wife.

265
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:04.000
But this is Sahaja Yogi, this is something no one can understand, you cannot say to anyone else, it is just because we are Sahaja Yogis.

266
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:39.000
I think it is really the criteria which makes us selective, which is sometimes focused on short term results.

267
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:53.000
So we want immediately to be wah-wah-wah since that is the bathroom.

268
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Even science finds out that this wah-wah-wah feeling lasts for a while.

269
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
And then it is replaced by something else.

270
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
And if there is not something else, you don't have anything.

271
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:32.000
And the something else is if you really fit together, if all the little, little details fit together, then you have to come.

272
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And this is what I wish all of you and kids will definitely learn.

273
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
A bit patience is needed.

274
00:38:49.000 --> 00:39:14.000
You know that if I may add something else, do never underestimate how much we all the yogis want your appreciation needed also.

275
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Like as you mentioned, it is a natural thing that you will say, ok we leave the adults out and we want to do our own thing, which is fine.

276
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
But at some point to come back a little bit is very nice for us also.

277
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
We have talked a little bit about the movement.

278
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
And we truly have to take care of ourapper.

279
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
If you have something to tell us more, we can listen.

280
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
You come in the back.

281
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
You stand in the back.

282
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
And now evolution moves from material to spiritual.

283
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So the one who is spiritually the fittest is going to be on top of evolution.

284
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So you have a big advantage in this race over the others.

285
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Because you are ahead of them.

286
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So don't go back just for the sake of being with them.

287
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
It's a little bit lonely on the top.

288
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
On the top of a mountain.

289
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
But the view is very nice.

290
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:41.000
But we are not lonely in the mountain.

291
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
You are not lonely as long as you are with yourself.

292
00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:01.000
He is Confucile. He knows mountain tops.

293
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
He knows mountains tops.

294
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Mountains have nice language.

295
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
He knows mountains tops.

296
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
He knows mountains tops.

297
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
He knows mountains tops.

298
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
He knows mountains tops.

299
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
You know, yesterday when I spoke about Russia and Ukraine,

300
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I said that if you can manage your role here, you could help opening the aperture.

301
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:53.000
I think that the Chinese yogi are very good at opening the door of the left side.

302
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You know, like the Chinese yogi, they help opening the door of the left side.

303
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Open the left side of the door.

304
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:17.000
You can help opening the right side of the door.

305
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
And you can do that.

306
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
You will have your names on the street in 200 years.

307
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And people will bring garlands to your grandchildren.

308
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
So have a sense of perspective.

309
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:09.000
You can help opening the door of the left side of the door.

310
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:23.000
You can help opening the door of the right side.

311
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I'm quite surprised because I think that what I said is true.

312
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:56.000
We also sort about this in the silence moment.

313
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:05.000
So now you can walk in Kiev and you can say, okay, this place I want my name.

314
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:13.000
It all works above the idea.

315
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Any questions?

316
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Also please, boys, don't go on aggression.

317
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:34.000
And girls, you know less to say.

318
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
You can have it on your telephone.

319
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
At least in our crazy country, maybe not here.

320
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Don't go there.

321
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
For a simple reason.

322
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
It's very easy if I drop ink.

323
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
It's very easy to drop ink on this sweater.

324
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
To clean the sweater is difficult.

325
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
So keep your life simple.

326
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And if you do it, don't feel guilty.

327
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Just use your willpower.

328
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
So here your freedom.

329
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Freedom from ignorance.

330
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Freedom from addiction.

331
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Freedom from what binds your spiritual evolution.

332
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I have a question.

333
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
What about astrology?

334
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
She was not respected.

335
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Yes, she did, but also, she said also, she respected astrology,

336
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:26.000
but she said also that the realized soul can go beyond the strength of the science.

337
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:38.000
You understand?

338
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:49.000
If you realize the stars lose their influence.

339
00:48:49.000 --> 00:49:01.000
But still, it is part of the game.

340
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Why are we important?

341
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Because if you want to know about astrology, it's because you want to know.

342
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
But if you're on the top, you know.

343
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
So you don't need astrology.

344
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:41.000
You have very nice vibration.

345
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.000
You think that we give you vibration, right?

346
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
You think that?

347
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
You think that?

348
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:57.000
We think that you give us vibration.

349
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:11.000
I didn't think that.

350
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
You're welcome.

351
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
This is collective.

352
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
This is the Kalkin donation.

353
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Before, it wasn't like that.

354
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:40.000
I think we were very wrong.

355
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Okay. The parrot.

356
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000
I said Shri Kalki is a horse and a parrot.

357
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
So I explained the horse.

358
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Why the parrot?

359
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
And so I asked him.

360
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Parrot doesn't stand.

361
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Parrot is the one he rides?

362
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
No, parrot is a bird.

363
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
It's the parrot which spins.

364
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Because he has a parrot.

365
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:16.000
So I asked him, I said, I understand the horse, but why the parrot?

366
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
And she responded?

367
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Because he wants to communicate that he can't.

368
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Because she said everything that was to be said.

369
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.000
And then she was silent for ten years.

370
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:59.000
So this is because now the Divine did everything that it could to help us and now it's up to us to grow.

371
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
She stopped talking.

372
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Because she said what we needed to hear.

373
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:32.000
One of the first movies, first marriages in the yoga, they have the children whose age they are ready for marriages and maybe they already have a children.

374
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
So I think this children is the purest one.

375
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.000
So the children of the children who come in scratch to manage.

376
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Is it they already come or it's like this year?

377
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Yes, they came already.

378
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Already.

379
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Do you know them?

380
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
What age are these children?

381
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Two, three, four, five.

382
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
These great children for example.

383
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
That's why he smiles.

384
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Your children have a marriage with also second children.

385
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000
I think there is this children will be something outside of another.

386
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Look at this place.

387
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
He is naughty.

388
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
They need to be protected.

389
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000
They need to be protected.

390
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:39.000
They can be born only in real life family.

391
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Also they absorb a lot from school.

392
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
For everybody it's like a washing machine all the time.

393
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Things and things and things.

394
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:46.000
They want to be your grandchild.

395
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Maybe I will be their grandchild.

396
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I think it's a good thing.

397
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I think it's a good thing.

398
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
I think it's a good thing.

399
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
I think it's a good thing.

400
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000
So the question was really we have a question on the quality of medication.

401
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
So the things that we have.

402
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
I was going to say that we are taking trade.

403
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
We have no question.

404
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
We want to take a drug.

405
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
We just take a drug.

406
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
We just do better.

407
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
However, what we taste here is that we may have like big, big, beautiful medication.

408
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
And still medication is not the thing.

409
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
So can we treat it with medication only in small bit?

410
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Is it kind of more effective than to meditate more?

411
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Because we are losing that in a large collective while being discovered.

412
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
It's quite possible.

413
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
But here the answer is try.

414
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Try what works.

415
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Because there is not one answer.

416
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
You need to try.

417
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
You need to meditate in small group, meditate in large group.

418
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
See what works.

419
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
You keep your child.

420
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
You are like before a landscape.

421
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:41.000
You cannot ask me how do I navigate in the landscape because it's your landscape.

422
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
You will find.

423
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
It's experimental.

424
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
But yes, you can have this situation where if there are a couple of negative people,

425
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
if you have two or three people from a fake guru or two or three people who really have bad vibration,

426
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
you can spoil and eat it.

427
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000
You can.

428
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
It's nice that we failed now.

429
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Remember?

430
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
You remember?

431
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Remember?

432
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
This one you remember?

433
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Yes?

434
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Or is the other one you would say?

435
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Over there.

436
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Do you remember?

437
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
You?

438
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Yes?

439
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Do you remember the silence?

440
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
You failed the silence?

441
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
She's not sure?

442
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.000
She's asking why then?

443
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Why?

444
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
If she was silent all the time, that's even better.

445
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
That's even better.

446
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
But you know just have faith in yourself.

447
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Let's have faith in yourself.

448
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:23.000
What I find out sometimes in meditating in big groups, in the big group,

449
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
it's about how the channel has different.

450
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:33.000
In a big group, the attention goes off is much worse than in a smaller group sometimes.

451
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Because in a smaller group, if three or four people keep their attention, you can still have a better try.

452
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000
But in a bigger group, or for a certain percentage of people, the attention goes off somewhere.

453
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
And that can have many reasons.

454
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And it's much more difficult.

455
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
I think that the question is more about the collective.

456
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Because collective means that we have to be more conscious,

457
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
and we have to be more conscious.

458
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
But if collective means that we have to be more conscious,

459
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
that's the question.

460
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:13.000
So when you find out that you can't do it, maybe it's also a way to find out what do we prefer,

461
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:20.000
and what kind of how do we want to have communication or people to be showing more of the people.

462
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:35.000
I think that we have to be more conscious.

463
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Maybe you have discussions on how do you want to have communication in order to experience more of the traffic concerns.

464
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:54.000
But how would you do your limitations?

465
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:17.000
You are not Cuba. The question was for the U.S.

466
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:26.000
You have a question for the U.S. What do you do?

467
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I think that the question is more about the collective.

468
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think that the question is more about the collective.

469
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I think that the question is more about the collective.

470
01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I think that the question is more about the collective.

471
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It's actually very nice because you start relaxing.

472
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Because what really happens inside, it's not as we do.

473
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:40.000
If I do this in the back of somebody, what do I do? I move my hand.

474
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And then a lot of things are happening on the stage.

475
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
We need to enjoy the show. We need to enjoy the leader.

476
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We need to move, be curious. We should relax because that power is going to work out a little.

477
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:16.000
We need to be curious because that power is going to work out a little.

478
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Because we, he and me, in our life, we're stressed because of such a yoga.

479
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
We need to be curious because that power is going to work out a little.

480
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Because we want to give more realization because we think people should grow faster, because we think yogis should not fight.

481
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:53.000
That if I am frustrated, I don't help anybody and I don't help myself.

482
01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:11.000
So you know it's a balance between being dynamic and relaxed. This is the balance of life. Being at the same time dynamic and relaxed.

483
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:20.000
There is one minute to four o'clock so we can have a last question.

484
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Are you like Ukraine? Are you like Ukraine?

485
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Do you like me?

486
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000
A little.

487
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:53.000
He wants the vibrations to answer.

488
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I met you first time in Kabbalah and you just picked me up in Rome and you told me your story when you were first time in Ukraine.

489
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Can you tell the story to all viewers because I heard it but I wanted to tell you the story to all viewers.

490
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
You told me when you started with Shmachi Vaki.

491
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Oh, why?

492
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Well it's not a big story but just I was here and in the morning we were supposed to go all together to the airport and when I woke up everybody was gone.

493
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I was alone in my hotel room.

494
01:04:36.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Today in the city of K dipped .

495
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Maybe she just felt the desire to be in Ukraine.

496
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:25.000
See the other thing that maybe just to add one thing, you see, here people are naive

497
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
about the West.

498
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Because you know what doesn't work in your part of the world.

499
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And you think that in our part of the world things are better.

500
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
It's true we are better economically.

501
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Maybe infrastructures are better.

502
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Maybe there is more freedom.

503
01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But in our countries the family is destroyed.

504
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So when the family is destroyed it becomes a vicious circle.

505
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Because the children of destroyed families are worse.

506
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And the children of those children are worse.

507
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And now we really, you know, it is a very serious situation.

508
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So maybe also in your vision, you know, have a vision for Ukraine.

509
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Don't have this vision that the future of Ukraine is to be like the Western country.

510
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
No.

511
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Your food is still healthy here, I hope.

512
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:01.000
You know, the food in our place, people get cancer left, right, left, right.

513
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Because we are poisoned by our food, we are poisoned by the pharmaceutical industry.

514
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I think that the problem is that we are not able to solve the problem.

515
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
We are not able to solve the problem.

516
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I think that the problem is that we are not able to solve the problem.

517
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I'm just saying that because if I were in Ukraine, I would say, often I could travel.

518
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.000
We have people west and visit New York and this and that.

519
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I understand this desire, but actually that would not be the solution.

520
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I think that in Ukraine, the problem is that we are not able to solve the problem.

521
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
We are not able to solve the problem.

522
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I think that the problem is that we are not able to solve the problem.

523
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Okay, so maybe we see each other at the public program tomorrow.

524
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I don't know.

525
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Is there any space?
