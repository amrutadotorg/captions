1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,541
And I already spoke on Kundalini yesterday 
for two hours.

2
00:00:05,541 --> 00:00:17,680
Those who want to hear My speech can arrange 
it with Mr.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,460
Rai and can come sometime and listen to it.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:48,359
But today, after telling you about the three 
powers which govern our autonomous nervous

5
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:58,319
system and 
the seven centers which look after all our

6
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:12,920
autonomous behavior, which are the milestones 
of our evolutionary different stages…

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:37,210
The centers carry the symbols of deities who 
are responsible for our evolution, who have

8
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:45,890
helped us to evolve by leading us, by giving 
us a leadership.

9
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,909
The whole action has been sahaj.

10
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:58,259
As I have told you yesterday, ‘sahaja’: 
‘saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’ means

11
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,240
‘born’, born with you.

12
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:12,210
In a seed, the complete map of the tree and 
all the trees that are coming in future is

13
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,740
microscopically placed.

14
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:29,410
In the same way, in our being, the complete 
map was placed.

15
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:43,361
We have crossed quite a long distance to be 
human beings from the state of amoeba or even

16
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,740
earlier.

17
00:02:45,740 --> 00:03:10,770
Today I’m going to tell you about what lies 
around the normal human consciousness.

18
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,460
We have to understand man in his complete 
totality.

19
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:26,930
It is very necessary to know all that is unknown, 
because whatever that is unknown is not Divine.

20
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:37,610
We should not mistake everything that is unknown 
as a Divine force.

21
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:51,720
And to understand the complete totality of 
man you have to open your mind, listen to

22
00:03:51,720 --> 00:04:00,870
Me like a scientist would listen or understand 
a hypothesis, and later on if you are realized

23
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,120
– if you are; that is a very big “if” 
with some people, with some people it is not

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:20,900
– you all can testify, you can find out, 
but as a scientist you must have an open mind.

25
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:30,150
If you are a fanatic, even if you are science-obsessed 
person, you cannot understand.

26
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,540
Science does not know anything of love, it 
does not know anything of religion, it does

27
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,910
not know anything of incarnations.

28
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:51,940
But it can be proved today that there exists 
a Force which is the synthesis of all the

29
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,470
forces that are working.

30
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:05,650
And there exists the all-pervading power of 
Divine love.

31
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,770
But for that, you have to be a subtler personality.

32
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,830
With this gross human attention, you cannot 
realize it.

33
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,160
You have to be a subtler being and to be that 
subtle being you are already blessed with

34
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,470
a mechanism that works out this happening 
spontaneously.

35
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,100
It is sahaja, spontaneous, effortless.

36
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,730
Somebody has to trigger it.

37
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:50,920
Yesterday I have told, quite elaborately, 
all the chakras and their names and their

38
00:05:50,920 --> 00:06:00,280
deities and all the three forces, but today 
I’m going to tell you what lies beyond these

39
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,690
lines, beyond the human awareness.

40
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:15,710
Is a subject of psychology, you can say, though 
psychology is such a child’s science and

41
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,020
the knowledge is so limited because they are 
probing from outside.

42
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:26,570
It’s an objective knowledge in the sense 
that you come from outside and see things.

43
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,139
You grope at something and say, “This is 
this.

44
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,190
” Then you grope at another thing and say, 
“This is this.

45
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,210
” You have heard the story of six blind 
men trying to understand an elephant.

46
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:49,630
As I told you yesterday that there can be 
a method by which you can put the light on

47
00:06:49,630 --> 00:07:01,640
and one can see clearly the complete, the 
total picture of man.

48
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:13,450
In this picture I’ve not been able to show 
that part but in the human mind, as you all

49
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:19,880
know, there are different stratas of consciousness.

50
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:29,370
Now you are listening to Me, paying attention 
to Me, your Chitta is towards Me.

51
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,310
This attention is the conscious mind.

52
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,460
You know that you are conscious of what I’m 
speaking.

53
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,390
Moment to moment you are listening to Me.

54
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:49,060
This present moment now, at this moment, this 
moment as it is, it’s slipping, is becoming

55
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,360
the past and the future is coming in you.

56
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,850
Every moment is disappearing and a new moment 
is coming.

57
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,970
You cannot stop the present, you cannot stop 
your attention at present.

58
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:11,460
Now, to be at this moment, you cannot be, 
that’s the difficulty.

59
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:21,300
You either think of the past or of the future, 
but you cannot think of the present, of this

60
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,270
moment.

61
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:33,979
So, we have our past and our future, in a 
simple work.

62
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,550
The past, they call it as subconscious mind.

63
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,529
Subconscious mind, they call it as psyche 
sometimes.

64
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:47,959
I don’t know what do they mean by psyche, 
they are so confused, but we have a subconscious

65
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:56,559
strata, in which we store all that we collect, 
experiences, conditionings, everything.

66
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:06,670
This work is done by the left-hand side channel, 
known as Ida Nadi, which is worked by the

67
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,680
power of Mahakali.

68
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,809
Now this word should not shock all the English 
knowing scientists.

69
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:26,740
This Mahakali power works with storing of 
all the experiences, all the thoughts that

70
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:42,920
are coming to you from the present into the 
past, is done by Mahakali power.

71
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:56,610
Thinking of the future, planning of the future, 
organizing the future is done by the right-hand

72
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,929
side power of Mahasaraswati which acts through 
the Pingala channel.

73
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:19,560
In the gross form they are expressed left 
and right sympathetic nervous systems.

74
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,170
But for a doctor, both the systems act simultaneously.

75
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,420
They are so interconnected that it is very 
difficult for them to verify two different

76
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,540
functions which are allotted to them because 
the ways and methods are so gross.

77
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:57,820
The left side attends to our emotional being, 
the lower left side to our physical.

78
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,610
We can say psychosomatic side.

79
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:21,250
The right side, the lower to our physical 
being and the upper right side to our thinking.

80
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:52,850
The center channel of Sushumna is a completely 
independent system which works out our sustenance.

81
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:04,180
In the beginning, when a person wants to drink, 
he wants, all the parasympathetic activities

82
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:15,649
are performed through the subtle action of 
this channel known as Sushumna and the power

83
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,059
that acts is known as Mahalakshmi.

84
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:29,730
This power evolves us, it gives us Dharma, 
is a sustenance.

85
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:37,139
The complete periodic table, if you have studied 
chemistry, is amazingly organized.

86
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:50,949
The carbon is placed as a tetravalent element, 
with four hands just like a Ganesha.

87
00:12:50,949 --> 00:13:01,699
I do not want to go into the details of the 
periodic table but it is so well organized

88
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:13,430
that every atom of every element has to have 
the last circle with eight protons.

89
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:26,239
If there are less or if there are more than 
four, they either become the negative or the

90
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,679
positive element.

91
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,860
What a tremendous planning it is.

92
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:39,189
And when we say there is no God, we must understand 
such a tremendous planning could not have

93
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:43,189
been achieved by just chance.

94
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:48,999
It doesn’t work out by that law of chance.

95
00:13:48,999 --> 00:14:03,170
All right forget about God, because suddenly 
if you talk of God the scientists get a shock.

96
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:12,269
But He exists and these are His three powers 
which perform these three actions in our being.

97
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:24,290
By the first we build up our past, by the 
second we build up our future and by the center,

98
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,740
the Sushumna Nadi we exist in the conscious 
mind.

99
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:46,220
The problem of future and past is created 
for human beings by a special method, as I

100
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:58,739
told you yesterday, that this brain assumes 
a shape of a prism and that when these powers

101
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:10,129
enter into the brain on both the sides they 
lose part of it.

102
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:17,899
The one that enters from the right-hand side 
passes to the left-hand, losing something

103
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,699
on the left-hand side.

104
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:35,240
This one is the Mahakali power which loses 
outside, this one is the reaction to the past.

105
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:42,869
You see someone, I see this gentleman, suddenly 
I remember of My past experiences with him.

106
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,199
The whole past of him comes to Me through 
that part.

107
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:56,019
And as a reaction I develop a superego, a 
conditioning in My brain, which I have shown

108
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:00,439
on the other side like a balloon.

109
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:06,339
I’ll give you a simple example to understand 
the superego and the ego, how it develops

110
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,329
in a little child.

111
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:17,480
A child is nursed by the mother and he’s 
in complete joy, one with the mother, enjoying

112
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,730
fully.

113
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:25,429
Suddenly the mother removes the child from 
one side to another side, he doesn’t like

114
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,429
it.

115
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:33,970
The child doesn’t like and he puts down 
his foot there.

116
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,170
That is the development of ego.

117
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,269
He asserts himself.

118
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:55,609
Ego develops gradually on the left side in 
the brain but comes forward.

119
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:09,289
When the child is then corrected by mother, 
she says, “Don’t do, don’t do like this”,

120
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,860
he is conditioned.

121
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,240
By that, he accepts it, and the superego as 
a reaction develops on the right-hand side

122
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,120
of the brain from this side and covers it 
gradually, at the age of about twelve years

123
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,039
because language is another way by which they 
are strengthened.

124
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:39,519
And here, when they meet completely, a man 
is made into an egg, an articulation takes

125
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,019
place, everyone develops a separate personality.

126
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:51,970
He is Mr So-and-So, he is Mr So-and-So, he 
is Mr So-and-So and the misidentification

127
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:52,970
starts.

128
00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:01,630
There are many misidentifications we suffer 
from, we call them ‘mythia’, we know they

129
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,289
are myth, our name.

130
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:12,940
I’ve known people, somebody’s name was 
Dharamdhar and he was the greatest adharmi

131
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,940
ever born.

132
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,880
There are so many misidentifications.

133
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,600
We are attached to our name.

134
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,840
If somebody says that, “You Mr So-and-So, 
you are a very bad man”, one feels very

135
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,919
hurt and bad, you see, your anger comes up, 
“What do you say?

136
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,289
This was ‘my’ name.

137
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,610
” 
We are attached to so many misidentifications

138
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,610
all our lives.

139
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:46,140
The myths starts collecting and we become 
covered with so much of that misidentification.

140
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,919
Our ego and superego completely overlap all 
our wisdom.

141
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:05,399
So the ego is created as a byproduct I can 
say, or you can say by the over activity of

142
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:09,220
the right hand side channel.

143
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:18,490
The fumes of that activity, like in a factory 
you see, are collected in the ego.

144
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,820
And the activity of the left hand side collects 
the superego.

145
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,830
And that’s how you have ego and superego 
developed in your brain.

146
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,460
So that is how the human being is.

147
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:45,559
He has got his Mahakali power which is looking 
after his subconscious activity, his MahaSaraswati

148
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:57,320
power which is looking after the supraconscious 
activity, and his MahaLakshmi power which

149
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,700
is looking after the conscious activity.

150
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:15,110
Now, there are regions which lie beyond this, 
about which we are not aware.

151
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:21,399
On the left hand side, beyond the Mahakali 
region, lies the collective subconscious mind.

152
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:39,909
The collective subconscious mind where all 
that is dead is collected, that is the collective

153
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,190
subconscious.

154
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:50,080
Beyond the MahaSaraswati channel, beyond this 
region, lies the collective supraconscious

155
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
mind.

156
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,870
We are part of that also though we are not 
conscious of it.

157
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,659
We are not conscious of it so we can call 
it as still unconscious to us.

158
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:33,669
Now, beyond the central path of Sushumna, 
beyond the conscious mind, lies the collective

159
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,049
consciousness.

160
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:51,250
That is the all-pervading consciousness which 
we know as Sat Chit Anand.

161
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:57,590
It is all-pervading.

162
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:15,009
Below the Mooladhara Chakra, which I have 
shown you there down below, lies the most

163
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,830
fearful area of hell.

164
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,039
It exists.

165
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,860
It is there.

166
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,539
We maybe not believe in it but it is there 
and it can be proved.

167
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:56,409
In the collective subconscious, as I have 
told you, when we die we get into it.

168
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:01,159
Normally, not abnormally but normally.

169
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:14,669
Those people who have been extremely unhappy 
in life, who have been tortured and suppressed,

170
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,919
who are being made very miserable and have 
a malice burning in their hearts, when they

171
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,320
die they still have the vindictiveness and 
they want to make everyone else a miserable

172
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
personality.

173
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,500
They can’t see happiness around.

174
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:44,460
Such people, even if when they die they linger 
along in this area, which is not gone into

175
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:50,250
the collective subconscious.

176
00:23:50,250 --> 00:24:08,200
The collective subconscious receives a normal 
personality who has just accepted death as

177
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,159
a transition.

178
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:17,720
Actually, when we die we really do not die.

179
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:35,330
Only part of us, the earth element drops down, 
and part of the water element also.

180
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:45,070
But the rest of the elements that form this 
body: the different koshas* plus the Kundalini

181
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:54,309
that goes out and the Atma that rises, all 
that put together as soul you can call it,

182
00:24:54,309 --> 00:25:01,639
all that goes into the collective subconscious 
and starts going smaller and smaller, into

183
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:13,200
the area of that collective subconscious, 
where it is to be placed for getting smaller

184
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,460
and smaller.

185
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:34,549
But the people who die, as I told you, as 
the great sufferers with great desires and

186
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:50,580
lust, very depraved and debased people, who 
indulge in alcoholism and drugs and sex, who

187
00:25:50,580 --> 00:26:00,870
make their life miserable, who are violent 
to themselves and not to others, who are not

188
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:14,410
aggressive but are aggressed, who commit suicide, 
they do not go to the appointed place, they

189
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:30,629
stick on around and some of them are really 
busybodies.

190
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:34,880
They try to torture other souls.

191
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:49,549
All the mental cases that you find in this 
world, suffer from the obsession or the possession

192
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:50,549
by these entities.

193
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:54,440
We call them as bhoot and pishacha.

194
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,799
You may not believe it because people don’t 
believe in bhoots.

195
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:12,570
You believe it or not but they exist.

196
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:28,559
These people are not ambitious people but 
they are sly, they are mysterious but they

197
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,559
are afraid.

198
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:37,149
So they try to find out this type of people, 
they enter into the psyche of such people

199
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:39,789
and they make them even worse.

200
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:52,389
They make their lives miserable and they make 
such a person absolutely abnormal.

201
00:27:52,389 --> 00:28:03,929
When the psychology starts treating such abnormal 
people they perhaps do not know what they

202
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,509
are up to.

203
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:16,659
The psychologists, when they get in contact 
with such abnormal people, they themselves

204
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:18,710
are influenced or contaminated.

205
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:27,539
They catch from these depraved and debased, 
lusty, sexy people, and they themselves become

206
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,749
so abnormal.

207
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:36,360
Because they seldom have any relationship 
with normal people then they start putting

208
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:46,190
up theories absolutely abnormal: an abnormal 
personality is made as a normal personality

209
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,749
and is made to be accepted by everyone.

210
00:28:48,749 --> 00:28:57,419
So they start with the theory that you should 
not suppress your desires, you should become

211
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:03,450
very expressive and absolutely liberated as 
far as these desires are concerned.

212
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,450
All right, go ahead.

213
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:14,730
But they are not aware of the other side of 
the human beings that those who do like this

214
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:22,870
can get into the other trap and can become 
egoistical.

215
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:29,320
It starts as a trip of their ego, then they 
become so egoistical that they forget what

216
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,399
is saint, what is God, what is holiness.

217
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:43,110
That is what has happened in the Western countries.

218
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,559
Perhaps maybe the war.

219
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:52,850
In the war so many people were killed like 
that, they must have possessed these people.

220
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,519
And such patients must have gone to these 
psychologists and these psychologists must

221
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:09,679
have come out with these unique ideas of psyche 
being conditioned if you tell them about religion.

222
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,679
Psyche is conditioned, no doubt.

223
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,620
If you all the time tell the child, “Don’t 
do this, don’t do that”, the child gets

224
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,840
conditioned, no doubt.

225
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,010
If you discipline a person too much, he might 
get conditioned, no doubt.

226
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:34,570
But if you are a model yourself, if the father 
and mother both are the models of goodness

227
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:40,299
then the child accepts it without being conditioned.

228
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:46,480
This is the central path of evolution.

229
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:54,669
That’s why I say that the family is the 
most important unit of every nation.

230
00:30:54,669 --> 00:31:08,889
All efforts must be done to retain the holiness, 
the respect and the greatness of marriage

231
00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:09,889
institution.

232
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:16,159
That’s why all the incarnations have been 
married people.

233
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,720
And even the Gurus, like Guru Nanak and all 
these people, have been married and have been

234
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,600
leading a normal married life.

235
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,429
You go to the West and you are surprised at 
the tomfoolery and the stupidity to which

236
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:37,890
they are taking.

237
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,950
You cannot believe how foolish they have become.

238
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,700
We don’t have to learn anything from them 
in this respect.

239
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,450
They have broken their families; they have 
divorced their wives.

240
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,480
All right.

241
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,639
Now women have divorced their husbands.

242
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:04,070
Ten men divorcing ten women, marrying each 
other all the time, ending up in a enatala

243
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:07,210
[endlessness] and the children have taken 
to drugs.

244
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,679
What a nice society.

245
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:16,039
The husband comes home the wife has disappeared, 
taking a divorce saying, “I didn’t like

246
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,980
my husband, there was no compatibility.

247
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:27,879
” And the psychologists are very nicely 
helping them to build up a society of chaos

248
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:36,369
and the religion has been thrown to waste 
because they think it conditions people.

249
00:32:36,369 --> 00:32:45,369
It will if it is a false religion, if it is 
a suppression,

250
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:53,350
For example Christianity never preached such 
things that these people are following.

251
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,790
Christ never talked of sanyasa of any kind.

252
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,230
He Himself was a great celibate born personality.

253
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,950
He was an incarnation.

254
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,860
But his Mother was married and He attended 
marriages.

255
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:16,570
But the Roman Catholics started a suppressed 
type of institution where they preached complete

256
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,570
celibacy.

257
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:24,059
Martin Luther came in, he said, “No, this 
is wrong, it should be spontaneous.

258
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,620
” He was correct.

259
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:35,529
At that point he was correct but he went wrong 
that he did not recognize Mother of Christ.

260
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:40,080
That was the greatest mistake because from 
where do you get the sense of celibacy, from

261
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,830
where do you get the sense of holiness, in 
what relationship?

262
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,710
In the Mother and the Son.

263
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:58,460
That’s how Christianity has gone to the 
dogs, in that country.

264
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,440
As I told you yesterday, they are making a 
picture of sex of Jesus Christ.

265
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,210
Can you imagine such a picture?

266
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:13,810
Can you tolerate in this country?

267
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:24,020
So we have people who are teaching us who 
are actually possessed.

268
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:32,710
Most of the psychologists are possessed and 
they deal only with abnormal people and they

269
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,950
cannot normalize these ideas for the normal 
people.

270
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:44,750
But by doing that they have created abnormal 
personalities and you can find all kinds of

271
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,470
absurd things in that country.

272
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:51,780
That a ninety year old woman having a love 
affair with a nineteen year old boy.

273
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,810
Can you think of such a thing in this country?

274
00:34:58,810 --> 00:34:59,810
Is a common thing there.

275
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,130
There is a law in England, imagine and England 
is such a traditional place that a father

276
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:11,440
cannot have bad relations with the daughter 
and that the mother cannot have with the son.

277
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
A law.

278
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
We don’t need a law like that.

279
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,150
I mean we cannot have a law that you cannot 
eat the filth.

280
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,540
You do not make law like that.

281
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
I mean, human beings know that.

282
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
But they have a law.

283
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:30,520
Now, the trouble is they are asking, imagine, 
thanks to the psychologists, they are asking

284
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,650
that this law should be taken away so that 
they should be made free to do what they like

285
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:35,650
in this respect.

286
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,650
What do you say to this?

287
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,720
You can’t believe it but it is so.

288
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:54,252
There was a minister here, Mr Vidya Rao, he 
went to America and he gave Me a terrible

289
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,490
experience when I was going to America.

290
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,450
He said, “Don’t go there, they will never 
understand you, Mother.

291
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,070
Please don’t go.

292
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,190
” I said, “What happened?”

293
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,230
He said, “I went down to see my daughter.

294
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,680
She was away, living away from the main city, 
so I said, ‘I’ll stay over here with her.

295
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,400
’ So the landlady said, ‘No you can’t 
do that with your father.

296
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
’ She said, ‘What’?’

297
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
‘No no, he can’t stay.

298
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Any other man can stay but not your father.

299
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,420
’ She said, ‘You can’t sleep with her.

300
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,510
’ She gave her a big slap.

301
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,380
But this man said such filth.

302
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,350
Where they think doing so wee.

303
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,870
” He cannot understand these things just 
now.

304
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,750
They also never understood this thanks to 
these psychologists who never accepted…

305
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,901
Thank God we do not know so much of English 
to read that psychology of theirs.

306
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:44,060
The way they are ruining these innocent people 
by their preachings!

307
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,310
They are worse than all the horrible preachers 
ever known.

308
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:59,590
With a very little knowledge of this Kundalini 
on the left hand side, they have ruined such

309
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,410
a great place, such great people.

310
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,560
So many saints are born in that America and 
England.

311
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,490
Oh I weep to see all that.

312
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:26,030
They are all ruined by these people, by telling 
them these stories which they call as freedom

313
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,800
and disciplining their thoughts was conditioning.

314
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,660
But disciplining through a model they could 
not understand.

315
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:47,860
Now, I will tell you how in our country also 
people have used these entities.

316
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,620
We had the greatest saints and the greatest 
incarnations in this country, no doubt, I

317
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,790
agree, but we have the greatest thugs also.

318
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:02,190
The two extremes.

319
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,630
On the other side also we have the supraconscious 
people die.

320
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:19,080
I’ll put them together and tell you all 
the various types of things they do.

321
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,210
The people who are great planners and great 
sort of thinking all the time, “What am

322
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,310
I going to do this, what am I going to do 
that” and they cannot fulfill their desires

323
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:32,210
and they are sort of absolutely identified 
with their desires and very egoistical.

324
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,400
They are power drunk about women also.

325
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,230
They want to have many women around, women 
want to have many men around.

326
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,610
All kinds of things you see, all these complicated 
types.

327
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:50,250
They are not satisfied with one wife or one 
husband these sort of people, all abnormal.

328
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:57,370
And also those who think that, like Napolean 
you see, these kind of egoistical people who

329
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:08,190
think no end of themselves and try to identify 
themselves with their false ambitions, like

330
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,440
Hitler.

331
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,420
When they die, they go to the other side, 
on the right hand side, the supraconscious.

332
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:21,870
They are very dynamic people and they are 
the people who are very aggressive.

333
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:31,160
They can also possess you.

334
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:38,420
And you do not know how you get possessed 
by them for there are two types of people:

335
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:45,080
one the depraved and another the aggressive.

336
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:56,760
So the Thugs, who are always waiting for an 
opportunity to learn, use these entities for

337
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,720
their own purpose.

338
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,210
You want Me to tell how they do it, that would 
be bit too much.

339
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,980
They have a way, they work in the smashana 
[cemeteries] known as a Bhoot Vidya, Smashana

340
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,810
Vidya, Preta Vidya, I know everything, but 
you need not know.

341
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:19,930
They capture those entities and control them 
by controlling some of their parts of their

342
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,740
bodies, especially the skull and all that.

343
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,410
We had one Ananda Mardini you know that, and 
more will be coming forward.

344
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,020
You’ll see them one after, they’ll be 
exposed gradually.

345
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:45,141
So these people capture the entities in their 
power, some the supraconscious and some the

346
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:57,790
subconscious, and they try to capture the 
people through them.

347
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:03,590
We have had, say, Ravanna.

348
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:10,560
Ravanna had a capacity to hypnotize.

349
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:21,890
All hypnosis, all what you call this ESP, 
all these extra things are done by these entities

350
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:28,040
who can be bhoots, can be depraved, can be 
very bad.

351
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:35,540
In London there is an organization known as 
Late Doctor Lang’s International Curative

352
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Center.

353
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
‘Late’, he is dead.

354
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,580
So the Curative Center is what?

355
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:49,770
This Doctor Lang, when he died, he had discovered 
something which he wanted that he should implement

356
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,980
immediately.

357
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,130
I mean, this is written in their pamphlet, 
imagine.

358
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,940
It is open, they are not making a sort of 
a ‘thugee’.

359
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,280
They do not call it ‘God’ and all that, 
thank God.

360
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,480
Others call it ‘God’, but they openly 
say, “No it is not, it is a spirit.

361
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,780
” 
So the spirit of Dr Lang entered into the

362
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,740
body of one soldier fighting in Vietnam.

363
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,650
This they have written already on their pamphlet, 
it’s not My own.

364
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:23,240
And that spirit told this man that, “You 
go and tell my son that I am so-and-so and

365
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,430
that you open the clinic, the surgery.

366
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:35,570
” So the man possessed with this spirit 
went down and told the son and he was taken

367
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:42,990
aback but he gave him such secret information 
that the son had to accept this information

368
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:49,540
and they opened the Late Doctor Lang’s Curative 
International Center.

369
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,890
So the thing started working.

370
00:42:52,890 --> 00:43:01,670
Many doctors who died with this kind of delirium 
also started working through that organization.

371
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,840
So now they would say that, “If you are 
suffering from some disease you let us know,

372
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,600
we’ll give you the time; that time will 
work it out.

373
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,360
” Exactly on that date, that time the man 
would start shivering, “Ho, ho, ho, that’s

374
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,940
a bhoot I am.

375
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,000
” Something entering into their body and 
the person would get rid of his troubles.

376
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,070
But after five, six years that man would rattle 
like a junkie car.

377
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:31,180
And now he is completely finished.

378
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:41,630
I have had many patients from so-called Dr 
Lang’s horrible institution and it’s very

379
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:48,060
difficult to cure them because they are such 
horrible depraved souls that they do not want

380
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:54,540
to leave the body of these people.

381
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,290
You can use these spirits for many tricks.

382
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:02,840
It’s a very common thing.

383
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,670
In our group there was a lady who was a disciple 
of some sort of a man like this, who used

384
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,320
to carry a snake around and all that.

385
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:18,930
She came to Me, I gave her the realization 
quite all right, but she was like this, not

386
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:19,930
all right.

387
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:22,660
So I told her, “You have to give up this 
horrible Guru of yours and your ambition to

388
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:28,990
be one of those so-called people with power.

389
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,330
If you accept it, then only this realization 
will stay, otherwise it will disappear.

390
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,350
” 
She would not listen to Me.

391
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:39,670
By going to America I told her, “Madam, 
be careful.

392
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,520
You’ll get those powers but you should not 
accept them.

393
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,751
” She said, “No, I will never accept, 
I do not want these dead powers, I do not

394
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,839
want this, I want the Supreme, I want the 
Parama.

395
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,300
” I said, “All right, we’ll see.

396
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,580
” 
But she started getting some kumkum out of

397
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:01,240
her hand and some rice out of her hand that 
made her think it’s a good idea.

398
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,470
She’s started her center now, giving away 
things.

399
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,510
She starting showing all sorts of magical 
things.

400
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:15,480
It ended up by giving the number of the horse 
that is going to come.

401
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:24,230
She used to have a big stick in her hand, 
she used to beat people when they came to

402
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,230
her.

403
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,930
She became a satanic personality, horrible 
face.

404
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:34,560
Such horrible face she had, I mean, I could 
not recognize her when I came back.

405
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:41,240
When they told Me that this lady is doing 
all these miracles I was most embarrassed,

406
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,640
I didn’t know what to do.

407
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,690
And she had put up My photograph just there 
and I had disappeared from the photograph

408
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,400
long time back.

409
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,570
When I came back you know, she called Me in 
her house, she brought thousands of people.

410
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,530
For such a people there are thousands because 
you can tell horses number naturally, you

411
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,530
see.

412
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,300
Here I have less but that lady had thousands.

413
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,220
And she washed My feet and did all that.

414
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,390
I was so embarrassed, I could see in her house 
all those entities moving very nicely, jeering

415
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:16,730
at Me how they have captured the woman.

416
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:25,970
So I told her, when she came to Me, that these 
are not your powers.

417
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,200
And she got the shock of her life.

418
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,730
I said, “Now you say what you know before 
Me, Mataji.

419
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,790
” So she started telling another person, 
“You have a house like this, you have like

420
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,790
that.

421
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:39,040
” He said, “No, no, nothing of the kind, 
it’s all wrong.

422
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,270
” So she told it to somebody else who was 
sitting there that, “In your office there

423
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,920
is a man of this name.

424
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,430
” He said, “Nothing of the kind, it’s 
all wrong.

425
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,430
” 
So she just fell at My feet, said “Mother,

426
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,430
have you taken away all my powers?”

427
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,440
I told her, “Oh, My child, these were never 
your powers.

428
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,990
I would have put you on My head, I would have 
loved you, kissed you, but these are not your

429
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:05,500
powers, these are the powers of somebody else 
and they have disappeared like that.

430
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,610
” 
She got even worse and she said, “Mother,

431
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,470
please get rid of them.

432
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,980
” But then, when she went back home, all 
her thousands of disciples waiting there to

433
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,980
know all these things.

434
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,540
Now what a temptation.

435
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:30,700
She went on and on and now she is in the lunatic 
asylum.

436
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,410
And all her disciples will be filling up that 
Thana I see.

437
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,300
Thana hospital is very bad.

438
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:42,280
Some of the ones who were affected by her 
came to Me, I didn’t know what to do with

439
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,280
them.

440
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,920
Such a headache for Me.

441
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,230
You can work them out in so many ways.

442
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:59,410
Not only by this, but there are so many ways 
by which you can use these entities.

443
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:06,180
But for a normal person who is sitting down 
there, suddenly I get a snake in My hand,

444
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,760
“Oh, Mataji is the most powerful person 
here.

445
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,530
” With My own eyes I have seen.

446
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:18,100
I met an ambassador somewhere outside, he 
was wearing a nickel thing in his neck and

447
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,550
he was singing the praise of the man who has 
given them.

448
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,360
I said, “What for a nickel?

449
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,860
At least you should have had a diamond.

450
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,870
After all you are an ambassador.

451
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,040
” He got a little, you know, hurting there.

452
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,900
I said, “You are the cream of the nation, 
like a fool you are running after these nickel

453
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,900
things?

454
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,900
Did you go to asking for these things?”

455
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,860
He said, “No, I went for Supreme.

456
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,330
” Then I said, “Then why don’t you throw 
it on his face?”

457
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:47,310
There’s another one who came to Me.

458
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:49,480
They had got a diamond ring.

459
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,450
Rich man, very, very rich and I said, “How 
many diamond rings you have got?

460
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,450
Only the rich; “Huh.

461
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,990
” “Otherwise why don’t they solve our 
economic problems?

462
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,670
Easy thing, bring diamonds, solve the problems.

463
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:04,990
” 
Now the scientists, if they want to know how

464
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:13,010
I can tell them there are bhoots, they are 
not going to believe Me.

465
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:15,090
So they bring out.

466
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,540
This gentleman came to Me with a diamond ring, 
“Oh this is a diamond ring I have got”.

467
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,550
I said, “Very nice, now what do you want 
from Me?

468
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:25,830
I haven’t got diamonds.

469
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,590
” He said, “No Mother, I just ask You 
for the Supreme.

470
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:36,740
” “But why did you take the ring?

471
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:44,140
You can purchase the ring in the market.

472
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,340
How many do you have?”

473
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,980
He says, “I have many.

474
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,015
” “Can you purchase God in the market?”

475
00:49:50,015 --> 00:49:58,268
He’s a smuggler, he’s everything and the 
Guruji has no objections, Guruji himself drinks

476
00:49:58,268 --> 00:49:59,268
whisky.

477
00:49:59,268 --> 00:50:02,860
And the gentleman, he’s a great worshiper 
of the Guruji, he also drinks whisky.

478
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:09,030
Guruji does not mind, as long as he passes 
on two or three bottles of foreign whiskey

479
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:10,030
to him.

480
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:15,200
And then he comes to Mataji.

481
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,480
So Mataji asks, “Now why Me sir?

482
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,570
What am I to do about it?”

483
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,890
He said, “Mataji I have a problem.

484
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,660
” I said, “What’s the problem?”

485
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,450
“I am losing lots of diamonds.

486
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,450
” “Oh.

487
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,450
What about your wife?”

488
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,720
“Oh she’s completely dedicated to him, 
and she goes and stays there for months together.

489
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,920
She’s not bothered about the husband, about 
the children, about anything.

490
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,660
Oh, she has dedicated herself to the Guruji!”

491
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:52,310
So the wife was brought to Me.

492
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,170
The lady is completely possessed.

493
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,640
“Oh God,” I said, “Now what am I to 
do with this woman?

494
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,440
What question am I to ask her?”

495
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,990
Then I took out her bhoot, did lots of things, 
took out.

496
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,830
She’s a lady doctor.

497
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:13,530
I asked her, “If you are a lady doctor, 
what have you been up to?”

498
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,400
She said, “I don’t know.

499
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,270
Somebody inside me tells me these are all 
stones, give these to Guruji.

500
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,760
” “These are stones for you!”

501
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,780
I said, “Mad woman, if these things are 
stones for you, for a married woman diamonds

502
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,140
are stones, so they should be dust for that 
Guruji of yours who claims he’s a Sanyasi!

503
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,420
Why are you giving him these stones?

504
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,420
And did you tell your husband?”

505
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,420
She said, “No, I never told him.

506
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,270
He was about to report it to the police and 
the Guruji would have been in difficulty.

507
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,390
” 
But despite all that and the husband getting

508
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:56,370
heart attack thrice, they came to Me again 
for the curing of the husband.

509
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,140
Diamonds disappearing but the wife cannot 
get rid of the gentleman at all.

510
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,290
They are so possessed.

511
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:05,430
Very difficult.

512
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:13,960
And thousands of them will run after such 
a man because it’s very easy to hypnotize.

513
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,860
Even they can look at you and hypnotize you.

514
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:28,750
Hypnosis is a simple mass hypnosis which they 
have mastered, which they are using on people

515
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:34,980
and working it out this way and people are 
running after them.

516
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,590
And whenever you ask anyone of them they will 
say, “No, we didn’t ask for diamonds.

517
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,340
” 
Why are you impressed by him?

518
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,290
Did he give anybody realization?

519
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,370
Anybody has got Chaitanya?

520
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,460
Does he talk of Kundalini, does he know anything 
about parasympathetic nervous system?

521
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

522
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,900
He just says that, “I’m God”, fair enough.

523
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:06,320
And we all should accept it, anybody saying 
that, “I am God”?

524
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,790
There should be some pramas [premises?].

525
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,260
This is one style.

526
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,110
There are many like this.

527
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,540
Surprisingly, Christ was a man who…

528
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:23,390
Of course Nanaka has written, I must say Nanaka 
has written such a lot against them, thank

529
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:24,390
God.

530
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,060
I hope the Sikh people are not running after 
such people, I hope so.

531
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:29,330
But Kabir has written, Tukaram has written.

532
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:38,520
Kabir has lashed these people with threatening 
and this and that, lashed them completely.

533
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,842
But who reads Kabir?

534
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:49,780
These pishachas [demons], these rakshasas 
[evils], have been lashed by so many poets

535
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,320
of this country.

536
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:57,570
They have told not to go near these people 
who divert your attention from the subtle

537
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:01,490
to the grossest things.

538
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:04,580
But nobody reads them.

539
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:13,690
So they go to other styles of people.

540
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:22,480
Now Christ was one incarnation who has clearly 
told that you have nothing to do with spirits,

541
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,160
with the dead.

542
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,250
But all the Christian nations are ‘religiously’ 
spirit worshippers.

543
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,250
Religiously.

544
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:39,990
In London, you go four steps and you find 
one spiritualist sitting there.

545
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:53,350
I’m not telling you falsehood, we have some 
English people, they’ll tell you, you can

546
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:54,350
ask them, all kinds of spiritualists.

547
00:54:54,350 --> 00:55:02,510
Even among Christians there are Pentecotalists 
who get possessed, and they say that the holy

548
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:04,770
spirit has descended upon them.

549
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,380
Tantrikas started this in India about sixth 
century.

550
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:17,780
It has gone to such a foolish nonsense that 
in the temples of Mahalakshmi in Bombay they

551
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,230
are having this kind of a nonsense going on 
there.

552
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,160
And when I told the trustees that, “You 
stop all this otherwise I will not come to

553
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,210
your temple to address”, they would not.

554
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,720
They said, “How can we?

555
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
That’s how we gather crowds.

556
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,130
People, these cretin women, these working 
women, they get possessed, they start doing

557
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:39,109
“ho, ho, ho, ho”, people come and ask 
them some questions.

558
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,790
” 
That MahaLakshmi has some sense or not that

559
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:45,300
is she going to come to these cretin women 
who are doing all kinds of things there?

560
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,180
Some of them are prostitutes.

561
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:52,940
Is She going to enter into the body of these 
people to tell you the questions, “What

562
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,600
your father is going to get tomorrow?”

563
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,930
Is that the interest of God?

564
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,780
Use your brains.

565
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:12,350
Why God should be interested in such useless, 
worthless, momentarily existing things?

566
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:20,120
How can you connect it with God?

567
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:25,080
I cannot understand by what intellect you 
connect it.

568
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:40,950
And very great scientists, you see, are trying 
to discover and investigate that is dead.

569
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:46,001
So, we have types and types.

570
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,430
I’ve told you in London we have many types.

571
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:54,670
Scientology, another thing they started in 
America.

572
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,740
Oh God.

573
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:06,280
But what is the ulterior motive of this is?

574
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,470
One is power, one is money.

575
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:12,060
It’s all a money making proposition.

576
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:18,720
When I say that you cannot pay anything for 
your salvation, people get a shock of their

577
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,720
lives.

578
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:28,370
They cannot understand a Mother’s love, 
they cannot, that a Mother can work like this,

579
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:32,800
morning till evening, just to give us salvation.

580
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:38,780
They cannot think of a personality like that, 
impossible, that she doesn’t ask for any.

581
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,050
It’s impossible for them to believe it.

582
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:51,510
In America I went there, people said that, 
“Such and such person is charging 275 dollars

583
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,570
for introducing one bhoot into people.

584
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,570
What about you?

585
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:04,160
Why don’t you charge when you are giving 
people the Reality?”

586
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,070
I said “How much can you give Me?

587
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:10,070
How much have you got?

588
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,070
What is the value?

589
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:18,340
You put Me in the balance, can you sell your 
Mother?”

590
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:25,460
I said, “You have asked Me once, never raise 
such a question to insult Me.

591
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,270
All right, you have to build a place.

592
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:31,780
Supposing we want to have a place for meeting 
place, all right, you have to pay for this

593
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,780
pendal.

594
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,780
All right collect money, have a pendal.

595
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,810
But you cannot have realization with money.

596
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:45,720
” 
We have to understand one small thing, that

597
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,900
supposing I say, “All right come My son, 
live in My house without paying any money,

598
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,710
nothing, you just live like a parasite”, 
will you accept?

599
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,750
Anyone one of you, will you accept?

600
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:05,810
And these parasites are living on your money, 
other people’s money.

601
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:16,830
Every cloth that they have, every morsel that 
they eat, every house they have, every Mercedes

602
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:20,920
they ride, belongs to others.

603
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:30,760
The society which permits such parasites will 
get parasites.

604
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,760
It is what we have deserved.

605
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,760
Why should we pay for God?

606
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,760
I cannot understand.

607
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,000
Already we have had many of these pundits 
and these Thugs sitting in like pundas (pundits).

608
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:47,800
And then the archbishops of the Thugs have 
come as Bhagwans and Gods with all the special

609
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:59,140
knowledge of how to befool, and we the simple 
householders, and these the parasites who

610
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:06,660
call themselves as the Sadhus and the Sanyasis, 
living on our earnings, why should we pay

611
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,660
them?

612
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:13,830
Why do you pay to these Sadhus and Sanyasis?

613
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:24,430
Sitaji has very clearly told that, “Have 
nothing to do with Kashayas, nothing to do

614
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:33,230
with the Bhagwans, and no Sadhu should stay 
in a village for more than two days and one

615
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,230
night.

616
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:42,960
” She has said, “No woman should have 
a man as a Guru”, because Adi Shakti, Sita

617
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:51,410
Herself, was deceived by this horrible Ravana, 
who is born today, who is a Bhagwan.

618
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,600
You see, you don’t know him.

619
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,000
You will know him by his tricks, by the methods, 
the way he threatened Sitaji that, “If you

620
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,300
do not accept my proposals I’m going to 
make your Indian women naked” and he’s

621
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,300
doing it.

622
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,660
And we are seeing with our open eyes that 
photos are blown up and sold in America and

623
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,660
the fellow is a multi-millionaire.

624
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,670
And I don’t know what the income tax he 
is giving.

625
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,460
It’s a fact.

626
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:19,020
We are very passive people, I must say, in 
this respect.

627
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,960
Why can’t we find it out?

628
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,840
Is it our culture?

629
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:36,540
This can be done also, nice cabaret show arranged 
free of cost and people enjoy, you see.

630
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:45,560
They talk very much because, after all, you 
see, in the name of religion and God you want

631
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,410
to bring prostitution?

632
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,990
You want to kill the Dharma?

633
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,190
You want to make everybody a Satan?

634
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:03,520
No use killing these horrid people, they have 
been killed many a times and are again back

635
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:10,040
here.

636
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:21,830
I can only appeal to your senses and to your 
divinity that try to understand and rise.

637
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:29,630
Then, we see the other side.

638
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:33,980
You see there are many styles which I cannot 
go into details and nothing so important.

639
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,910
Better to talk of God than to talk of these 
horrid people.

640
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:42,260
On the other side of the human beings lies 
the supra-conscious, what they call ‘supra-mental’

641
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,920
and all these names are given.

642
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:55,280
On the right-hand side there the people who 
are extra dynamic exist.

643
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,450
They are also used by some people.

644
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:08,470
For example, it’s better to give them, these 
entities, some names of God.

645
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:16,750
For example they’ll give a name, say, of 
Rama.

646
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,212
We say, “Oh, we must take the name of Rama.

647
01:03:18,212 --> 01:03:22,750
” They are taking name, “Rama, Rama, Rama, 
Rama, Rama.

648
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,349
” 
Now we must understand.

649
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:27,370
What is our right to call Rama?

650
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,670
Is He our servant?

651
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,530
That we go, “Oh Rama, come here!

652
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:36,560
Look after my father’s health, give me food, 
supply these, do this.

653
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,510
” Is He your servant?

654
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,920
Is Shri Rama the incarnation of God?

655
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,550
You want to call Him just like this?

656
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:50,710
What is your right calling, “Rama, Rama, 
Rama”?

657
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:59,390
Because the great saints have said, “Sumi 
Rana Karo”, so we are doing Sumi Rana.

658
01:03:59,390 --> 01:04:02,750
Is it Sumi Rana?

659
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:08,310
Do you have that heart to do Sumi Rana?
