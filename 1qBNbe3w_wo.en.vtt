00:00.086 --> 00:04.143
One fellow was taught the complete
Kundalini yoga

00:04.344 --> 00:07.996
for eight months and he also disappeared.

00:09.307 --> 00:12.294
He never had the experience!

00:12.495 --> 00:16.575
Once you establish them up to a point where
they start feeling the vibrations

00:16.776 --> 00:22.638
and feeling the joy, they’ll never give up
Sahaja Yoga.

00:23.926 --> 00:29.081
But you must also weigh a person, how deep
he is.

00:29.282 --> 00:33.002
So the whole attitude towards spreading
Sahaja Yoga should be

00:33.203 --> 00:40.870
that it is not a thing that to be thrown
away before people who do not understand.

00:41.340 --> 00:45.097
I know you feel very much for Americans.
I, too, feel the same way.

00:45.298 --> 00:51.234
And we wish we had more and more American
people coming to Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:51.435 --> 00:58.635
But it is only in our hands to work hard.
We can’t say what we’ll achieve.

00:59.931 --> 01:05.545
We must also understand what are
the problems of the American people,

01:06.475 --> 01:15.437
what sort of things that are obstructing
them from coming to Sahaja Yoga.

01:16.216 --> 01:21.711
So perhaps maybe tomorrow I’ll be able to
tell you what I have understood about them.

01:21.912 --> 01:24.230
Then you keep that in your mind.

01:24.431 --> 01:30.982
With that, if you approach with a proper
attitude of self-confidence,

01:31.451 --> 01:36.590
then I am sure you can do very well. But
there should be self-confidence in you.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.025
That doesn’t mean that you should aggress,
but there should be a self-confidence.

01:41.226 --> 01:47.804
If you have to do something right, you have
to be yourself fully confident of it.

01:48.005 --> 01:51.290
Otherwise, nobody is going to believe you.

01:51.491 --> 01:57.858
We want to get some more Sahaja Yogis
from India to help you out.

01:58.059 --> 02:04.820
But, first of all, those who are here,
I think, you must try to listen to them.

02:05.021 --> 02:09.429
Instead of that, I am (indistinct name)
told Me that you teach them.

02:09.630 --> 02:16.385
I am not saying that Indians are all very
good, that they are very capable.

02:16.586 --> 02:20.360
But one thing is that they have been
with Me for days together.

02:20.561 --> 02:26.232
Apart from that, all Indians are not good
than all the Americans,

02:26.433 --> 02:33.260
but some of them are very good. And those
who are very good must be respected.

02:33.461 --> 02:39.016
And try to understand the attitude of such
people, what they have to tell you.

02:40.900 --> 02:44.717
The way you understand life is not correct.

02:44.918 --> 02:50.734
If it was correct, there would have been
a different America.

02:51.417 --> 02:54.929
Lots of mistakes have been made.

02:55.130 --> 03:02.169
And to get to new life and to new styles,
a new understanding of the new age,

03:02.370 --> 03:12.063
we have to understand that it is a new
knowledge for us

03:12.264 --> 03:16.495
and we have to learn it and understand it.

03:16.696 --> 03:21.781
So far we have had no knowledge about
living processes.

03:21.982 --> 03:24.920
Whatever knowledge we have had is of dead,

03:25.121 --> 03:30.008
like you can make a house out of a dead
tree, from dead to the dead.

03:30.209 --> 03:34.707
But living processes you have never
understood.

03:37.256 --> 03:44.020
So the whole working of saintliness is
nothing but your attitude

03:44.221 --> 03:51.790
towards the knowledge how the living
process of our evolution works out,

03:51.991 --> 03:56.557
and complete confidence in your knowledge.

03:56.734 --> 04:00.506
I am sure you’ll pay full attention to what
I have said it.

04:00.707 --> 04:03.621
Also, tomorrow you can ask Me questions
about it.

04:03.822 --> 04:07.092
In this short time I cannot tell you
everything elaborately,

04:07.293 --> 04:16.008
but I hope you understand that a new type
of attitude is to be taken,

04:16.209 --> 04:20.168
if you have to achieve that vision.

04:20.369 --> 04:23.077
May God bless you.

04:35.341 --> 04:41.359
Now, whatever you say, I'll sit there,
we can watch the film.

04:42.936 --> 04:46.785
Whatever is the programme... (Marathi)
