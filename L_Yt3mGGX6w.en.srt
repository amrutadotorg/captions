00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,550
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

2
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:13,415
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

3
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:21,505
where the evil has been suppressed.

4
00:07:53,375 --> 00:08:01,335
The evil that spreads its power all over

5
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:06,585
is only because of two factors.

6
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:14,415
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

7
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:19,335
you are still blind,

8
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:24,625
and you follow things

9
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,375
which are not right but you think are powerful.

10
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:38,295
This illusion creates not only problems,

11
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:43,625
but absolute destruction.

12
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:50,545
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

13
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:59,415
and it was easily solved.

14
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,375
It was based on all wrong basis,

15
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:11,415
just to create a problem.

16
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:19,585
Problem was created with a purpose,

17
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,455
and nobody could imagine

18
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:34,665
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

19
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:42,625
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

20
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:08,295
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

21
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:13,415
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

22
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:19,415
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

23
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:24,415
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

24
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:29,415
and they cling on to the fact

25
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,295
that they know everything.

26
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:36,505
With all this happening,

27
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:40,255
there have been so many fractions,

28
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:42,625
so many stupid people

29
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:51,295
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

30
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:56,415
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:10:57,505 --> 00:11:03,295
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

32
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:08,585
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

33
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,455
it is very subtle.

34
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,665
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

35
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,585
they fall into the wrong path of,

36
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:26,415
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

37
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:29,255
the people who are doing good.

38
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:35,295
But above all is the power of God.

39
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:42,335
All this drama is played to prove the existence

40
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,505
of that great Power.

41
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:48,545
It has all worked out so well,

42
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,625
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

43
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:57,255
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

44
00:11:58,545 --> 00:12:01,585
Many people who have achieved

45
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,585
so-called success cannot see that point,

46
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:10,295
but you can see it because you are spectators.

47
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:17,255
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

48
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:20,585
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

49
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,705
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

50
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,705
that would finish before Diwali.

51
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,375
So it goes like this, the stupidity

52
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,455
which is being created;

53
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,755
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

54
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:45,665
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

55
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:52,295
If you see among all these people who have lost,

56
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:56,415
what impression have they created?

57
00:12:57,295 --> 00:13:00,455
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

58
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:06,335
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

59
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,755
But what impression they have created?

60
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:14,455
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

61
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,335
they can see that it’s a miracle,

62
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:24,585
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

63
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:35,415
Now the new phase has started.

64
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:44,415
You all have a very, very open challenge

65
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:48,625
to get people into enlightenment.

66
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,705
People are not so ignorant now,

67
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,585
they are not so much blasted.

68
00:13:57,585 --> 00:14:01,415
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

69
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:08,295
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

70
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,585
and they understand

71
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:14,585
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

72
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,455
It’s very important,

73
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:24,295
because if a human being starts thinking

74
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:27,505
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

75
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:31,375
At any cost, whatever may happen,

76
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,705
he’ll go on sticking to that.

77
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:41,335
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

78
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:47,665
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

79
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:53,665
to smell the evil – innate.

80
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:57,705
We cannot, human beings cannot.

81
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,755
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

82
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:09,415
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

83
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:14,505
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

84
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:21,705
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

85
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:25,415
who is a thief and who is not?

86
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,705
We have a higher awareness.

87
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:35,295
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

88
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,625
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

89
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,545
We cook our food – they don’t.

90
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:51,415
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

91
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:57,335
because the way people behave

92
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:04,255
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

93
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:07,665
All this happening

94
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:11,585
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

95
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,795
and apply it to yourself, and see

96
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,625
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

97
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:23,705
For that, you have to rise higher.

98
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,415
You have to rise higher

99
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:34,335
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

100
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,665
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

101
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,295
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

102
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,415
Why my attention is like that?

103
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:51,335
What is the main reason

104
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:57,335
for my own

105
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:02,455
possession, I should say, or my own

106
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:08,665
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

107
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,505
Once you’ll start seeing that,

108
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,705
and if you find even a wee bit of such

109
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:20,255
nonsensical understanding within you,

110
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,335
then you can forgive also people

111
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,375
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

112
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,795
absolutely brainwashed,

113
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:35,665
and they did everything under that influence.

114
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:42,585
As it is now you have risen much higher

115
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,295
than all these people,

116
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:53,375
and much more aware than all of them.

117
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:59,295
So you have to just understand this point,

118
00:17:59,665 --> 00:18:04,295
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

119
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:13,415
And for the people who are actually bad,

120
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,705
you don’t have to worry.

121
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:22,505
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

122
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:28,505
But watch yourself and see for yourself

123
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:35,705
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

124
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:42,625
You should try to cleanse the mirror

125
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:48,545
so you see your complete image

126
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:55,375
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

127
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:03,455
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

128
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:15,585
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

129
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:19,255
I simply pity them.

130
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:24,795
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

131
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,415
to see what they have been doing.

132
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:29,585
Why have they been doing like that?

133
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,625
What is the need to do that?

134
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:42,795
All this introspection will work out so well.

135
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:46,545
Then your real powers will come out

136
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:54,505
– your powers of giving realization,

137
00:19:56,415 --> 00:20:03,415
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

138
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,585
of the whole world.

139
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:14,795
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

140
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,455
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

141
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,625
then things will work out.

142
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:27,585
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

143
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:34,835
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

144
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:39,295
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

145
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:48,665
Of course, with that beautiful idea

146
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:56,415
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

147
00:20:57,585 --> 00:21:00,915
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

148
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,915
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

149
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:10,415
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

150
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:15,375
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

151
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:21,375
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

152
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:29,955
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

153
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:36,795
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

154
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:41,295
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

155
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:45,875
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

156
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,415
and that you cannot do it.

157
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:56,585
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

158
00:21:57,585 --> 00:22:02,505
because looks there’s a very little distance

159
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:08,415
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

160
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:11,835
It is a very difficult task sometimes

161
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:20,455
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

162
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:25,915
At that point I find some of you fail.

163
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:31,455
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

164
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:36,335
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

165
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:40,585
it’s best is to introspect,

166
00:22:41,955 --> 00:22:44,955
“Am I doing everything right?

167
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:51,795
How am I working for my betterment?”

168
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,545
The illusion is such

169
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,505
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

170
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,625
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

171
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:05,375
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

172
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:12,375
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

173
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,455
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

174
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:19,755
The purpose should be

175
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:22,665
that you should be able to see yourself within.

176
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,415
You must see what is the problem inside,

177
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:34,955
and you can very well understand

178
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:42,255
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

179
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:50,295
For example, there’s a very big building,

180
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:57,335
and all the buildings in the nearby area

181
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:02,625
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

182
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:09,585
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

183
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:13,915
is constructed on very solid grounds.

184
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,455
In the same way

185
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,835
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

186
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:25,705
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

187
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:29,665
and every person has to do that.

188
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,875
For example, some people told Me,

189
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:35,665
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

190
00:24:35,955 --> 00:24:38,415
they are big show-offs and that.”

191
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:43,705
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

192
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:47,915
that they could be like that.

193
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:52,585
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

194
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:05,915
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

195
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:10,955
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

196
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:15,835
I said, “Myself I know everything,

197
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:20,415
but I want you to know everything.”

198
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:26,955
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

199
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:30,665
– but find out faults within yourself.

200
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:35,335
What are these things that are strangling us?

201
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:45,955
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

202
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:54,415
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

203
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,375
you have to know how you are driving,

204
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:02,545
you have to see what are the problems.

205
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,705
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

206
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:09,795
– it won’t work out.

207
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:16,625
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

208
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:21,585
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

209
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,835
joyous thing.

210
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:35,415
But this joy is not for ourselves;

211
00:26:35,705 --> 00:26:38,375
this joy is for the whole world.

212
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:41,955
We have to work for the whole world.

213
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:47,915
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

214
00:26:48,835 --> 00:26:53,295
but what are you doing for others?

215
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,375
That you should see for yourself,

216
00:26:57,915 --> 00:27:04,705
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

217
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:10,795
because they have concern, they have care,

218
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:13,755
and they are doing something for others.

219
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:20,255
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

220
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:26,625
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

221
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:32,375
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

222
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:35,585
that we have to do something ourselves

223
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:40,755
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

224
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:49,875
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

225
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:57,665
to make this light unshaky

226
00:27:59,705 --> 00:28:04,255
and full of enthusiasm.

227
00:28:05,705 --> 00:28:11,415
It’s there. It is you who are

228
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:16,835
anxious to fill your pitchers.

229
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,505
You can do it.

230
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:26,625
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

231
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:31,665
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

232
00:28:34,705 --> 00:28:37,415
complete picture about yourself,

233
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:45,295
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

234
00:28:47,335 --> 00:28:50,955
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

235
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:55,755
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

236
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:01,915
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

237
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:05,915
what is the aim of our lives?

238
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:14,915
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

239
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:21,755
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

240
00:29:22,505 --> 00:29:28,875
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

241
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:33,665
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

242
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:37,255
then can you imagine what will happen?

243
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,795
Think of that dream I have,

244
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:47,415
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

245
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:52,455
and we have to transform them into good people.

246
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,415
If they are not transformed

247
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,955
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

248
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:03,505
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

249
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:10,955
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

250
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:16,625
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

251
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,795
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

252
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:27,255
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

253
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,255
– you have now overcome it.

254
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:35,335
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

255
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:42,255
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

256
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:49,255
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

257
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,415
your method of working it out,

258
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:57,955
your anxiety to work it out.

259
00:30:58,505 --> 00:31:02,665
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

260
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:07,755
You can transform anyone.

261
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:11,665
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

262
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:14,625
Like when we came in the plane,

263
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,505
I found at the airport so many people

264
00:31:18,755 --> 00:31:21,335
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

265
00:31:21,665 --> 00:31:25,415
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

266
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:31,295
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

267
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:35,295
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

268
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:37,835
” They didn’t know anything about it,

269
00:31:38,255 --> 00:31:40,455
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

270
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,625
Then what is this cool coming?

271
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:48,415
That basically they are there to get their realization,

272
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:52,335
only we have to extend our ideals,

273
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:55,835
we have to extend our love to them.

274
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,835
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

275
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:04,455
better is to give them a chance

276
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:11,625
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

277
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:16,955
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

278
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:21,705
It’s over now. You will be amazed

279
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:26,705
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

280
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:32,665
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

281
00:32:36,795 --> 00:32:40,295
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

282
00:32:41,665 --> 00:32:44,665
You have to have more and more of candles,

283
00:32:45,415 --> 00:32:47,545
and that’s what is your job.

284
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:51,795
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

285
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:58,795
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

286
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:02,875
at any cost, at any place?

287
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:09,625
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

288
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:15,295
I asked them, “What did you do?”

289
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:17,625
They said, “No, nothing.”

290
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:20,295
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

291
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,505
“No, nothing.”

292
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:26,955
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

293
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:29,875
If you have done nothing,

294
00:33:30,705 --> 00:33:33,455
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

295
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:37,915
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

296
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:43,335
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

297
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:48,625
we are coming from a program.”

298
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:51,835
“How are you so late?”

299
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:56,545
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

300
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:59,375
“So you were waiting outside?”

301
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:00,705
“Yes.” “How many?”

302
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:04,415
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

303
00:34:04,755 --> 00:34:07,545
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

304
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:10,505
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

305
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,875
“But you were realized souls?”

306
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:15,665
“No, we had our realization,

307
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:18,705
that sometimes we have to wait too.

308
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:23,375
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

309
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:27,455
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

310
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,795
Only we do it to ourselves.”

311
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:33,255
So again I will say introspection

312
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:36,665
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,705
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

314
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:49,705
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

315
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:56,625
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

316
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:02,755
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

317
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:07,255
– how timely they were! It never happened,

318
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:11,545
in the history of this world it never happened;

319
00:35:11,705 --> 00:35:16,705
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

320
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:21,455
give a new experience of the showers?

321
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:25,665
All this is a time, we should say,

322
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:33,255
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

323
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:37,705
that this is the time for a special thing.

324
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:41,755
Normally I get letters

325
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:47,335
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

326
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:49,625
this is sick, all kinds of things.

327
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,705
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

328
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,755
then somebody has children, they are sick –

329
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,795
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

330
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:04,755
The reason is they

331
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:07,375
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

332
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:10,625
or maybe they are halfway,

333
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:13,415
because they could themself say

334
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,505
that “Why should we write to Mother?

335
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,665
We can get it done ourselves.”

336
00:36:20,415 --> 00:36:23,335
Instead of that, one has to write

337
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:27,295
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

338
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:31,415
how they have got love from others,

339
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:36,705
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

340
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:39,835
All this is much better to write,

341
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,705
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

342
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:49,625
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

343
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:53,705
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

344
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:58,585
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

345
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:03,415
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

346
00:37:03,705 --> 00:37:07,705
So let it be. That’s not your job,

347
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:10,705
you don’t have to work it out.

348
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:14,705
Even before coming I got letters like that:

349
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:18,545
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

350
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,455
So I asked this lady, I said,

351
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:25,545
“Why do you write all these things

352
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:29,255
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

353
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:32,335
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

354
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:33,705
“How?”

355
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:37,955
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

356
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:41,875
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

357
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:46,335
This looks like advertising or something,

358
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:49,955
speciality that you should cure somebody,

359
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,795
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:55,955
We just don’t want such people to come.

361
00:37:57,585 --> 00:38:01,755
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

362
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:05,415
and understanding, and the wisdom.

363
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,665
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

364
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,835
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

365
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,755
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

366
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:22,335
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

367
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:28,835
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

368
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:30,875
You have to respect yourself.

369
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:35,295
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

370
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:40,545
Like understanding,

371
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:47,955
wisdom that we have come here for a

372
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:52,955
very,  very special work of very high quality:

373
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:59,505
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

374
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:03,335
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

375
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:08,705
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

376
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:12,755
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

377
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:16,625
And all my relations are now saying,

378
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,705
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

379
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:23,505
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

380
00:39:25,295 --> 00:39:29,705
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

381
00:39:30,915 --> 00:39:34,255
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

382
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,625
that “all my family people are saying ...

383
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:39,915
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

384
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,585
If this marriage doesn’t become

385
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,665
all right, then they will say there’s

386
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:48,835
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

387
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:55,455
We have not committed that way.

388
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:01,455
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

389
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:02,665
father, this, that.

390
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:07,295
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

391
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,705
You yourself can cure them

392
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:15,585
you can work it out yourself.

393
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:20,585
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

394
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,415
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

395
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,625
“Mother?" " No.”

396
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:30,255
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

397
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:36,255
So why are you asking Me?

398
00:40:36,915 --> 00:40:39,415
What relationship I have with them?

399
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:43,705
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

400
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:48,665
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

401
00:40:50,585 --> 00:40:53,295
It is impossible to understand.

402
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:58,875
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

403
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:05,255
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

404
00:41:05,705 --> 00:41:09,375
you can give them and fix them properly.

405
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:13,875
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

406
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:18,335
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

407
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:19,875
all kinds of things

408
00:41:20,585 --> 00:41:25,455
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

409
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:30,455
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

410
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,335
What you should do is to see

411
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:37,835
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

412
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:40,755
And you must tell them,

413
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,335
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

414
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,295
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:41:48,415 --> 00:41:51,415
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

416
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:56,505
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

417
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,955
so everybody comes there.

418
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:03,795
I would request you on a Diwali day

419
00:42:04,295 --> 00:42:08,755
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

420
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:11,545
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

421
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:16,915
” It’s very important,

422
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,955
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

423
00:42:23,915 --> 00:42:25,795
and on wrong basis.

424
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:29,335
If you have some intelligence

425
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:32,755
you must know that now you belong

426
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:40,625
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

427
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:46,835
which are very few. In this world

428
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:53,705
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

429
00:42:54,915 --> 00:43:00,875
to see that this quality

430
00:43:02,755 --> 00:43:04,955
must be in so many people,

431
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:08,955
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

432
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,835
Find out such people, tell them

433
00:43:13,455 --> 00:43:15,795
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

434
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:20,835
But don’t worry about things

435
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:23,915
which are of no value to us.

436
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:27,335
You must know you are a special race.

437
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:30,625
You are special soldiers

438
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:36,705
who have been trained

439
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,455
for doing Sahaj work only.

440
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:45,665
So wasting energy on your relations

441
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:49,835
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

442
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:55,665
It is to be understood now

443
00:43:57,335 --> 00:44:01,875
that you have your own energy reserved

444
00:44:03,545 --> 00:44:07,585
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

445
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:15,295
You should help everyone

446
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:18,455
who is a Sahaja yogi

447
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:20,955
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

448
00:44:22,795 --> 00:44:25,455
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

449
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:29,915
you must help them; because we are one Personality

450
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,625
and these are all the different hands

451
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:39,415
of one Personality, one God.

452
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:45,505
So this oneness must be established

453
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:52,875
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

454
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:58,415
There are some people who are very active.

455
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:04,375
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

456
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:12,335
All that will work out, I’m sure,

457
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:18,545
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

458
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:23,665
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

459
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,545
nothing will work out.

460
00:45:30,955 --> 00:45:34,625
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

461
00:45:34,795 --> 00:45:39,545
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

462
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:43,915
All the armament they have, everything they have;

463
00:45:44,665 --> 00:45:46,505
but we need more.

464
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:51,915
And for that we have to work out collectively,

465
00:45:52,915 --> 00:45:55,585
must plan what should we do.

466
00:45:57,585 --> 00:46:00,755
Recently there has been a big

467
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:06,545
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

468
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:11,375
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

469
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:20,415
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

470
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,955
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

471
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:29,915
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

472
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:33,375
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

473
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:37,955
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

474
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,665
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:46:45,255 --> 00:46:48,505
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

476
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,705
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

477
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:59,795
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

478
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:05,875
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

479
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:11,875
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

480
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:17,875
And you will definitely try to correct it,

481
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:19,915
if you love them

482
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:23,505
– or you give up.

483
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:28,915
These are special people, specially selected

484
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:31,755
for a very special cause,

485
00:47:32,255 --> 00:47:36,375
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

486
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:39,545
That is one thing you should know.

487
00:47:40,505 --> 00:47:42,795
On this Diwali day you have to know

488
00:47:43,545 --> 00:47:46,455
that you have to burn yourself

489
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:53,795
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

490
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,915
But don’t do it too much.

491
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,585
Like some people came and told Me,

492
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:04,545
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

493
00:48:04,665 --> 00:48:06,875
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

494
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:09,545
Still we are not good.”

495
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:12,625
So I said, “Why should you give up?

496
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:16,625
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

497
00:48:17,335 --> 00:48:20,295
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

498
00:48:20,705 --> 00:48:25,755
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

499
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:31,625
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

500
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:36,255
Such half-baked people are no good,

501
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,375
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

502
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:43,625
They don’t deserve any attention.

503
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:49,455
That is very much to be understood,

504
00:48:50,335 --> 00:48:52,455
that you should not be also like that,

505
00:48:52,955 --> 00:48:55,665
nor you should have friends like that,.

506
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:58,875
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

507
00:48:59,705 --> 00:49:03,375
Sahaja yogi is a special character

508
00:49:03,585 --> 00:49:07,335
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

509
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:15,835
That kind of a personality when you will have,

510
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:20,505
there will be lights all over.

511
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:28,505
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

512
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:33,375
and I want you to respect yourself

513
00:49:34,415 --> 00:49:38,375
and understand what is the position of

514
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:41,295
your being in this

515
00:49:44,755 --> 00:49:49,795
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

516
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,705
And how are we working it out?

517
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:57,505
The attention should move from

518
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:01,705
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

519
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:07,335
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

520
00:50:09,955 --> 00:50:13,455
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

521
00:50:14,665 --> 00:50:20,505
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

522
00:50:22,455 --> 00:50:25,415
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

523
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:27,585
May God bless you.
