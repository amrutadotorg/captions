00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.320
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.720
to this great country of yoga.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.640
Today first of all we have to establish

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.880
our desire within ourselves

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.640
that we are seekers

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.920
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.840
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.520
The whole universe

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.400
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.680
Your desires should be so intense

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.120
that they should emit out

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.800
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.920
which is the pure desire

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.440
of attaining the spirit.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.040
That's the real desire.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.400
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:54.360
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.480
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.440
and then to achieve it.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:20.080
And by intense desire of purity

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
you have to purify the whole world.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.120
Not only the seekers,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.480
but even those who are not seekers.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.200
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.200
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.720
the spirit.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.160
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.280
than Me, because I can manage,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.720
many more things within Myself,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.320
because everything is in My attention.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.320
But you try to purify your desires,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.440
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.400
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.680
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.680
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.400
That's more than sufficient.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.040
Then purify yourself.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.200
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.880
And once you are purified

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.040
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.040
it's very interesting.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.840
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.160
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.760
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.640
You all rise above that desire.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.720
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.560
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.480
that you are facing

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.920
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.840
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.200
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.840
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.400
The rest of it is My headache.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.760
Now the problems

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.880
that should take your desire on the collective

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.680
should be very different.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.560
To substantiate your purity,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.840
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.200
your attention should be on the other side.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.000
Now you are not facing Me,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.240
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.640
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.080
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.520
How can I give?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.880
What is my mistake in giving?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.520
I have to be more alert.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.960
Where is my attention?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.440
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.800
what am I doing?

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.960
What's my responsibility?'

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.920
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.160
You should be pure desire.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.040
That means you should be the spirit.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.080
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.320
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.120
should be manifested,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.680
should be complete.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.480
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.480
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.080
which is the work of God,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.600
which has started and you are My hands.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.440
You have to do the work of God,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.920
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.440
the satanic elements.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.080
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.800
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.560
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.400
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.080
I know this is going to happen.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.560
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.320
that sorting out will start.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.800
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.080
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.200
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.840
better and better and better.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.960
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.040
that is within you,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.240
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.920
works out everything.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.880
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.400
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.200
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.080
and not a cheap personality.

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.160
Every one of you

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:53.440
is worth the whole universe.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.640
If you want to rise to that height.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:07.360
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.400
If you want to rise to that height,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.960
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.880
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.760
on Mahakali Day.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.240
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.400
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.000
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.920
But according to Me,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.520
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.400
the desire to be pure,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.760
and to be cleansed out.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:05.120
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.360
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.080
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.040
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.160
It's not difficult.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.280
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.360
because what you surrender,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.440
I don't want anything from you,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.640
except that you accept My Love.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.600
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.600
Give up this ego.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.880
That's all and it will work out.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.240
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.680
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.760
and I'll definitely settle down there.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.800
May God bless you for today's puja,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.560
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.200
that the subtlest of subtle

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.840
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.960
every way, and the Love,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.240
which culminates into joy.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:24.680
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.960
will manifest in today's puja.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.840
May God bless you!
