00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.275
Sorry, I have to say something before entering in,

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:27.646
but it is good that it has happened,

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:31.581
because now I have to tell you some things important in life

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.976
and that is specially for ladies I have to tell this.

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:41.616
I've noticed - of course, I am also a woman

00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:48.542
that women have certain water powers of crying, weeping

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:52.782
and, thinking they're very miserable

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:56.695
and making everybody miserable. This is their power.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.207
I've noticed this.

00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:04.481
I mean this song is the worst song you could sing on any day whatsoever,

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.822
but it has come into somebody's head,

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:10.158
is very negative and not only that,

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:12.690
but it shows a person who can never be happy

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.965
and doesn't want anybody to be happy.

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:21.176
So inside every woman, there is a motherhood,

00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:28.668
there's great capacities, sacrifice, everything is there.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:33.279
With that, they also should know they're left-sided.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:44.169
And our joy about which we talk within our heart

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.518
has to manifest outside.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.395
People should see that we are joyous,

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:54.870
that we are happy people,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.319
that we are not like others who start crying for small things.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:03.918
Like when My father died,

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:06.915
I was surprised that suddenly I became thoughtless,

00:02:06.915 --> 00:02:09.238
absolutely thoughtless.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:12.129
For about three days I was thoughtless.

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.371
Neither the thought of pain or the thought of unhappiness or anything came up,

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.394
but just thoughtless.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:26.186
And everybody was surprised

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:30.553
because I looked after him and, I mean, he was very attached to Me,

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.016
very fond of me, everything was there.

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:38.070
They were surprised how easily I became suddenly thoughtless.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.302
So if you are a Sahaja Yogini, then at the time of crisis

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.937
you should become thoughtless. That's one of the signs.

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:48.281
I have seen with Myself, if there is any crisis in the family,

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.844
I just become thoughtless. That means what?

00:02:51.844 --> 00:02:56.746
That God just takes you in your problems.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:04.079
He puts his hand, He puts His protection and He takes you out of it

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:10.224
and makes you absolutely thoughtless. And in that thoughtless

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:18.201
awareness you discover what is right, what is wrong.

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:22.038
So even in crisis,

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:27.432
this thoughtless awareness is all the time extremely alert.

00:03:27.432 --> 00:03:30.820
It becomes much more alert than normal.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.691
That's the sign of a Sahaja Yogi and sign of Sahaja Yogini.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.234
My job is to encourage you to tell you about your inner subtleties, your beauty.

00:03:43.234 --> 00:03:47.527
Now do you know what beautiful thing you are?

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.966
Let us talk about our inner beauty.

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:55.922
What are we?

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:00.494
Are we all these mad people?

00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:08.024
Are we all these people who are all the time are miserable?

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:11.443
Or are we all these people who are always fighting,

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.800
those who are hankering after things,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.133
whom this matter dominates?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.666
No, we are the Spirit.

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:33.839
We are the Spirit. We are the reflection of God Almighty,

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.822
which is Purity,

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:39.399
which is Truth,

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:42.722
which is Knowledge. We are that.

00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:45.970
We are not like ordinary people.

00:04:48.072 --> 00:04:50.626
How can we live on that level?

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:53.876
Only if you are possessed, if you had a bad guru

00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:57.059
or something like that, maybe you are going like a yo-yo,

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:00.270
going up and down, up and down, up and down,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.826
but those who have crossed all those limits

00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:08.887
have reached that state, should value that they are the Spirit

00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:13.532
so many Spirits sitting here, sitting, reflecting God Almighty.

00:05:13.532 --> 00:05:16.810
I am such a proud mother

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.375
and all of you are capable of enlightening so many people in this world.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.915
But the beauty within you is that you are absolutely independent

00:05:28.915 --> 00:05:31.677
of anybody else.

00:05:34.185 --> 00:05:37.352
You depend only upon yourself,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.211
upon the source of your Spirit,

00:05:41.211 --> 00:05:43.706
the joy of your Spirit.

00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:47.121
You don't expect others to give you joy.

00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:50.270
Supposing somebody tomorrow comes and abuses Me.

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:53.343
I'll say, "All right. It doesn't matter."

00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:59.910
It never touches Me because I am with Myself.

00:06:00.163 --> 00:06:02.756
He is saying these things.

00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:06.450
He will suffer or not suffer. That's not My department.

00:06:07.857 --> 00:06:11.176
When you start depending only upon yourself,

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:18.163
just imagine a house which is standing on rocks.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.565
Like that, you are.

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:29.210
Try to feel it. Feel the rock within you.

00:06:31.393 --> 00:06:34.842
Try to understand.

00:06:34.842 --> 00:06:38.679
You are not going to behave like other people.

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:39.340
It's all right,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.720
people who have built their houses on sands have to worry.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.359
Not we. We have built on rocks.

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:53.970
So we have to be very courageous. You have to be very bold.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.809
At the same time, extremely humble.

00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:02.150
When the tree is laden with fruits it bends down.

00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.559
So we worship the Mother Earth. We worship the sun.

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:06.922
We worship the moon.

00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:10.070
You worship everything around us which has helped us.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.474
We worship our parents, everyone.

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:18.087
But above all we worship ourselves.

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:23.819
Because we are worshipable.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.467
Now all of you have become saints.

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:29.353
That doesn't mean that you develop beards

00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:31.927
and have all funny dresses and all that.

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.538
Nothing of the kind.

00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:35.567
You are saints because inside you

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:44.579
there is the fragrance of beautiful fragrance of your lotus.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:47.359
That's the Spirit.

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.552
This is a lotus you have made for Me here.

00:07:50.552 --> 00:07:54.873
Such a beautiful lotus, I am sitting in a beautiful lotus.

00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:59.778
In the same way is reflected in your heart as a beautiful lotus.

00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:03.760
Feel that lotus,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.048
how beautiful, how delicate it is.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:19.395
It's pink because pink is the lotus which invites everyone,

00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:25.551
sign of generosity, of invitation.

00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:30.714
Pink colour attracts all kinds of insects, everybody.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.660
So lotus is pink and it invites everything,

00:08:45.216 --> 00:08:48.781
open to everything, not frightened of anything.

00:08:50.107 --> 00:08:53.131
But it comes out of the mire,

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:58.482
comes out of absolutely horrible ponds.

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:03.195
There are lots of worms going round it, all right,

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:15.482
but it emits the fragrance and makes the whole pond so beautiful.

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:18.209
That's what you are.

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:23.153
Wherever you'll be, you can create that beauty.

00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:27.417
You can flow that beauty.

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:36.916
You can make people see what a Spiritual person is.

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:41.001
You are the reflector of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:43.736
You have to reflect Sahaj Yoga.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:55.797
For such people are always in joy and wisdom.

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.582
Shri Ganesha is the giver of wisdom

00:10:02.582 --> 00:10:08.325
wisdom, how to behave at what time,

00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:11.128
how to say at what time,

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.908
how far to go with everything.

00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:14.857
It just should become innate,

00:10:14.857 --> 00:10:17.890
Sahaj. You don't have to work it out, but just know.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.172
"I am a Sahaja Yogini."

00:10:21.172 --> 00:10:26.205
Every morning you should tell yourself, "I am a Sahaja Yogini.

00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:31.705
So how far I should go? How should I behave?

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.433
What should be my attitude?"

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:39.458
All this can be very easily understood if

00:10:42.606 --> 00:10:45.815
you develop this lotus of wisdom.

00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:51.981
How does a lotus come out? There is a seed which sprouts.

00:10:53.897 --> 00:10:57.300
That's how the wisdom - there is already the seed within you.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.486
All of you have got and now it has started opening

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:02.414
because you are realised souls.

00:11:02.414 --> 00:11:05.598
Allow your wisdom to take over.

00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:10.854
So how do you do it?

00:11:12.592 --> 00:11:14.467
There's one way, I would say.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:18.734
"Supposing Mother had this problem, what She would have done?"

00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:20.651
a very good idea.

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:29.702
"How She would have dealt with it?"

00:11:29.702 --> 00:11:32.773
You may again say that we don't understand Mother's style.

00:11:32.773 --> 00:11:37.143
She's full of tricks. Correct. I am.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.691
But there's a very simple way of doing it.

00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.089
You can surrender it to My wisdom

00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:53.401
and the wisdom itself that is in you is active.

00:11:53.401 --> 00:11:55.707
It will work.

00:11:56.237 --> 00:12:01.077
This point also you should understand.

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.991
Wisdom within you is active.

00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:08.949
There was one gentleman working at the airport in London.

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:10.246
He's a Sahaja Yogi,

00:12:10.246 --> 00:12:13.895
but he doesn't come to the collective. He has no time.

00:12:13.895 --> 00:12:18.080
So somebody said something harsh to him.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.122
He went home and he said that "It's not good he said to me.

00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:25.321
After all, I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:32.590
And next day he heard the fellow has fallen from his bike.

00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:37.085
The gentleman might not have understood that

00:12:37.085 --> 00:12:38.983
because "He said all these things,

00:12:38.983 --> 00:12:41.307
that's why this has happened to me."

00:12:41.307 --> 00:12:45.067
But he knew because Deities are with you.

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:53.247
So in wisdom you understand that all the Deities are just with you

00:12:53.247 --> 00:12:57.375
and whatever happens to you, they're before you.

00:12:57.876 --> 00:13:02.321
Nobody can harm you. Nobody can touch you.

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:11.951
You are so protected. Lotuses are not protected.

00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:16.959
You are so protected that anybody tries to harm you,

00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:22.274
immediately there's protection.

00:13:22.274 --> 00:13:25.178
Also your own protection is there, as I said,

00:13:25.178 --> 00:13:28.879
that you jump into thoughtless awareness.

00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:33.823
We harm ourselves more than anybody else can sometimes.

00:13:37.126 --> 00:13:39.295
One friend of mine I knew,

00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:41.701
she was from very childhood she was like that,

00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:44.118
always crying for everything.

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:46.385
Always she used to cry

00:13:46.385 --> 00:13:49.763
for nothing at all because she was such a spoiled child

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:52.766
that she used to always cry.

00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:56.394
Now, was surprised to see at a very young age she became blind.

00:13:56.394 --> 00:13:58.973
I said, "How did you become so blind?"

00:13:58.973 --> 00:14:02.668
She had to use a very thick glass and all that.

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:05.917
She said, "I used to cry so much, you remember."

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:11.286
I said, "That I remember, but did you cry even after school?"

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.801
"Yes, I was always crying like this."

00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:19.024
So it's a kind of a personality you develop

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:22.647
that "I'm like that, I just cry."

00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:26.532
But why not develop a personality that, "I am always in joy?"

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.345
Anything I see, I feel joyous. Anything I hear, I feel joy.

00:14:33.766 --> 00:14:39.633
Then this lotus of your fragrance will improve

00:14:43.068 --> 00:14:49.929
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:14:50.194 --> 00:15:00.553
that you will take all that is very beautiful easily.

00:15:01.168 --> 00:15:06.217
You'll get all that is very satisfying, very joyous.

00:15:06.217 --> 00:15:11.014
It's kind of an activity of this wisdom within you

00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:15.477
which just leads you to people who are extremely nice,

00:15:16.704 --> 00:15:19.308
to situations which are very beautiful

00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:24.547
where you discover nice things

00:15:28.062 --> 00:15:42.476
or to such beautiful creations that you would never expect to see.

00:15:46.608 --> 00:15:52.568
It's very, very important to understand that you tell Me,

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:55.126
"Mother, that this miracle happened, that miracle happened."

00:15:55.126 --> 00:16:03.721
Is nothing, is your own wisdom, your own Spirit is working it out.

00:16:04.298 --> 00:16:06.795
You don't have to do anything.

00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:10.214
Only thing you have to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogini

00:16:10.214 --> 00:16:14.580
and your character should be that of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:19.735
that your ideas should be that of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:22.150
Same with Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:30.071
Sahaja Yogis, being men, they don't show much,

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:32.322
but there are certain other ways of showing his temper.

00:16:34.908 --> 00:16:39.555
They get into tempers and sometimes the tempers are so much that

00:16:39.555 --> 00:16:42.965
you just start looking, "What's the matter with the person?"

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:46.456
One side the tempers, another side the crying.

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:49.918
I mean, in between, what remains? I don't know.

00:16:50.887 --> 00:16:55.375
Both things are absolutely not needed.

00:16:56.813 --> 00:16:59.214
You have to correct people, to say things.

00:16:59.214 --> 00:17:01.934
Just now I had to say something. I've said it, finished.

00:17:01.934 --> 00:17:08.052
But it's not anger. It just - I have to act.

00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:12.600
The difference is like this - I'm not involved with it.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.205
Even if I cry, I'm not involved. I'm just crying.

00:17:17.205 --> 00:17:20.588
Even if I am angry, I am not really angry.

00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:25.300
I am just trying to be angry in an acting.

00:17:27.154 --> 00:17:29.091
That's what happens.

00:17:30.357 --> 00:17:32.709
You do not get involved into it.

00:17:32.709 --> 00:17:35.345
But if you get involved into your anger,

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:38.236
then the joy is finished, completely finished.

00:17:42.502 --> 00:17:48.645
Some people think also that if you are joyous you have to be very serious.

00:17:48.645 --> 00:17:50.487
Not at all.

00:17:50.487 --> 00:17:53.468
What is there to be serious? What is to be serious in this world?

00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:55.619
Everything is stupidity.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:58.818
I don't find anything serious in this world.

00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:02.263
And I can't keep serious for more than three minutes.

00:18:04.062 --> 00:18:07.029
Sometimes people take advantage of that, but what can I do?

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:08.254
That's My nature.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.098
What's so serious? You don't have to create sun.

00:18:11.098 --> 00:18:15.244
You don't have to create moon. You don't have to create Mother Earth.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.878
What's so serious? What great jobs have you to do?

00:18:20.878 --> 00:18:25.293
Everything is there for you. Just enjoy.

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:29.441
What is there to be so serious?

00:18:29.441 --> 00:18:33.550
Some people, you know, try to impress also by their seriousness.

00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:40.024
Once I saw a lady standing, very seriously thinking.

00:18:40.024 --> 00:18:42.267
I said, "What is the problem?"

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:45.996
"I don't know how to broom this thing. See, I don't have a broom."

00:18:45.996 --> 00:18:49.659
I said, "Such a big problem is there as if the heavens are falling.

00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:52.194
Doesn't matter today you don't do it.

00:18:52.194 --> 00:18:55.860
You can do it tomorrow. What is so important?"

00:18:56.329 --> 00:18:58.742
I mean if you don't have something, it's all right.

00:18:58.742 --> 00:19:01.973
"No, no, no, I must do it. You see, I'm very house-proud."

00:19:01.973 --> 00:19:05.015
I said, "That's the main problem which is serious."

00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:11.354
So because you suffer from some serious, stupid problems,

00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:15.717
that's why you become serious.

00:19:16.277 --> 00:19:20.853
And, by becoming serious, if you think your problems will be solved they will not.

00:19:20.853 --> 00:19:24.628
At the same time, I must tell you we should not be frivolous.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:28.758
We should not be vulgar and not frivolous.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:32.249
That's not - see these flowers.

00:19:32.597 --> 00:19:35.543
Look at them. They are shaking with My vibrations.

00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:38.584
But look at them, in their own dignity.

00:19:38.584 --> 00:19:41.923
They're going to die tomorrow. They are not bothered

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.294
as long as they are all right there in their own place,

00:19:46.684 --> 00:19:49.961
giving you pleasure and happiness, finished.

00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:54.389
What is the use of a light?

00:19:54.389 --> 00:19:57.637
Let us see, as a light, as we are. To give the light.

00:19:59.587 --> 00:20:03.390
So, we are here to give joy, happiness to everyone,

00:20:04.435 --> 00:20:06.760
to make everyone happy.

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:12.006
There are so many ways of making others happy.

00:20:12.937 --> 00:20:15.263
And for that, we have to learn also.

00:20:15.465 --> 00:20:19.210
So many things we have to learn, how to make others happy.

00:20:19.463 --> 00:20:25.172
And then when you make them happy, then you feel that joy within yourself.

00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:28.760
"Oh, they're so happy." See their happiness,

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.257
then only this lotus opens out much more.

00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:43.235
Like a ripple moves and moves to the end of the shores

00:20:43.719 --> 00:20:48.637
and then from the shore it returns back.

00:20:49.387 --> 00:20:53.786
In the same way, when your joy reaches the joy of others,

00:20:54.471 --> 00:21:00.598
then the ripples that come up make a beautiful pattern of your eye.

00:21:00.805 --> 00:21:02.861
Just think of such situations

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:06.043
where you did something good to others,

00:21:06.043 --> 00:21:08.662
being very nice to others

00:21:08.872 --> 00:21:12.577
and then you found the joy in that person

00:21:12.577 --> 00:21:16.119
and how that joy came back to you.

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:20.986
Think of that pattern that you felt so subtlety in your life,

00:21:20.986 --> 00:21:22.472
how it is built in.

00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:25.543
Whenever you think of that time or that moment

00:21:25.543 --> 00:21:33.112
or that area, whole picture comes to you

00:21:35.421 --> 00:21:40.960
and you think, "What a time!"

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.496
But that time is eternally within you,

00:21:44.496 --> 00:21:50.210
all the time and that's why is Diwali so important.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.349
You are all, as I said, you are My light.

00:21:53.687 --> 00:21:58.195
And the light is there which is an eternal light.

00:21:58.434 --> 00:22:00.538
These lights will be finished.

00:22:00.538 --> 00:22:03.548
We'll have to light them every year. Not you people.

00:22:03.548 --> 00:22:09.665
You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.366
What's the problem of this world?

00:22:12.704 --> 00:22:14.672
The whole problem, you take it.

00:22:15.291 --> 00:22:20.680
There's no joy. Simple as that

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.097
there's no joy.

00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:27.335
If they had joy, they would not have done all these nonsensical things.

00:22:27.335 --> 00:22:30.149
There's no joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight,

00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:33.142
you don't want to do anything that is harmful.

00:22:33.142 --> 00:22:35.651
You don't want to say anything after anyone,

00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:42.547
not only that but you do not want to have something that will spoil this Mother Earth

00:22:42.547 --> 00:22:44.785
or which will bring ecological problem.

00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:46.715
No, you just don't want it,

00:22:46.715 --> 00:22:50.350
don't want to do anything because it harms others.

00:22:52.251 --> 00:22:57.509
People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere.

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:02.579
You just feel that "Why should I do such a thing

00:23:02.934 --> 00:23:10.447
which is not so congenial to others?" I mean, it's not joy-giving.

00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:14.430
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.240
and if you are not joy-giving

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.278
that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga

00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:22.995
and that's why we have to come up now.

00:23:22.995 --> 00:23:27.974
We have to become Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.587
That is joy-giving society.

00:23:31.587 --> 00:23:33.496
We can change our name, if you like.

00:23:33.496 --> 00:23:40.000
If Sahaja Yoga is not good - Joy Giving Association.

00:23:56.376 --> 00:24:00.687
Now also we should find out what kills the joy.

00:24:00.687 --> 00:24:05.099
That's important. What kills the joy?

00:24:07.394 --> 00:24:09.592
First I said you must have wisdom.

00:24:09.592 --> 00:24:12.806
Wisdom means that it gives you detachment,

00:24:12.806 --> 00:24:21.408
detachment from all that is selfishness,

00:24:21.408 --> 00:24:23.258
self-centredness, self-obsession, ego

00:24:32.336 --> 00:24:36.206
all connected with self. Can you imagine?

00:24:36.707 --> 00:24:42.962
Selfish, the Self, means the Spirit.

00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:51.161
Selfishness is what?

00:24:51.161 --> 00:24:55.800
Is the one that completely darkens the Self

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.033
because you think of yourself,

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:04.402
your children, your family, that's all.

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:09.563
At the most, even that sometimes - sometimes it's only yourself.

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:16.724
And when you start thinking like that

00:25:17.289 --> 00:25:24.654
and when you start becoming smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:28.054
the lotus collapses.

00:25:33.907 --> 00:25:38.782
But to think about others is so great.

00:25:40.239 --> 00:25:43.090
In My case is different.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.619
If I think about Myself really, I tell you,

00:25:46.619 --> 00:25:50.950
I feel very happy, nice, joyous, I must tell you, I must confess.

00:25:51.556 --> 00:25:56.035
But some people I think of, immediately My chakras start catching

00:25:56.316 --> 00:26:01.462
and I feel, "Oh, God, why did I think of such a person?"

00:26:01.462 --> 00:26:05.335
I mean, their chakras start moving fast for that person.

00:26:05.335 --> 00:26:11.291
But this body is so generous that you can't imagine even if I see somebody,

00:26:11.291 --> 00:26:16.100
suddenly the chakras start working as if I'm responsible

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.301
for everybody's chakras which are gone off,

00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:24.227
which I am in a way, but to such an extent.

00:26:24.597 --> 00:26:32.207
But still I think about people who are in trouble,

00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:34.460
about every one of you.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.140
Why? Why do I think?

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:44.563
Because I know that if I can improve your chakras, you'll be happy.

00:26:45.723 --> 00:26:48.873
I don't have to logically go to that point,

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:53.149
but just My body knows it. And it works.

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:55.923
It works and feels very happy.

00:26:55.923 --> 00:26:57.980
When I see somebody getting their Realisation

00:26:58.292 --> 00:27:00.463
it's such a great joy to Me.

00:27:00.463 --> 00:27:04.009
When I see somebody being relieved of the problem,

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:05.704
such a joy to Me

00:27:05.704 --> 00:27:15.874
because joy-giving is the character, nature of Spirit.

00:27:18.747 --> 00:27:23.054
If you do not allow your Spirit to fulfill its own nature

00:27:23.676 --> 00:27:24.776
and its own character,

00:27:29.686 --> 00:27:33.893
Spirit is not going to manifest itself.

00:27:34.254 --> 00:27:36.112
So you are the vehicle.

00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:44.642
You are the lamp, you can say, as far as body, mind is concerned.

00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:50.497
But this light of Spirit, if it has to manifest,

00:27:50.497 --> 00:27:55.317
then it has to be of a very unique type

00:27:55.317 --> 00:27:58.095
that it emits all its light outside.

00:27:58.497 --> 00:28:03.113
It gives light to others.

00:28:06.862 --> 00:28:12.054
And this light-giving quality, you have to improve.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:18.546
Gradually you'll be surprised, only if you try in your life,

00:28:19.091 --> 00:28:23.522
in your relationships, in your endeavors,

00:28:23.522 --> 00:28:31.133
to give light to others, to make their lives better,

00:28:31.445 --> 00:28:33.991
not to show off, not to be egotistical,

00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:38.190
but in a very loving, beautiful manner,

00:28:39.057 --> 00:28:41.664
you'll really understand

00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:46.943
that you are the Spirit because Spirit loves.

00:28:47.956 --> 00:28:49.846
It loves.

00:28:50.722 --> 00:28:55.242
And in love you are forgiving, very forgiving.

00:28:55.242 --> 00:28:59.721
Sometimes, you know, leaders get angry with Me that I'm rather forgiving.

00:28:59.721 --> 00:29:01.668
What can I do? That's My nature.

00:29:01.668 --> 00:29:04.449
I can't help it.

00:29:04.449 --> 00:29:09.734
Because I love, you know.

00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:13.089
If you love a person, you do forgive.

00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:15.510
You don't feel bad.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:20.066
Not to forgive is difficult, but to forgive is the best.

00:29:20.066 --> 00:29:24.422
At least, when you forgive there's no headache for you.

00:29:24.727 --> 00:29:30.483
So this Love, which is Joy. Actually, I think,

00:29:30.483 --> 00:29:36.167
when this love melts and flows like a river

00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:49.472
and gives nourishment to all the surrounding trees on the shores,

00:29:51.716 --> 00:29:54.157
that is the time,

00:29:54.157 --> 00:30:02.468
is the completion of the individuality or a personality

00:30:02.468 --> 00:30:08.845
of that love and that's the time, it feels fulfilled.

00:30:08.845 --> 00:30:14.389
It's not just that you have a light in the corner,

00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:23.314
but it has to flow. It has to move. It has to nourish.

00:30:23.314 --> 00:30:29.549
Love is not something dead, like a stone.

00:30:30.517 --> 00:30:36.090
When it melts, it encompasses everything

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.021
and everything becomes very beautiful with that.

00:30:40.021 --> 00:30:44.371
So you have to first understand that

00:30:44.371 --> 00:30:47.536
life is for giving joy to others

00:30:47.536 --> 00:30:52.921
because you are now saints and your light has to give Joy.

00:30:52.921 --> 00:30:58.164
Little bit you have to bear. You have powers to bear.

00:30:58.164 --> 00:31:01.895
You have all the powers and so I wish you

00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:08.119
good luck for the next year and great prosperity.

00:31:08.119 --> 00:31:10.501
May God bless you.
