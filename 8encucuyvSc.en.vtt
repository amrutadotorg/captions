00:02.120 --> 00:06.840
Now, the question is, for a modern man,
whether to believe

00:07.040 --> 00:10.120
that there are spirits or not.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.040
Because it’s a very unknown area.

00:14.240 --> 00:17.240
And the unknown area,

00:18.520 --> 00:23.760
unless and until it is fully explored
and found out,

00:23.960 --> 00:29.600
always creates a hallucination
that it is something divine.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.520
So we have to know even about spirits:

00:32.720 --> 00:37.760
who are they, how they act,
and how they work out.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.680
Now, many will say
that “We do not believe in spirits.”

00:40.880 --> 00:44.520
Whether you believe it or not —
but they are there.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.680
Christ, He was not a liar.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.320
He took out spirits
and put them in the pig.

00:49.520 --> 00:55.000
And He is the man who very clearly said
that “Keep away from the spirits.”

00:56.920 --> 00:59.960
The spirits are the people.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.040
We can be spirits tomorrow
if we want to be.

01:05.240 --> 01:09.320
When we die, we do not die fully.

01:09.520 --> 01:14.800
Only the element of earth,
which has created us…

01:15.600 --> 01:17.680
for appearance, or which is the…

01:17.880 --> 01:21.720
we can say, the Jala Tattva
[Water Principle], with the gross form —

01:21.920 --> 01:25.520
that portion only dies,
the rest of it remains.

01:25.720 --> 01:29.480
And it goes into an area

01:29.680 --> 01:32.520
which we call as Pretaloka
[the world of the dead],

01:32.720 --> 01:35.960
where it starts becoming
smaller and smaller

01:36.160 --> 01:39.520
till it comes to the size

01:40.320 --> 01:44.040
of a foetus,

01:45.040 --> 01:49.680
or, you can say, a very small foetus.

01:49.880 --> 01:52.880
It waits there.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.200
But some of the people, when they die,

01:58.400 --> 02:01.920
they are dissatisfied souls.

02:02.120 --> 02:06.760
In Sanskrit we call them
as atrupta atma [unsatisfied soul].

02:07.000 --> 02:12.400
Means, in life they have been hankering
after things too much,

02:12.680 --> 02:18.360
and they couldn’t get to their goals,
and they died.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.320
For example, a mother dies
during labour pains.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.320
Her child is born;
she sees the child and dies.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.360
She is worried
about looking after that child.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.720
A father dies suddenly in an accident.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.440
His children are left behind,

02:33.640 --> 02:37.520
and he is worried about his children
they’re looked after.

02:37.720 --> 02:41.320
There are some people
who are very ambitious in life —

02:41.520 --> 02:44.160
very, very ambitious —

02:44.360 --> 02:47.400
and they die before fulfilling
their ambitions.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.200
They also become spirits.

02:50.400 --> 02:55.160
There are people who have been tortured
and troubled and killed.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.080
They also die, and they don’t want
to live in the Pretaloka,

03:00.280 --> 03:03.880
but they want to trouble the people
who have troubled them.

03:04.080 --> 03:08.360
So there are types and types of people
who become spirits.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.520
We can divide them into two types.

03:12.840 --> 03:19.760
One type is the one
which is very aggressive,

03:22.840 --> 03:27.320
ambitious, egoistical,

03:27.520 --> 03:31.160
oppressive person,

03:31.360 --> 03:34.320
who dies and becomes a spirit.

03:34.520 --> 03:38.440
That area is known
as the supraconscious area.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.760
So many gurus and sadhus [ascetics]
who renounce the world

03:42.960 --> 03:46.160
and go to the Himalayas,
and break their necks,

03:46.360 --> 03:50.040
and do all kinds of frantic things,

03:50.240 --> 03:52.680
which we call as dravidi pranayam
[a roundabout way of doing a thing] —

03:52.880 --> 03:56.120
when they die without Realization,

03:56.320 --> 04:00.520
they also are
on the supraconscious side.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.360
And they remain on the right-hand side
of the human being.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.360
On the left-hand side…

04:10.560 --> 04:13.520
“Human being” because human being
is a reflection

04:13.720 --> 04:19.720
or, we can say, is the same microcosm
of the macrocosm, which is the Virata.

04:21.800 --> 04:26.520
Hence they are reflected
on the right-hand side of the Virata,

04:26.720 --> 04:29.040
and so we should say

04:29.240 --> 04:33.200
that they are available
on our right-hand side.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.680
The other ones,

04:35.880 --> 04:41.240
we can say that they are… they belong
to the category of the people

04:41.440 --> 04:43.720
who are suppressed, who are oppressed,

04:43.920 --> 04:46.280
who are tortured, who are troubled,

04:46.480 --> 04:49.760
who are debased, who are insulted.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.240
Such people, when they die,

04:53.440 --> 04:57.600
they want to take their revenge
by their sly methods.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.240
So they remain on the left-hand side
of the Virata

05:01.440 --> 05:05.280
and thus are reflected in us also,
in the collective subconscious,

05:05.480 --> 05:08.840
which is on the left-hand side.

05:12.560 --> 05:19.240
Basically, these are the two styles
of people who are becoming spirits.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.480
But there can be a mixture,
there can be every type of a spirit.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.680
There could be good spirits also,
good people,

05:27.880 --> 05:32.560
who are trying to only help
their families and things like that.

05:34.640 --> 05:40.040
These spirits try to manifest.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.560
For example,
the supraconscious type spirits.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.000
There was a doctor in London, who died.
His name was Dr Lang.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.200
When he died,
he had discovered lots of things,

05:55.400 --> 05:58.080
and he wanted to continue
with his practice in London —

05:58.280 --> 05:59.920
and he was a surgeon —

06:00.120 --> 06:02.960
but he could not do it,
because he suddenly died.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.320
So his spirit entered into a soldier

06:06.520 --> 06:10.640
who was living in…
who was fighting in Vietnam.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.520
And when the spirit entered into him

06:12.720 --> 06:15.200
and told him
that “I am such and such doctor,

06:15.400 --> 06:19.480
you must go and meet my son
and my brother

06:19.680 --> 06:23.280
and tell them that I am within you,”
the soldier could not believe it,

06:23.480 --> 06:27.200
but then he said
that “You come along with me,
and I’ll guide you to that place.”

06:27.400 --> 06:31.680
And he took him to that hospital
where this doctor was working.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.240
The hospital was closed,
the surgery was closed,

06:35.440 --> 06:39.800
so he went and saw the son,
and he told him about this spirit
entering into his body.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.040
The son could not believe it.

06:42.240 --> 06:45.160
So he said that “I will tell you
all the secrets of our life

06:45.360 --> 06:47.760
that we spent together
and which no one knows.”

06:47.960 --> 06:49.960
And when he started
telling him all these things,

06:50.160 --> 06:52.560
he was amazed, he said,
“All right, I’ll open the centre.”

06:52.760 --> 06:54.880
So they opened
a very-big-news organization

06:55.080 --> 07:01.080
known as Late Dr Lang’s International
Curative Centre in London.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.480
Now, this organization
started working long time back,

07:04.680 --> 07:07.520
about, I think, eleven
or twelve years back.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.320
Actually, I came to know about it
because somebody who was suffering

07:10.520 --> 07:13.160
from the treatment
of one of these people,

07:13.360 --> 07:15.480
she came to Me
and she told Me all about this,

07:15.680 --> 07:20.480
and she gave Me a pamphlet
in which they had written
all this story about Dr Lang.

07:20.680 --> 07:24.720
And what they used to say —
that “You should write to us
about your illness whatever it is.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.440
And when you write to us,
then we will organize it in such a way

07:27.640 --> 07:31.800
that at such a time, at such a point,
at such a place —

07:32.000 --> 07:33.440
whichever place you suggest —

07:33.640 --> 07:36.160
something will happen to you:
you’ll start shaking in the body

07:36.360 --> 07:39.720
and you’ll get those spirits into you
and you’ll be cured.”

07:39.920 --> 07:43.640
It happened with this lady,
the one who came to Me first
when she told Me.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.480
Then afterwards I’ve met many of them,
even in England I’ve met some of them.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.240
So, when she came to Me…

07:50.440 --> 07:54.160
You see, what was her trouble was…
she said that “I had some trouble.”

07:54.360 --> 07:56.800
I think she had some minor trouble,
which was cured

07:57.000 --> 07:59.680
but was very inconvenient thing
for her —

07:59.880 --> 08:02.200
sort of a… it was a nuisance,
the trouble was.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.160
She was definitely cured with that.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.320
But after, say, five, six years or so,

08:08.520 --> 08:11.120
she started, you see,
shaking her body completely.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.160
Her nervousness was so much
that she couldn’t see Me.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.280
When she sat before Me,
she started shaking,

08:16.480 --> 08:18.520
her hands started shaking,
body started shaking

08:18.720 --> 08:21.320
as if a lunatic would do that
before Me.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.160
So I told her, “See, this gentleman
has come from lunatic asylum,

08:24.360 --> 08:26.360
and he is behaving the same way
as you are behaving.”

08:26.560 --> 08:28.360
She says, “I know.
Because I have a pain here,

08:28.560 --> 08:30.880
I have a problem here…
And I know there’s something wrong.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.840
I am not thinking properly,
and I cannot remember anything.

08:34.040 --> 08:36.120
I am a lost soul,
and I know what has happened to me.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.720
Now what can You do about it?”

08:37.920 --> 08:39.720
Of course, I then cured her, no doubt.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.720
Because in Sahaja Yoga you can —

08:42.920 --> 08:44.840
through vibrations of love,

08:45.040 --> 08:47.520
this Divine Love
which I told you yesterday —

08:47.720 --> 08:52.120
you can give a bondage
to those spirits.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.720
By that bondage,

08:53.920 --> 08:57.800
you can make that bondage pass
into the Pretaloka, and they disappear.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.080
But some of these are controlled

09:00.280 --> 09:04.320
by some of these ambitious
so-called gurus.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.840
Now, these so-called gurus
that you know of —

09:07.040 --> 09:10.840
so-called, they call themselves gurus —
what do they do?

09:11.040 --> 09:14.320
They go… you see, if they find
some evil genius dies somewhere —

09:14.520 --> 09:17.120
they know he is an evil genius —
then they follow his body,

09:17.320 --> 09:20.800
they go to smashan [burning-ground],
they try to collect a part of his body,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.320
and they keep it with them.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.000
Now, the spirit, till thirteen days,
moves around the body,

09:27.200 --> 09:30.720
and it starts watching
what is the body doing.

09:30.920 --> 09:36.080
So, when the spirit, you see,
sees that his own part of his body —

09:36.280 --> 09:38.840
which is to form again
in his own body later on —

09:39.040 --> 09:41.560
is missing through these people
and they will be doing something,

09:41.760 --> 09:44.360
so it appears before them,
and they know how to talk.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.120
It’s easy to talk.
Even ordinary spirit person,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.360
if he comes here,
I can make them talk,

09:49.560 --> 09:51.760
and they talk quite a lot,
all kinds of nonsense,

09:51.960 --> 09:56.240
and they also tell about these people
what these people have been doing.

09:56.440 --> 10:01.840
So, that spirit then, you know,
is captured by these people,

10:02.040 --> 10:04.880
and they start using
these supraconscious spirits.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.080
These people being crooked

10:08.280 --> 10:14.280
and very intelligent people,

10:15.360 --> 10:18.080
they start acting into their hands.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.520
Now, these spirits
are given some names.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.000
Like, they can call them Ram, Krishna…

10:23.200 --> 10:24.440
Some people say Aim,

10:24.640 --> 10:27.680
some says Hrim, some says Klim —
all Goddess’s names, you see.

10:27.880 --> 10:31.160
They can even give the name of Jesus
or something like that.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.160
So, what happens — that, when these…
when you go to these gurus,

10:35.360 --> 10:38.280
then, when you ask them,
they say, “We’ll give you a mantra.”

10:38.480 --> 10:41.120
Now, you think that the mantra-giving
is a very great thing.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.120
You see, so many people
will come and tell Me —

10:43.320 --> 10:46.080
in Marathi also, Maharashtrians
are special ones for this —

10:46.280 --> 10:49.920
that “Mataji, mala kani guru mantra dila
[some guru gave me a mantra].”

10:50.120 --> 10:51.920
After all, a mantra can be given…

10:52.120 --> 10:54.440
say, kay dila mantra “Ram”
[what if mantra “Ram” is given]?

10:54.640 --> 10:57.880
Why do you need a guru
to tell you this? Use your brains!

10:58.080 --> 10:59.480
Now, they go on saying “Ram”,

10:59.680 --> 11:02.040
and this fellow has already connected
them with the Ram

11:02.240 --> 11:05.320
whom they have appointed
to get into this fellow.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.640
So the Ram enters into the psyche
of this person.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.240
Mostly it is through this Agnya Chakra,
which I told you.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.400
Yesterday I described
the whole Kundalini

11:13.600 --> 11:15.080
and its places and everything.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.680
So it enters through this
into the psyche.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.240
When it enters into the psyche
on the right-hand side,

11:20.440 --> 11:22.800
you see, on the ego side
it enters into,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.120
and it starts making the man
very egoistical.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.080
He’ll beat his wife,
he’ll beat his children,
he’ll rave and try to show off.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.320
Sometimes such a man
might get a promotion,

11:31.520 --> 11:32.800
and he’ll become so dynamic,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.640
he will… people will say,
“Oh, what has happened to him?” and…

11:35.840 --> 11:38.840
sort of, you see, his attention,
which was…

11:39.040 --> 11:41.000
was spent in doing other things,

11:41.200 --> 11:44.600
will be diverted
to very ambitious style of work.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.160
Now, he becomes very ambitious,
but he has no dharma in him,

11:48.360 --> 11:50.720
no love in him, no compassion in him,

11:50.920 --> 11:53.560
but he becomes
a very so-called successful man.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.200
For a short time.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.160
But after… I’ve met many like them
in Delhi also,

12:00.360 --> 12:02.720
those who have been
“initiated” like that

12:02.920 --> 12:08.480
by paying quite a lot of money
to these swamis and sadhus —

12:08.680 --> 12:11.280
and before Me
they were just rattling like this.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.000
And they said, “Mataji, this is such a lot
we are rattling before You,

12:15.200 --> 12:19.520
but even if we take a… even if we burn
a udbatti [kind of incense sticks]

12:19.720 --> 12:21.360
in the name of God Virata,

12:21.560 --> 12:25.360
we can’t go near a temple,
we can’t go near a church.

12:25.560 --> 12:28.600
If we see anything of God,
we start rattling like this.”

12:28.800 --> 12:31.040
And they all have resigned
from their jobs

12:31.240 --> 12:33.760
and are settled down
as useless people.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.400
This has happened to them
within five, six years time.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.320
Young people, very young.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.440
In Singapore I’ve met one fellow.
No, not — Kuala Lumpur.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.680
You would not believe
he is only twenty-two years of age,

12:45.880 --> 12:48.280
and he is like that now.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.520
And this is the supraconscious style —
they call it transcendental thought.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.600
This is the trance they use.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.040
So, just by giving you one name —
you must also think!

12:58.240 --> 13:02.920
After all, you cannot call like that
your God, the Almighty.

13:03.120 --> 13:06.200
By just a name?! How can you call Him!
Is He your servant?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.440
“Rama gari [fellow, man, man servant],
come along.” Can you call Him like this?

13:09.640 --> 13:13.600
“You do my job, You look after my father,
You look after my mother.”

13:13.800 --> 13:15.880
Who are you?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.880
Are you entitled to call like that?

13:18.080 --> 13:21.480
And can you just tell Him
that “You have to…

13:21.680 --> 13:23.800
You better look after everything
that I tell You,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.280
otherwise I’ll give You up.
I have no faith in You.”?

13:27.480 --> 13:31.400
The man in his ego starts thinking
these nonsensical things.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.400
You have to surrender to God.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.880
You have to become one with Him,
you have to be authorized.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.880
Then only you can ask His help.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.160
The another supraconscious people
are another type of…

13:42.360 --> 13:47.080
they work out in this way that, you see,
these people are the Hatha yogis —

13:47.280 --> 13:50.200
so-called Hatha yogis,
because I call them neo-Hatha yogis.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.640
They are not real Hatha yogis.

13:51.840 --> 13:56.560
The real Hatha yogis never stay
with the human… normal…

13:56.760 --> 13:58.600
what you call them…

13:58.800 --> 14:02.040
citizens of a city or a village.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.480
They stay in the forest with gurus.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.480
In the Patanjali Shastra,

14:07.680 --> 14:10.640
who is the original writer
of Hatha Yoga,

14:10.840 --> 14:13.640
he has told there are six things
a Hatha yogi has to do.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.520
He has to stay in the jungle
with a guru who is a realized soul,

14:17.720 --> 14:19.600
and he does not have to lead
a married life,

14:19.800 --> 14:22.400
he has to be a brahmacharya,
a celibate person.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.280
And he has to do six things together.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.600
In that, meditation is there,
prana pratishtha [calming of the breath],

14:28.800 --> 14:30.840
pratyahar [withdrawal of the senses],
yama-niyama [“dos” and “don’ts”]…

14:31.040 --> 14:33.840
All these things mean
he has to regulate his life,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.040
he has to lead
a very chaste and holy life.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.920
It is not meant for people
who are householders.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.440
Here now, for fashion’s sake,

14:40.640 --> 14:42.440
the Hatha Yoga has come
to all the people,

14:42.640 --> 14:46.360
and all Hatha yogis as such
get heart attacks.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.760
Yes, they do.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.280
I’ve met a doctor here —

14:49.480 --> 14:52.680
you might be knowing him also very well,
he was a very well-known doctor —

14:52.880 --> 14:55.160
and he was preaching Hatha Yoga,
and he had a heart trouble.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.760
And he was a heart specialist!

14:56.960 --> 15:00.440
And when I met him, I told him,
“Doctor, be careful about your heart.
You are catching on your heart.”

15:00.640 --> 15:02.440
He said, “How can that be?
I’ve taken my cardiogram!”

15:02.640 --> 15:05.480
I said, “Doctor, be careful
and don’t do this Hatha Yoga.”

15:05.680 --> 15:10.920
Because it is an extreme type
of a sadhana [spiritual practice],

15:11.120 --> 15:14.720
which is to be done with a person
who can balance you,

15:14.920 --> 15:17.240
where no other energy is exhausted,

15:17.440 --> 15:20.080
but only thing is,
it is just done for the sadhana,

15:20.280 --> 15:22.160
and your guru works it out.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.800
It is done by very few people.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.800
But nowadays everybody wants to become
a cinema actor and a cinema actress.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.880
Every girl wants to be [UNCLEAR]
certain shapes

15:33.080 --> 15:34.960
that are described
in the beauty contest.

15:35.160 --> 15:40.360
I tell you, these proportions
are absolutely satanic.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.960
I’ve read those proportions —

15:42.160 --> 15:45.320
they are not the proportions
of goddesses. Or of gods.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.600
These proportions that are described
in these beauty contest things

15:48.800 --> 15:51.400
are absolutely of dirty women.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.320
These proportions,
if they exist in any human being,

15:54.520 --> 15:56.120
only bad vibrations will come out.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.480
That’s why, you must have seen,
once they win that test,

15:59.680 --> 16:02.760
then you have seen
how they become funny.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.000
These are all human conceptions,
but all the human conceptions

16:06.200 --> 16:08.520
are such foolish things
that they do not know

16:08.720 --> 16:10.920
that they are playing
into the satanic forces.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.520
The idea about cinema actresses,
you see — all the ladies, these days,

16:14.720 --> 16:16.880
even in London,
even ninety-year-old women

16:17.080 --> 16:18.480
want to be actresses.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.320
Are they mad?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.520
They don’t want to be mothers.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.520
And then they will do
all kinds of dieting,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.440
torture their husbands,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.600
and they will… I don’t know
what they are up to.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.240
You have to be good wives,
decent wives.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.280
You have to be good mothers
first of all.

16:38.480 --> 16:42.320
You are married women,
you are not actresses.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.560
And the husbands also want
to be actors or what, I don’t know,

16:46.760 --> 16:48.000
that they are at Hatha Yoga.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.400
They want to make their body
very perfect

16:50.600 --> 16:53.040
in those dimensions
that they are described.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.720
Who has said that these dimensions
are the best?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.800
I mean, these days, when you see it,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.080
men, they don’t look like men,
and women don’t look like women.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.200
Women have started looking like men
or like horses,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.240
and men have started
looking like women.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.040
It’s a wretched system.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.120
We have to be women in the full way,

17:12.320 --> 17:15.160
and men have to be men in the full way.

17:15.360 --> 17:18.040
You have heard about Shivaji, Rana Pratap
[legendary Indian warrior kings]…

17:18.240 --> 17:21.240
You have seen their personalities.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.960
You see, all the descriptions
of these personalities

17:24.160 --> 17:25.520
going to drop down like anything

17:25.720 --> 17:29.200
when you see these “actors”
and “actresses”, teeny-leeny people:

17:29.400 --> 17:33.120
somebody slaps them once on the face,
the husband falls down dead,

17:33.320 --> 17:35.520
and the wife is running away
with another man —

17:35.720 --> 17:39.440
all sorts of things going on
in this ghor [terrible] Kali Yuga.

17:39.640 --> 17:43.720
This is only you are playing
into the satanic forces. Nothing else.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.800
But these, I tell you,
these supraconscious people

17:46.000 --> 17:47.360
are teaching you all these things.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.040
Then there are people
of extreme nature,

17:52.240 --> 17:53.560
women specially,

17:53.760 --> 17:56.160
who are pativrata
[devoted to a husband], you see.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.480
They are also nonsensical people.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.960
Because, you see,
they think they love their husband,

18:01.160 --> 18:02.960
the whole gods must fall onto them.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.680
Of course, a pativrata
is a very powerful personality.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.960
But she has to be a realized person.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.760
Otherwise, she is not realized,

18:09.960 --> 18:12.840
and she is all the time
making the husband, you see,

18:13.040 --> 18:16.200
a noose around his head all the time —
and using God for it.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.880
Is absurd!

18:18.080 --> 18:20.280
She must allow all the freedom
to the man,

18:20.480 --> 18:25.640
to man to understand
the complete play of life.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.640
These women also, when they die,
you see, they are afraid

18:28.840 --> 18:31.160
that their husband might marry
somebody else or whatever it is.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.400
They sit on the husband’s head only.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.720
Then the mothers, some of the mothers
who are so much involved

18:38.920 --> 18:43.280
and selfish and self-centred,
only love their own children.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.440
They’ll say:
“He is the only son I have,”

18:46.640 --> 18:49.040
“She is the only daughter I have.”

18:49.240 --> 18:52.240
But what does that mean?
Why are you so misidentified?

18:52.440 --> 18:54.680
How many times you have been born
in this world?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.680
How many children
you have had before?

18:56.880 --> 19:00.600
Why are you so much involved into it,
so much misidentified?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.760
That does not mean
that you kick your children.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.760
Either they will kick their children

19:04.960 --> 19:07.880
or they will be absolutely
downtrodden by the children.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.960
This is the extreme type
of temperament.

19:10.160 --> 19:13.080
Normal people, who love their children,
love other children also,

19:13.280 --> 19:16.920
live in a normal way,
normal, pious married life,

19:17.120 --> 19:20.760
don’t run after other men
and don’t run after other women —

19:20.960 --> 19:24.200
these normal people, when they die,
they go to Pretaloka,

19:24.400 --> 19:26.680
and then they are born again
as good people,

19:26.880 --> 19:31.560
and they, if they are born today,
they get Realization.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.760
There are kinds and kinds
and types and types.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.240
I don’t want to waste your time
and My time

19:36.440 --> 19:38.520
in describing all these horrid people.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.360
But on the other side,
on the left-hand side,

19:40.560 --> 19:43.280
the debased and the sly
and the horrid and the murderers

19:43.480 --> 19:45.440
and all that — they are all there.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.600
Oh, these are another type.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.600
Now, what these people try to do?

19:49.800 --> 19:55.440
You see, sometimes
they will do some sly things.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.960
But when these people enter,
these debased ones,

19:58.160 --> 20:01.800
when they enter into your psyche,
you become lunatic or mad,
or something happens.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.320
They teach you all kinds of things.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.000
They’ll teach you how to drink,
to take to drugs, to do these things;

20:06.200 --> 20:08.080
or if you are taking drinks,
they’ll enter into you.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.440
Because they are drunkards,

20:09.640 --> 20:11.720
so they want to drink more —
so they will drink.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.480
You’ll be amazed, you won’t believe
that in Cuba I met a lady,

20:15.680 --> 20:17.240
she was a very “dainty darling”,

20:17.440 --> 20:22.440
and she told Me that she can take
one whisky neat, one full bottle.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.680
I mean, I can’t even look at that bottle
the way she showed Me.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.520
I said, “How do you manage that?”

20:27.720 --> 20:30.160
And her husband said, “Really,
it is true, sometimes she does it.”

20:30.360 --> 20:33.000
So she says, “Do you know,
there’s a very big, huge Negro

20:33.200 --> 20:36.000
who enters into my body.
And then he drinks, not I.”

20:36.200 --> 20:39.640
She sees him coming inside this body.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.960
So these types of people
are the other side,

20:46.160 --> 20:48.000
on the left-hand side.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.720
Now, there are mixture types,
some of them.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.880
You see, they are the people
who believe in God,

20:53.080 --> 20:56.840
and they haven’t found God,
and they have worked very hard…
sort of people.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.960
So they try to give you
little, sometimes, assurances.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.920
For example, yesterday one lady came,
and she told Me,

21:03.120 --> 21:07.720
“Mataji, suddenly I found
that there were some chanas [chickpeas]
lying in my house.

21:07.920 --> 21:11.080
I thought they must have been given
by Mataji, so I ate them,
and I got cured.”

21:11.280 --> 21:16.440
I said, “Am I mad to give you chanas
and diamonds and this and that?”

21:20.080 --> 21:23.320
And there are some gurus also
who are working out
the so-called materialization.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.600
This is nothing, you see.
Sometimes, you see, you find, in Bombay…

21:26.800 --> 21:30.600
now, you find that suddenly
your something is missing.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.640
Most of the missing things
you’ll find there.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.160
And these are the things
they are passing out to people
like this — come along! —

21:38.360 --> 21:40.000
in a… jadu me [in a magic way].

21:40.200 --> 21:45.720
It is… it is a spirit,
which is transparent.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.160
It is not opaque thing,
you cannot see it.

21:48.360 --> 21:52.160
So, it comes round, picks up anything
it feels like, and it goes away.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.800
And it just disappears.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.920
And it goes, and it can also give it
to some people there.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.480
And this is all the vidya
[knowledge, lore] of spirit.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.960
Now, how are you to know
that this is spirit and not God?

22:06.160 --> 22:08.920
Only ask one question:
what is the interest of God

22:09.120 --> 22:11.880
in giving us all these
nonsensical things

22:12.080 --> 22:14.000
which we are going to leave here only?

22:14.200 --> 22:15.360
When we die,

22:15.560 --> 22:20.080
all our diamonds, all our ornaments —
everything is going to lie down here.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.520
So why should God give us
these things? Is He mad?

22:26.280 --> 22:28.040
You see, if He loves you,

22:28.240 --> 22:32.880
He’ll give you the highest,
the eternal, the greatest,

22:33.080 --> 22:35.560
the one that is promised
in all the scriptures.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.040
And you read all the scriptures.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.480
Do you find this kind of a nonsense
anywhere that Krishna came

22:40.680 --> 22:43.080
and He brought out some rings
and gave it to somebody?

22:43.280 --> 22:46.280
He did not.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.560
I mean, it can be done by Him.

22:51.760 --> 22:56.240
If He wants to do, He can do anything,
but He is not going to steal things.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.800
So this kind of supraconscious spirits
and these things do exist,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.040
believe Me, they do.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.920
But there’s nothing important for us,
because one exists in the future

23:07.120 --> 23:10.200
and another exists in the past.

23:10.440 --> 23:14.240
We have to be conscious
of the present, present moment —

23:14.440 --> 23:16.400
and this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.120
That now, at this moment;

23:18.320 --> 23:20.520
you must understand
the dynamics of this moment,

23:20.720 --> 23:23.760
the spontaneity of this moment.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.200
So now people will say, “Then that means,
Mataji, You don’t believe in planning.”

23:29.400 --> 23:32.880
I do not. I do not believe
in human planning at all.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.520
Because when human beings plan,
you know what is the mess they create.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.120
Everywhere in the whole world,
wherever there have been planners,

23:40.320 --> 23:42.760
what has been done?

23:42.960 --> 23:46.080
I’ll give you a simple example.

23:47.680 --> 23:51.720
You plan a wedding, A to Z.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.880
Now, you’ll find, suddenly,

23:54.080 --> 23:57.520
when the bridegroom has to come
from this place to that place,

23:57.720 --> 24:00.360
something will happen
and he won’t move.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.440
He may have to go to the bathroom;

24:03.640 --> 24:06.920
maybe he wants to meet his mother,
he will be emotionally tied up;

24:07.120 --> 24:11.720
maybe his mother will come there,
and she might start crying…

24:12.720 --> 24:15.160
If you want to make it
a living marriage,

24:15.360 --> 24:18.320
then you should not plan
in such detail.

24:18.520 --> 24:23.440
You must allow the spontaneity,
the blessing of God to work out.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.320
In manner… I’ll give you
one example.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.000
You see, I do not plan out much,

24:32.200 --> 24:34.680
and I don’t bother so much
about this planning out.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.320
Today we wanted to come here
very early.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.920
These people said
we must reach there at six thirty.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.680
I was just laughing. I knew
when I had to reach I would reach,

24:42.880 --> 24:45.600
because, whatever they may try,
we cannot reach early.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.960
[UNCLEAR]?

24:51.600 --> 24:54.240
And I just could not.

24:54.440 --> 24:58.760
So why worry? Because I know
we are not going to reach early.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.040
Of course, I mean, today
supposing I have to go tomorrow,

25:03.240 --> 25:05.960
so I have to just buy the ticket
for tomorrow.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.520
Is all right, there’s no planning.
That is to be done today.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.000
But A to Z you start planning
everything,

25:12.200 --> 25:16.120
and suddenly you find this is missing
and the whole thing goes off.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.440
Let the spontaneity,
at least in human relationship —

25:19.640 --> 25:21.880
because you are such planners,
you cannot do everything else —

25:22.080 --> 25:26.000
but human relationship, at least,
try the spontaneity to work out.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.480
Now, in the Western countries,

25:27.680 --> 25:29.840
people are understanding
the value of spontaneity,

25:30.040 --> 25:33.880
but they are stupid people,
they don’t know how to harness it.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.640
I cannot even tell you
to what stupidity they go.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.960
If I tell you, you won’t believe.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.360
There are small children,
otherwise I would have told you.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.280
It is impossible to believe
how stupid they are

25:48.480 --> 25:50.560
that they believe in the spontaneity

25:50.760 --> 25:53.800
and the kind of spontaneity
they have done.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.040
All the developing countries
are now developing

25:57.240 --> 25:58.840
to be the developed countries,

25:59.040 --> 26:03.360
but we must also see in [UNCLEAR]
these developed countries are.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.560
They are stupid people.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.720
They are all right
as far as their work is concerned —

26:10.920 --> 26:13.760
they are all in time, their things
are all clean, spick and span.

26:13.960 --> 26:17.080
But if you see,
their families are broken up.

26:17.280 --> 26:21.280
Stupidity to such a limit —
a ninety-year-old woman

26:21.480 --> 26:25.120
having a love affair
with a nineteen-year-old man,

26:25.320 --> 26:28.320
and on the front page
their love letters are posted.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.880
Every newspaper you have to read,
that is the first break news coming,

26:32.080 --> 26:36.400
and all the men reading
this “great” Romeo-Juliet going on.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.440
Stupid, absolutely stupid!

26:38.640 --> 26:41.400
When you talk to them,
you find they’re such stupid people!

26:41.600 --> 26:44.680
You don’t know where to look
and what to say.

26:44.880 --> 26:49.280
You have no idea to what extent
they have gone in stupidity.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.920
Of course, they have Cadillacs,
and they have big cars,

26:52.120 --> 26:53.400
and they have big houses.

26:53.600 --> 26:59.160
But sometimes I feel it is donkeys
living inside these beautiful houses.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.680
In certain matters
they are absolutely stupid.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.800
In certain matters,
absolutely, we are crooked.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.480
They are innocent, simpletons,
but they are stupid people.

27:17.680 --> 27:21.600
We are crooked.
Now, that point I’ll touch later on.

27:21.800 --> 27:26.800
So, let us see now
that how these two types of spirits

27:27.000 --> 27:29.880
enter into us, into our psyche.

27:30.080 --> 27:34.240
They can enter through this,
they turn this thing.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.360
They turn this portion
and put inside.

27:37.560 --> 27:40.920
Now, what happens with that,
with the spirit thing?

27:41.120 --> 27:43.000
There are some —
like Ravan was there,

27:43.200 --> 27:48.000
who could only with speech
he could make people naked, absolutely.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.200
We have got one here,
exactly the same type.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.840
If he goes on giving speech,
people start taking out their clothes.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.920
Now, just think how stupid we are

27:57.120 --> 28:00.840
not to think: “By taking out clothes,
are we going to go near God?”

28:01.040 --> 28:04.560
I mean, what sort of a logic is this?

28:05.440 --> 28:07.960
When we take our bath,
we are all naked.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.200
Are we nearer God by that?

28:12.760 --> 28:15.200
All sorts of absurd things
are being taught,

28:15.400 --> 28:18.240
and people are accepting.
Thousands of people!

28:18.440 --> 28:22.680
In your great Bombay, there are
so many intellectuals, aren’t there?

28:22.880 --> 28:26.400
Doing such silly, stupid things.

28:31.280 --> 28:37.480
Then you will find lots and lots
of people just… organized.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.760
For what?

28:39.960 --> 28:42.920
“Oh, there is some gentleman
has come, you know,

28:43.120 --> 28:45.000
and he speaks very well
on this thing.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.720
And he is very good at this,
he’s a very great speaker.” —

28:47.920 --> 28:49.480
“What does he speak?” —

28:49.680 --> 28:53.560
“He speaks about how Radha
and Krishna loved each other.”

28:53.760 --> 28:56.760
Very good idea.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.360
You can have free cabaret,

29:02.560 --> 29:06.560
and you can have free discourses
on all the nonsensical things

29:06.760 --> 29:09.040
debasing God Himself.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.400
All these things are so interesting
to human beings!

29:12.600 --> 29:17.160
Are they really seeking the truth?
Are they really asking the reality?

29:17.360 --> 29:20.400
They will never read Shankaracharya.
Yesterday I told you.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.120
They will never go and find out
what Markandeya had written,

29:24.320 --> 29:27.640
they have no time to find out
what Jesus has to say about it.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.240
They don’t know
what Mohammed Sahib has said.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.680
Nanak has said so many things,
Kabira has said so many things.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.200
They are all fools.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.480
These vice have come
from somewhere to teach us

29:43.680 --> 29:47.280
about all the satanic methods
that they want to employ on us.

29:47.480 --> 29:51.000
So beware. Be careful.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.880
This is the ghor Kali Yuga.

29:54.080 --> 29:57.560
All these satanic forces are acting.

29:57.760 --> 30:03.760
Krishna has said
that “Whenever there is need

30:04.160 --> 30:07.280
to establish the Dharma

30:07.480 --> 30:10.760
and to kill the dushtas [evil people]

30:10.960 --> 30:13.320
and to save the sadhus [good people],

30:13.520 --> 30:15.920
I am born again and again.”

30:16.120 --> 30:19.960
But, I find, who is the sadhu
and who is the dushta?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.320
It is such a mixture!

30:22.520 --> 30:24.920
The Satan has entered
into all the sadhus,

30:25.120 --> 30:28.480
and sadhus are absolutely
in a conflict.

30:28.680 --> 30:30.720
This is what Kali Yuga is.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.920
It’s a very delicate matter.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.240
So, in our own being, as I said it,

30:40.440 --> 30:43.280
on the right-hand side
is the supraconscious area,

30:43.480 --> 30:44.800
and on the left-hand side

30:45.000 --> 30:49.040
is what we call
as the collective subconscious.

30:49.240 --> 30:51.040
Nearer your own being

30:51.240 --> 30:53.240
is the subconscious
on the left-hand side,

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
which we call as the psyche part,

30:55.640 --> 30:57.920
where we store everything
that is dead,

30:58.120 --> 31:00.240
of this life and past life.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.920
And on the right-hand side,
is the preconscious mind,

31:04.120 --> 31:07.320
which we call as mana,
by which we —

31:07.520 --> 31:09.600
I don’t know, “mana” is also
very confusing thing,

31:09.800 --> 31:12.040
but English word is better,
is “preconscious mind” —

31:12.240 --> 31:15.520
with which we plan
and with which we think,

31:15.720 --> 31:20.640
and this body is maintained
through our right-hand side power.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.600
In the centre, we have got
the evolutionary power.

31:23.800 --> 31:27.520
By this power only, we have evolved,

31:27.880 --> 31:30.000
which is the conscious mind.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.120
This moment, now, at this moment.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.240
We can say that the past and future
cross like that,

31:36.440 --> 31:37.800
and in the centre is that point.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.080
Or we can say like this: that the past…
the future and the past,

31:42.280 --> 31:45.360
they pass like this in the centre,
and they pass out.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.960
So the thoughts from the past
come to the future,

31:49.160 --> 31:52.440
and the future to the past,
but they cannot stay at conscious.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.360
For example, I say,
“Now, at this moment, stop it.”

31:55.560 --> 31:57.280
You cannot.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.480
Why?

32:03.080 --> 32:04.720
Because of thoughts.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.720
The thought rises,
goes up and falls down,

32:07.920 --> 32:10.920
and disappears like that.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.840
Again, another thought rises,
rises and again falls, and disappears.

32:16.040 --> 32:21.640
Now, you can see
the rising of the thought,

32:21.840 --> 32:24.280
but you cannot see
the falling of the thought.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.120
In between these two thoughts,
there is a little gap

32:27.320 --> 32:29.320
known as vilamba [delay]
in the Sanskrit language.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.520
That is the point of conscious mind.

32:32.720 --> 32:37.520
The thoughts can come
from the supraconscious side,

32:37.720 --> 32:39.480
or can come
from the collective subconscious,

32:39.680 --> 32:41.520
can even come
from the preconscious,

32:41.720 --> 32:45.400
or can even come
from the subconscious.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.480
That’s how the thoughts waves are.

32:49.680 --> 32:53.320
But if you have to jump
into the conscious mind itself —

32:53.520 --> 32:56.200
now, at this moment —

32:56.400 --> 33:00.960
you cannot do it, because at that point
there is no thought.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.680
I am not telling you
all these things of My own,

33:03.880 --> 33:08.920
because this has been already
discovered by many psychologists —

33:09.120 --> 33:12.080
that one has to jump
into thoughtless awareness,

33:12.280 --> 33:15.600
not into the so-called trance
but into awareness,

33:15.800 --> 33:18.880
which you are completely aware,
but inside there is silence.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.640
Now, this silence has been described
by all the scriptures.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.840
And while jumping into that…

33:26.040 --> 33:30.080
even the psychologists,
so many of them said

33:30.280 --> 33:33.120
that you jump
into an unconscious mind, which —

33:33.320 --> 33:37.760
“unconscious” means
which is not known to us, achetan mana —

33:37.960 --> 33:42.120
which is collectively conscious,
which is universal.

33:42.560 --> 33:46.160
For example, we can say Jung is one
of the greatest psychologists,

33:46.360 --> 33:48.240
and I respect him very much.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.400
He has done a lot of work
on the unconscious,

33:50.600 --> 33:55.600
and he has taken many years

33:56.560 --> 33:59.600
to experiment on thousands
and thousands of people

33:59.800 --> 34:03.920
to find out how the unconscious works
through dreams and symbols.

34:04.120 --> 34:09.000
Now, he has found out many symbols
appear in the dreams.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.360
For example, a triangle like this
appears in a dream of one man,

34:13.560 --> 34:15.480
pointing downward.

34:15.680 --> 34:19.280
Invariably in all the cases,
wherever such a dream has appeared,

34:19.480 --> 34:23.160
such a man has murdered someone.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.720
Or if the triangle
is just upside down,

34:26.920 --> 34:29.880
means the top is the pointer,

34:30.080 --> 34:32.880
then invariably all these people

34:33.080 --> 34:35.800
who saw this in the dream
and reported to him,

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
they were murdered.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.600
There are many such things
he has found out.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.480
He has found out another thing
about the Universal Unconscious —

34:46.680 --> 34:49.840
that it always gives you a balance.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.280
By different experiments.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.000
Now, the medical science people

34:56.200 --> 34:58.440
have found out many things
which they cannot answer.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.720
I have told you already
that they have found out

35:00.920 --> 35:02.680
that the acetylcholine and adrenaline,

35:02.880 --> 35:08.880
which act through the parasympathetic
and the sympathetic nervous system,

35:09.160 --> 35:11.480
they act very funnily in the body,
and they don’t know

35:11.680 --> 35:14.120
how they are controlled,
by whom, and why they act.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.080
They say the mode of action
of these two chemicals is not known.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.280
That means one thing is sure —

35:23.880 --> 35:25.880
that they cannot explain.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.880
So, we have to think: why?

35:29.080 --> 35:32.800
Why a chemical should react
separate, differently?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.880
Because there is a deity
sitting within them!

35:36.080 --> 35:37.760
There is a deity, a living deity

35:37.960 --> 35:40.760
which handles the chemicals
in the way that it likes.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.800
The other day also
I asked you a question:

35:43.000 --> 35:44.680
a medical person,
if you go and ask him,

35:44.880 --> 35:47.840
“If everything, every foreign body
is thrown out of the body,

35:48.040 --> 35:53.360
how is it a foetus is accepted,
not only that but nurtured in the body?”

35:55.680 --> 36:00.560
So we should know that there is
a Unconscious Universal Being,

36:00.760 --> 36:04.720
which is being accepted
by many people

36:05.880 --> 36:07.640
in the West.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.080
And that’s why they say:
“Let the Unconscious look after.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.000
Let us have the spontaneity,
let it work out spontaneously.”

36:13.200 --> 36:15.400
But they cannot,
they are so complicated now.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.440
They have such an analytical mind
that they’ll go on analyzing,

36:18.640 --> 36:23.240
and they cannot allow
the spontaneity to work out.

36:25.480 --> 36:30.160
They are trying all their methods
to work out the spontaneity,

36:31.480 --> 36:37.480
but somebody has to give an impetus,

36:38.600 --> 36:42.880
has to give that triggering,
as you can say.

36:43.440 --> 36:47.040
Because through rationality if you want
to jump into unconscious, you cannot.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.480
Rationality is a very limited stuff.

36:50.680 --> 36:54.840
If you want to go to something
unlimited and universal —

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
which is collectively conscious —

36:57.240 --> 37:01.520
then you have to learn
to be unlimited yourself.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.720
Now, how will you do it?

37:04.920 --> 37:08.000
Somebody has to trigger it.

37:12.520 --> 37:16.800
You see a light, a dip [lamp, candle]
which is not yet lighted.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.360
It is a limited stuff.

37:19.560 --> 37:22.320
But when you light it,
it becomes unlimited.

37:22.520 --> 37:28.520
But for lightening this light,
you have to take another light near it.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.600
When you bring another light near it,

37:30.800 --> 37:33.480
it doesn’t do,
it’s just like a catalytic agent.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.880
It just touches this,
and it starts burning.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.000
It gets unlimited light.

37:40.200 --> 37:44.880
The light becomes unlimited
with a limited dip.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.120
In the same way,
somebody has to trigger this.

37:53.960 --> 37:58.200
I give a very, I should say,
a contemporary, or a very modern example

37:58.400 --> 38:00.760
which is very simple
for people to understand.

38:00.960 --> 38:03.880
You see, in our houses, we have seen
all these Bombay gas lights,

38:04.080 --> 38:08.560
we have seen there’s a little flicker
going on. Nobody can see that.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.320
In the same way,
in the heart there is the Spirit,

38:11.520 --> 38:14.920
the reflection of God that is there.

38:15.680 --> 38:20.720
And the flow of the gas is stopped,
is kept ready.

38:20.920 --> 38:25.680
In the same way,
in you the Kundalini is kept there,

38:26.400 --> 38:30.040
and somebody has to open that.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.440
And when that is just opened,

38:33.640 --> 38:38.440
the Kundalini rises and meets
that flicker, and the light spreads.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.880
And this is what happens
when the light spreads —

38:41.080 --> 38:44.320
that the vibrations start coming.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.840
Thus you jump
into your unconscious awareness,

38:49.040 --> 38:52.560
means you become
a different personality.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.120
As I told you, you are a computer.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.680
But you are not a working computer.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.560
Once you are connected
with the mains,

39:01.760 --> 39:03.920
you become a computer
which is giving information;

39:04.120 --> 39:08.280
suddenly you start feeling
on your fingers all these things.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.520
You start feeling what is…

39:11.720 --> 39:14.760
what are the centres on the other person,
what are not working.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.600
And these centres,
as I explained to you yesterday,

39:17.800 --> 39:23.360
have all the physical, mental,
and emotional sides, which they control,

39:23.560 --> 39:25.840
and you can make out
what’s wrong with the person.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.480
You can cure them also
by giving them these vibrations.

39:29.680 --> 39:35.320
So, through this computer,
now you get information,

39:35.760 --> 39:40.280
you give information,
and also you can correct it.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.640
You can execute also information.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.640
Now, our computers that we have,
they cannot execute.

39:46.840 --> 40:06.240
(Somebody interrupts Shri Mataji,
and She asks not to interrupt Her.)

40:09.600 --> 40:15.600
You see, lecturing about Divine
has been done by many.

40:16.120 --> 40:20.680
I am talking about actualization.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.800
You become that!

40:24.000 --> 40:28.880
Now, always people say
that “How can it be possible, Mataji?”

40:29.080 --> 40:32.600
I mean, I cannot understand
this question.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.240
Supposing I say
there is a diamond lying here.

40:37.440 --> 40:41.520
Will you ask such a question?
You’ll immediately come pick it up.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.760
I mean, you don’t have to lose
anything by this.

40:45.960 --> 40:49.000
You are not paying Me anything.
It’s all free.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.960
By doing this, you have seen here,
people have been cured.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.080
But once you get it,

40:57.280 --> 40:59.480
fifty percent of you
will feel very happy,

40:59.680 --> 41:01.560
go home and say, “All right, forget it.”

41:01.760 --> 41:05.160
One or two will criticize: “Oh, mala kahi
jhala sei, we didn’t feel anything,”

41:05.360 --> 41:06.640
as if they are very great people.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.920
If they haven’t got it,
there’s something wrong with them.

41:09.120 --> 41:12.120
They should get it.

41:12.360 --> 41:17.200
And fifty percent will think about it,
will come again and again, work it out.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.560
There are now in Bombay
some of them,

41:19.760 --> 41:23.440
very highly placed Sahaja yogis,
who are curing people.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.960
They have cured cancer.
They are very ordinary people.

41:27.160 --> 41:30.400
We have one here, a teacher
in the school,

41:30.600 --> 41:34.320
and he has cured people
who were suffering from elephantiasis,

41:34.520 --> 41:37.560
from cancer…
so many things he has cured.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.840
He is a very, very ordinary person
in life.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.800
There are so many like that
who are doing it.

41:46.560 --> 41:47.600
You can also do it.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.920
But you are great babus
[respectable people],
you are great people.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.160
You have no time for all this.

41:53.640 --> 41:57.440
When I’ll be no more, then you
will be beating your heads, I know:

41:57.640 --> 42:02.960
“I wish we had done
something about it!”

42:04.480 --> 42:08.560
Some of them
have definitely learned the art.

42:08.760 --> 42:11.000
Like, I said that “There’s a fan here.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.120
If I open the fan,
you’ll get cool breeze.”

42:14.320 --> 42:17.600
So you’ll say, “All right. Please open
the fan immediately, we want to have it.”

42:17.800 --> 42:19.480
Normally people would say that.

42:19.680 --> 42:21.920
Then I would say, “All right,
I’ll open the fan. Cool down.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.800
Now you feel nice?” — “Yes.”

42:24.000 --> 42:25.880
Then I will tell you
how this fan is made,

42:26.080 --> 42:29.320
how the electricity is produced,
all the engineering I’ll tell you.

42:29.520 --> 42:33.160
But I have also told you
a little bit of engineering.

42:33.960 --> 42:37.520
All people want to listen to lectures.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.240
Aren’t you fed up of them?

42:45.640 --> 42:48.640
Why don’t you have it?

42:48.960 --> 42:51.320
This is the blessing of God.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.480
You have to jump
into the Kingdom of God,

42:53.680 --> 42:57.960
and you just see how you are protected,
how you are looked after.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.480
There are seven chakras,

42:59.680 --> 43:05.680
and all the seven blessings
are bestowed upon you with a stroke.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.320
We have here people who have been
nothing in life after Sahaja Yoga
[Shri Mataji probably means “before”] —

43:10.520 --> 43:15.160
even this one I will give you as a…

43:15.600 --> 43:19.440
as a little chocolate
over the castor oil, as they say —

43:19.640 --> 43:24.600
that they are also very much
improved materially

43:24.800 --> 43:27.360
because it is Lakshmi
who is sitting in the Nabhi.

43:27.560 --> 43:31.120
This may appeal to many in India

43:31.600 --> 43:34.600
that Lakshmi is cured
and you improve even materially.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.440
People get promotions,
they become this, that…

43:37.640 --> 43:39.200
One example is our Dr. Nagensi.

43:39.400 --> 43:43.720
He got his Realization,
and see where he has got.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.560
Many people like that.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.760
He is a Sahaja yogi.

43:50.160 --> 43:53.640
So many people are Sahaja yogis
who have achieved things in life,

43:53.840 --> 43:55.760
but they are busy people,
some of them are.

43:55.960 --> 43:59.920
But if you could devote
a little time for sadhana,

44:00.120 --> 44:02.880
and if you come here
and see for yourself

44:03.080 --> 44:05.080
and give more, then you get more.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.600
Because why should God
give you all the time vibrations

44:07.800 --> 44:09.440
when you are not going to use them?

44:09.640 --> 44:12.040
There’s a gentleman sitting here,
his son was suffering

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
from too much of drug.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.400
He was a young schoolboy,

44:16.600 --> 44:20.200
and he was being cheated,
and poor boy has been tried.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.360
He has spent twenty thousand rupees
just curing him.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.640
People were just giving him
drugs to sleep and drugs to sleep,

44:26.840 --> 44:28.120
only tranquillizers.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.640
And in one day he’s cured, and today
he’s sleeping nicely without anything.

44:31.840 --> 44:34.720
He had brought and showed Me
a prescription which, he says…

44:34.920 --> 44:36.520
Kiti paise bata [tell me how much was it]?
Charshe rupaye —

44:36.720 --> 44:40.480
four hundred rupees
poor man had to shell out.

44:40.680 --> 44:44.400
And for what? Not for curing!
To make that boy sleep off.

44:44.600 --> 44:49.560
I mean, that’s also a kind of a drug.
And that boy is so normal today.

44:52.160 --> 44:57.640
But there will be some satanic here
who can create problem for you.

44:57.840 --> 44:59.320
So you decide for yourself.

44:59.520 --> 45:02.520
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)
