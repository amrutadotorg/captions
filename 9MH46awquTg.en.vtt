00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.915
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.338
It's a very opportune time today, I feel,

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.881
where the innocence, especially

00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:42.714
in the European and American countries,

00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:45.753
is under attack.

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:50.332
There's no respect of the innocence,

00:05:51.207 --> 00:05:54.998
no value for the innocence.

00:05:56.332 --> 00:05:59.123
They don't understand how important

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:03.498
it is for human life

00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:07.956
to have innocence

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:14.373
being respected within themselves and also without.

00:06:16.456 --> 00:06:21.207
The human life is different from that of animal life.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.498
Animals are controlled all the time, or we can say

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:31.790
they are under a complete imprisonment, you can say

00:06:32.748 --> 00:06:37.790
under the will of Lord Sadashiva.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.664
That's why He's called as Pashupati.

00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:48.623
But human beings have been given freedom

00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:54.040
to choose their ascent, to choose the right,

00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:56.498
to choose the truth.

00:06:56.706 --> 00:07:00.748
Only through innocence they can achieve that.

00:07:01.623 --> 00:07:03.896
Can you remove this one from here because

00:07:04.097 --> 00:07:06.639
people can't see Me I think.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:17.539
It's all right.

00:07:22.332 --> 00:07:26.332
Only the innocence is the source of joy.

00:07:27.998 --> 00:07:31.956
Without innocence you cannot enjoy anything fully.

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:38.873
This innocence is today completely under challenge

00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:43.165
and to finish the innocence,

00:07:43.748 --> 00:07:46.082
in a very subtle way

00:07:46.623 --> 00:07:49.873
there are very negative, cruel,

00:07:50.165 --> 00:07:53.873
criminal type of people who are working it out.

00:07:54.498 --> 00:07:58.332
Their minds, if you say “possessed,” it doesn't look like that

00:07:58.748 --> 00:08:03.831
because otherwise they are quite intelligent.

00:08:04.956 --> 00:08:08.539
They are also, in a way,

00:08:08.748 --> 00:08:12.581
creative of horrible things.

00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:16.456
So you can't say they are not intelligent,

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.082
but from where do they get this knowledge

00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:25.664
of creating something so horrifying?

00:08:32.998 --> 00:08:35.915
In this Kali Yuga, as in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.082
everybody can take birth. There's freedom.

00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:46.082
It was not before so much so

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.623
that all kinds of evil people have taken

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.748
birth on this earth.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.915
These evil people generate

00:08:58.498 --> 00:09:05.165
evil thoughts and people catch them and get moving with it.

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:08.873
Even a good person can get swayed by it.

00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:12.373
Even a saint can get swayed by it.

00:09:13.248 --> 00:09:17.123
So these forces of evil,

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:22.165
the forces which are working out today,

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:26.332
are coming basically from these horrible people.

00:09:27.539 --> 00:09:31.082
Firstly, they might have come as false gurus,

00:09:32.123 --> 00:09:35.998
teaching something nonsensical,

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:38.456
like Rajneesh.

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:42.581
Then from some philosophers like Freud,

00:09:42.998 --> 00:09:47.748
who is still accepted in some countries as a great philosopher,

00:09:49.998 --> 00:09:55.998
and still some psychologists worship him as God.

00:09:57.332 --> 00:10:02.248
This Freudian knowledge was accepted

00:10:02.748 --> 00:10:06.706
without even thinking why Freud did that.

00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:11.207
Freud was a Jew,

00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:16.915
and he found that many Christians tortured the Jews in America.

00:10:17.956 --> 00:10:21.290
This is another anti Christ activity.

00:10:22.207 --> 00:10:24.498
And when they tortured the Jews,

00:10:24.998 --> 00:10:29.230
this fellow thought that better to make them immoral,

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:31.373
destroy their innocence.

00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:34.373
I don't know if he could understand to that point,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.040
and he started theories which were so shocking

00:10:41.248 --> 00:10:46.332
that normally any sensible person would never have accepted it.

00:10:47.082 --> 00:10:51.831
But so many people accepted in America to begin with.

00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:54.623
In America,

00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:57.332
people take to anything very easily which is absurd,

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:59.332
which is stupid; I don't know why.

00:10:59.498 --> 00:11:02.040
They have a special liking for such things.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.956
If Freud had come to India,

00:11:04.165 --> 00:11:07.135
they would have cut him into a hundred pieces, I tell you,

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:09.297
and thrown in the Arabic Sea.

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:11.664
They could not have born this idea,

00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:16.664
the way he had insulted the mother and her love for her child,

00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:19.123
the purity of her love.

00:11:21.498 --> 00:11:24.664
But Jews did not accept him, surprisingly.

00:11:25.082 --> 00:11:26.623
Jews did not accept.

00:11:26.831 --> 00:11:32.040
It's the Christians who accepted his ideas and started destroying,

00:11:32.248 --> 00:11:35.123
displeasing Shri Ganesh.

00:11:37.915 --> 00:11:39.373
First of all,

00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:43.165
we have to understand we are born in a very precarious,

00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.748
dangerous times.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:49.831
At the time of Christ there were very few people

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.964
who followed him and they didn't understand much about Kundalini either.

00:11:54.165 --> 00:11:56.123
They had no knowledge.

00:11:56.664 --> 00:11:58.956
They had no knowledge that Christ

00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:01.790
was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.290
But in the Christian countries only you find

00:12:05.456 --> 00:12:08.873
the insult of Christ, the insult of innocence

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:13.290
openly done, sometimes legally accepted.

00:12:14.332 --> 00:12:18.332
So when we are born under such horrible circumstances,

00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:20.706
we have to build up

00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:23.664
a great force, ourselves,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.831
of spirituality.

00:12:27.082 --> 00:12:28.998
When I came today,

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.873
there was no breeze, no leaf was moving,

00:12:33.082 --> 00:12:36.706
but you were singing songs and tremendous breeze was coming

00:12:36.915 --> 00:12:39.998
from you all, and that made Me understand

00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:44.082
that this Divine force has come into being.

00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:46.748
It is there.

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:52.040
It's working. Not only that, but it’s very powerful.

00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:57.332
Normally, breeze doesn't come to Me, it goes the other way around.

00:12:58.123 --> 00:13:00.207
But it was such a tremendous breeze

00:13:00.414 --> 00:13:02.748
that I had to hold somebody's hand.

00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:05.790
And not a leaf was moving.

00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:09.956
So this collective force that you have,

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:12.498
you must remember you have to fight it,

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:16.498
not to run away. Don't escape it.

00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:19.748
You have to fight it

00:13:19.956 --> 00:13:24.040
and you have to prove that innocence is to be respected.

00:13:33.706 --> 00:13:38.581
Adi Shakti first made Shri Ganesh.

00:13:39.165 --> 00:13:41.539
It was the first

00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:44.539
deity was created. Why?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.456
Because She wanted to fill

00:13:48.664 --> 00:13:52.998
the whole atmosphere with Chaitanya,

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.414
with holiness, with auspiciousness.

00:13:57.998 --> 00:13:59.915
It is still there.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:02.664
It's still everywhere you can feel

00:14:02.873 --> 00:14:06.748
Chaitanya is working, but

00:14:07.873 --> 00:14:11.539
it does not penetrate into the

00:14:12.248 --> 00:14:16.248
modern minds because modern mind

00:14:16.414 --> 00:14:19.539
doesn't know what this innocence is.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.790
They have no idea at all about innocence.

00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:27.790
The way they are going on

00:14:28.082 --> 00:14:33.539
everywhere, is really something never happened on this earth.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.956
So with the innocence comes moral life.

00:14:42.456 --> 00:14:47.623
Morality is the expression of innocence.

00:14:54.082 --> 00:14:56.539
Innocence

00:14:57.123 --> 00:15:02.664
shows a person that he's incapable of being immoral.

00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:05.748
Once I had gone to visit a ship.

00:15:06.123 --> 00:15:09.194
I was coming out in the Customs.

00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:11.436
When I was coming in the Customs

00:15:11.637 --> 00:15:14.014
they said, "Did you get anything from the ship?"

00:15:14.215 --> 00:15:15.714
I said, "Yes, of course."

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.623
So they were shocked, you know , "What did you get?"

00:15:18.873 --> 00:15:20.414
"Some cheese."

00:15:20.664 --> 00:15:21.790
"And?"

00:15:21.998 --> 00:15:26.040
"And we ate also, and we have some cheese with us.”

00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:27.498
"What else?"

00:15:27.748 --> 00:15:29.456
"Some books."

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:31.456
"Books?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.290
You are not supposed to get any books from there."

00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:35.956
I said, "Why not?"

00:15:36.165 --> 00:15:38.373
He said, “You have to pay Customs."

00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:43.414
I said, “All right, how much do we have to pay Customs?"

00:15:43.748 --> 00:15:46.873
“You didn't read any rule about it?”  I said, “No.”

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.414
I was innocent.  I never read anything

00:15:49.623 --> 00:15:52.581
that you have to pay money for books also.

00:15:53.207 --> 00:15:55.956
He said, “No, no you are joking. Go."

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:58.831
They thought this woman is so simple,

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:03.060
She doesn't, I was the wife of the Chairman of Shipping Corporation,

00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.719
going in a very big car,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.587
and they couldn't understand this woman is so simple that

00:16:07.788 --> 00:16:09.913
She's saying She has taken some cheese

00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:12.531
and She has taken some books.

00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:17.706
All these laws and regulations

00:16:17.956 --> 00:16:20.581
people bind they have also come

00:16:21.332 --> 00:16:24.332
from our idea of Dharma.

00:16:24.539 --> 00:16:28.539
But the root of Dharma is innocence.

00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:33.207
All laws are made

00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:36.623
to protect the innocent.

00:16:37.332 --> 00:16:39.748
Not to punish

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:44.373
only the criminals but to protect the innocent person.

00:16:44.915 --> 00:16:48.332
So if somebody is proved to be innocent,

00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:53.332
your innocence protects you.

00:16:54.373 --> 00:16:56.706
I have seen many a times in My life,

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:01.165
because I'm so simple, I should say,

00:17:01.706 --> 00:17:06.207
that I had no problem, never, of anything.

00:17:09.332 --> 00:17:13.248
This is a kind of

00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:16.082
a very powerful vibrations

00:17:16.498 --> 00:17:18.873
that come from an innocent person,

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.414
like from small children.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.539
Small children, if you see their vibrations,

00:17:25.915 --> 00:17:29.539
hundreds grown up Sahaja Yogis may not have

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.956
the vibrations of a little one, I can tell you this much.

00:17:33.165 --> 00:17:35.873
But once they start growing,

00:17:37.248 --> 00:17:40.581
then they become very intelligent,

00:17:41.498 --> 00:17:44.290
very grown up, matured,

00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:50.165
and as if they have lost their innocence.

00:17:51.623 --> 00:17:54.373
This is no growth according to Me.

00:17:54.915 --> 00:17:58.706
According to Me this is the death of innocence.

00:17:59.373 --> 00:18:02.207
To be cunning, to be clever,

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:06.581
to be very intelligent, so called,

00:18:07.332 --> 00:18:09.956
it is very self-deceptive.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.373
For that, there is one blessing also.

00:18:19.623 --> 00:18:22.664
All those who have

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.082
committed such mistakes

00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:30.831
have to ask forgiveness from Sadashiva

00:18:31.165 --> 00:18:33.873
or from the Adi Shakti.

00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:37.623
But Ganesha doesn't forgive.

00:18:38.998 --> 00:18:42.581
That is one thing wrong with Him: He doesn't forgive.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:47.207
If you have hurt Him, He'll hit you back.

00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:51.581
As a result now, we have diseases like AIDS,

00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:54.123
all other horrible diseases that you have

00:18:54.332 --> 00:18:57.165
which are called as secret diseases.

00:18:57.748 --> 00:19:01.581
They are all because of the wrath of Shri Ganesh.

00:19:02.123 --> 00:19:04.873
Immoral life that people have been leading

00:19:05.123 --> 00:19:07.373
as if they have a permission

00:19:07.748 --> 00:19:10.581
from God Almighty to do what they like.

00:19:12.373 --> 00:19:16.248
People are so proud, such vanity,

00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:20.373
that they think whatever they do, after all, what,

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.040
nothing can happen to them.

00:19:23.456 --> 00:19:26.414
And with all these things happening in this world,

00:19:26.664 --> 00:19:29.790
people are still taking to immorality,

00:19:30.165 --> 00:19:32.332
very openly,

00:19:33.414 --> 00:19:35.498
boastfully.

00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:40.456
And I've seen that people who are elite, I have till now,

00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:42.498
been in the elite people.

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:46.915
They crack such dirty jokes and they are so

00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:50.623
overly smart that you just can't bear their company.

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:54.332
They are worse than the loafers on the street sometimes.

00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:57.332
So this disease has spread,

00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:03.414
spread among older people more than among younger people,

00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:06.207
among children.

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:11.664
So I think the people are now jealous of the little children.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.706
Otherwise, why should they attack

00:20:13.915 --> 00:20:16.956
younger children? What do they get out of them?

00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:22.040
In this jealous attitude

00:20:22.248 --> 00:20:26.123
they try to attack in a very dirty, funny manner.

00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:29.623
Then Shri Ganesh,

00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:31.873
He will never forgive these people -

00:20:32.082 --> 00:20:34.581
never, never, never.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.956
First of all, He'll expose them,

00:20:37.623 --> 00:20:41.706
and He will punish them for seven lives.

00:20:42.123 --> 00:20:45.915
Seven lives their families will be cursed,

00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:49.998
and seven lives they, themselves, will be cursed.

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:53.123
That is His commandment.

00:20:53.332 --> 00:20:55.956
But if His Mother says, "All right, forgive",

00:20:56.165 --> 00:20:59.373
or the father says, "All right, forgive", He obeys.

00:20:59.623 --> 00:21:03.248
He obeys His Mother absolutely.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.414
Never questions, never questions,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.831
never answers back.

00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:16.207
Whatever He’s told,

00:21:16.623 --> 00:21:21.332
though He's in command of all the Ganas, He's  Ganadheesha,

00:21:21.664 --> 00:21:26.831
but before His Mother, He's just like a little baby.

00:21:27.539 --> 00:21:30.456
He doesn't challenge the Mother.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:35.207
Even if the Mother tries to test Him

00:21:36.165 --> 00:21:40.332
or tries to get puzzled,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.748
He never doubt Her.

00:21:45.664 --> 00:21:48.831
In Her Maya He cannot fall.

00:21:49.456 --> 00:21:53.831
He cannot fall into Her Maya because He's so innocent.

00:21:55.332 --> 00:21:59.456
He's like a churned out butter, out of the buttermilk.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:03.539
So this butter can never get dissolved back.

00:22:03.748 --> 00:22:07.998
In the same way, this child,

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.498
which is pure innocence,

00:22:11.748 --> 00:22:15.040
never can be contaminated

00:22:15.456 --> 00:22:18.290
by the Maya of the Mother.

00:22:18.498 --> 00:22:23.581
Maya is the process by which you test people.

00:22:24.123 --> 00:22:26.165
You have to test them.

00:22:26.332 --> 00:22:30.123
See, these days people are so clever, so intelligent,

00:22:30.332 --> 00:22:34.040
that it is beyond even Adi Shakti, beyond any Shakti,

00:22:34.248 --> 00:22:37.123
the way they try to cheat you.

00:22:37.332 --> 00:22:39.290
So many have cheated Me,

00:22:39.456 --> 00:22:41.873
but they are back in their seats again.

00:22:42.082 --> 00:22:45.248
That's done not by Me, but by Shri Ganesha.

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:48.040
He's just standing on all the sides.

00:22:48.248 --> 00:22:50.664
If you try to do anything like that,

00:22:50.873 --> 00:22:53.873
He'll hit you hard - I can't help it.

00:22:54.248 --> 00:22:57.290
Now, this one came on this earth

00:22:57.456 --> 00:23:01.456
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:23:02.504 --> 00:23:06.171
Christ, I think, is more active than Shri Ganesha

00:23:06.382 --> 00:23:10.421
because Shri Ganesha is fat, He has a big belly,

00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:12.873
I think He takes time to hit you.

00:23:13.082 --> 00:23:15.373
But this Christ,

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:18.082
I don't know how He has hit people.

00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:22.998
All over the world there are diseases, diseases, diseases.

00:23:24.082 --> 00:23:27.706
He has killed so many people.

00:23:28.082 --> 00:23:31.873
He's the one who used to ask for forgiveness

00:23:32.331 --> 00:23:34.665
for the people who killed him.

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:38.082
But He is so active, I have seen,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.706
that sometimes I tell people,

00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:43.790
don't talk ill of Me, its very dangerous.

00:23:43.998 --> 00:23:46.498
Don't talk against Me.

00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:50.123
In a very secret manner He exists

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.248
and the way He hits people is sometimes -

00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:59.498
it's dangerous. Even My eyes get filled up with tears.

00:23:59.915 --> 00:24:02.164
So I have to control both sides.

00:24:02.373 --> 00:24:07.790
One is Shri Ganesha, another side is Christ.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.123
There are two other people,

00:24:12.623 --> 00:24:16.581
Saint Michael and Gabriel.

00:24:17.082 --> 00:24:20.498
We call them

00:24:21.957 --> 00:24:24.623
in Sanskrit language

00:24:24.832 --> 00:24:27.748
as Bhairava and Hanumana,

00:24:27.957 --> 00:24:31.957
and they incarnated as

00:24:33.456 --> 00:24:37.248
Buddha - Mahavira and Buddha.

00:24:39.748 --> 00:24:43.248
And the Buddhists are really, I tell you,

00:24:43.456 --> 00:24:47.498
are another kind of  perverts.

00:24:48.456 --> 00:24:51.581
It was said, Buddha said

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.498
that you should not get attached to anything;

00:24:54.748 --> 00:24:57.581
you shouldn't get attached to your money,

00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:03.248
to your wealth, to your family, to anything.

00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:16.373
That time,

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:20.123
the attachment was very great, must have been,

00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:24.581
and this attachment he wanted them to

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.665
remove from the minds of the people.

00:25:27.873 --> 00:25:29.873
You cannot.

00:25:30.082 --> 00:25:31.873
By removing your clothes,

00:25:32.082 --> 00:25:35.164
by wearing those saffron clothes,

00:25:35.706 --> 00:25:39.248
by shaving your heads, by walking bare feet,

00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:43.123
by torturing your body, you cannot.

00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:45.957
That's all outside.

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:50.331
That's not real detachment. That's not Buddha at all.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.082
Neither Christ, nor Mahavira.

00:25:55.331 --> 00:25:59.957
What they said that you should get detached from within.

00:26:01.082 --> 00:26:05.123
To get detached from within is very different

00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:09.706
than to get detached from outside.

00:26:11.248 --> 00:26:16.123
It's not how much you starve that you become Christ,

00:26:17.248 --> 00:26:22.248
or whether you move like Mahavira,

00:26:22.456 --> 00:26:26.082
that you become like Him,

00:26:27.331 --> 00:26:31.706
or you get saffron clothes

00:26:31.915 --> 00:26:34.748
like Buddha, you become Buddha.

00:26:34.957 --> 00:26:38.373
So what a misconception they have

00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:42.623
of whatever was taught to people.

00:26:42.957 --> 00:26:47.289
That was the time when it was the days of tapasya,

00:26:47.623 --> 00:26:52.082
of penance, and that's why they said to do penance

00:26:52.248 --> 00:26:54.623
is best is to get rid of all these things

00:26:54.873 --> 00:26:59.706
so you will develop deeper into your being.

00:27:01.706 --> 00:27:04.331
Even in the Christian religion they started

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.248
these nuns and these, what you call them,

00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:09.998
the fathers and the mothers and the nuns,

00:27:10.164 --> 00:27:12.581
and all kinds of things.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.498
This is another artificial thing they started.

00:27:16.957 --> 00:27:21.790
By doing this, do you think you can become innocent?

00:27:24.498 --> 00:27:27.873
I have known nuns who are so horrible

00:27:28.082 --> 00:27:30.082
that you can't even look at them,

00:27:30.248 --> 00:27:32.873
they emit nothing but heat.

00:27:33.082 --> 00:27:37.082
And those priests, now you have heard about them,

00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:42.248
the way they are attacking the innocence of people.

00:27:44.331 --> 00:27:48.915
Buddhists are the worst, I should say, because

00:27:53.873 --> 00:27:57.832
they say, “Renounce, renounce everything.”

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.206
All right, renounce and beg.

00:28:03.206 --> 00:28:07.581
So you renounce everything and beg for gold.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.915
What do you say to this kind of a contradiction?

00:28:11.082 --> 00:28:15.123
And we have there, like Dalai Lama,

00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:18.832
he is a universal beggar

00:28:19.498 --> 00:28:21.206
and people like it.

00:28:21.414 --> 00:28:23.040
People like if somebody is begging

00:28:23.206 --> 00:28:26.331
because their ego is pampered.

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.873
Like he went to Los Angeles

00:28:29.082 --> 00:28:32.082
and all the actors and actresses had a very, very

00:28:32.248 --> 00:28:33.957
big conference and thought

00:28:34.123 --> 00:28:36.665
that by giving alms to this beggar

00:28:36.873 --> 00:28:40.082
their innocence will come back.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.832
Can you believe such a story?

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.206
Any sensible people has to understand,

00:28:45.414 --> 00:28:49.123
that by giving alms, how can your innocence come back?

00:28:50.623 --> 00:28:53.498
And so this fellow was again given lot of alms.

00:28:53.706 --> 00:28:56.289
He's got lot of gold and he's really

00:28:56.498 --> 00:29:01.414
a goldy man, all the time collecting gold

00:29:01.623 --> 00:29:04.957
from here and gold from there and gold from you.

00:29:08.373 --> 00:29:12.414
Such people, incarnations, who came just to

00:29:12.748 --> 00:29:17.706
tell us to be detached, just to develop morality.

00:29:18.373 --> 00:29:22.373
If you are detached about your sex life,

00:29:22.623 --> 00:29:27.082
if you are detached about your financial side,

00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:30.706
if you are detached even from your country,

00:29:30.957 --> 00:29:33.331
then a detached personality of that kind

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.706
will become innocent and there will be no quarrel.

00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:43.082
But it's happening the other way around now.

00:29:46.748 --> 00:29:48.748
Same in the Islam.

00:29:48.957 --> 00:29:53.790
Whatever was taught in the Islam is taken on the other side.

00:29:53.998 --> 00:29:56.331
It cannot be in any way

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.082
where Mohammed Sahib was only insisting on morality.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.248
Any kind of immoral behavior He didn't want to have.

00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:09.123
He did say, at that time, you can marry more women

00:30:09.331 --> 00:30:11.164
because there were more women,

00:30:11.373 --> 00:30:15.164
but He never said you become prostitutes,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.623
you lead a life of sin.

00:30:20.915 --> 00:30:23.623
That was just a Samayachar, that was only

00:30:23.832 --> 00:30:27.082
that time, that was the problem. He said,   “All right.”

00:30:27.248 --> 00:30:30.082
For example, divorce was not allowed at that time,

00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:33.082
but in Sahaja Yoga we do allow divorce.

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:36.289
But I have seen that without divorce

00:30:36.498 --> 00:30:40.164
they can't live, I mean, just an impossible situation

00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:42.998
because also women sometimes

00:30:43.206 --> 00:30:46.748
are extremely, extremely cruel

00:30:46.957 --> 00:30:50.540
and men sometimes are extremely peevish.

00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:54.915
Under these circumstances, how can they be companions?

00:30:55.832 --> 00:31:00.623
More women are immoral in this matter, I should say.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.248
First, it was the men who used to do immorality,

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.082
but now the women who are not only innocence,

00:31:07.289 --> 00:31:09.873
but also Shakti,

00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:13.748
are trying to get into

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.540
some sort of a shamelessness.

00:31:18.373 --> 00:31:23.248
No care of their own innocence.

00:31:23.915 --> 00:31:26.581
Their innocence is the Shakti.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.832
If a woman is not innocent, how can she have Shakti?

00:31:32.623 --> 00:31:35.790
If she is leading an immoral life,

00:31:36.123 --> 00:31:39.498
then her Shakti will be finished.

00:31:39.748 --> 00:31:44.373
Only her morality is her Shri Ganesha

00:31:44.623 --> 00:31:49.456
which emits this purity in her.

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:56.665
Now, I feel that

00:31:57.665 --> 00:32:01.164
the way people are pumping our heads with ideas,

00:32:01.373 --> 00:32:03.873
especially from Hollywood,

00:32:04.082 --> 00:32:06.164
we accept them

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.040
and we forget that we are just hurting Shri Ganesha

00:32:11.248 --> 00:32:14.040
and He'll come back on us.

00:32:15.665 --> 00:32:18.581
It starts at a very low level

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.248
when we start hating our children.

00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:28.414
The problem starts when we don't understand our children.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.040
I mean, in England they say that two children are killed

00:32:33.206 --> 00:32:37.456
every week by parents.

00:32:40.957 --> 00:32:45.832
This kind of attitude towards children.

00:32:46.373 --> 00:32:49.331
First of all, they should not produce;

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.289
if they have produced then they are Shri Ganeshas.

00:32:52.498 --> 00:32:54.248
They have to respect,

00:32:54.456 --> 00:32:58.373
they have to love, and they have to encourage.

00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:00.957
But to spoil the children is also

00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:04.373
another kind of negative force, I think.

00:33:04.623 --> 00:33:07.790
Some people spoil their children.

00:33:09.498 --> 00:33:12.623
Ganesha can never be spoiled.

00:33:13.748 --> 00:33:17.581
You cannot spoil Him, because He is beyond Maya.

00:33:17.915 --> 00:33:21.748
But the way people run after their children sometimes

00:33:21.957 --> 00:33:23.164
is shocking.

00:33:23.373 --> 00:33:27.082
To them, that is the greatest achievement they have got,

00:33:27.248 --> 00:33:28.873
that they have a child.

00:33:29.082 --> 00:33:31.581
Even in a place like India

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.790
where it's an over population,

00:33:35.498 --> 00:33:37.832
to them their children are like,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.082
I don't know what, so attached.

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:44.790
So this is a new attachment that has started

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:51.373
which also gives you a kind of an immoral life,

00:33:54.456 --> 00:33:57.414
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:57.998 --> 00:34:00.540
For people who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:00.748 --> 00:34:03.957
all the children of the world are their own,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.832
not only your own children whom you love.

00:34:09.418 --> 00:34:12.302
All of them are Shri Ganeshas.

00:34:12.463 --> 00:34:15.414
Of course, if there's somebody who is not a good child

00:34:15.623 --> 00:34:19.040
or you find it difficult, its all right,

00:34:19.206 --> 00:34:22.748
but otherwise all the children of this world

00:34:22.957 --> 00:34:25.832
are your own children

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.790
and you have to love them

00:34:27.998 --> 00:34:30.498
as you would love your own children.

00:34:30.706 --> 00:34:33.547
Christ has said, "Love thy neighbor as thyself."

00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:36.257
I don't know why He said it because in all

00:34:36.418 --> 00:34:40.627
Christian nations neighbors are the biggest problem.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.832
Even here.

00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:49.082
So I say, "Love thy child,

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:52.498
love other children as thy children".

00:34:52.706 --> 00:34:55.540
Let’s start at that point, maybe after that.

00:34:55.748 --> 00:34:59.414
But normally there are places where they won't allow

00:34:59.623 --> 00:35:02.040
you to take a flat because you have children.

00:35:02.206 --> 00:35:04.248
I mean, imagine.

00:35:04.498 --> 00:35:09.832
Only unmarried people or barren people can live there.

00:35:10.082 --> 00:35:13.873
And also compulsory is that you should not have any child.

00:35:14.082 --> 00:35:16.082
Even today you may not have child

00:35:16.248 --> 00:35:19.023
but once you live there you should not have any child.

00:35:19.184 --> 00:35:24.433
If you have a child then you are ousted. Can you imagine?

00:35:25.082 --> 00:35:28.289
About only thirty years back, people had twelve children,

00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:32.082
fourteen children, they were competing in that

00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:34.082
and lived very happily.

00:35:34.248 --> 00:35:39.414
And these days the problem has become like this,

00:35:39.623 --> 00:35:42.706
that you should not have many children.

00:35:42.915 --> 00:35:47.373
Those who started the problem are having no children at all.

00:35:48.289 --> 00:35:50.915
Those who said should be controlled, see,

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:55.414
anywhere in the west the growth is minus.

00:35:55.623 --> 00:35:58.206
Who is doing that? Shri Ganesh.

00:35:58.414 --> 00:36:02.082
You don't want children, all right.  Don't have.

00:36:02.623 --> 00:36:05.915
Except for Sahaja Yogis, nobody gets child.

00:36:06.248 --> 00:36:08.998
In this place, Mohan got his child first

00:36:09.164 --> 00:36:12.248
so in the whole village there was a celebration.

00:36:12.456 --> 00:36:16.998
There has been no child born here for years together.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.456
But then, again, the problem is like this.

00:36:21.665 --> 00:36:25.540
When I say this, I find Sahaja Yogis go to another extreme.

00:36:25.748 --> 00:36:30.540
They are stuck to their children; “stuck” actually is the word.

00:36:34.832 --> 00:36:37.748
Which is very wrong.

00:36:38.331 --> 00:36:41.123
I'm not saying you should neglect your child in any way,

00:36:41.331 --> 00:36:46.498
or you should in any way beat them or trouble them,

00:36:46.706 --> 00:36:48.498
all these things.

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:51.915
You must love them in such a manner

00:36:52.456 --> 00:36:56.082
that they should know, if they do anything wrong

00:36:56.289 --> 00:36:58.706
they'll lose your love.

00:36:58.915 --> 00:37:03.540
Because for children love is the most important thing.

00:37:07.957 --> 00:37:10.998
They should know this, what you don't like.

00:37:11.164 --> 00:37:14.289
You should tell them what you don't like.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.456
And you will be amazed

00:37:18.665 --> 00:37:24.164
how children will not do anything

00:37:24.414 --> 00:37:28.748
that will make you unhappy with them.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.581
Now that's a trick I think one has to learn.

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:35.873
This is the best way to grow your children.

00:37:36.082 --> 00:37:38.623
I'll tell you a story of My own daughter.

00:37:38.832 --> 00:37:43.082
She went to Delhi and all the girls were having sleeveless blouses.

00:37:43.456 --> 00:37:46.790
So she asked Me,

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:50.351
"I want to have sleeveless blouses."

00:37:50.512 --> 00:37:52.790
She was grown up, she was going to college.

00:37:52.998 --> 00:37:55.414
I said, "All right, have it, whatever you like."

00:37:55.623 --> 00:37:59.164
Then said, "By the way, why don't You wear sleeveless?"

00:37:59.373 --> 00:38:02.414
I said, "I feel shy."

00:38:04.123 --> 00:38:07.456
"Then why should You allow me?  This is no criteria.

00:38:07.665 --> 00:38:11.957
Whatever I ask, You say, ‘yes’ to me.  I'm not that grown up."

00:38:14.998 --> 00:38:17.498
Even My granddaughter, she was here,

00:38:17.706 --> 00:38:18.790
she asked Me,

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.873
"Nani, why do you wear always blouses with sleeves?"

00:38:23.082 --> 00:38:28.082
I said, "Do you know these are very important chakras,

00:38:28.498 --> 00:38:31.456
the most important chakras for our body.

00:38:31.665 --> 00:38:34.915
If you keep them open, these two or these two,

00:38:35.082 --> 00:38:36.873
then you will have problems."

00:38:37.082 --> 00:38:41.164
"My goodness, I must wear now full sleeve."

00:38:41.414 --> 00:38:44.540
Immediately they understood.

00:38:44.832 --> 00:38:47.581
So something deep, if you tell them

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:52.623
in a deep manner which is respecting their innocence,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.581
they will improve.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.581
For example, a child comes spoilt child,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:00.248
he does very well in the class and all that.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.665
Now one way is to beat him up, shout at him,

00:39:03.873 --> 00:39:05.915
scold him - these are one.

00:39:06.082 --> 00:39:08.456
Another simple thing is

00:39:08.665 --> 00:39:13.040
to talk to him, “See, supposing you stand first,

00:39:13.498 --> 00:39:18.164
supposing you get good marks, you become a great man.

00:39:18.373 --> 00:39:22.082
How proud I will be.  Everybody will be proud of you.

00:39:22.289 --> 00:39:24.123
But supposing you do not,

00:39:24.331 --> 00:39:27.040
then they will think, ‘Oh, he's a useless fellow,

00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:29.832
he'll have to beg on the street.’”

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.748
Immediately, he'll change.

00:39:32.957 --> 00:39:37.414
The handling of the children is very important.

00:39:37.998 --> 00:39:40.540
Innocence is to be handled

00:39:40.748 --> 00:39:42.832
in a very delicate manner

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.331
as you would handle a beautiful flower.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.040
It's a flower.

00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:54.456
As flower has fragrance, also innocence has fragrance.

00:39:54.915 --> 00:39:59.998
Now this Ganesha was made out of the Mother Earth.

00:40:20.082 --> 00:40:23.623
He was made out of Mother Earth.

00:40:24.206 --> 00:40:29.082
Mother Earth is the essence of innocence.

00:40:30.414 --> 00:40:32.456
See this Mother Earth,

00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:35.665
we don't look after, we don't give Her water,

00:40:35.873 --> 00:40:38.498
we don't do anything for Her,

00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:43.998
but how She's trying to enrich our life;

00:40:45.123 --> 00:40:49.082
how She's trying to cool us down;

00:40:50.082 --> 00:40:53.706
how She works out for us things

00:40:53.915 --> 00:40:58.373
which normally cannot be improved.

00:40:59.581 --> 00:41:04.414
To respect this Mother Earth  is very important

00:41:04.623 --> 00:41:08.138
for all the innocent people. They do.

00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:10.915
I've seen children, they respect the Mother Earth.

00:41:11.082 --> 00:41:15.706
They like to play on the mud, they like to play on sands,

00:41:15.957 --> 00:41:19.082
they want to build castles,

00:41:24.581 --> 00:41:28.665
and all kinds of things they do with the Mother Earth.

00:41:29.082 --> 00:41:32.540
But they are not attached, that's one thing.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.123
They are not attached.They'll build a castle.

00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:38.082
All right, finished, now finish this.

00:41:38.248 --> 00:41:40.082
Then they go to the airport,

00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:44.206
there they find something, they all join to make it a joy.

00:41:44.498 --> 00:41:46.665
Wherever they go

00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:49.331
they find it easy to make that thing

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:54.082
for their enjoyment. To them, enjoyment is important.

00:41:54.872 --> 00:41:57.623
To them, yesterday, as I said time is not important.

00:41:57.832 --> 00:42:00.082
How much you enjoy is important.

00:42:00.248 --> 00:42:04.832
Time is a headache for the grown-ups.

00:42:05.082 --> 00:42:07.540
Children don't worry.

00:42:07.748 --> 00:42:11.706
You take them somewhere in a nice place

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:15.619
so they don't want to come our way.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.623
You ask them, "Lets go home."

00:42:17.832 --> 00:42:21.957
"Why?  For what? Why should we go home?"

00:42:22.118 --> 00:42:24.701
They can't understand.

00:42:25.082 --> 00:42:30.206
They love all that is natural, all that is beautiful.

00:42:30.456 --> 00:42:34.498
They don't know the value in the money form.

00:42:34.706 --> 00:42:36.998
They know the value of something

00:42:37.164 --> 00:42:40.164
in the form of love.

00:42:41.331 --> 00:42:44.082
I have seen Myself,

00:42:44.373 --> 00:42:48.248
you see, if you give something to children

00:42:48.498 --> 00:42:52.581
they'll keep it there, even Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:56.498
and they'll show you, “I've got it.”

00:42:56.832 --> 00:43:02.957
See the essence of Shri Ganesha is pure love.

00:43:06.164 --> 00:43:10.082
The pure love of this Mother Earth

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.832
created Shri Ganesha,

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.331
or Adi Shakti created out of the pure love.

00:43:18.623 --> 00:43:20.123
But surprisingly,

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:25.040
Shri Ganesha was created before the Mother Earth,

00:43:25.414 --> 00:43:27.248
so how it is?

00:43:27.456 --> 00:43:30.706
So first He was created only

00:43:30.915 --> 00:43:34.082
as the Logos, as they call it, or we call it

00:43:34.289 --> 00:43:37.623
the Brahmanadha, Omkara.

00:43:38.082 --> 00:43:42.623
First He was created only as the sound of Omkara.

00:43:43.206 --> 00:43:45.832
Then this Omkara

00:43:46.082 --> 00:43:49.832
was covered with the Mother Earth

00:43:50.164 --> 00:43:53.414
to make Shri Ganesha.

00:43:53.873 --> 00:43:59.581
So, Omkar is so important

00:44:00.289 --> 00:44:04.456
because it has got in it

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:10.373
all the three powers, A-U-M.

00:44:12.456 --> 00:44:17.498
A-U-M stands for the Mahakali,

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.915
Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi's powers.

00:44:22.706 --> 00:44:27.123
All these three powers exist in this Omkara.

00:44:27.706 --> 00:44:30.873
So in a dormant form, we can say

00:44:31.082 --> 00:44:35.123
those three powers exist in Shri Ganesha.

00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:40.957
So when we try to harm Him,

00:44:41.206 --> 00:44:45.414
then we are harming the Shakti within us,

00:44:45.873 --> 00:44:48.790
which is Omkar,

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.790
which fills the whole universe,

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.164
which fills all the vibrations.

00:44:56.498 --> 00:45:00.082
In the vibrations these powers move.

00:45:00.456 --> 00:45:04.456
These three powers fill up every vibration.

00:45:04.915 --> 00:45:07.623
That's why they know, they understand

00:45:07.832 --> 00:45:12.581
and they work out the whole thing in such a manner that...

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.957
Supposing now somebody has broken his legs,

00:45:16.123 --> 00:45:18.665
take it like that.

00:45:19.581 --> 00:45:23.206
Now, I sit down here and may give a bandhan.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.665
Immediately, immediately,

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:33.823
a power is sent, immediately.

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:36.573
Somehow,

00:45:36.865 --> 00:45:41.156
is faster than all your communications that you use

00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:45.114
and immediately things work out.

00:45:47.448 --> 00:45:52.323
How it works out? Now it's a very complicated stuff,

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.198
but it’s also very uncomplicated because

00:45:56.406 --> 00:45:59.531
it is the work of Shri Ganesh.

00:46:01.281 --> 00:46:03.573
He's not interested.

00:46:03.782 --> 00:46:06.323
You see, if there's any problem, all right,

00:46:06.531 --> 00:46:10.823
like making a little fort on the seashore;

00:46:11.032 --> 00:46:15.239
All right, it will melt it, finished, back again.

00:46:15.698 --> 00:46:18.698
He's not attached.

00:46:20.032 --> 00:46:23.073
So what should we do

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:27.364
to show our gratitude to this little child?

00:46:29.281 --> 00:46:31.823
Supposing you say to a child, “Thank you.”

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.615
He’ll say, “Hey, what did you say?"

00:46:34.823 --> 00:46:37.073
Won't understand, children don't understand

00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:39.026
why should we thank them.

00:46:39.187 --> 00:46:40.854
We teach them say "thank you,"

00:46:41.015 --> 00:46:44.175
so even if they have to say "sorry", they’ll say "thank you"

00:46:44.336 --> 00:46:48.364
because they know only one word, "thank you". So they say "thank you".

00:46:48.656 --> 00:46:50.448
Now these children,

00:46:50.656 --> 00:46:55.156
how will they play, in the same way this Omkara plays.

00:46:56.865 --> 00:47:02.615
Most detached, as they call "Nishkriya", to the power.

00:47:02.823 --> 00:47:05.239
Means doesn't do anything.

00:47:05.531 --> 00:47:07.698
Nothing, just paying attention.

00:47:07.907 --> 00:47:11.114
If somebody gets cured, gets saved,

00:47:11.364 --> 00:47:15.656
somebody gets vibrations,

00:47:16.323 --> 00:47:18.907
who does it?  Shri Ganesh.

00:47:20.198 --> 00:47:25.281
But He is not attached, He's not attached,

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.615
He doesn't want any credit for it.  It's His job.

00:47:28.823 --> 00:47:31.406
He will send one Ganas, all right, go to... fast .

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.406
They will run fast,

00:47:33.615 --> 00:47:37.615
more than any one of your modern - the most modern

00:47:37.823 --> 00:47:40.990
vehicle that you have as aeroplanes or anything.

00:47:41.156 --> 00:47:44.615
Immediately, I'm telling you again, the word is that.

00:47:44.823 --> 00:47:48.364
Just as if you press the button, it works.

00:47:48.573 --> 00:47:51.698
But on some people it does not,

00:47:51.907 --> 00:47:55.406
if they are surrounded by people who have no faith,

00:47:55.865 --> 00:47:58.573
if they themselves have half faith or something.

00:47:58.782 --> 00:48:03.698
He is the judge of your faith in the Mother

00:48:03.907 --> 00:48:09.907
because He has absolute faith in His Mother - absolutely.

00:48:10.198 --> 00:48:16.531
In the same way, those who have absolute faith in His Mother,

00:48:18.114 --> 00:48:21.656
He looks after them.

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:25.032
He really looks after them.

00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:28.323
Also He destroys.

00:48:33.698 --> 00:48:37.239
Once a person told Me

00:48:37.448 --> 00:48:40.615
about a minister in India,

00:48:40.823 --> 00:48:43.323
a very nasty fellow,

00:48:43.531 --> 00:48:47.782
very corrupt, immoral, everything put together.

00:48:48.483 --> 00:48:51.608
He was going on, carrying on,

00:48:51.769 --> 00:48:55.322
but this was a nice Sahaja Yogi, very good Sahaja Yogi. He told Me

00:48:55.483 --> 00:48:58.370
that this man has now started troubling him

00:48:58.531 --> 00:49:01.228
and wants him to do something dishonest.

00:49:01.389 --> 00:49:06.531
I said, “Really?” I said, “Really here and there".

00:49:06.782 --> 00:49:11.198
This great minister had to resign and go away.

00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:15.295
That moment.

00:49:15.496 --> 00:49:19.371
Is a fact.  I can show you so many such things,

00:49:19.615 --> 00:49:25.781
but the faith of Shri Ganesha is tremendous.

00:49:28.387 --> 00:49:33.179
He never doubts, and He's not attached.

00:49:33.382 --> 00:49:34.787
So many people sometimes,

00:49:34.948 --> 00:49:37.865
"Mother, you know we did this, we went there,

00:49:38.032 --> 00:49:41.615
we had to climb up so much, and then we gave realization

00:49:41.823 --> 00:49:46.406
only to one person". Finished.

00:49:47.236 --> 00:49:49.986
What's the use?  Don't give any realization.

00:49:50.147 --> 00:49:52.194
I have told hundred times to people,

00:49:52.355 --> 00:49:55.513
if you think you are doing any work, better not do it.

00:49:55.673 --> 00:49:58.548
It's no good doing such work.

00:49:58.798 --> 00:50:01.882
If you are attached to it, then better not do it.

00:50:02.048 --> 00:50:07.131
You do it for fun, just for joy, just for faith in your Mother.

00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:11.882
With this absolute faith you never feel fatigued,

00:50:12.048 --> 00:50:15.423
you never feel tired. You see Shri Ganesha's work.

00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:17.632
All these bandhans, who carries?

00:50:19.239 --> 00:50:22.656
Shriman Ganesh Mahoday.

00:50:25.882 --> 00:50:30.340
He, with His big belly,

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.131
just orders His people,

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.590
and these Ganeshas, Ganas,

00:50:35.798 --> 00:50:39.923
are the most competent people you can find.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:45.298
You get Me any competent person, any scientist,

00:50:46.798 --> 00:50:49.423
no one can beat them.

00:50:49.757 --> 00:50:52.757
How can they cure a person?

00:50:53.048 --> 00:50:57.715
Say a lady had a son in Mexico who was sick

00:50:58.048 --> 00:51:01.798
and he had a fatal disease which was in their family

00:51:01.964 --> 00:51:05.882
but they always used to get it at an age

00:51:06.089 --> 00:51:09.632
when they were very old.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.882
But he was a young boy studying in Harvard.

00:51:13.131 --> 00:51:15.583
She wrote to Me three letters

00:51:15.744 --> 00:51:18.911
and in these three letters she was wondering, “What should I do?

00:51:19.072 --> 00:51:22.423
Should I send him to You?” And I was, you see,

00:51:22.632 --> 00:51:25.465
jumping from one tree to another tree.

00:51:25.673 --> 00:51:28.006
I said, "Where would you meet Me?"

00:51:28.214 --> 00:51:30.506
I just thought of it,

00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:33.340
and fourth letter comes in, that she took him

00:51:33.548 --> 00:51:36.840
to the hospital in Harvard University

00:51:37.006 --> 00:51:40.256
and there she took him to some other hospital,

00:51:40.465 --> 00:51:42.513
and all the hospitals declared that

00:51:42.673 --> 00:51:46.214
he is absolutely all right, he's completely cured.

00:51:50.548 --> 00:51:55.882
But, your faith. Her faith has worked.

00:51:56.506 --> 00:52:00.465
It is the mother's faith has worked for the son.

00:52:01.465 --> 00:52:05.256
It’s very easy to doubt Me, it's very easy.

00:52:05.548 --> 00:52:10.006
It's a slippery ground, I tell you, very easy to doubt Me.

00:52:12.214 --> 00:52:15.173
Because people doubt people for what they wear.

00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:17.298
Now they will say,

00:52:17.506 --> 00:52:20.089
"Why was She wearing such an expensive sari?"

00:52:20.298 --> 00:52:25.964
This is a selection of Mr. Guido the great, not Mine.

00:52:27.882 --> 00:52:31.089
He forced Me to buy this.

00:52:32.757 --> 00:52:35.590
What can I do?

00:52:36.882 --> 00:52:43.256
But I'm not attached, but to keep his spirits all right

00:52:45.173 --> 00:52:48.757
I wear it, just to please them.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.673
Even children, you will be surprised,

00:52:53.882 --> 00:52:58.256
they feel very pleased if you do something that they like.

00:52:59.548 --> 00:53:01.964
They are very, very,

00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:05.742
I shouldn't say intelligent because I don't like that word very much

00:53:05.903 --> 00:53:09.403
but I should say, very subtly understanding things.

00:53:11.214 --> 00:53:15.214
One of My granddaughters, eldest one, she's a gem of a gem.

00:53:15.673 --> 00:53:20.715
She, I took for her a Wendy's house and she built it up.

00:53:21.256 --> 00:53:23.798
And My daughter is quite tall.

00:53:23.964 --> 00:53:26.715
She called her, “Mummy, come to my house."

00:53:26.882 --> 00:53:29.256
So this daughter of Mine went there

00:53:29.465 --> 00:53:31.506
and she entered inside the house

00:53:31.715 --> 00:53:34.298
and she broke the whole thing.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.845
So it is, my granddaughter came to Me,

00:53:37.006 --> 00:53:38.548
"See. Look at your daughter.

00:53:38.709 --> 00:53:41.750
You have taught her no manners of any kind."

00:53:42.089 --> 00:53:45.506
I said, "Why, what happened?”, "She comes into my house

00:53:45.715 --> 00:53:48.214
and asks such an unmannerly question,

00:53:48.375 --> 00:53:50.208
‘What have you got for me to eat?’

00:53:50.369 --> 00:53:53.225
Do you do that when you are going into somebody's house?

00:53:53.386 --> 00:53:54.845
Do you ask such a question?

00:53:55.006 --> 00:53:57.298
And when I said, ‘You can't ask such a question

00:53:57.506 --> 00:53:58.715
in somebody else’s house,’

00:53:58.882 --> 00:54:02.048
she laughed so much that she broke my house.

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:05.869
Is this the way to behave? You have never taught them.

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:08.214
Grandma you have taught us everything nice.

00:54:08.381 --> 00:54:10.585
You have never taught her how to behave

00:54:10.746 --> 00:54:12.715
when you go to somebody's house.”

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:15.506
You see?  So innocent.

00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:18.964
So innocent the whole thing was,

00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:22.465
that just to please her,

00:54:22.715 --> 00:54:26.798
even a small thing if you do, you can please them.

00:54:27.048 --> 00:54:29.089
Very simple thing.

00:54:29.465 --> 00:54:32.590
Now His power is Kundalini.

00:54:32.798 --> 00:54:35.673
Well, this is another problem.

00:54:36.131 --> 00:54:40.089
She is the power of Shri Ganesha

00:54:40.423 --> 00:54:44.632
and without Him She won't rise.

00:54:45.298 --> 00:54:48.798
What a complication - now tell Me.

00:54:50.757 --> 00:54:54.298
Like, if My child says,

00:54:54.548 --> 00:54:59.340
"You can't go out of this house without asking me",

00:55:00.423 --> 00:55:02.506
so you can't just do anything,

00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:05.882
you are bound to the house.

00:55:06.506 --> 00:55:08.131
So in the same way,

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.131
without taking the permission of Shri Ganesha,

00:55:12.423 --> 00:55:15.173
Kundalini won't rise.

00:55:15.423 --> 00:55:18.465
It's very difficult,

00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:23.131
impossible I should say.

00:55:24.256 --> 00:55:27.256
Of course, the Mooladhara will go on like this,

00:55:27.465 --> 00:55:31.506
pumping just like a heart,

00:55:32.506 --> 00:55:34.422
but it won't come up

00:55:34.582 --> 00:55:37.206
because Kundalini would like to do

00:55:37.415 --> 00:55:40.956
but He won't allow Her to go.

00:55:42.998 --> 00:55:45.331
Those who are immoral,

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:48.331
those who have done immoral things,

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:52.832
and those who are spoiling

00:55:53.039 --> 00:55:55.914
the Ganesha principle of others,

00:55:56.123 --> 00:55:59.290
are very difficult for realization.

00:55:59.665 --> 00:56:02.415
But I have seen some people

00:56:02.623 --> 00:56:05.873
who have asked for forgiveness

00:56:06.415 --> 00:56:09.748
and the Mother has told Shri Ganesh to forgive,

00:56:09.914 --> 00:56:12.665
they have got realization.

00:56:12.832 --> 00:56:15.081
Only that's the point,

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.790
that if you approach through the Mother,

00:56:17.956 --> 00:56:19.956
He will forgive you.

00:56:20.164 --> 00:56:22.498
Definitely, He'll forgive you.

00:56:22.707 --> 00:56:25.164
There is such a nice

00:56:25.373 --> 00:56:29.123
relationship between the mother and child.

00:56:29.626 --> 00:56:32.914
That's something good, otherwise this fellow would have killed

00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:37.241
at least ninety percent of people in the modern times.

00:56:39.748 --> 00:56:45.790
So it is such a blessing, also,

00:56:48.081 --> 00:56:50.039
such a promise,

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.582
that if we look after our Shri Ganesh principle,

00:56:55.665 --> 00:56:58.039
keep ourselves clean,

00:56:58.248 --> 00:57:00.415
keep our eyes clean,

00:57:00.665 --> 00:57:05.914
and develop pure relationships among ourselves,

00:57:08.956 --> 00:57:13.373
we'll have no problem of any kind.

00:57:13.707 --> 00:57:16.373
You'll have proper relations with your wife,

00:57:16.582 --> 00:57:19.331
proper relations with your children,

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.707
and proper relations in the family,

00:57:23.290 --> 00:57:26.456
proper relations in the society,

00:57:26.832 --> 00:57:32.081
proper relations in the politics, economics,

00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:37.540
and all various areas in which you move.

00:57:38.415 --> 00:57:41.748
Your innocence will help.

00:57:42.415 --> 00:57:46.456
You might think that people are trying to befool you.

00:57:46.998 --> 00:57:52.998
Let them try and you see what happens.

00:57:54.498 --> 00:57:58.790
Let them try to attack your innocence

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:02.582
and see what they get out of it.

00:58:05.498 --> 00:58:10.790
It is such a blessing you all have as human beings,

00:58:11.206 --> 00:58:13.623
that your Mooladhara is so well developed

00:58:13.832 --> 00:58:16.373
and Shri Ganesha is nicely settled down.

00:58:16.582 --> 00:58:18.832
You all have got your realization

00:58:19.039 --> 00:58:21.665
and now whatever we were enjoying -

00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:25.832
- yesterday, just like children, don't you think so?

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.323
We had forgotten our age, everything,

00:58:28.484 --> 00:58:31.373
we were just like children enjoying everything,

00:58:31.582 --> 00:58:34.415
whether the dance were rhythmic, unrhythmic

00:58:34.623 --> 00:58:37.956
or inconsistent, we didn't mind.

00:58:39.707 --> 00:58:41.998
Everything we enjoyed.

00:58:42.248 --> 00:58:45.832
No rules, regulations are needed for enjoyment.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:49.331
And this enjoyment, the source of this enjoyment,

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:52.748
comes from the innocence that we have within us.

00:58:54.081 --> 00:58:55.456
Without innocence,

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:59.081
you cannot enjoy anything with this mind

00:58:59.832 --> 00:59:03.498
and from this heart,

00:59:04.206 --> 00:59:09.998
because in the heart resides the father,

00:59:12.164 --> 00:59:15.206
Shiva.

00:59:15.498 --> 00:59:18.707
They are terrible people,

00:59:19.123 --> 00:59:22.498
snakes around them.

00:59:23.206 --> 00:59:24.331
You...

00:59:26.873 --> 00:59:30.373
Not easy...

00:59:30.665 --> 00:59:34.914
If you can stand on your feet for fifteen years

00:59:35.123 --> 00:59:37.748
and go on saying,

00:59:37.956 --> 00:59:40.373
“Om Namaha Shivaya, Om Namaha Shivaya”,

00:59:40.582 --> 00:59:46.164
then maybe Shiva might grant you some boon.

00:59:46.707 --> 00:59:51.290
It's the most difficult deity to please, is Shiva.

00:59:51.832 --> 00:59:54.331
Though He is very innocent Himself,

00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.873
He is too innocent, so much so,

00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:58.956
just like a white cloth you can say.

00:59:59.164 --> 01:00:05.081
Any bit of spot on your character, finished,

01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:07.832
condemned.

01:00:08.873 --> 01:00:13.540
But even a rakshasa stands on his leg

01:00:13.748 --> 01:00:16.415
for twenty-five years maybe

01:00:16.623 --> 01:00:20.914
and goes on praising Him, then He may forgive.

01:00:24.707 --> 01:00:27.248
Shri Ganesha doesn't forgive.

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.331
So the only person left to you is your Mother,

01:00:31.956 --> 01:00:33.998
who just forgives.

01:00:34.206 --> 01:00:37.623
I don't want to have any headache of this not-forgivingness.

01:00:37.784 --> 01:00:41.505
It's a big headache. If you don't forgive somebody, I get a headache,

01:00:41.665 --> 01:00:44.956
so I don't want Myself to do that.

01:00:45.164 --> 01:00:50.123
So I just forgive. I forgive.

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:55.998
I forgive all the Sahaja yogis all the time.

01:00:56.206 --> 01:00:59.665
There have been some horrible, nasty fellows.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.914
I don't want to be angry with them because Ganesha will

01:01:04.123 --> 01:01:05.582
just finish them.

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:08.956
Automatically, Ganesha is doing something,

01:01:09.206 --> 01:01:12.331
but at least He doesn't do it so fast

01:01:12.707 --> 01:01:16.540
because they have called Me Mother and I respect it.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:20.873
Of course, they have been very troublesome, horrible, I know.

01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:24.665
I know why you are angry with them,

01:01:26.498 --> 01:01:31.206
but forgiveness is the best punishment

01:01:32.623 --> 01:01:37.415
by which they realize their mistakes

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:41.748
and out of hundred, ninety-nine people

01:01:41.914 --> 01:01:45.998
will enjoy forgiveness than punishment.

01:01:49.832 --> 01:01:53.956
So all this is done by Shri Ganesha

01:01:54.956 --> 01:01:58.123
and He is all the time with you.

01:01:58.373 --> 01:02:01.748
Your Ganesha is awakened, no doubt.

01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:04.373
He is all the time with you.

01:02:04.623 --> 01:02:07.832
But some people have vibrations,

01:02:08.039 --> 01:02:11.650
they get realization, then they are busy,

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:14.553
say, if they are women, busy with their children,

01:02:14.714 --> 01:02:18.172
they have no time for Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:18.956 --> 01:02:22.026
At the most, cleansing they'll do. But for what?

01:02:22.187 --> 01:02:24.437
Why are you cleansing?  Supposing this glass

01:02:24.598 --> 01:02:26.379
is cleansed, cleansed, cleansed,

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:29.665
and never used, what is the use of cleansing?

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.873
They meditate for themselves,

01:02:33.081 --> 01:02:35.665
they cleanse for themselves,

01:02:35.832 --> 01:02:38.248
but never use their vibrations,

01:02:38.456 --> 01:02:42.832
never give vibrations.  How can that be?

01:02:44.248 --> 01:02:47.415
You have to give vibrations.

01:02:47.623 --> 01:02:49.623
If you don't give vibrations to others,

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.832
if you don't transform other people,

01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:53.748
if you don't cure other people,

01:02:53.914 --> 01:02:57.998
if you don't teach them how to have pure love,

01:02:58.206 --> 01:03:01.456
what's the use of cleansing, coming to Puja,

01:03:01.665 --> 01:03:04.540
feeling nice, joyous?  Finished.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:10.707
These are useless people, useless Sahaja Yogis.

01:03:11.707 --> 01:03:14.623
Ganesha is not happy.

01:03:14.832 --> 01:03:16.206
How can He be happy?

01:03:16.415 --> 01:03:20.665
His Puja is to give realization.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:23.748
That is His Puja.

01:03:23.914 --> 01:03:26.790
Supposing He is waiting there, say,

01:03:26.998 --> 01:03:30.248
for you to ask for His blessings.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.790
Now what is His blessing?  Is to give realization,

01:03:35.039 --> 01:03:37.290
to allow the Kundalini to rise.

01:03:37.498 --> 01:03:42.164
You ask for it and what do you get?

01:03:42.914 --> 01:03:47.290
You ask for your health, ask for this, ask for that.

01:03:47.665 --> 01:03:49.832
Why not ask,

01:03:50.039 --> 01:03:53.873
"Shri Ganesh, make us good instruments of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:54.081 --> 01:03:57.665
Give us strength to give realization to people

01:03:57.832 --> 01:04:00.540
and talk about Sahaja Yoga."

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:03.290
People don't even talk about Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:03.498 --> 01:04:07.290
They are feeling shy.  Why should you be shy?

01:04:07.698 --> 01:04:09.782
One day I was traveling by train,

01:04:09.948 --> 01:04:12.154
I met a lady, she sat next to Me

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:15.144
and she was following some sort of a cult, I don’t know,

01:04:15.305 --> 01:04:17.114
some Muslim cult,

01:04:17.275 --> 01:04:19.615
and the whole time she was boring Me.

01:04:19.782 --> 01:04:21.989
I started feeling sleepy

01:04:22.198 --> 01:04:24.615
but whenever I got up she was still talking

01:04:24.782 --> 01:04:26.073
about that cult.

01:04:26.281 --> 01:04:28.823
I said, "Sahaja Yogis will never do that."

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.615
You must talk about it.  You must tell people.

01:04:31.782 --> 01:04:33.365
You must go around.

01:04:33.573 --> 01:04:37.073
Don't be afraid, Ganesha will protect you.

01:04:37.281 --> 01:04:39.782
He'll help you, He'll be very happy.

01:04:40.365 --> 01:04:42.948
He'll work it out, everything for you.

01:04:43.156 --> 01:04:45.240
All problems can be solved.

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:46.948
Everything can be done.

01:04:47.156 --> 01:04:51.989
Believe in His power.

01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:54.490
Have faith in your Mother.

01:04:54.698 --> 01:04:57.532
That is the message of Shri Ganesha.

01:04:57.774 --> 01:05:00.339
May God bless you.

01:05:06.281 --> 01:05:10.073
Today of course I would like chidren to come up for the Puja,

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:16.490
say, they should be all below six years, would be better idea.

01:05:19.323 --> 01:05:22.073
Say, from two years to six years, we could have small ones.

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:26.198
Or maybe eight years, but then they grow up I think, after that.
