00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:48.971
Today we are going to perform the Puja of Shri Raja Rajeshwari.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:57.931
Especially in the south of India,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.050
the Devi is recognized in many forms.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.091
The reason is that here

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:17.731
there were many Devi bhaktas (devotees of the Goddess), like Adi Shankaracharya,

00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:25.050
and they established the religion of Shakta Dharma.

00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:30.411
Shakta Dharma means the religion of Shakti (God's power).

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.811
Two kinds of religions started simultaneously.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:46.211
Ramanujacharya established the Vaishnav religion,

00:03:49.011 --> 00:03:51.771
and

00:03:54.051 --> 00:04:01.651
while following two kinds of religions, people got separated.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:08.211
The one who is truly Vaishnav (following the Vaishnav religion),

00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:13.771
his work is of Mahalakshmi.

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:18.491
And Mahalakshmi ji

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.131
who has many forms,

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:32.851
assimilates all those forms within Herself;

00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:36.050
like Dharma,

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.691
establishing the Dharma

00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:45.411
and being in the middle path,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.331
going neither to the left nor to the right,

00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:53.050
but being in the center.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.051
Such people are called Vaishnavas.

00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.131
As time passed,

00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:05.371
Vaishnava Dharma spread in Gujarat and other (states of India).

00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:14.820
When one goes through the Vaishnav path,

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:19.181
through Kundalini,

00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.820
then at the end you reach Sahastrara,

00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:27.581
but at Sahastrara,

00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:32.741
at the Brahmarandra, is the seat of Sadashiva.

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:39.301
So by following Vaishnava Dharma, at the end,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.501
one reaches Sadashiva,

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:49.261
who is also the goal of Shakta Dharma.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:57.101
But one must understand that the power of Kundalini,

00:05:57.781 --> 00:06:01.621
Kundalini Shakti,

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.301
passes through the central path.

00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:08.461
So how can you separate the two (Shakta and Vaishnava Dharma)?

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:12.221
The path of Shakti is the central path.

00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:18.820
Both the things which were interwoven together were separated,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.261
the reason being

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:26.581
that in those days the ascent of Kundalini didn't take place.

00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:32.061
In Maharashtra, in Kolhapur there is a temple of Mahalakshmi,

00:06:32.301 --> 00:06:34.820
where She is awakened.

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.781
There people sing, "Uday uday Ambe."

00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:43.661
Amba is the Shakti.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.341
Kundalini is called Amba.

00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:51.221
So in that temple of Mahalakshmi

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:55.221
they sing about awakening the Shakti.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.981
They don't know why they sing this (bhajan).

00:07:03.061 --> 00:07:05.701
So the Vaishnavas make their path (of evolution),

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.861
make the route, the path,

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:13.261
and when that path is ready,

00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:16.941
then the Kundalini rises through it.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.261
We also do the same in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:27.820
When you all put your hands towards Me,

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:32.301
then slowly all your seven chakras get all right,

00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.381
which means that you become a Vaishnav.

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.541
From extremes you come to the central path,

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.820
and your chakras settle down properly.

00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.820
When your chakras are corrected,

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:53.821
only then Kundalini is awakened.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.301
So that’s why initially you become Vaishnav

00:07:57.541 --> 00:08:00.820
and then you become Shakta.

00:08:02.661 --> 00:08:06.701
So, both of them are one (Vaishnav and Shakta religion).

00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:12.820
But in the south (of India)

00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:19.021
many aspects of the Devi are recognized,

00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:25.820
and out of these (aspects), Raj Rajeshwari is worshipped a lot.

00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:34.820
The Lakshmi

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:40.461
is on the Vaishnav path, on the path of Vishnu, wife of Vishnu,

00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:44.981
and that’s why

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:52.581
this aspect of Lakshmi was explained,

00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:57.061
which is an aspect of Shakti itself.

00:08:59.301 --> 00:09:01.501
Raja Rajeshwari means

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.061
that Kundalini comes to Nabhi.

00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:08.781
When Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.341
it acquires the form of Lakshmi,

00:09:12.581 --> 00:09:18.381
or gets the reflection of Lakshmi on it.

00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:24.820
When this Kundalini reaches the Nabhi chakra,

00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:29.820
then She takes the form of Lakshmi,

00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:34.820
It takes the form of many kinds of Lakshmi:

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:39.421
Gruha Lakshmi, Raja Lakshmi.

00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.820
There are many Lakshmis,

00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:48.820
but Lakshmi takes these forms

00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:52.820
when it gets the Shakti of Kundalini.

00:09:53.581 --> 00:09:58.421
They are enlightened only through the union with Kundalini Shakti.

00:09:58.661 --> 00:10:02.820
So though Raj Rajeshwari is the power of Kundalini only,

00:10:03.341 --> 00:10:07.021
it takes this form when Kundalini reaches Nabhi chakra.

00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:11.820
Then Kundalini itself is recognized as Raj Rajeshwari.

00:10:13.421 --> 00:10:18.622
Or we can say that the aspect of Adi Shakti at Nabhi chakra

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:22.421
is called Raja Rajeshwari.

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:28.182
Now the person who has at Nabhi chakra

00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:33.582
the principle of Raja Rajeshwari established,

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:42.421
means that he has Gruha Lakshmi established on the left side

00:10:42.862 --> 00:10:46.421
and Raj Rajeshwari on the right side.

00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:52.182
The highest state of Raja Lakshmi
is considered to be Raja Rajeshwari.

00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:56.662
Now at the last stage of Raj Rajeshwari,

00:10:56.942 --> 00:10:59.742
how should a Sahaj Yogi be?

00:11:02.502 --> 00:11:06.782
The blessings of Lakshmi have to be there, at this stage.

00:11:08.262 --> 00:11:14.022
After Kundalini awakening, a person

00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:18.421
receives the blessings of Lakshmi.

00:11:21.182 --> 00:11:22.902
They have to come definitely.

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:28.822
All the Sahaj Yogis receive the blessings of Lakshmi,

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:33.421
and sometimes this Lakshmi

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:38.222
can increase a lot, unexpectedly.

00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:41.582
And even if it does not increase,

00:11:41.822 --> 00:11:49.421
such a man gets the attiutude of a king.

00:11:52.382 --> 00:11:58.302
Until your attitude becomes like that (attitude of a king),

00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:03.222
you must understand that the Kundalini is still lost at Nabhi.

00:12:05.302 --> 00:12:06.502
The temperament changes!

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:10.462
The biggest miracle which happens after coming to Sahaj Yoga

00:12:10.702 --> 00:12:14.662
is that a person's temperament changes,

00:12:14.862 --> 00:12:17.662
his nature changes.

00:12:19.542 --> 00:12:22.862
A man who is full of a-Lakshmi,

00:12:23.102 --> 00:12:26.982
within whom Lakshmi is not visible,

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:30.102
- means there are many rich people also,

00:12:30.342 --> 00:12:32.502
who are miserly.

00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.742
So they cannot be called as Lakshmi-pati.

00:12:36.982 --> 00:12:39.822
There is no form of Lakshmi visible in them.

00:12:40.062 --> 00:12:43.382
They live like beggars, all the time crying for money.

00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.421
It's very difficult for them to give some money to others.

00:12:48.262 --> 00:12:50.421
In such miserly people,

00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:56.502
Kundalini has not yet awakened.

00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.421
They die of miserliness.

00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:06.382
They are so miserly, and think so much about money

00:13:06.422 --> 00:13:10.062
that their liver can also get destroyed.

00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:14.782
Their face will be just like a beggar.

00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:22.382
So just to achieve the Lakshmi (material wellbeing)

00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:25.662
is not the work of Kundalini.

00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:33.421
To establish the essence of Lakshmi within is the work of Kundalini.

00:13:36.942 --> 00:13:40.382
So  Raja Rajeshwari

00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:44.942
is that power of Kundalini which establishes within you.

00:13:45.182 --> 00:13:49.022
The essence of Lakshmi-pati is Raja Rajeshwari.

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:55.022
It doesn’t mean that you should get lots of money,

00:13:55.262 --> 00:14:01.421
but should become generous, as if you are a king.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:07.222
Raja Rajeshwari means that you develop the temperament of a king.

00:14:08.582 --> 00:14:11.822
Here even the kings are like beggars,

00:14:12.182 --> 00:14:14.262
and they are miserly,

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:18.102
they are liars, they take bribes, and do all such things.

00:14:19.102 --> 00:14:22.622
But here we are talking about the pure form.

00:14:23.582 --> 00:14:27.382
The one who worships Raj Rajeshwari,

00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:30.262
and the one who has achieves it,

00:14:31.222 --> 00:14:33.302
has so many qualities

00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:37.421
that they maybe cannot be described in today's lecture.

00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:42.382
But the biggest thing which happens

00:14:42.421 --> 00:14:47.421
is that one develops generosity,

00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.062
he becomes generous,

00:14:54.182 --> 00:15:01.662
knowing that he is nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:07.421
"I will never have any shortage of money or anything else.

00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:09.662
So why not just enjoy!

00:15:09.902 --> 00:15:15.662
Why not make myself happy by giving to others?"

00:15:19.862 --> 00:15:24.302
In olden times, when kings were pleased,

00:15:24.862 --> 00:15:30.421
then they would give the most precious things to those near them.

00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:36.942
The man who does not have generosity,

00:15:37.182 --> 00:15:40.622
his (life's) meaning is incomplete.

00:15:43.142 --> 00:15:46.342
The most important thing is that

00:15:46.421 --> 00:15:51.822
no king begs in front of anyone, ever!

00:15:52.342 --> 00:15:55.262
He might get poor,

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:59.822
and maybe even his entire property is lost,

00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:03.222
but he will not go and beg in front of anyone.

00:16:03.822 --> 00:16:07.342
He might die, but he will not beg.

00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:12.062
So Sahaja Yogis develop a temperament of a king.

00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:17.862
Even their lifestyle is king's like.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:21.421
He does not go about wearing torn clothes,

00:16:21.702 --> 00:16:24.421
like these people from Hare Rama.

00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:28.421
They take the name of Shri Ram and Shri Krishna,

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:31.421
and Krishna is Himself Kubera,

00:16:31.702 --> 00:16:36.421
but as people of His kingdom, they roam about like beggars.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:42.302
By no means they know the essence of Krishna.

00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:45.462
But Sahaja Yogis should know

00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:50.382
that according to your temperament,

00:16:50.422 --> 00:16:53.502
Paramchaitanya will create your situation.

00:16:53.942 --> 00:16:57.421
A man who is always crying for money

00:16:57.622 --> 00:17:00.421
will be in such a situation only -

00:17:01.982 --> 00:17:07.421
a man who is always calculating the money

00:17:08.302 --> 00:17:12.382
and who is always busy to make more money.

00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:16.936
There are even people who want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:20.022
These people are completely gone cases!

00:17:21.245 --> 00:17:24.275
No one is worse than them.

00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:31.434
Once

00:17:33.902 --> 00:17:36.942
King Akbar asked Birbal (his minister),

00:17:37.102 --> 00:17:40.562
"Who are the most downtrodden people?"

00:17:40.763 --> 00:17:46.421
So he said, "Those who beg from people in the temple of God".

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:51.281
When God is sitting here, why are you begging from people?

00:17:52.763 --> 00:17:55.541
Similarly, there are such people also in Sahaja Yoga -

00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:57.421
very few, but there are some -

00:17:57.622 --> 00:18:02.767
who think that they have to make money somehow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:04.985 --> 00:18:07.541
Someone told me that in Ganapatipule

00:18:07.742 --> 00:18:11.755
Sahaja Yogis brought some things and were selling them.

00:18:13.022 --> 00:18:17.301
There was one person who took My permission and sold things,

00:18:17.502 --> 00:18:21.276
and whatever profit he had, he gave it to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:24.237
But even this shouldn't be done.

00:18:24.438 --> 00:18:29.301
But they say that it's convenient
for people to get sarees and so on.

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:34.371
But such a person who only wants to earn money in Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:38.522
is not worthy of being called Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:51.732
You cannot understand the power of Raja Rajeshwari through him.

00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:57.999
With Raja Rajeshwari power, whether a man has money or not,

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:08.059
there is no fear in him.

00:19:10.646 --> 00:19:17.111
There is no feeling of any shortage,

00:19:17.312 --> 00:19:19.861
that, "I have a scarcity of this".

00:19:20.062 --> 00:19:24.621
He feels, "I am totally complete. What else should I do?

00:19:24.903 --> 00:19:27.727
What else do I need?

00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:31.220
Why should I be scared?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:36.582
Wherever I am, I will have prosperity.

00:19:36.822 --> 00:19:39.967
I can achieve everything there."

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:43.471
And such a man

00:19:46.046 --> 00:19:52.284
lives his life in a very majestical way.

00:19:55.422 --> 00:19:58.508
His temperament is like

00:20:02.421 --> 00:20:09.316
a very magnificent and great human being.

00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:16.960
He enjoys only giving, not accepting.

00:20:18.542 --> 00:20:22.174
If someone is rich, then he is rich only for himself,

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:27.032
and if someone is poor, then also he is poor only for himself.

00:20:27.782 --> 00:20:31.665
But for a Sahaja Yogi, whether a person is rich or poor,

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:35.084
for him it's (not important),

00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:41.798
he will be completely ready to help that person.

00:20:43.502 --> 00:20:45.851
There are also such people in Sahaja Yoga

00:20:46.052 --> 00:20:49.433
who do a lot for asahaj people,

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.086
but if some poor Sahaja Yogi come,

00:20:53.287 --> 00:20:56.656
they don't even offer him a chair to sit on.

00:20:57.902 --> 00:21:01.763
So by looking at the exterior grandeur (of people)

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:06.371
many people give them a lot of importance.

00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:09.701
“He is very great", "he has so many cars",

00:21:09.902 --> 00:21:14.421
or "he is a very famous actor",

00:21:14.582 --> 00:21:18.662
or "a famous doctor", "architect", "a very great man”.

00:21:20.502 --> 00:21:25.315
These titles are very outward things, and they are given importance.

00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:30.114
But if someone thinks that,

00:21:30.315 --> 00:21:35.421
“The power is flowing through this man,

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:42.055
such powerful vibrations are flowing through him.

00:21:43.382 --> 00:21:46.965
Who is this great saint?"

00:21:48.311 --> 00:21:52.324
Such a person possess a temperament like a king, we can say.

00:21:52.525 --> 00:21:56.101
There are many such people in our country.

00:21:56.302 --> 00:22:00.329
We have the special example of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:22:01.964 --> 00:22:04.563
He was a great saint,

00:22:05.548 --> 00:22:08.742
a realized soul and a very ideal person,

00:22:08.902 --> 00:22:11.704
but his behavior towards saints

00:22:11.905 --> 00:22:18.244
was extremely beautiful and polite.

00:22:19.591 --> 00:22:25.061
Once his guru, Shri Ramdas arrived

00:22:25.262 --> 00:22:28.227
and he called on Shivaji.

00:22:29.285 --> 00:22:33.825
Shivaji Maharaj wrote a letter and put it in his bag.

00:22:34.747 --> 00:22:38.261
In that letter it was written, "Guru, O my Guru,

00:22:38.462 --> 00:22:45.102
All of my power, my kingdom

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:48.829
everything, I am giving to you."

00:22:50.765 --> 00:22:53.088
After reading that letter,

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:57.382
Guru Ramdas laughed and said,

00:22:57.583 --> 00:23:00.830
"Son, I am an ascetic.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:05.291
What will I do with your kingdom?

00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:11.218
You are the king, and this is your duty (to rule the kingdom).

00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:16.215
But yes, if you think,

00:23:18.294 --> 00:23:26.144
that you should rule this kingdom with bhakti,

00:23:28.622 --> 00:23:31.220
then you can make its flag,

00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:39.399
triangular and the same color as my robe.

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:47.006
With that flag, people will understand

00:23:47.207 --> 00:23:50.993
that you are ruling with a saintly attitude.

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:56.618
You don’t have any attraction or attachment for it.

00:23:58.142 --> 00:24:01.289
You are the king,

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:07.624
but still you do not have the consciousness of this fact."

00:24:08.974 --> 00:24:13.844
Those people who are boasting that they are the king

00:24:14.045 --> 00:24:16.182
and go about madly saying this,

00:24:16.421 --> 00:24:20.421
that "I am this", actually they are not that.

00:24:20.784 --> 00:24:24.161
And those who are, they never say so.

00:24:26.285 --> 00:24:29.644
You will see many such people.

00:24:30.662 --> 00:24:34.378
Once I was traveling in London.

00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:39.701
There was a gentlemen sitting far who started talking to Me.

00:24:39.902 --> 00:24:46.432
(Men) usually don’t talk to women, they talk amongst themselves.

00:24:47.365 --> 00:24:51.181
But he asked a lot about India.

00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:54.520
"How is this? How is that?"

00:24:55.896 --> 00:24:58.062
So I asked, "Did you go to India?"

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:01.492
He said, "Yes, I was in India for many years."

00:25:03.182 --> 00:25:08.372
And he did not say anything about himself, who he was.

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:12.993
Then he disembarked and left and I also left.

00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:18.541
Later, one day,

00:25:18.742 --> 00:25:23.546
I was traveling with My husband and we met him again in the train.

00:25:25.199 --> 00:25:27.741
So he invited us to his house

00:25:27.942 --> 00:25:31.382
to discuss about India.

00:25:32.513 --> 00:25:37.982
So when we reached, we found that he had a very big house.

00:25:38.183 --> 00:25:41.446
We found out he was the Viceroy in India!

00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:45.542
But he never said it himself!

00:25:45.743 --> 00:25:48.220
We didn’t even know that he was the Viceroy.

00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:52.107
In earlier times, people could not even meet the Viceroy.

00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:54.696
And he talked to us with so much humility,

00:25:54.897 --> 00:25:57.481
"If you have any problem, let me know".

00:25:57.682 --> 00:25:59.619
Being a lady, I was thinking,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.051
"Why is he giving Me so much importance?"

00:26:02.252 --> 00:26:03.838
"Are You having any problem?

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:06.936
People here are a bit stubborn", all these kind of talks!

00:26:07.792 --> 00:26:10.220
"They are not like Indians. They are not dharmic."

00:26:10.421 --> 00:26:14.457
All these kind of talks. But he never said that he was a Viceroy!

00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:18.376
And he had so much respect for Indians.

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:20.935
He was talking about them with so much love.

00:26:21.136 --> 00:26:24.159
In our country,

00:26:25.401 --> 00:26:29.845
if someone is a minister's assistant, even that makes him crazy.

00:26:31.268 --> 00:26:34.555
There is a story that when some people went to meet the minister,

00:26:34.756 --> 00:26:36.735
there was a man who was shouting a lot.

00:26:36.936 --> 00:26:39.298
So they asked, "Why are you so angry?"

00:26:39.499 --> 00:26:43.304
He said, "Don’t you know? I am the P.A. (drunk in Hindi)".

00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:49.815
If people get even a little bit,

00:26:50.016 --> 00:26:52.373
their minds get damaged,

00:26:52.574 --> 00:26:55.894
and this is not a symptom of a king.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.154
The first quality of a king is that he is extremely polite.

00:27:02.503 --> 00:27:06.576
Arrogance comes in a man because he thinks,

00:27:06.777 --> 00:27:11.154
"I am so wealthy. I can scold everyone, shout at everyone".

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:19.756
Or if he is highly educated, has a high position,

00:27:19.957 --> 00:27:23.788
or is the son of an important father, he gets more arrogant.

00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:26.883
You can't even talk to him!

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.290
I have noticed

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.758
that even common men -

00:27:36.959 --> 00:27:43.095
like in My husband's office, they would answer rudely on the phone.

00:27:44.546 --> 00:27:47.095
So once he asked, "Who is speaking?" and he found it was Me.

00:27:47.296 --> 00:27:49.975
He was very scared!

00:27:50.176 --> 00:27:53.416
"In the beginning why did you talk so rudely?"

00:27:53.696 --> 00:27:56.095
He said, "Don’t tell Sir about it. Please forgive me!"

00:27:56.296 --> 00:27:58.415
I said, "Why would I tell him?

00:27:58.616 --> 00:28:00.855
But why did you talk like this in the beginning?"

00:28:01.056 --> 00:28:04.027
Water always spills out from a vessel which is half full.

00:28:04.228 --> 00:28:11.359
The person who is complete is extremely polite and simple.

00:28:13.361 --> 00:28:14.936
You will understand that.

00:28:15.137 --> 00:28:19.016
Until you are complete, you will have a false ego,

00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:23.688
false anger,

00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:27.855
and you acquire a strange type of personality,

00:28:28.056 --> 00:28:31.469
so that anyone who hears your name runs away!

00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:36.189
One type are like beggars.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.855
When they come, you know they have come to ask for something.

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:44.972
"This has happened to me, my father, my mother.

00:28:45.176 --> 00:28:48.712
I don’t have money. I want this". Always like a beggar!

00:28:48.974 --> 00:28:53.566
And another type are always shouting.

00:28:54.976 --> 00:28:59.254
So first we have to become Vaishnav, to come to the center.

00:29:00.578 --> 00:29:04.854
You can gain the power of Raja Rajeshwari only coming to the center.

00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:08.095
Otherwise it will not work within you!

00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:12.416
Like there is no point in watering a plastic plant.

00:29:13.623 --> 00:29:16.931
Similarly, in these people

00:29:18.056 --> 00:29:25.480
there is a kind of false show.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.538
Recently I was coming from London. There was a lady with Me.

00:29:35.182 --> 00:29:41.182
She was wearing many diamonds, in her ears, nose, hands, everywhere.

00:29:43.752 --> 00:29:46.108
So she said,

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:48.655
"I believe in simple living and high thinking.

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:52.892
Live with simplicity and have high thoughts."

00:29:53.093 --> 00:29:56.335
So I said, "Good, very good. Have a seat, please".

00:29:56.536 --> 00:30:00.115
She said, "I don’t wear this kind of colored clothes.

00:30:00.316 --> 00:30:03.708
So, I am very simple." I said, "Very good!"

00:30:04.496 --> 00:30:06.988
Before arriving to India,

00:30:07.189 --> 00:30:10.658
she came to Me, "I have a problem. Please help me out.

00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:13.295
The customs officers respect you a lot,

00:30:13.496 --> 00:30:17.975
and I am wearing 650,0000 Rupees worth of jewelries,

00:30:18.176 --> 00:30:20.816
so please take me through customs."

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:24.545
So I said, "You believe in simple living.

00:30:24.746 --> 00:30:27.856
So why don't you tell customs that you believe in simple living?

00:30:28.056 --> 00:30:31.268
They will release you, just like that!"

00:30:31.469 --> 00:30:34.455
She came behind Me, and the customs people

00:30:34.656 --> 00:30:38.592
did namaskar to Me and also to her, and she passed through.

00:30:41.936 --> 00:30:45.191
Another thing in a man is greed.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.820
Greed is a very dirty and bad thing.

00:30:52.456 --> 00:30:58.049
Very low people have greed for others' things.

00:30:59.407 --> 00:31:02.535
As soon as they come from someone's house they start,

00:31:02.736 --> 00:31:05.455
"Let's also get the thing which was in their house".

00:31:05.656 --> 00:31:09.997
Bring this thing, then another thing. There is no end to that!

00:31:10.198 --> 00:31:13.178
And greed continues.

00:31:14.935 --> 00:31:18.601
What is the antidote to this greed?

00:31:22.095 --> 00:31:28.727
The antidote is to know what a headache is to own something.

00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:37.695
For example, here is a nice carpet,

00:31:37.896 --> 00:31:40.504
and I start having greed for it,

00:31:40.705 --> 00:31:43.856
"I want to get this carpet".

00:31:44.095 --> 00:31:46.650
I can even steal it,

00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:49.978
and if I don't steel it, then all the time the thoughts will be,

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:54.086
"Where did this carpet come from? When?" and so on.

00:31:54.287 --> 00:31:57.557
So Puja is on one side,

00:31:59.576 --> 00:32:03.150
and if that carpet is brought and it's laid down here, you'll think,

00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:07.801
"Oh, this carpet will be spoilt. This will happen to it" and so on.

00:32:09.616 --> 00:32:13.898
It's better if you understand that this is not your carpet.

00:32:14.099 --> 00:32:16.894
"It belongs to someone else. God save me!"

00:32:17.095 --> 00:32:19.335
That’s all. No more trouble!

00:32:19.536 --> 00:32:22.503
"If it belongs to someone else, then why should I have the headache,

00:32:22.704 --> 00:32:26.778
get it insured, do this, go to the bank.

00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:30.144
Why should I do it? It doesn’t belong to Me.

00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:32.687
Leave it. Do you want to take it? Take it!

00:32:32.888 --> 00:32:36.583
Do you want more? There is more. Very good!"

00:32:40.335 --> 00:32:45.735
This way, the madness of greed

00:32:46.737 --> 00:32:50.058
is completely destroyed.

00:32:51.425 --> 00:32:55.692
And it's a very big problem for Sahaja Yogis

00:32:55.893 --> 00:32:59.535
because on one side they are Sahaja Yogis, and on the other side

00:32:59.736 --> 00:33:03.136
their foot is in the mouth of a crocodile called greed.

00:33:03.534 --> 00:33:08.321
So how will they come into the boat? Their foot is stuck there.

00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:12.615
If we have greed for anything

00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:17.850
then we must realize that Raja Rajeshwari has left us.

00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:22.894
And those who have a temperament of Raj Rajeshwari

00:33:23.095 --> 00:33:27.095
start enjoying even small things!

00:33:29.976 --> 00:33:34.523
They never have a shortage of anything.

00:33:38.874 --> 00:33:44.456
Once I went to Palitana. It's a two and a half hour climb journey.

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:50.296
There, outside, was a temple made of sangamarmar,

00:33:50.497 --> 00:33:53.896
what we call as marble.

00:33:54.893 --> 00:33:58.324
So all those people who were with Me, laid down.

00:33:58.525 --> 00:34:00.684
When I saw what was above, I said, "Look up.

00:34:00.885 --> 00:34:02.305
So many elephants carved

00:34:02.506 --> 00:34:05.713
and they all have their tails made in a different way."

00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:09.481
They said, "Mummy, we are so tired.

00:34:09.712 --> 00:34:12.727
How can You see tails of elephants?"

00:34:12.928 --> 00:34:15.059
I said, "See there. You are not looking at them".

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.856
They said, "Aren't You tired?"

00:34:17.057 --> 00:34:21.458
I said, "No, after seeing this art, all My tiredness ran away!"

00:34:24.486 --> 00:34:28.355
So we start to enjoy small, small things

00:34:30.213 --> 00:34:35.174
start to enjoy them and feel the satisfaction.

00:34:35.427 --> 00:34:40.629
Like, Shri Ram was so satisfied after eating the berries of Shabri.

00:34:43.656 --> 00:34:48.980
When you start to understand this thing, then you can say

00:34:49.181 --> 00:34:54.604
that you are nourished by the power of Raj Rajeshwari.

00:34:57.343 --> 00:35:00.768
If someone gives a small thing with love,

00:35:01.681 --> 00:35:06.136
even a small thing like a betel nut given with love,

00:35:07.496 --> 00:35:13.815
even if I don’t eat betel nut usually, that one I will surely eat,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.894
to make that other person happy.

00:35:16.095 --> 00:35:19.310
He doesn’t know that I don’t eat betel nut.

00:35:20.935 --> 00:35:27.048
It means that for any object in this world,

00:35:27.249 --> 00:35:32.974
if you put on, for example on the glass,

00:35:35.527 --> 00:35:38.273
if you put mercury,

00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:45.694
any ordinary glass which is transparent, if you put mercury,

00:35:45.895 --> 00:35:50.480
then it becomes a mirror in which you can see your reflection.

00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:53.993
On any object, if you add love

00:35:55.366 --> 00:35:58.913
that object becomes so beautiful.

00:36:00.022 --> 00:36:03.641
Then you want to give it to someone.

00:36:04.266 --> 00:36:07.015
Like when you go to the market, you will feel that,

00:36:07.255 --> 00:36:10.414
"Yes, this is good for him, this is good for her".

00:36:10.615 --> 00:36:14.646
What is good for yourself, this thought shouldn’t even come.

00:36:17.615 --> 00:36:25.455
If this thought comes, "What do I want? What do I like?", finished!

00:36:26.806 --> 00:36:32.773
It means that the All-pervading Power has not yet come within you.

00:36:33.363 --> 00:36:37.363
If the All-pervading Power comes within you,

00:36:38.255 --> 00:36:41.773
then you will become very wise

00:36:41.974 --> 00:36:46.974
and will know what is the need of everybody.

00:36:47.744 --> 00:36:53.847
Like if you go somewhere and you see

00:36:54.048 --> 00:36:59.712
that there is a very beautiful lamp,

00:37:00.883 --> 00:37:03.414
you think, "Yes, I stayed in their house

00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:08.108
and they didn’t have this lamp. So I should get it for them."

00:37:09.806 --> 00:37:12.694
You start to understand everyone’s needs,

00:37:12.895 --> 00:37:15.783
when your own needs disappear.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.814
You remember everyone's problems.

00:37:22.197 --> 00:37:24.569
Someone is sick,

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.773
someone needs something,

00:37:27.974 --> 00:37:32.853
someone doesn’t have a tape recorder

00:37:33.054 --> 00:37:35.434
and he wants to hear My speech,

00:37:35.635 --> 00:37:37.735
all this you know.

00:37:37.936 --> 00:37:39.984
And when you give him that thing,

00:37:40.185 --> 00:37:42.773
he says, "Mother, how did you find out that I need it?"

00:37:42.974 --> 00:37:45.577
What do you mean? I don’t know how.

00:37:46.757 --> 00:37:50.149
That's why love is called knowledge.

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:53.589
Knowledge is only pure love,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.521
because when you have pure love for anybody,

00:37:57.722 --> 00:38:01.676
then you have all the knowledge about him, and it happens.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:06.166
Even if She is Mahamaya, you can know,

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:09.305
but you must have pure love.

00:38:10.077 --> 00:38:14.428
The pure love gives you all the knowledge -

00:38:14.974 --> 00:38:18.783
any kind of knowledge, any type.

00:38:19.855 --> 00:38:26.773
For example, if you look with pure love to something -

00:38:26.974 --> 00:38:31.974
like in Madras I have seen a lot of poverty and suffering.

00:38:33.575 --> 00:38:35.773
So the thought arose in my mind

00:38:35.974 --> 00:38:41.235
that in this heat there are small small children, old people,

00:38:41.436 --> 00:38:45.139
everyone standing and waiting for the bus for a long time

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.054
and I am sitting in a nice car moving around.

00:38:49.764 --> 00:38:51.926
So I started worrying.

00:38:52.085 --> 00:38:53.814
"What should I do about it?"

00:38:54.015 --> 00:38:57.043
I said, "Why don’t they arrange a private transport?

00:38:57.244 --> 00:39:00.267
At least some of their misery will be lessened."

00:39:00.468 --> 00:39:02.967
And this is what is staying in My mind,

00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:07.197
that somehow this transport should be organized.

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:10.815
So when you get Realization,

00:39:11.016 --> 00:39:14.498
then you are bound by the brotherhood of the entire world.

00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:18.773
It's such a great work of Shri Raja Rajeshwari,

00:39:18.974 --> 00:39:21.143
that you can think about everybody!

00:39:21.344 --> 00:39:23.651
Like the queen of a king

00:39:23.852 --> 00:39:28.538
will look at the problems of her people

00:39:28.739 --> 00:39:31.015
and will remove their problems.

00:39:31.216 --> 00:39:34.532
She will not sit down counting how many jewelries she has,

00:39:34.733 --> 00:39:37.773
how many diamonds she has.

00:39:38.185 --> 00:39:40.694
She will see,

00:39:40.895 --> 00:39:45.374
"How many people in my kingdom are suffering?

00:39:45.575 --> 00:39:48.153
What small things even do they need?"

00:39:48.354 --> 00:39:51.773
Similarly, your temperament also becomes like this.

00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:57.619
Until you raise to a higher state,

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:03.463
how can you be a worshipper of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma?

00:40:04.295 --> 00:40:08.654
And Vishwa Nirmal Dharma is not something outward,

00:40:08.855 --> 00:40:12.892
like, "I am Hindu, or Muslim or Christian." It's not like this.

00:40:13.093 --> 00:40:16.054
This is an internal light,

00:40:16.255 --> 00:40:18.229
and in this light a human being

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:23.169
comes out with a very majestic personality.

00:40:24.702 --> 00:40:27.488
He doesn’t think,

00:40:27.689 --> 00:40:32.310
"What am I getting? What have I achieved?"

00:40:32.511 --> 00:40:40.414
He only thinks, "What can I do for others?

00:40:40.615 --> 00:40:42.495
I have done very less.

00:40:42.696 --> 00:40:45.671
Oh Mother! I could give Realization to only 100 people.

00:40:45.872 --> 00:40:47.654
I couldn’t do anything more!"

00:40:47.855 --> 00:40:52.560
When one starts thinking like this, then he must understand

00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:59.423
that the power of Raja Rajeshwari is overflowing within him.

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.602
It's shining. It's troubling him that,

00:41:02.803 --> 00:41:04.765
"What are you doing? You have so much power.

00:41:04.974 --> 00:41:07.628
Why are you not giving it to others?"

00:41:08.735 --> 00:41:13.374
This cannot be measured by money or anything else.

00:41:13.575 --> 00:41:16.342
Like today I was late.

00:41:16.543 --> 00:41:20.098
There was a phone call from Russia so I was delayed.

00:41:20.974 --> 00:41:25.454
So on the way I asked, "Where is everyone sitting?"

00:41:25.921 --> 00:41:27.591
They said, "In the open."

00:41:27.792 --> 00:41:31.690
So I said, "Did you put up some shade for them?" They didn’t know.

00:41:31.891 --> 00:41:35.183
They said, "Mother, may not be a roof, but cool breeze is blowing!"

00:41:35.384 --> 00:41:36.974
I said, "But a roof should be there.

00:41:37.175 --> 00:41:40.974
I won't like to have a roof only above Me and not above others."

00:41:41.175 --> 00:41:43.841
So they said, "It's like this, with roof only above You."

00:41:44.042 --> 00:41:45.465
"This is not correct".

00:41:45.666 --> 00:41:50.254
Finally when I saw they all had a roof above them, I was very happy.

00:41:57.866 --> 00:42:00.998
Similarly, in Chinddwara also it was very hot

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:03.252
and everyone was sitting in the open.

00:42:03.453 --> 00:42:05.934
All the time I was worried about what was happening,

00:42:06.135 --> 00:42:08.974
and everyone was saying, "Mother, we were feeling cold from inside".

00:42:09.175 --> 00:42:12.414
Although they were sitting in so much heat, they were feeling cold!

00:42:12.615 --> 00:42:15.134
This power of Raja Rajeshwari

00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:19.694
is benevolent for everyone, everywhere.

00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:23.734
It is much more than benevolence, it gives everyone rest,

00:42:23.935 --> 00:42:27.987
it gives everyone happiness and joy.

00:42:28.188 --> 00:42:31.773
And the same power you have within yourself.

00:42:31.974 --> 00:42:37.935
If you want, you can take it to a very high level.

00:42:40.535 --> 00:42:44.854
The work which can be accomplished with just one paisa

00:42:45.055 --> 00:42:48.731
cannot be accomplished with 1000 rupees.

00:42:49.511 --> 00:42:52.773
But the power of giving should be great.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.094
I will say again that

00:42:56.295 --> 00:42:59.603
Shri Krishna went to Vidura's house and ate with him,

00:42:59.804 --> 00:43:01.895
and didn’t eat the delicacies of Duryodhana.

00:43:02.096 --> 00:43:04.734
There is a very important message

00:43:04.935 --> 00:43:09.107
and the message is that, if something is filled with love,

00:43:10.015 --> 00:43:16.690
you cannot measure its worth.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.408
So firstly, Vaishnavas need

00:43:22.575 --> 00:43:27.019
to clean their Lakshmi chakra.

00:43:27.824 --> 00:43:32.522
"First of all I don’t have any needs.

00:43:32.723 --> 00:43:37.119
Others have needs, and that's why I have come to Sahaja Yoga."

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.134
You should come with such thoughts.

00:43:40.335 --> 00:43:42.174
You will be surprised that yesterday,

00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:45.354
so many people came after the program, and I was very happy.

00:43:45.555 --> 00:43:49.522
But suddenly, My right heart was caught up.

00:43:49.974 --> 00:43:53.477
I didn’t understand why right heart catches so much here.

00:43:54.375 --> 00:43:57.985
It has never happened before.

00:43:58.493 --> 00:44:02.979
Then this power gave some indication.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:08.455
Then I asked, "What is the position of Gruha Lakshmis here?

00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:14.815
How do people treat Gruha Lakshmis in Hyderabad?"

00:44:15.293 --> 00:44:18.175
So I found out that they treat them very badly.

00:44:18.376 --> 00:44:20.290
There is no respect for them at all,

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.134
and they are scolding them all the time.

00:44:23.675 --> 00:44:26.694
They respect their mother but don’t respect their wife at all.

00:44:26.895 --> 00:44:30.558
And they said, "This is the Muslim influence here".

00:44:31.122 --> 00:44:35.461
You don’t know, even Muslims

00:44:35.662 --> 00:44:38.773
how much they talked about respecting the women in Koran,

00:44:38.974 --> 00:44:41.583
but they don’t do it. It's a stupidity!

00:44:42.735 --> 00:44:47.117
Respect for women is written there (in Koran) but is nowhere else.

00:44:48.773 --> 00:44:50.773
Then I understood.

00:44:50.974 --> 00:44:56.254
Where women are worshipped, there reside the Devtas.

00:44:56.455 --> 00:44:59.974
Where the women of the house

00:45:01.316 --> 00:45:03.773
are not respected,

00:45:03.974 --> 00:45:07.929
there the Devtas never rule.

00:45:09.184 --> 00:45:15.937
Of course, the simple idea is that

00:45:16.138 --> 00:45:23.955
if you respect you wife completely,

00:45:24.156 --> 00:45:27.245
then children will also respect you and respect themselves.

00:45:27.446 --> 00:45:29.620
This is true.

00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:33.865
But if the woman herself is not worthy of being worshipped,

00:45:34.066 --> 00:45:38.606
and she does such things which are not worthy of being worshipped,

00:45:40.296 --> 00:45:43.406
then she must be corrected.

00:45:44.837 --> 00:45:47.891
But if she is a good woman,

00:45:48.092 --> 00:45:51.574
and she takes care of the children of the house

00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:55.332
and takes care of the household with love,

00:45:55.571 --> 00:45:58.732
this kind of a woman

00:45:58.933 --> 00:46:02.205
should be respected, not only in the house but also in the society.

00:46:02.406 --> 00:46:05.534
But think about that My entire right heart got caught up,

00:46:05.735 --> 00:46:08.294
and for half an hour I was suffering.

00:46:08.495 --> 00:46:11.974
All the suffering which you give to your wives,

00:46:12.135 --> 00:46:15.236
all that suffering came inside Me!

00:46:15.974 --> 00:46:17.773
Now, it's possible

00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:24.078
that a woman may not understand Sahaja Yoga very well with her mind,

00:46:24.279 --> 00:46:26.593
but with her heart she understands.

00:46:26.794 --> 00:46:29.668
A woman understands things with her heart,

00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:32.946
and a man understands with his mind.

00:46:33.415 --> 00:46:37.181
But it's a very big thing to understand with one's heart,

00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:40.974
and women are always considered as a form of Shakti.

00:46:41.278 --> 00:46:43.494
In a house where a woman is not respected,

00:46:43.695 --> 00:46:47.030
nothing will work out properly.

00:46:47.231 --> 00:46:50.054
The reason is, if woman only is the power -

00:46:50.255 --> 00:46:52.878
for example, if this does not have power,

00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:54.734
then what is the use of My talking?

00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:56.614
This big thing is kept here,

00:46:56.815 --> 00:46:59.815
but it's of no use if it does not have electricity.

00:47:00.055 --> 00:47:04.375
If you suppress the woman of the house like this,

00:47:04.576 --> 00:47:06.814
and she is not respected,

00:47:07.015 --> 00:47:10.108
the power cannot work within you.

00:47:11.135 --> 00:47:13.773
This is a very big fault.

00:47:13.974 --> 00:47:16.334
I don't know why, it never happened before

00:47:16.485 --> 00:47:18.465
but yesterday, after the program,

00:47:18.666 --> 00:47:22.078
the entire right heart was caught up so badly.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:26.842
I used to think that these things happen more in North India,

00:47:27.043 --> 00:47:28.719
but I see they are more in South India.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.063
North Indians don’t do it so much.

00:47:33.877 --> 00:47:37.345
If Indians have a shortcoming, it's only this one,

00:47:37.546 --> 00:47:40.773
that they don’t give respect for the women's power.

00:47:41.164 --> 00:47:44.735
The biggest shortcoming! On one side they will worship the Goddess,

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.066
will recognize Her as innocent Goddess,

00:47:47.267 --> 00:47:51.570
will recognize Her in all Her forms, but not as Gruha Lakshmi.

00:47:52.962 --> 00:47:57.204
That’s why today I want to say clearly that if you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:57.405 --> 00:48:00.966
then keep your respect towards your women.

00:48:01.167 --> 00:48:04.654
I have heard that openly you are scolding them.

00:48:04.855 --> 00:48:08.055
Then openly you will also be insulted.

00:48:09.375 --> 00:48:13.322
A man has no right to insult a woman,

00:48:13.852 --> 00:48:16.225
for no reason.

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.990
I think that if this thing can get right,

00:48:25.095 --> 00:48:28.974
then the powers of  Raja Rajeshwari will be definitely activated.

00:48:31.664 --> 00:48:34.214
You should understand completely

00:48:34.415 --> 00:48:40.627
that husband and wife are the two wheels of a chariot,

00:48:40.828 --> 00:48:42.817
one on the left, and the other on the right.

00:48:43.018 --> 00:48:45.701
Left one cannot come to the right, right cannot come to the left.

00:48:45.902 --> 00:48:48.418
Both have to keep their place.

00:48:48.898 --> 00:48:53.385
Both of them are similar but their places are different.

00:48:53.586 --> 00:48:56.245
It means no place is higher or lower.

00:48:56.446 --> 00:48:58.940
If one wheel gets lower, the chariot will not move forward.

00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:01.524
It will keep rotating in one place.

00:49:02.974 --> 00:49:08.081
Children also learn these things from you.

00:49:08.282 --> 00:49:11.773
If children cannot respect their mother,

00:49:11.974 --> 00:49:15.780
what can they do then in this world? How can they respect Me?

00:49:17.937 --> 00:49:21.607
That’s why I have a request from everybody,

00:49:21.816 --> 00:49:26.054
that from today don’t insult anymore the women in your house.

00:49:26.255 --> 00:49:29.027
Don't make them look smaller in any way.

00:49:29.228 --> 00:49:31.614
Their power is very important for you.

00:49:31.815 --> 00:49:34.254
Similarly, women should also go deeper in Sahaj

00:49:34.455 --> 00:49:38.520
and should assume their powers,

00:49:38.721 --> 00:49:41.586
should achieve their powers.

00:49:44.535 --> 00:49:48.814
Today, so many people have come for the Puja.

00:49:49.015 --> 00:49:52.710
They have come from the whole of India.

00:49:53.935 --> 00:49:56.694
I did not expect that.

00:49:56.895 --> 00:50:02.003
Now Sahaja Yoga is indeed getting very integrated

00:50:02.204 --> 00:50:06.368
and things are happening with so much love.

00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:11.668
Everywhere, wherever I look,

00:50:11.869 --> 00:50:18.000
it looks like Sahaja Yoga is spreading with great speed.

00:50:19.943 --> 00:50:26.673
But we must understand one thing,

00:50:26.874 --> 00:50:30.276
how deep we have gone.

00:50:30.477 --> 00:50:33.033
It is very important.

00:50:34.935 --> 00:50:36.814
The number is increasing,

00:50:37.015 --> 00:50:41.114
but there is no advantage in a big quantity.

00:50:45.095 --> 00:50:50.895
Until the time

00:50:51.175 --> 00:50:53.981
the values of Sahaja Yoga come within you,

00:50:54.198 --> 00:50:56.476
the quality will not be achieved.

00:50:56.677 --> 00:51:02.497
If you respect Raja Rajeshwari,

00:51:02.698 --> 00:51:05.474
then Her powers increase within you.

00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:08.655
Its manifestation should be within you.

00:51:09.095 --> 00:51:12.214
If not, then it's all right also.

00:51:12.415 --> 00:51:14.677
You have taken off one robe and put on another one.

00:51:14.878 --> 00:51:16.646
It's all outward thing.

00:51:16.847 --> 00:51:18.871
Nothing happened inside.

00:51:19.072 --> 00:51:24.472
This is an innate power and it should be visible

00:51:24.673 --> 00:51:28.230
in your behavior, conversation, everything.

00:51:29.146 --> 00:51:31.797
Unlimited blessings to you all.
