00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:01.120
We

1
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:02.720
Sit down.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.829
He

3
00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:08.369
Yes.

4
00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:10.689
Look at things

5
00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.970
So you are a community of the?

6
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.040
I think so.

7
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:19.049
No.

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.469
Sri Mataji,

9
00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:24.149
uh,

10
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.520
but I,

11
00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:25.190
uh,

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.389
I think Maggie should

13
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.950
translate for you because most of them are speaking German.

14
00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:31.030
Maggie,

15
00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.670
are you there?

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.560
Thank you.

17
00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.810
Yeah.

18
00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:42.659
Yeah I speak German.

19
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.889
Yeah.

20
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340
Hm.

21
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.819
Yeah.

22
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.730
She's here.

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.690
It's all.

24
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.069
That's all.

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.349
But the first thing you must have is your realising that.

26
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.099
Now this child is a bonds.

27
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.309
This is skin ly and you can feel the vibrations of the child.

28
00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.519
He's a born and how would you know he's bonized or not?

29
00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.919
So once you get your realisation,

30
00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.639
then you can say that who's realised who

31
00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.830
are everything because you become the absolute.

32
00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849
So.

33
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.910
Now this uh you can

34
00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.919
book that.

35
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.479
I.

36
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:23.789
That ain't so fucking.

37
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.160
And try.

38
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.339
You do get your relaxation,

39
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.449
but it has to be run.

40
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.559
Pran when it gets enlightened,

41
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460
then it becomes ran ran

42
00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.440
when it gets enlightened.

43
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.220
But is the right psychology,

44
00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.830
right.

45
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.910
I created.

46
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.759
But I was.

47
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.960
Why relevance within us.

48
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.410
But.

49
00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.300
It is the right side of me.

50
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.649
It is the

51
00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:01.350
vital side for our

52
00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.149
physical and mental being.

53
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:12.479
Pravimusse louisi kraft rechteelement.

54
00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.410
And the

55
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.119
channel that works it out is Pingal that is only one side.

56
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.630
This is about I if you go too much on the right side.

57
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:34.960
Then you neglect your left side.

58
00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:38.410
Which is the site we call as again look I'll make some.

59
00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:38.479
So is the emotional side

60
00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:02.339
as they call hello,

61
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.399
as they call it man.

62
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.229
They thought that

63
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.779
you have to resolve

64
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.119
Prana into Manasa.

65
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.880
Minranayama I see does manrana in Manassa alflous.

66
00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:21.108
But the problem is before realisation.

67
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.850
It is

68
00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:25.839
No

69
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.869
Advisable to follow any one of these patterns

70
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.000
because first we should know.

71
00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.320
What is our property?

72
00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:36.279
What is our nature?

73
00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.510
Every individual has a different nature.

74
00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:40.640
Uh but there's probably is for absolutely show is this kind is a good day.

75
00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.829
I know from this um

76
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.320
uh ide and alenge signa eigen natua men.

77
00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:52.190
Say for example,

78
00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.899
people in the west are right

79
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.440
means they're overactive.

80
00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.750
They are futuristic.

81
00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.100
They plan a lot.

82
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.329
They are physically and mentally equipped.

83
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:16.130
The high seasoned uber actives decline in that season cruises uh adult.

84
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.790
So the right side which is the suria Nadi.

85
00:05:21.049 --> 00:05:22.480
Was practised in India.

86
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.269
Long time back,

87
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:25.470
as you must be knowing,

88
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.839
to the way that also they talk about it

89
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.299
and the and then they just wait to see our point is too young.

90
00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:36.510
Now the thing is in the west,

91
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.559
if you are the right sided person.

92
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.429
Then

93
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.720
to give yourself

94
00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:44.019
a balance,

95
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.600
you have to be a left sided.

96
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.890
You have to

97
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.079
practise left-sided

98
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.920
things.

99
00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:50.450
able to link if you are left sided,

100
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.489
then you must practise right sided so the balance is established.

101
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.730
So in olden days,

102
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.380
you see,

103
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.559
when we were.

104
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.059
Trying to seek the truth,

105
00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:22.260
the saints,

106
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.470
the sages.

107
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.859
They found

108
00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:27.850
that the people are mostly,

109
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.750
mostly.

110
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.640
Left sided conditioned.

111
00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:33.380
In we.

112
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.179
So they started the system

113
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.739
of anxiety,

114
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.739
the right side this is the same.

115
00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:59.200
So in the way that you find the five elements are very important.

116
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.079
And Prajapati means the rama was the creator

117
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:03.820
of these five elements.

118
00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:06.260
Or he don't know what they call him

119
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.019
when he eats.

120
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.670
Uh,

121
00:07:09.769 --> 00:07:11.010
who got realisation?

122
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.959
Well,

123
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.119
I'm a side ulcer that is absolutely common heart,

124
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.549
but

125
00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:20.170
Janica really took his lots of tests.

126
00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:23.079
Without that you won't give him realisation.

127
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.140
It is all described

128
00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:34.559
how

129
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:38.299
he took his test and then he gave him realisation.

130
00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:44.269
It is we are in the tested attack on our saner we gave him that.

131
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:50.809
Now

132
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.859
And among you,

133
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:56.540
there may be some people who are right sided and maybe some people

134
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.950
who are left sided.

135
00:07:59.179 --> 00:08:05.410
On in and give this leroy.

136
00:08:05.739 --> 00:08:07.880
And you do not only belong to this life.

137
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.720
You have had many lives of So firstly we have to

138
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.250
see a balance.

139
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:22.970
Uh,

140
00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:23.540
to be given,

141
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.250
and then

142
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:26.890
we have to

143
00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:27.940
see.

144
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:32.710
We have to see

145
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.729
how

146
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.549
your chakras

147
00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.590
work out,

148
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.890
come into balance,

149
00:08:38.558 --> 00:08:40.539
and then you get your realisation.

150
00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:46.940
So I recently and like total and then the show by the chakras,

151
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:46.969
4,

152
00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:47.049
and then some of these from the.

153
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.070
That's the,

154
00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:54.039
that's,

155
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.530
you see,

156
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:56.830
you will come into a complete balance.

157
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.250
And then

158
00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.840
the kalin will rise,

159
00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:03.260
but it takes hardly any time to make your coolerin rice.

160
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:09.489
So as I say I'm total like to come and then this is.

161
00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:10.809
pretty cool you need some outside now

162
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.900
when the funaini rises.

163
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.729
She establishes a balance without the balance like left and right

164
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.140
in your.

165
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.429
Spinal cord

166
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.460
can

167
00:09:31.869 --> 00:09:33.340
cut out the centres.

168
00:09:35.669 --> 00:09:36.460
Like this

169
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.200
might go to the right or to the left.

170
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.919
It cuts out the centre

171
00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:42.229
left and the right.

172
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.090
Like that to me.

173
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.880
The mankind can see candi by the site and funding

174
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:58.109
centre and Alan and the Makundalini alte ye visuaman.

175
00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:00.200
Now when

176
00:10:00.789 --> 00:10:02.109
the kalini rises,

177
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.150
she establishes the balance,

178
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.750
otherwise she can't rise,

179
00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:06.830
but

180
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.679
afterwards,

181
00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:09.330
you have to establish it

182
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.770
yourself cooperatively.

183
00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:26.179
Wendielini Alsteiglisani nisteigenn of Christian is musi Mirren lies to Aus then.

184
00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:28.010
Once you have got like this,

185
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.700
then we should see if you have to

186
00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:34.510
do rana or you have to some do some

187
00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:35.049
Vama

188
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.169
or what yama

189
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:50.479
that has to be seen after you've got relaxed.

190
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.820
We done it deserves to be shower of yama or the oxy and Sara to your system.

191
00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:56.789
See how he's enjoying with me.

192
00:10:58.409 --> 00:10:58.419
Yeah.

193
00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.150
Yeah

194
00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:01.140
I see,

195
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.179
I see now.

196
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.640
They're very sweet.

197
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.869
There are so many children

198
00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:09.390
born everywhere who are realised so.

199
00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.049
It's out the bottom and tell you to say listen.

200
00:11:18.619 --> 00:11:19.989
Now for example this child

201
00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:22.489
is more on the right side.

202
00:11:22.859 --> 00:11:23.229
This is after the rest,

203
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:27.789
and

204
00:11:28.099 --> 00:11:29.849
the people who are on the right side

205
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.849
become overactive.

206
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:32.979
Delo of rest is in very active.

207
00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:36.900
Not only that,

208
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.020
but

209
00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:40.539
they developed all the problems with the right side.

210
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:42.280
If not us,

211
00:11:42.479 --> 00:11:42.500
sometimes how

212
00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:45.409
how the problem is the rest

213
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:45.929
resting.

214
00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:48.299
So you see,

215
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.020
you have to first of all,

216
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.390
like a car has to move.

217
00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.409
The car has to move

218
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:56.650
to see

219
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.070
whether it requires the brake

220
00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:01.750
or the acceleration.

221
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:04.049
So chances and ask the bacon.

222
00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:04.580
I'm done Chai of Sars over the over the premises.

223
00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:14.020
Moreover,

224
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.090
when the car

225
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.919
goes to a different gate,

226
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.869
then it will know

227
00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:21.179
what is to be done,

228
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.500
how to open the gate.

229
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.369
But before the car has started moving,

230
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.780
how can we decide it beforehand?

231
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:42.349
And when there's concern and talk on them let us listen.

232
00:12:42.359 --> 00:12:42.380
We out.

233
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:42.590
Our canine before the auto and the time had to be taken on to this for the common.

234
00:12:43.349 --> 00:12:44.539
This is common sense.

235
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.489
This is one

236
00:12:48.989 --> 00:12:50.140
that is why anything that you do,

237
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.380
you must do it first of all

238
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:53.510
with.

239
00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:56.650
Attainment of the absolute

240
00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:57.760
point.

241
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.109
So that relatively you have discussion

242
00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.630
what is to be done.

243
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.580
They say Alexaimachin who it as that absolute ari to

244
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.739
mix it down and ha canon discriminum next to it.

245
00:13:19.479 --> 00:13:23.469
So that all your activities get related to the spirit.

246
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.840
So with all ear actually taken in so.

247
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.250
Now realisation has been very difficult.

248
00:13:30.659 --> 00:13:31.650
I know that.

249
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:35.729
Because some crisis.

250
00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:37.929
And there have been books and books about it.

251
00:13:41.419 --> 00:13:41.460
So you look for.

252
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.010
But

253
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.969
time has to come where the,

254
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.260
the,

255
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.609
uh,

256
00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:47.179
seekers have given their realisation.

257
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.809
It is their right to help.

258
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:57.289
I will excite much common for the lore that a common.

259
00:13:58.109 --> 00:13:59.340
That time has come.

260
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.150
And decent sight is quite common.

261
00:14:02.059 --> 00:14:03.280
And this time

262
00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.210
distribute.

263
00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:08.500
On this side is out for herbicide for me.

264
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.729
So according to time,

265
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.619
as they call in to Samiiata.

266
00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:16.549
They practised

267
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.119
various types.

268
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.469
So to this she inside I'll send,

269
00:14:25.349 --> 00:14:25.469
how is she a technique in your case?

270
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:31.390
How the human beings were depending on the on the property,

271
00:14:31.489 --> 00:14:33.260
the nature of human beings is a.

272
00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:39.330
And the modern surgery.

273
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.320
It's nothing but a simple.

274
00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:44.419
Uh,

275
00:14:44.429 --> 00:14:44.700
my.

276
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:47.739
Which

277
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.739
I felt that first.

278
00:14:50.549 --> 00:14:51.750
Give them the realisation.

279
00:15:04.929 --> 00:15:05.700
yoga it's no OK I'm finding I mean and this is delighted he gave this lamb.

280
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.530
It's dirty,

281
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.419
so we go on cleaning it,

282
00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:11.969
cleaning it through Payama other things,

283
00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:12.659
cleaning it.

284
00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:20.619
Spencer is a lamps can put in and put in the yama or the.

285
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.809
I

286
00:15:24.469 --> 00:15:26.640
Thing could be you first put the light off.

287
00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.419
I'm sharp

288
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.390
and then clean it and the time is not have it.

289
00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:35.659
You can see it better

290
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:37.799
than the first,

291
00:15:37.809 --> 00:15:40.179
and you can do it easily on the side.

292
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:41.940
I won't have to tell you,

293
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.609
don't do this,

294
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.929
don't do.

295
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.049
That you know like human nature is very funny

296
00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:54.190
otherwise now they're getting a snake in their hat.

297
00:15:59.409 --> 00:16:02.140
And you see the snake and you say throw away the snake.

298
00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:02.909
They're not

299
00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:12.799
as long as they don't see the

300
00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:23.919
snake themselves,

301
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:24.000
they will never try it.

302
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.090
They'll argue with you.

303
00:16:24.099 --> 00:16:25.190
So we didn't strike till the snake bites them,

304
00:16:25.219 --> 00:16:26.119
they'll be carrying it.

305
00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:39.065
And what's the use of throwing the snake when it was done

306
00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:43.315
so because they are in ignorance and in ignorance don't fight.

307
00:16:45.426 --> 00:16:48.885
So now put on the light and tell them see what have you got in your hand.

308
00:16:57.531 --> 00:16:58.502
They can't do it anymore.

309
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:11.141
That is why in this our first real vibrations you judge yourself.

310
00:17:14.852 --> 00:17:16.472
You better be your own guru.

311
00:17:18.421 --> 00:17:19.311
I go,

312
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:20.911
so there's no blame on me.

313
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.608
This is the method

314
00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:39.170
which we call too many Sahaj means spontaneous because it's a living process.

315
00:17:39.689 --> 00:17:42.170
Karini awakening is a process of a living.

316
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.609
And

317
00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:52.199
also it means such means easy.

318
00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:57.219
So.

319
00:17:57.969 --> 00:17:59.410
Somebody asked that they

320
00:17:59.689 --> 00:18:00.130
think.

321
00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:03.280
In the 16th century called Ramdasa,

322
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:04.949
how much time it takes a higher like a row.

323
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.030
He said that

324
00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:12.160
that is the moment,

325
00:18:12.369 --> 00:18:13.060
that moment in,

326
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.640
but he put a condition

327
00:18:19.969 --> 00:18:22.109
that the disciple and the guru

328
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.560
should be equal.

329
00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.420
The one who does that

330
00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:30.229
should be equipped as well as a disciple,

331
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.390
but here disciple,

332
00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:32.189
no condition.

333
00:18:39.819 --> 00:18:43.060
But the disciple and the master both should be equal.

334
00:18:43.229 --> 00:18:44.020
That was the condition it was That's it but here.

335
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.430
yoga.

336
00:19:02.439 --> 00:19:04.339
There is nothing like such a condition.

337
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:06.660
I've been so keep this kind of social.

338
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.380
As long as you desire to be realised,

339
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.250
you'll get it.

340
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.030
I think yeah,

341
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.140
if you take him out and you're right,

342
00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.530
you know.

343
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.619
What's the matter?

344
00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:31.500
Are you all right now?

345
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.530
huh?

346
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.260
I think so.

347
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.380
If you take him out for a while,

348
00:19:33.459 --> 00:19:34.060
he'll be all right.

349
00:19:34.109 --> 00:19:35.270
Let's see more oxygen.

350
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.410
the door.

351
00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:44.140
So now,

352
00:19:45.599 --> 00:19:46.030
with this,

353
00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:46.689
you asked me that question.

354
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:48.439
Yes,

355
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.819
I'm

356
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.660
afraid we didn't explain ourselves very well.

357
00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:54.859
The breathing we practise is not ranayama.

358
00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:55.260
It is,

359
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.739
uh,

360
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.900
as a matter of fact,

361
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.189
I,

362
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.530
I don't think it is the system at all,

363
00:19:59.540 --> 00:19:59.550
uh,

364
00:20:00.469 --> 00:20:02.189
it is concerned more or less

365
00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.189
there's a certain amount of gothfulness

366
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.540
to start the breathing in the circle.

367
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:08.939
And after that,

368
00:20:08.989 --> 00:20:11.579
the circle takes over and it spontaneously

369
00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:13.069
moves to the left to the right,

370
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:13.790
up and down.

371
00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:14.310
So

372
00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:18.459
actually we'rene the concern divide up or down by the by the circle and then

373
00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:19.949
circle does whatever it has

374
00:20:20.989 --> 00:20:21.479
and

375
00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.109
I think uh.

376
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.640
The thing happens spontaneously

377
00:20:30.739 --> 00:20:30.780
that it cannot take.

378
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.089
It cannot spontaneously cannot take.

379
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.530
The reason I tell you why.

380
00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:35.459
Because the person

381
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.520
Uh,

382
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.250
it is

383
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.900
It's importantly also bad luck to us because this is

384
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.729
a compulsion in

385
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.020
in any yoga

386
00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:48.280
in any unit

387
00:20:49.189 --> 00:20:51.140
that a person who is a real eye so.

388
00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:53.680
Only 10 with.

389
00:20:55.229 --> 00:20:57.380
And that he should be quite.

390
00:20:58.339 --> 00:20:58.969
Uh,

391
00:21:00.089 --> 00:21:01.079
Quite an expert

392
00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:03.089
to do the job.

393
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.959
Otherwise awakening cannot take place.

394
00:21:06.089 --> 00:21:07.130
You may be cleansed up,

395
00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:13.130
but awakening can only take place in a person who is enlightened and of a very.

396
00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.109
Perfect.

397
00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:15.719
Uh,

398
00:21:15.729 --> 00:21:15.739
condition.

399
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.439
Now this has brought us bad luck also because every everybody you see is talking big,

400
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:22.839
uh,

401
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:23.780
this thing that thing,

402
00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:24.180
you know,

403
00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:24.660
from India,

404
00:21:24.739 --> 00:21:25.729
you know how many

405
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.560
uh thugs have come here,

406
00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:29.619
but

407
00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:30.530
also

408
00:21:30.739 --> 00:21:35.050
it's a fact because one light which is enlightened,

409
00:21:35.489 --> 00:21:38.500
can only enlighten another light,

410
00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.410
but that doesn't mean you are obliged,

411
00:21:41.739 --> 00:21:42.609
that doesn't mean you,

412
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.140
you are in a dominated.

413
00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:44.790
Nothing of the country,

414
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.609
but it's a catalyst.

415
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.530
That's is a guru,

416
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.170
which

417
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.250
enlightens

418
00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:51.369
one life for another,

419
00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:54.140
but in inside we have no good watch.

420
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.930
Because the enlightenment takes place,

421
00:21:57.099 --> 00:21:58.609
you become your own guru.

422
00:21:59.219 --> 00:22:01.369
There is nothing like a single guru,

423
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.219
but once you have reached a certain stage,

424
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.790
what we call a vials.

425
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.430
Where it is doubtless awareness

426
00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:11.709
is a state,

427
00:22:11.989 --> 00:22:16.680
is the state of your awareness of your consciousness when you reach that state.

428
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400
That

429
00:22:18.849 --> 00:22:21.189
You yourself can be a brother.

430
00:22:21.699 --> 00:22:22.910
You yourself can,

431
00:22:23.239 --> 00:22:23.989
uh,

432
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.109
everything

433
00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:26.199
you can cure people,

434
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.569
you know everything about it.

435
00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:31.030
You're very knowledgeable people because the knowledge is all within it,

436
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.680
but the door has to be open.

437
00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:34.119
And

438
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.510
it is such a system in which

439
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.949
the enlightened soul can be sub guru is the one who is an enlightened soul.

440
00:22:43.119 --> 00:22:48.040
Why Raha Janaka had to do for Nachike Nachiketa could not do it himself.

441
00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:50.969
But

442
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.130
that doesn't mean a guru takes money from everyone.

443
00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.969
He dominates everyone,

444
00:22:56.219 --> 00:22:56.699
tortures,

445
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.939
it's not doesn't mean that,

446
00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:58.579
not at all.

447
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.569
A guru is a compassionate person,

448
00:23:01.349 --> 00:23:02.540
but here I'm not a guru,

449
00:23:02.619 --> 00:23:03.449
I'm your mother.

450
00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.290
My mother,

451
00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:05.609
you know,

452
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.560
is always a guru.

453
00:23:06.689 --> 00:23:08.339
What she is a compassion,

454
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.959
not only that,

455
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.410
but

456
00:23:11.689 --> 00:23:12.699
what is the,

457
00:23:12.969 --> 00:23:13.880
what is the.

458
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.140
The desire of her mother is always that her children

459
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.550
should get all her powers and they should shine more than I.

460
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.890
That's what she wants.

461
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.150
What does she want?

462
00:23:24.849 --> 00:23:24.859
Yeah.

463
00:23:31.069 --> 00:23:31.489
Let me do it.

464
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:33.599
Yeah.

465
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:04.369
the common seal the dimension.

466
00:24:28.454 --> 00:24:28.604
perfect.

467
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.189
It has,

468
00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:36.900
it has a very big snag in it,

469
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.609
no doubt,

470
00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:38.310
because,

471
00:24:38.599 --> 00:24:39.030
uh,

472
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.270
as I told you

473
00:24:40.989 --> 00:24:41.829
yesterday

474
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.060
that about only 100 years back,

475
00:24:44.439 --> 00:24:45.189
it happened

476
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:45.910
that

477
00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:48.479
people started describing a funny method,

478
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.520
a new method

479
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.920
as just the part.

480
00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:04.150
It is nowhere mentioned in the whole of this.

481
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:07.439
This is.

482
00:25:10.089 --> 00:25:11.170
In the whole of Patanja,

483
00:25:11.489 --> 00:25:12.109
it's not mentioned.

484
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.359
It's traditionally nobody knows about this only about,

485
00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:17.280
uh,

486
00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:17.439
uh,

487
00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:18.479
this word

488
00:25:18.719 --> 00:25:22.810
I came to know from people who were suffering from troubles from their gurus,

489
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:24.560
and they told me this word.

490
00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:25.020
I said,

491
00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:25.900
Where is this word?

492
00:25:38.189 --> 00:25:38.449
You deloited it's a common sense I under a guru one this is formosisin man.

493
00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:44.060
So this is some new style of thing people have started

494
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:57.369
which is actually a tantric stuff is a stuff by which you get possessed.

495
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:57.459
Does he signs and harm.

496
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.689
Does he signs his address.

497
00:25:57.699 --> 00:26:00.680
The gentleman who wrote a book for his name was Vishnuir

498
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.060
who was,

499
00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:02.589
I think,

500
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.750
must have died about 60-70 years back.

501
00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:09.050
And this fellow was really absolutely in the wrong lines

502
00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:09.979
because

503
00:26:10.229 --> 00:26:15.790
he's just started a new sort of appeal and a new thing appeals to the right side

504
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:33.839
on this one.

505
00:26:33.859 --> 00:26:34.310
So this is this problem you see whatever.

506
00:26:34.444 --> 00:26:36.555
Your city is based on tradition.

507
00:26:36.564 --> 00:26:36.675
We have come from amoeba to this stage

508
00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:36.864
like this electricity has developed through tradition of

509
00:26:50.265 --> 00:26:52.265
search on electricity.

510
00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:09.589
So the gardens and so it has no relevance whatsoever.

511
00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:12.939
This no a kind relevance kind of.

512
00:27:14.579 --> 00:27:15.359
It's a,

513
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.000
it's a movement

514
00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:18.800
which just attracts

515
00:27:19.089 --> 00:27:20.219
the subconscious

516
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.089
to play its part the spirit or the supraconscious that is the right side or the right.

517
00:27:35.449 --> 00:27:36.709
I'm a student.

518
00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:38.079
Uh,

519
00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.689
we can say that certain people use the left side.

520
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.040
Some people use the right side.

521
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:42.079
Manolo.

522
00:27:46.069 --> 00:27:47.329
So that's the position

523
00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:52.609
and so and resy or a sy does not.

524
00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:56.510
Posses and this with this position,

525
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:07.520
your physical,

526
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:07.560
mental,

527
00:28:07.569 --> 00:28:07.719
emotional beings hurt physician mentality.

528
00:28:08.859 --> 00:28:11.910
It is if it is the left side.

529
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.319
If it is the left side,

530
00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:26.420
if it is the left side,

531
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.500
movement of that thing when he,

532
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:26.589
when he offer some sometimes after link,

533
00:28:26.609 --> 00:28:28.339
but if it is the right side,

534
00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:31.319
then a person himself doesn't suffer,

535
00:28:31.489 --> 00:28:32.949
but he addresses others.

536
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.060
He becomes very ambitious.

537
00:28:47.069 --> 00:28:57.709
He thinks of himself and he goes on like a malignant cell.

538
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.079
So this is what it is

539
00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:07.040
that we must understand

540
00:29:07.729 --> 00:29:09.079
that the whole thing

541
00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:11.000
has a science behind it.

542
00:29:11.369 --> 00:29:14.189
It has nothing to do with only Indian philosophy,

543
00:29:14.729 --> 00:29:15.599
all the great.

544
00:29:17.339 --> 00:29:21.069
Profits and incarnations have talked about the Pundali.

545
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:22.250
The this is this is er grows prokundaliniro like mamachana

546
00:29:33.859 --> 00:29:35.069
who calls kundalini as

547
00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:35.680
asses.

548
00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:41.140
Mohammad Satikundalinius and he said that

549
00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:49.770
in the resurrection time your hands will speak to that.

550
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:52.459
That is exactly what happens in yoga,

551
00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.469
that your hands start speaking you through your chakra.

552
00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.910
OK now does see it in sha yoga?

553
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.380
Does it aer to hear in chakra's expression.

554
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.189
Now has talked about it.

555
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.430
Now say at that point Confucius of Confucius,

556
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:08.560
Socrates.

557
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.719
That you are to be born again

558
00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:14.589
has been said very clearly by Christ.

559
00:30:15.099 --> 00:30:19.979
Socrates and Christus.

560
00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:22.719
Now in the Bible,

561
00:30:22.819 --> 00:30:24.530
what we hear about the Holy Ghost

562
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:25.969
is the one is the.

563
00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:30.760
That was here in the Heinekegeist her.

564
00:30:31.969 --> 00:30:32.040
This is Kundalini.

565
00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:36.750
Now in Sergio we can prove,

566
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.599
we can prove actually.

567
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.500
The existence

568
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.569
of our centres,

569
00:30:43.829 --> 00:30:47.140
the existence of all these incarnations in us,

570
00:30:47.349 --> 00:30:48.520
it can be proved.

571
00:30:56.989 --> 00:30:57.160
In yoga can existence is kalini in.

572
00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.750
It is no movement to the darkness.

573
00:30:59.619 --> 00:30:59.750
Um,

574
00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:00.989
I'd be here.

575
00:31:01.949 --> 00:31:01.989
Vivien is

576
00:31:03.469 --> 00:31:05.010
is kind of a vehicle in the fight.

577
00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.699
How we prove it now,

578
00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.229
I tell you,

579
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.500
supposing I say that Christ is on the Agata.

580
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:18.540
We devi somosagi in and does Christo after Agaraist when the kundalini rises.

581
00:31:19.699 --> 00:31:21.060
If she stops theagia.

582
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.069
You have to take his name

583
00:31:24.609 --> 00:31:27.750
and the Kundalini outside and see like by the Aakashte mussen chrystals.

584
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.780
Now if

585
00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:35.069
the kundalini stops at a particular sector.

586
00:31:37.219 --> 00:31:37.229
Then

587
00:31:38.489 --> 00:31:42.489
you have to take the name of the deity on that particular centre.

588
00:31:42.569 --> 00:31:44.400
This is the knowledge one as well.

589
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:45.310
That's all.

590
00:31:55.989 --> 00:31:56.199
And by centrum they employed the muscles in for the rare.

591
00:31:56.209 --> 00:31:58.209
Now supposing this finger.

592
00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:58.819
Is

593
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.660
maybe these the fingerprints.

594
00:32:02.829 --> 00:32:03.079
Now

595
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:04.719
this represents the navi.

596
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.619
That's what presented the naviaka if you see the back of the person.

597
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.489
You will be surprised that at the navi centre,

598
00:32:13.939 --> 00:32:14.459
the

599
00:32:14.689 --> 00:32:16.329
the vertebrae will be out.

600
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.170
Out of place.

601
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.770
Benzy uh these are mentioned and

602
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.459
and then the rash sign Kasua soil of this and incliner,

603
00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.369
the,

604
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.869
the person who's suffering from liver,

605
00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:33.790
for example,

606
00:32:34.099 --> 00:32:36.250
if you see the back side of such a person,

607
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.650
you'll be amazed

608
00:32:37.859 --> 00:32:40.530
that the spinal cord will be uneven

609
00:32:40.739 --> 00:32:42.209
and will be jutting out.

610
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:42.729
Now if you know how to give it

611
00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:55.060
a

612
00:32:56.839 --> 00:32:56.859
proper head.

613
00:32:59.099 --> 00:33:02.290
Can you listen this is very helpful canon.

614
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:03.800
Then,

615
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.349
then you can

616
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.849
improve that centre

617
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.729
and the kundalini will rise.

618
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.640
The id is a from the kalini.

619
00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:18.349
So it is a

620
00:33:18.609 --> 00:33:19.400
process

621
00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:21.770
which proves all the incarnations,

622
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.449
all the scriptures

623
00:33:23.729 --> 00:33:24.310
and

624
00:33:24.689 --> 00:33:27.239
all that so far has been said

625
00:33:27.449 --> 00:33:28.670
about our evolution.

626
00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:30.680
So it's a sign process

627
00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:39.930
does the deviceki the other descript it can the profate Als are for.

628
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.680
And about this is written in a book called

629
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.959
Nari byrobahui who lived thousands of years back,

630
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.380
who was the pioneer of astrology.

631
00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:49.709
And this is for Heideon

632
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:54.060
therefore.

633
00:33:57.239 --> 00:33:58.709
That such a thing will happen,

634
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:02.270
that the Fundalini will rise spontaneously,

635
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.160
and people will get that realisation.

636
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:04.920
It's a great description.

637
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:04.989
It's a complete book,

638
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:14.679
but

639
00:34:14.978 --> 00:34:16.100
that is what is happening.

640
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.938
If you happen to read the book,

641
00:34:17.978 --> 00:34:18.708
if you can get it,

642
00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.570
I don't think it is.

643
00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:23.455
You will see that all that is there is.

644
00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:38.014
So the surge also means effortless.

645
00:34:41.905 --> 00:34:42.475
For example,

646
00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:43.504
there's a seat.

647
00:34:44.197 --> 00:34:45.498
And you want to sprout.

648
00:34:45.898 --> 00:34:48.608
So get on salmon salt.

649
00:34:49.259 --> 00:34:51.618
Now the mother earth has a capacity to sprout.

650
00:34:52.018 --> 00:34:52.268
The salmon and to sprout

651
00:34:58.618 --> 00:34:59.729
is the nature

652
00:34:59.979 --> 00:35:00.819
of the seed.

653
00:35:01.259 --> 00:35:04.519
On the salmon's sausage freeze.

654
00:35:04.658 --> 00:35:07.108
Now when you put the seed in the mother earth,

655
00:35:07.339 --> 00:35:08.479
you don't do anything.

656
00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:16.610
It just stops like in the min says Sriwi liner.

657
00:35:17.139 --> 00:35:17.979
You are all liquid.

658
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:42.750
So why do any of you have done Raam and last lives quite a lot.

659
00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:42.870
There's no need for it.

660
00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:42.959
You are not seekers of today.

661
00:35:42.969 --> 00:35:43.100
You are seekers of is it need fun this is fun.

662
00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:44.649
If you can eat this way,

663
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.820
why go round and round.

664
00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:47.209
so

665
00:35:58.540 --> 00:35:59.189
that as a as a mother,

666
00:35:59.229 --> 00:36:00.949
I say I've done the cooking.

667
00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:06.729
You better eat if you are hungry,

668
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.379
you'll have that in essence even if you are not hungry,

669
00:36:13.689 --> 00:36:15.419
then you'll ask me how I cooked it,

670
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.949
how I bought it and all that.

671
00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:17.020
Now this slide

672
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.280
uh say is here.

673
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:27.209
Uh,

674
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.550
if you want to have it on,

675
00:36:28.629 --> 00:36:30.649
you'll just switch on there and it's,

676
00:36:30.709 --> 00:36:33.030
it's on because it is built in that way.

677
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.860
He li is here because his I have listed in the I'm so is so angry about this.

678
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.510
But supposing

679
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:45.239
you say first describe to us how electricity has come and

680
00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.419
how then

681
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.270
what is the history of electricity,

682
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:50.300
it would be boring.

683
00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:52.770
It's already there.

684
00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:02.459
Just panic.

685
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:07.820
for you

686
00:37:10.629 --> 00:37:11.709
you don't have to bother.

687
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.820
I've done everything for you.

688
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:11.889
This is to end.

689
00:37:11.899 --> 00:37:11.939
There is no need

690
00:37:29.429 --> 00:37:29.510
because you're all ready for it.

691
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:29.580
There is no need right here.

692
00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:35.290
Now let's have it.

693
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:44.250
Let's see how many are you feeding the food.

694
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:44.350
That's that's the end so.

695
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.909
This is the

696
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.500
Titan.

697
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:47.709
This is the Prannova,

698
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.629
not the prana.

699
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.449
Prannova is the one where the prana is light.

700
00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:57.149
The is trianiumranava does is the alloysis.

701
00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:01.229
Yeah.

702
00:38:03.199 --> 00:38:03.219
You it

703
00:38:11.399 --> 00:38:11.409
Hm.

704
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:13.879
All right.

705
00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:17.500
Are you feeling

706
00:38:20.939 --> 00:38:21.550
Just feel.

707
00:38:21.979 --> 00:38:22.570
If you don't feel it,

708
00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.310
you must have.

709
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.010
It is you who has to adjust.

710
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.860
Nobody asks,

711
00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:27.409
just see on top of your head.

712
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:28.860
should come out of your head,

713
00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:29.409
yeah,

714
00:38:29.929 --> 00:38:31.179
should come out of the a little high,

715
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:31.760
little high.

716
00:38:35.219 --> 00:38:35.560
Piss off so you can see her.

717
00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:44.040
It's called to him shines in well in the.

718
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:47.080
There

719
00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:49.379
So it's very oops,

720
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.139
put your right hand and we see with the left hand.

721
00:39:01.149 --> 00:39:01.360
Let's with the left hand.

722
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.530
It feels better with the left.

723
00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:04.689
Because right is heavy,

724
00:39:04.929 --> 00:39:05.669
I think.

725
00:39:10.469 --> 00:39:11.790
Now ask a question in your heart.

726
00:39:11.909 --> 00:39:12.889
Is this Pranova.

727
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.050
Is this all pervading power of God?

728
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.689
Is that the Alistairring in the craft godess.

729
00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:31.889
Is it that the Holy Ghost?

730
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.070
Is there a highly a kind.

731
00:39:35.729 --> 00:39:37.100
You can keep your eyes open.

732
00:39:37.149 --> 00:39:37.780
It's all right.

733
00:39:37.909 --> 00:39:39.340
You are in thoughtless awareness.

734
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.310
You are in in need to charge somebody already,

735
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:41.510
huh,

736
00:39:41.709 --> 00:39:42.260
now done.

737
00:39:42.429 --> 00:39:42.510
See,

738
00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:42.909
now listen.

739
00:39:49.469 --> 00:39:51.310
After realisation you have to do practise.

740
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.120
Not people.

741
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.850
Now the las.

742
00:39:57.899 --> 00:39:58.820
With understanding,

743
00:39:58.830 --> 00:39:59.699
with discrimination,

744
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.530
with knowledge.

745
00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.300
practical math meet for mid first time mid discriminar,

746
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.110
mids.

747
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.850
Not happen.

748
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:15.729
you know how old is she?

749
00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:26.429
Most of you have right side problem.

750
00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.739
Put left side is left is way to the,

751
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.310
uh,

752
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:32.899
sky,

753
00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:38.280
the right hand you rest your hands in the wrist.

754
00:40:45.219 --> 00:40:45.800
you like.

755
00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:47.899
But.

756
00:40:51.189 --> 00:40:51.620
You have

757
00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:54.010
Little Bonnie.

758
00:40:58.739 --> 00:40:58.780
That's it.

759
00:41:00.389 --> 00:41:00.459
I said dogs are buying.

760
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:09.169
Now don't be worry.

761
00:41:11.939 --> 00:41:14.050
You have to be pleasantly placed about it.

762
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:16.290
You are entering into the

763
00:41:16.659 --> 00:41:17.969
realm of the divine.

764
00:41:27.389 --> 00:41:27.399
Ma.

765
00:41:30.169 --> 00:41:31.129
Ah,

766
00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:32.729
say one thing.

767
00:41:34.169 --> 00:41:36.050
The mantra because this centre is patchy.

768
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:37.020
Yeah,

769
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.689
it is.

770
00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:38.949
Mother,

771
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.000
I'm not guilty.

772
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.689
Put it in your heart of hearts,

773
00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.870
not to feel guilty at all.

774
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.959
You are a saints.

775
00:41:59.439 --> 00:42:00.219
I'm just forgive yourself,

776
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.570
but science is even not yet science is.

777
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280
It.

778
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:17.090
What do you say.

779
00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:24.030
Forgive,

780
00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:24.810
forgive,

781
00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:25.270
forgive,

782
00:42:25.389 --> 00:42:25.979
forgive.

783
00:42:26.209 --> 00:42:27.189
3 times a year.

784
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.820
I like.

785
00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.580
Silent.

786
00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:42.219
You have to forgive,

787
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:42.590
madam,

788
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.800
forgive everyone.

789
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.260
Was for you.

790
00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:48.189
From your heart,

791
00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.469
just forgive them.

792
00:42:49.709 --> 00:42:52.020
I know because you're saying nobody can understand.

793
00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:54.659
But you are not so badly off.

794
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.659
Imagine the saints of the past,

795
00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.010
how much they suffer.

796
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:12.770
That science man for help and advice is for heart deloit fish on the higher.

797
00:43:17.439 --> 00:43:17.449
What.

798
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:18.290
To get home.

799
00:43:34.719 --> 00:43:36.489
So now I have to go to the programme.

800
00:43:38.229 --> 00:43:39.389
It's mostly some programme.

801
00:43:40.379 --> 00:43:41.629
Can you just see her how precious.

802
00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:42.770
She's all right,

803
00:43:42.949 --> 00:43:43.939
little upset.

804
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.889
You see,

805
00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:48.939
don't talk.

806
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.129
Ian beach,

807
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:52.270
she has.

808
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.169
Left to the right,

809
00:44:01.429 --> 00:44:01.979
just put it.

810
00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:06.879
Not to be anxious at all.

811
00:44:11.699 --> 00:44:11.750
Yeah

812
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:17.260
No.

813
00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:22.169
OK

814
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:30.510
That's for data.

815
00:44:37.389 --> 00:44:37.870
Now see,

816
00:44:37.949 --> 00:44:39.110
are you feeling it now better?

817
00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:40.600
That's

818
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:46.850
all right,

819
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.449
so it's the size of the device.

820
00:44:50.629 --> 00:44:51.959
If you can master it,

821
00:44:52.429 --> 00:44:53.060
all of you.

822
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.689
Everyone can become a great master

823
00:45:00.709 --> 00:45:01.040

824
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.780

825
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:04.979
So

00:45:06.449 --> 00:45:08.429
