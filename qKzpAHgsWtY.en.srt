1
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:12,460
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because
most of them are Hindi-knowing people

2
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:15,400
and I've just told them what is
the importance of Bombay,

3
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:22,223
and why so many incarnations came here,
and why Shri Rama

4
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:29,173
had to walk in the villages and the hills
and dales of Maharashtra,

5
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:37,533
what was the need, and the need is that
they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

6
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:42,906
Also, this would be the last Puja
for all of you, in India.

7
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:46,573
I hope you all have gained a lot
in these different Pujas

8
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:51,651
and different places we have been to.

9
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:57,071
Only thing is that one should remember
that Krita Yuga has started.

10
00:22:57,104 --> 00:23:01,254
Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga
has started, and in this Yuga

11
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:08,532
- that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely
effective and very efficient.

12
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:13,779
Now if you do anything wrong it will
punish you.

13
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:17,715
It may not punish immediately but it
will give you a suggestion,

14
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,609
it will give you a proper signal that
something is going wrong with you.

15
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:27,735
But if you do not try to control your
footsteps then you may go down very fast.

16
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,541
So you have to be very careful about that.

17
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:34,003
Actually, I have told you so many times
that there are two forces working,

18
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:36,857
one which attracts you inside and one
which throws you out.

19
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:43,864
So it is important for all of us,
all of us to remember

20
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:48,904
that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that
this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

21
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:52,877
Also, you are rewarded. You have been
telling me so many stories,

22
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:56,361
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj
it has happened,

23
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:59,841
all of you have been telling Me very
nice stories.

24
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:08,042
But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga

25
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,974
and that you are placed in the kingdom
of God.

26
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:15,323
So, in the kingdom of God you are there,
try to enjoy it,

27
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,663
that's the only thing you have to do
is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

28
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,355
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate
yourself from this joy,

29
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:31,430
break the connection of joy by some sort
of thinking, which is not reality,

30
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:34,278
then you are responsible for yourself.

31
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:38,342
So, I have to tell you that keep
the connection on. Not only that,

32
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:45,410
but try to make it stronger and stronger,
and become one with that divine force

33
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:49,789
permanently, which will flow through you
and will not only enlighten you

34
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:56,327
but will give you so many powers, and you
will see the new life in this new year.

35
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:59,587
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have
to work it out now.

36
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:04,483
Individually, we have to go all out to see
that we spread Sahaja Yoga

37
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:09,214
and talk about it. On this day I give you
complete freedom

38
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:13,732
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You need not ask Me any permissions,

39
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:18,109
and you can try everything that you
want to. But should be something decent,

40
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:22,258
should not be something indecent
and something which is not behoving

41
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:27,981
a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write
letters or answers or anything,

42
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:30,678
even if you have to show the anger
it should be done

43
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:35,134
in a very decent and a beautiful
manner.

44
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:40,289
And it should show that it's a yogi
who is talking.

45
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:47,468
The other things, whatever problems
you have, will be solved in no time.

46
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:52,877
But the main problem is yourself, it should
be solved by you by meditative methods.

47
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:59,904
And so much attention we are paying
to all our extra-curricular activities

48
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,900
but that will definitely fail, it will
boomerang on you

49
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:06,818
if you do not have the foundation
of Sahaja Yoga.

50
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:11,791
It is very important to keep attention
on your spirit all the time

51
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:15,413
so that whatever you are doing, whatever
you are projecting,

52
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:19,860
has the base and you just don't get lost.
This is a very important thing,

53
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:27,696
and I am sure that you will understand
that without the nourishment

54
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:33,868
from the roots you cannot grow. So this
nourishment must be kept alive.

55
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:37,493
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
