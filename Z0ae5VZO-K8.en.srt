1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,452
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

2
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:14,454
that you’ll meditate every night,

3
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:17,514
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

4
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:21,734
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

5
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:27,314
you are in contact with this Divine power.

6
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:33,414
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

7
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:39,135
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

8
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,714
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

9
00:00:42,994 --> 00:00:45,754
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

10
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:53,334
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

11
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:58,434
which is another great blessing to us.

12
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:03,970
Unless and until your Sahasrara is opened

13
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:10,534
all the blessings of the Divine power cannot come to you, cannot.

14
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,294
Maybe you might get some money, you might get some jobs,

15
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:16,314
you might get this and that.

16
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:20,534
But your own development is only possible when you meditate

17
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:26,834
and your Sahasrara is completely open and open to truth.

18
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:34,514
Now the truth is that this Divine power is compassion, is love.

19
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:37,074
This is the truth.

20
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,834
They say God is love and God is truth,

21
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:45,394
so the equation has to be made that truth is love and love is truth.

22
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:48,847
But it’s not a truth that, as you have for your own children,

23
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,874
you have for your family, attached.

24
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:55,066
Attached love is not truth.

25
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,414
If you are attached to somebody

26
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:01,334
then you never see the bad points of that person.

27
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,454
If you are angry with somebody,

28
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:06,774
then you can never see the good points of that person.

29
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:11,014
But it’s a complete detached love

30
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:14,434
and that love is extremely powerful

31
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:19,214
because whenever you project that love to anyone,

32
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,774
you’ll be surprised, the problems of that person will be solved,

33
00:02:22,874 --> 00:02:24,816
his personality will improve,

34
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:29,994
everything will work out in a very big way and his life will be changed.

35
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:34,998
But if you’re attached to anything whatsoever,

36
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:46,650
that attachment itself causes problems and doesn’t allow Sahaj to grow.

37
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:51,311
This attachment could be any kind, for example,

38
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:55,503
you can be attached to your country, attached to your society,

39
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:58,514
attached to your family, it can be of any kind.

40
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:03,916
But when Sahasrara is open, you’ll learn one thing, is detachment.

41
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:06,297
It just happens that you get detached.

42
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:09,779
Though, I mean, you are not running away.

43
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:14,067
As it is in Sahaja Yoga we don’t believe in people who run away

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:19,145
from society and go to Himalayas, all that I call escapism,

45
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:20,589
that is not the point.

46
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:26,060
What happens is that you are there, you see everyone,

47
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:30,033
you watch everyone, you know everyone,

48
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:34,921
you are close to everyone, but you are a detached person.

49
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:40,093
It’s a state of mind that you achieve when Sahasrara is open.

50
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:44,936
In that state you are dealing with people,

51
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:49,814
you are dealing with problems, you are dealing with situations,

52
00:03:49,914 --> 00:03:55,354
but you are not involved in it, there’s no involvement;

53
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,630
and that involvement which you had before

54
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:03,659
can never give a complete insight, what is happening,

55
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:06,775
what the truth is, about any situation.

56
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:09,756
So this detachment helps.

57
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:15,801
The greatest thing of the detachment is that you are not affected.

58
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:20,174
No use saying that, “oh you are not affected,

59
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:26,175
Mother, so how can you feel for another person?

60
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:30,580
How can you have compassion for another person?

61
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:34,941
Because if you feel for another person

62
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:38,154
then only you can solve the problem”.

63
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:43,501
But this feeling that you have is again a kind of an attachment.

64
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:50,209
It is not a real feeling, because it doesn’t help.

65
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,714
The person is crying, you are also crying,

66
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:55,494
the person is trouble, you are also in trouble.

67
00:04:55,594 --> 00:05:01,044
And this does not help that person, nor will it help you.

68
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:05,014
So to have detached in no way means

69
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:09,409
you do not feel for another person.

70
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,854
You do feel.

71
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:16,599
You feel the agony of that person, the trouble of that person,

72
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:21,601
of the whole society sometimes and of the whole country.

73
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:25,077
But that your feeling is so detached

74
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:30,234
that the All-pervading Power takes over.

75
00:05:30,315 --> 00:05:32,541
First we must have full faith

76
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:36,903
in the capability of this All-pervading Power.

77
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,318
As soon as you are detached.

78
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:43,142
You say, “You do it” - finished.

79
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,650
Once you say that, “You are going to do it,

80
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,834
it’s You who is going to do it,”

81
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,057
whole thing changes completely.

82
00:05:50,154 --> 00:05:54,934
Because you transfer all your responsibilities, all your problems,

83
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:58,374
to this Divine power, which is so powerful,

84
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:03,600
which is so capable, which can work out anything.

85
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:08,952
So whenever you think that this problem you are going to solve,

86
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,440
you are the one who’s going to do it,

87
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:17,167
then, alright, the Divine power says: “Alright, try your luck.”

88
00:06:17,234 --> 00:06:21,087
But if you can really put this problem to the Divine power,

89
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:22,814
it will work out.

90
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:26,034
We have all kinds of problems in Sahaja Yoga,

91
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,708
especially when we find that people

92
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:32,465
are not so much attracted to Sahaja Yoga,

93
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:35,954
they are few in number then you feel very bad about it.

94
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,325
But have you tried to meditate on this point,

95
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:44,268
and have you tried to put this problem to the Divine power?

96
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,054
Why should we worry?

97
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:49,200
When we have Divine power available through our Sahasrara,

98
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:50,374
why should we worry?

99
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:52,614
Why should we think about it?

100
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:56,118
Just leave it to the Divine power.

101
00:06:56,154 --> 00:07:00,354
If that is possible, if that you can achieve,

102
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:03,234
which is very difficult for human beings,

103
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,753
because they live with their ego,

104
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,714
they live with their conditionings;

105
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:12,858
but if that attachment to all these things goes away,

106
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:18,274
then what you do is just leave things to this power.

107
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,146
Krishna has said in His Gita:

108
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:24,954
“Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja”

109
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:26,832
“Forget about all your dharmas”.

110
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:31,674
Dharmas means, He means, meaning that we have a dharma of a wife,

111
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:36,178
of a husband, of a member of the society,

112
00:07:36,274 --> 00:07:38,519
all of them have their own dharma.

113
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:44,037
But He says “Leave them. And leave it, them to Me and I’ll manage.”

114
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:47,607
This is it what we have to learn, is to say that

115
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:52,160
“It’s this Divine power which will solve our problems.”

116
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:55,628
As human beings it’s a very difficult state

117
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:59,895
and this state only can be achieved through meditation.

118
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:03,734
But I’m not saying that you go on meditating for hours together.

119
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:05,233
That’s not necessary.

120
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:10,934
But with full faith in yourself and in the Divine power.

121
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:14,294
If you work it out, I’m sure it’s not difficult

122
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:18,594
to rise to that state of consciousness.

123
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,904
That is what we have to achieve.

124
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:25,396
It’s possible for men as well as for women.

125
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:29,232
They don’t have to think: “How can we, Mother, do it after all?”

126
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:32,594
You see, all such people are no good for Sahaja Yoga.

127
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:38,668
Those who have diffidence about themselves cannot do anything.

128
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:43,327
But those who are surrendered and those who think they can do it,

129
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:53,156
can manage all this transfer of their power to the Divine power.

130
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:55,054
Just put it on the Divine power.

131
00:08:55,154 --> 00:09:00,022
Now supposing I have a car which can drive Me down.

132
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,585
So, if I have a car then I don’t put bullocks on it,

133
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:10,574
that I don’t push My car, I just sit inside and use it.

134
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:15,050
In the same way, if you have this great power around you,

135
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:20,383
if your Sahasrara is absolutely, completely submerged in it,

136
00:09:20,514 --> 00:09:26,883
then you’ll be amazed how things work out for yourself.

137
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:32,074
I will give you an example of a Sahaja Yogi, he’s no more now,

138
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:36,594
he was a fisherman, ordinary fisherman, but also he was educated,

139
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,992
so he was working in a bank.

140
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:43,914
This one was going one day to do some Sahaja Yoga work

141
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,338
and he had to go by boat.

142
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:50,084
So when he came out he saw that the whole place was clouded

143
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:53,814
and it was about to burst out into a big havoc.

144
00:09:53,914 --> 00:10:00,831
So he got very much perturbed about it that – “what is this?”

145
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:05,589
Immediately, his Sahasrara was so open and good, immediately he said,

146
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:08,834
“Now I leave it to this Divine power

147
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,169
to stop all these things happening.

148
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:15,669
I don’t want it to rain and to have any problem

149
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:19,336
till I come back home and go off to sleep”.

150
00:10:19,394 --> 00:10:22,854
And it was surprising, people told Me that

151
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,306
“Mother, the clouds and everything were there

152
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:32,456
all throughout but it did not rain, did not do anything,

153
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:35,861
and there was no chaos of any kind”.

154
00:10:35,914 --> 00:10:38,885
He went to another island where he had to go,

155
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,456
he did Sahaja Yoga and came back.

156
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,258
And then when he went to sleep, then only,

157
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,514
everything started pouring down.

158
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:51,660
So, nature, everything, every leaf, every flower, everything,

159
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,938
is worked out through the Divine power.

160
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:59,074
So we should not have our ego that we can do something ourselves,

161
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,899
we can manage ourselves.

162
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:02,910
Once you have that kind of a thing,

163
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,934
you are not yet that much developed,

164
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:08,664
you are not that much grown up in Sahaja Yoga.

165
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:12,734
But to grow up in Sahaja Yoga should not be difficult for you,

166
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:15,633
because you have guidelines.

167
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:20,268
Those people who got their realization, very few of them,

168
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:24,514
like Sufis and we had some saints in India, all of them;

169
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,382
how much they must have struggled.

170
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,217
Nobody to guide them, nobody to help them,

171
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:32,594
nobody to tell them about what they can achieve.

172
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:37,670
And despite that they were very satisfied people,

173
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,353
very happy people, and they worked it out so well.

174
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,964
They saw the whole world with another angle, as you can also see,

175
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,821
but they were not upset and they had such self-confidence,

176
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,937
they had such knowledge of their own

177
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,175
that they achieved through their meditative process.

178
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:02,934
And the way they have written books,

179
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:06,286
some of them are so great, it’s very surprisingly,

180
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:14,558
how they have achieved these great verses, such full of knowledge.

181
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:19,360
One cannot understand that they had no guidance,

182
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,463
nobody was to tell them.

183
00:12:22,558 --> 00:12:24,883
But one thing with them was

184
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:30,748
that they always tried to look after their Sahasrara.

185
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,367
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

186
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:40,360
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

187
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:44,334
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

188
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:47,544
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

189
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:51,885
Thoughts are coming all the time,

190
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:56,274
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

191
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:58,188
react to this and react to that

192
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,334
and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

193
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,379
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

194
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:07,434
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

195
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:11,863
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

196
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:17,154
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

197
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,752
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

198
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:23,061
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

199
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:27,299
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

200
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:31,874
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

201
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,654
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

202
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:38,194
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

203
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:42,046
And these are so much built up within you,

204
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,139
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

205
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:51,590
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

206
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,974
First one is, when it is conditioning,

207
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:56,876
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

208
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:59,514
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

209
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,779
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

210
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,965
That’s the conditioning part of it.

211
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,195
Conditioning can be of many types.

212
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,734
But the ego part of it is that,

213
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,502
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

214
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:15,971
I must be able to rule everyone.”

215
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:19,715
These two things are there in the mind

216
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,477
which are all the time crossing over.

217
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:29,016
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

218
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:34,135
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

219
00:14:34,234 --> 00:14:39,554
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

220
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:44,810
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

221
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:48,739
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

222
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:51,016
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

223
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:54,004
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

224
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,568
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

225
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,426
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,

226
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,037
“I’m an extrovert”.

227
00:15:02,074 --> 00:15:04,029
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

228
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:10,117
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

229
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:13,774
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

230
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:19,774
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

231
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:26,379
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

232
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:30,783
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

233
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,314
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

234
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:37,234
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

235
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,855
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

236
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:44,544
this Agnya can be opened out.

237
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,190
With surrendering to the Divine,

238
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:49,609
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

239
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:53,601
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

240
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:58,410
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

241
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:05,314
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

242
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:09,814
Your connection of Sahasrara with

243
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,998
the All-pervading Power is established.

244
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:18,909
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

245
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:24,054
how they help you, how they try to give you whatever

246
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:27,774
is the real knowledge about everything.

247
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:32,702
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

248
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:35,574
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

249
00:16:35,674 --> 00:16:39,374
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

250
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:44,794
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

251
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:52,615
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

252
00:16:52,674 --> 00:17:00,318
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

253
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:05,659
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

254
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:09,334
Kabira has said something great about this,

255
00:17:09,434 --> 00:17:18,314
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

256
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:21,910
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

257
00:17:22,034 --> 00:17:29,794
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

258
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:33,796
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

259
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,154
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

260
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,185
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

261
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:49,256
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

262
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,321
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

263
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:57,514
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

264
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:02,927
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

265
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:08,673
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

266
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:14,146
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

267
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:18,440
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

268
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:23,274
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

269
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,860
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

270
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,970
But the greatest thing happend to you

271
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:31,994
that you become a global personality.

272
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:35,812
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

273
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,153
of every other nation where they have problems.

274
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:44,271
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

275
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,486
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

276
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,174
maybe for media, maybe for something.

277
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:54,772
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

278
00:18:54,834 --> 00:19:00,542
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

279
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:05,354
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

280
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:10,682
that it, whatever disturbs you,

281
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:15,804
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

282
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:19,907
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

283
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:24,154
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

284
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,096
if you are a global person.

285
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,020
If you are a global person then

286
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:34,725
what happens is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

287
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,141
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

288
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:43,797
to act because you are purely a global personality.

289
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:46,074
Not attached to this, attached to that,

290
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:50,174
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

291
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,022
by this Divine power very easily.
