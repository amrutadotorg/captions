00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.360
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.560
In the center He resides as Shri Krishna.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.040
On the left-hand side His power, Vishnumaya, His sister, resides.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.760
There He resides as Gopala,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.240
as the one who lived in Gokul played as a child.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.920
On a right-hand side He resides

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.080
as the king who ruled in Dwarika, the king Shri Krishna.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.440
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.880
The people who use their right side to dominate others,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.160
use their voice to put down people,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.000
to show their authority,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.960
shout at people,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.800
are the people who get affected by the right side.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.040
The right side is caught up

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.400
on the physical side you get a very big problem,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.600
because the Right Heart cannot work out its flow.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.120
So you get what you call asthma and all these diseases.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.560
But specially when the Right Heart is affected

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.080
by the fathers problem.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280
On the left side is the Vishnumaya,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280
is the sisterly relationship.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.440
When the sister who is your pure relation

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.760
is not treated as the sister,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.120
when the attitude of a person towards women

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.880
is of indulgence and of lust,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.480
then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.240
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very strongly

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.120
and if he has a bad Agya of he has eyes which are roving eyes,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.760
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot of trouble.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.320
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you know,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.240
by feeling guilty about things for nothing at all.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.720
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.880
But Vishuddhi Chakra has a specialty.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.200
When the humane beings raised their head upward

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.480
from Mother Earth towards the sky,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.760
sky is, ether is Shri Krishna's nature,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.840
when it raises head towards the ether, towards the sky,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.040
then this Vishuddhi Chakra developed into a different dimension

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.560
and people started developing ego and superego.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.760
Superego was already developed,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.680
but ego developed in such a way,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.440
that it started suppressing the superego.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
That's how you have got conditionings on one side

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.080
of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other side.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.360
When I told you the other day that you give up your free will

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.000
in the sense that when you raised your head

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.000
you did it through your free will with your power of growing,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.360
that you had as animals.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.680
After that now you have reached to the humane level.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.160
And to rise above the humane level now

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.440
you have to do is to seek your complete freedom.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.520
And for that Vishuddhi Chakra is going to help you a lot.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.960
On this Vishuddhi Chakra we have to really pay full attention.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.640
It is such a complicated Chakra.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.840
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari's script

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.120
emitting out of the sound

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.280
of the shakti that is passing through it,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.040
of the Kundalini that is passing through it.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.640
So all the vowels are heard on these Chakras.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.480
These vowels are, as you know, sixteen in number.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.960
Without the vowel

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.360
in the Devanagari you cannot write anything.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.440
Vowels are the sustenance,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.160
are the power that

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.800
supports every consonant.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.280
So it's very important that our vowels

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.400
have to be fully nourished and respected.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.240
The movement of the neck,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.680
as you have seen in all international life,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.720
if you see, everybody has practically the same.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.080
Even those who cannot hear,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.120
those who do not understand your language,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.120
you can nod like this,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.320
can say, "No", like this.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.240
Everyone understand this is "Yes" or "No".

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.200
In some particular area

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.640
of course they have little different type of nodding.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.040
But too much of nodding of head is not a very good sign.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.160
I have seen people in the West,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.720
if you tell them something

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.120
to show that they appreciated it,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.480
they'll go on for quite some time.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240
That's not necessary.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.600
Just have to say, "Alright", or "I've understood it", that's all.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.240
You have to use your voice

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.720
instead of nodding like this all the time.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.360
Is very bad, very-very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.360
Or some of them are the other way round.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.280
That whatever it is they'll put up their head like this

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.520
and they won't talk properly,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.000
they will not say a word, they'll just keep quiet.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.120
You may go on pinching them, doing anything, they won't badge.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.960
This kind of personality is also very much detrimental

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.960
to the growth of their evolution.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.760
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a very big problem.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.560
Because of Vishuddhi there are so many problems.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.680
Like angina you develop because of Vishuddhi.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.120
You develop spondylosis because of Vishuddhi.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.240
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.080
Sometimes they have all the time coughing.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.280
And there are so many physical problems

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.520
out of Vishuddhi because, as I said,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.200
this a very-very complicated center,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.640
which looks after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteenth

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.520
sub plexuses are there, which are looked after by this center.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.680
But above all is the center of discrimination.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.880
The center of discrimination only comes when you are free people.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.000
Till you are biased, till you have your own concept,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200
you cannot be discrete.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.720
And that's the one point where one must understand

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.920
that to achieve your complete freedom,

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.800
you have to get your Vishuddhi Chakra cleared out.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.200
First and foremost thing is that we must speak in a sweet manner,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.320
speak to someone in a sweet manner,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.960
not artificially, but sweetly.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.280
Speak in a manner that another person likes it.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.760
Saptyam vadeyt, priyam vadeyt.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.040
Speak the truth, don't tell the lies.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.960
If you go on telling lies after some time,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.920
even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.880
But if you are telling the truth,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.920
that even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.840
Now some people

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.560
think that they can be cunning,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.320
by their talks they can cheat people.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.080
But actually they are cheating themselves.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.880
All such people who cheat others

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.680
by sweet talks, by artificial talks

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.760
or by some maneuvering

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.720
go to such a horrible state

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.680
and in this Kali Yuga specially they are cursed

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.600
and they get exposed and people know about them,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.320
that these are the greatest liars ever known.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.440
Now the times are coming

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.600
when all such people will be exposed

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.080
very much more than they have been ever exposed.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.680
So be careful not to think that you can cheat.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.320
In Sahaja Yoga specially you cannot cheat.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.040
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.760
"We can befool Mother, we can some or other carry on.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.160
If we see in front of Mother She won't know, what we are up to".

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.440
Is not so.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.120
I may not say, I may use My discretion not to say,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.920
I may allow you to have a long way, but be careful.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.360
Do not come into My illusions,

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.160
I'm very illusive.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.600
And when I play My illusions you will suddenly find yourself

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.600
in a very difficult situation and then you will say,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.440
"Mother, why am I in this situation?"

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.520
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.800
that He is the one who becomes illusive.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
And His illusiveness not cunning but illusive.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.680
In His illusiveness He exposes people to themselves.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.240
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.800
in which He had illusively acted to give

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.760
greater joy to some people,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.160
to give nice lessons to some people

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.200
and sometimes to punish.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.440
For us it is important, that we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.040
in this lifetime we have a chance

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.200
our Kundalini has risen,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.200
that we can face ourselves,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.280
that we can correct our chakras,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.960
that we know about ourselves,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.040
that we know where is the problem is.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.520
I've known of people who were caught up with left Vishuddhis

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.120
and have become devilish by nature, devilish.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.120
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.240
they have criticized Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.440
they have tried to trouble Me a lot.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.720
So don't think that if Vishuddhi is spoiled

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.840
there's nothing so special about it.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.840
It can be a very dangerous center.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.120
Of course, Heart, Agya and Vishuddhi, these three centers

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.240
one has to guard against

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.520
because three of them can allow you

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.760
or can force you to become one with identification

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.160
of evil as your own.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:33.160
You might just feel that it's nice to be evil;

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.280
you might just feel that it is a great fun to be evil

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.720
and you might become evil.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.920
So at the Vishuddhi Chakra one has to be extremely careful.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.240
Vishuddhi Chakra you looks after so many things,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.640
specially your skin, your eyes.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.600
Skin is now I've seen people who have bad Vishuddhi

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.640
can have all kinds of funny troubles with their skins.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.000
Of course, it has to do with your liver,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.360
but skin is the way it shines,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.200
the way it glows,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.280
depends on how you smile,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.440
how you look at the world.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.040
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing at all.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.120
Specially women I have seen, ladies I have seen,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.680
they just smile stupidly.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.880
That's not [inaudible], one should not be stupid.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.880
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna's principle.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.280
Like you have seen the stupid people, how they are.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.880
Their tongue is always halfway out.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.120
If you have noticed the stupid man,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.040
his face is that, his tongue is always out,

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.040
mouth half open and he looks like a dumbfound fool.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.160
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.200
Another one is the one where

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.480
you get the Vishddhi's straits.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.240
So such a person has very purse lips,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.960
angry lips and he doesn't talk.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:24.120
The another one might even get the expression of an idiot,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.920
but could be just making a face like that.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.880
Because if he's cunning he may take a

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.240
I would say a kind of a

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.120
rupa or... (yogi: "Mask").

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.240
Mask you can say, a mask on his face,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.840
that he is an idiot and make high to deceive you.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.080
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.280
Whatever may be the expression of a person,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.600
a person may look very innocent.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.480
Because that's the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.960
You are free because you've raised your head

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.200
and this point you have achieved, this kind of a special aptitude

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.000
that you can deceive yourself and you can deceive others.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.400
Some people look extremely innocent on the face.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.120
They may look to be very simple people,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.080
but may turn out to be horrid.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.200
Some people may look to be idiotic,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.120
but may be very intelligent.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.400
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:40.280
which is, which is responsible.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.240
But the main thing what I'm trying to tell you,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.720
that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.960
The way you want to put your expression,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.840
the way want you make your face,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.000
the way you want to suggest something,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.160
all you can maneuver

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.440
and you can keep your heart away from it.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.040
In the heart you may have poison for a person,

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.600
but outwardly you may say

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.600
to that person in a very sweet manner something

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.520
that a person might feel impressed.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.640
But in this all this behavior, pattern of behavior,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.920
you are deceiving yourself, not deceiving the another person.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.320
Because yourself is Spirit,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.840
which knows you very well.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.240
And this will go on and on

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.800
for all your lives that have to come.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.880
So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression,

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.760
there is no need to hide anything in your expression.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.040
Of course, I mean, if you don't like someone

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.960
you need not just say, "I don't like you",

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.120
but in that case you have to be

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.360
not also so much appreciative of the person,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.320
that he's deluded into your appreciation.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.320
Now, eyes are very important

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.280
and eyes in a way are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.320
because the muscles of the eyes

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.280
are looked after by Vishuddhi.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.440
And the kind of the muscles we have

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.200
which pull our eyes,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.920
which close our eyelids and all that is very much suggestive.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.880
You must noticed that there are some people who come to Me,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.760
their eyes go on like this.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.160
When they close their eyes, they cannot keep it shut.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.720
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.480
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.280
Both are in trouble.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.920
The ones which are the ones,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.360
which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.480
are the people having supraconscious.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.120
And those who flicking their eyes are having the subconscious.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.280
Some people have also

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.680
habit of eh keeping the eyes in an angle all the time

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.040
they never see you straight,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.360
but in angle they'll see.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.880
Ah, they think it's sometimes it's very fashionable sometimes,

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.440
ladies think it's a very good way of looking at people

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.720
and some of them have such eyes

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.160
that they'll go on and looking and boring

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.240
their greedy eyes onto others,

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.520
or their lusty eyes onto others.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.480
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.440
because such people are easily can become blind.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.320
Such people might have trouble of the eyes.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.160
Specially reddening of the eyes

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.080
can come to such people

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.400
very much, very quickly.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.960
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.840
The eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.720
He was a witness,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.560
He, He was on this Earth,

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:03.040
He play, He played with Radha. He married five women,

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.920
they were the five elements.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.000
Sixteen thousand women He married,

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.040
they were His sixteen thousand powers,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.520
but He was Yogeshwara.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.280
He was Yogeshwara;

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.960
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them, at all.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.040
He was beyond them, He was Yogeshwara.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.160
That was the testing point of His,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.800
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.840
Such an Yogeshwara is there!

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.680
Of course, I don't expect you to be Shri Krishna.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.000
But you have your wife.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.840
Those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.040
That we'll get wives and will be,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.120
ah, we'll have a wife and think of a wife,

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.440
who will be your own

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.560
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.720
who comes across ah with that kind of a thing.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.040
I've seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.640
it's surprising, I mean, there's nothing in the photograph,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.760
what is in a photograph?

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.400
But even a photograph can attract their attention,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.280
I mean, I don't know what can attract their attention like this.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.640
But they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.280
No control, they become absolutely lost and they have no control.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.920
That shows that they have no powers in them

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.000
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.920
For the eyes are very-very important as Christ has said,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.920
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.480
There should be no adultery.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:36.200
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.880
If they have to show anger with their eyes

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.520
they'll just go on looking like this and show the anger.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.040
I need there not do that to you, but.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.960
And the angry eyes you see are another dangerous things

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.400
to do with your eyes,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.720
because then they can become mesmeric.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.440
If you start putting your eyes onto something

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.840
and concentrating on it your eyes might become mesmeric

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.200
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.480
First of all you'll catch bhoots in your eyes,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.480
they'll settle down there and then

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.080
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.160
It's a very-very dangerous thing

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.520
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.160
There's another kind of a stupid thing or a bhootish thing maybe,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.800
that people ask you to meditate here. It's absolutely wrong.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.200
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.160
Nobody should put attention here.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.040
Instead of put attention, put attention at the door.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.880
What's the use of looking at a window?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.520
You can't get out of it, can you?

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.760
If you have to look at anything be on a lookout for the door.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.680
And the door is here.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.240
The door of Sahasrara is to be open out.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.040
So you should not try to concentrate on this path.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.160
Many people who have concentrated on this path have become mad.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.920
When they become mad, people say,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.280
"These are Yogi but has got [SOUNDS LIKE - unmanitasha]."

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.080
That he moves like a madcap.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.520
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.520
That means he's united with God. Is He mad?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.920
All such mad people are really mad,

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.280
they've nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.600
But there are people who believe in such things,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.680
"Oh, he is in love with God,"

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.320
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into ecstasy,

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.920
dances like a madcap.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.360
How can God be mad?

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:42.080
First position is this that the sanest personality is God,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.720
has to be.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.520
From where do the sanity comes?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.880
So this is one thing one has to understand,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.760
that any such practices

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.880
can lead you to lunacy and one should not doing.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.200
Thirdly in the indiscretion that one has

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.040
comes from people who are good hearted, nice people,

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.640
but they get kind away by the smiles of others

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.880
or by the artificial goodness they show on their faces.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.800
I've known some people, they always have a face like

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.160
as if they are all the time smiling.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.720
No, I can't do that way.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.560
All the time if you look at someone like this, you see.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.480
It means as if you are mocking at the person.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.080
And there are people I've seen who just like this

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.720
all the time have them [lips] like this.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.440
So, one should not be always in one pose.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.960
Sometimes this muscles can get very weak

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.360
and start paining if you take one.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.440
There are some others

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.480
who always try to show they are very miserable.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.440
I don't know what do they want to attract.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.560
Attract the attention of others,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.200
attract ah the bhoots in themselves

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.200
or I don't know what are they up to,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.840
why can't they keep a normal face.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.800
Even while sitting in dhaan, or meditation,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.280
I've seen that trying to show Me or may whatever it is,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.600
because My eyes are mostly closed, but doesn't matter.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.280
When I open My eyes I find some people like this, like that.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.720
Why? What is the need? You have to have a balanced face.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.840
That's what Shri Krishna had described the Sthita Pragya,

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.960
One who is balanced,

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.160
who doesn't laugh like an idiot,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.760
who laughs, but not like an idiot.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.800
Nor he's a serious like another kind of an idiot.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.880
So both the things are not at all

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.400
expression of your inner being.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.960
Such a person is, as I told you today,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.000
is not frivolous, but not serious either,

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.960
but full of joy within himself.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.760
He doesn't want you to be unhappy,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.920
never would like that you should be unhappy people.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.800
But human beings if they want to be unhappy,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.080
what can anybody help,

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.400
because they have got the free will to be unhappy.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.480
They have got a free will to cut their nose,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.640
they've a free will to cut their ears,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.320
they've a free will to commit suicide.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.120
They have this free will so-called.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.720
Now the greatest freewill comes from Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.640
as I told you and that's why we call Him Yogeshwara,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.360
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.280
The establishment of Yoga is possible

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.960
when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.160
Completely surrenders yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.960
Your Yoga will be established. Means what?

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.720
Means all your balances will be established.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.440
You go into complete balance

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.960
and that balance is complete because Vishnu,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.440
Who is the Incarnation for sustaining the dharma,

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.600
Who is responsible for giving you the balance,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.320
becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.160
That's why He said that, "You leave all the dharmas

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.640
[SOUNDS LIKE - sarva dharma nam partitte jam ma meik shana wraja]",

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.040
that's why surrender all of them to Me.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.520
So all the dharmas if you put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna,

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.440
means if you follow His ideals,

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.080
then all your dharmas are balanced.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.440
But after Realization you go beyond dharma.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.960
Whenever you go wrong in dharma,

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.520
[SOUNDS LIKE - dharmatchutta] as they call it,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.040
when you go wrong in dharma,

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.160
that's the time you have to surrender yourself to Shri Krishna,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.920
so that He establishes your dharma.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.040
There are so many dharmas.

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.280
There is the pati dharm -

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.320
husbands dharma, patni dharma - wive's dharma,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.160
father's dharma, mother's dharma, son's dharmas,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.840
the [SOUNDS LIKE - rashtra] dharma - means the nations dharma.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.600
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:29.520
of we can say ah where one has to bow

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.760
to the higher things of life.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.520
But then He says, "[SOUNDS LIKE - Sarva dharma anam pari tedg]"

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.400
"Forget all the dharmas."

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.960
"[SOUNDS LIKE-Maa meikam charanam gachchhami ]", -

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.840
"Just surrender your dharmas, all of them to Me",

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.080
that is at Vishuddhi.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.960
At Vishuddhi Chakra you surrender all your other dharmas.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.480
It means that it all gets sublimated,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.320
it all gets complete, the wholesomeness is achieved

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.960
because He is collective being,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.200
He is the Virat,

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.720
because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.760
and He is the Virata in our brain.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.520
He represents our brain.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.320
And when this Virat in us is awakened fully,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.440
then all the dharmas become natural with us.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.160
We don't have to do any dharmas,

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.760
we don't have to be conscious of any dharmas,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.920
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.880
For example, there are people now, say, Christ;

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.280
we can take example of Christ.

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.280
He was dharma personified.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.440
He would not steal money from anybody, will He?

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.240
Will He run away with somebody's wife, will He?

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.120
When He do anything wrong? No, He cannot.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.920
Why? Because He was Dharma.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.040
So now you have become dharmateet,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.080
means you have entered into the kingdom of God,

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.640
into the Virata's conditions

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.880
and there your condition is such that your state is such,

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.600
your state is such, that you are dharma.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.920
If you try to do adharma, you'll suffer.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.520
If you try to do wrong, you'll suffer.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.520
Here I don't have to tell you to be righteous;

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.800
I don't have to tell you, there's no need.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.840
I don't have to tell you that you tell the truth.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.960
I don't have to tell you, "Don't steal".

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.280
I don't have to do all these things.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.720
Only thing I can tell you

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.680
that get rid of your ego and superego, that's all.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.840
In a very general terminology.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:59.120
But you will follow Christ automatically,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.680
you will follow Krishna automatically, Sahaj,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.040
because now you have gone beyond dharma,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.600
you have crossed the limits of dharma

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.760
where you had to follow a dharma,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.120
now you have become the dharma.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.560
Where you will stand, wherever you will be

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.840
dharma will stand with you.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.640
People will look at you and say, "Here is a dharma standing,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.040
he's the dharma to be worshipped".

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.160
Not because of anything but because your state

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.560
is that of dharma, you have gone beyond that.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.480
Supposing this is loudspeaker I'm using today to talk to you.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.480
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part and parcel of Me,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.680
I don't have to use this, I go beyond it.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.120
In the same way

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.440
you are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.440
But when you go beyond dharma

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.400
into the state of Virata,

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.800
then you don't need any dharma,

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.200
you become the dharma of Virat.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.120
Now, what is the dharma of Virat,

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.240
what is the dharma of Shri Krishna

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.920
is collectivity.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.560
Krishna

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.600
is the Brain.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.920
Shiva is the Heart

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.800
and Brahmadeva is the Liver.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.960
Now what's the faculty of this brain is?

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.440
That the tree of life of evolution grows downward as He says.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.800
And this tree is growing downwards

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.360
of awareness from the brain.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.120
But if you have to go to the roots

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.720
you have to ascend and that ascent you have achieved,

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.600
now you have gone to the roots of your brain

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.360
where all your roots are enlightened,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.200
all your nerves are enlightened,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.600
your brain is enlightened,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.560
you are an enlightened person.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.880
When you are in darkness

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.840
you may catch hold of a snake as rope,

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:12.640
but when you are in light you will drop it.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.880
In the same way, when you become enlightened,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.760
your dharma is enlightened.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.120
You don't have to take to any guru

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.920
or to any book or to anyone,

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.400
you know yourself in your own life that this is wrong.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.160
Now the collectivity part of it is very important.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.960
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.280
Not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.120
Collective in the sense

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.160
that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.760
who tries to find faults with someone all the time,

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.680
wants to run away with his wife

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.680
and'll stay somewhere else or with her husband,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.920
who wants to get out, is not a person who's collective.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.600
There's no need to say

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.000
that, "I cannot live under the circumstances

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.560
in which Sahaja Yogis can live".

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.000
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if are a Yogi, you can live.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.920
Look at Me, I'm such an old woman, I can live anywhere.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.400
You take Me to a village,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.240
you take Me to any place I'm not bothered

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.080
about any physical comforts at all.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.120
Because I'm comfortable within Myself.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.480
My comforts are within.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.960
In the same way, a person who is not collective,

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.480
like many people just come to Pujas, that's all.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.120
It's like going to the church only once in Christmas

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.840
and then say, "Christ doesn't look after us".

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.600
Of course, not going to church and you don't meet Christ,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.120
but I mean to say that just to have a casual way

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.600
of Sahaja Yoga you cannot gain.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.840
You have to be collective.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.080
And collective means

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.160
that at every collective program you should be there.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.920
You should always meet collectively,

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.680
meditate collectively, live collectively,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.120
and try to find ways and methods of being collective.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.400
There are so many evil forces,

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.160
which are all the time trying to attack collectivity.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.800
First they will attack the leaders.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.440
That's the first thing.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.720
Any leader tell somebody, "You shouldn't do like this",

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.920
immediately that person will start spreading stories against,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.520
"That leader is very bad, he's like this, he's very harsh.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.720
He didn't garland me, he didn't give me this, that".

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.400
How can you garland a bhoot, can you?

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.080
That if that in that ah doesn't work out

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.720
then they have their sly methods

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.680
of going round and talking something here and there

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.000
in the ears to create some sort of a politics.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.880
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.040
As there is a centrifugal and a centripetal force,

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.520
both acting equal and opposite.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.560
Anybody who goes against collectivity,

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:58.000
who sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.000
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.640
and that's is to be remembered,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:07.600
that to be collective is to be joyous,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.240
is to be progressive, to be going further.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:16.000
It was alright when people were meditating in the Himalayas.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.760
It was alright at that time they were all alone,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.200
meditating all alone,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.120
to achieve something for the collective.

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.280
But they also did not get their Realization.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.720
When you have got your Realization remember this.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.560
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.560
into the Kingdom of Virat

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.800
where you are a part and parcel of a collective being.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.680
You are not alone, you cannot be single out,

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.720
you cannot separate yourself.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.680
Now you are awakened in the body of Virata

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.880
and you cannot get out of it.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.960
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be nourished.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.320
Supposing, I take out part of My body.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.400
Will it be nourished by this body? It won't.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.320
In the same way you have now become

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:11.800
part and parcel of that collectivity

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.120
and that collectivity that Virat is going to look after you,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.560
going to nourish you,

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.800
going to do the everything that is necessary

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.600
for your spiritual, physical, mental, emotional,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.040
even financial development.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.000
But if you cut it short, if you

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.040
try to block the collectivity,

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.120
if you try to make problems for collectivity

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.800
or even if you try just to get out of the collectivity,

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.920
then that is not our interest, that is not our work.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.320
This is to be understood fully,

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.720
in every way possible

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.840
and this when is understood in a proper way,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.680
you should know that

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.440
collectivity is not only your advancement,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.920
is not only your development,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.680
is not only your achievements,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.640
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
The purpose of your creation

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.600
is fulfilled by that.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.400
Those people who live in the ashram

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:33.200
are better of always, than the people who live alone, always.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.560
They will always have better results,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.720
than the people who live alone.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.200
Maybe they live alone

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.080
because they want to have a little private life or a privacy.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.320
But their privacy is not going to help them.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.440
That's not going to help them at all.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.320
The more we live together,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.120
the more you reside together,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.560
the more you enjoy together,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:04.080
there will be greater chances of your advancement.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.080
The more you will try to make yourself private,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.960
the more you'll try to get out of it,

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.440
whatever explanation you may give,

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.000
God understands, very well.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.560
So all such things where you cut off yourself

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.240
from the mainstream,

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.160
you try to get out of the main stream,

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:25.920
then there is a big problem for you.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.240
Of course, for certain conveniences you may,

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.720
for your certain understanding you may,

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.560
but you should enjoy more the company of Sahaja Yogis,

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.960
than your own private company

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.360
in the dingy room of yours.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.560
That is one thing you can judge yourself.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.640
Do you all enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.160
or you enjoy the company

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.400
of three-four of your family people together in a circus.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.960
Judgment is your own.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.240
Yogi "A difficulty Shri Mataji".

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.400
Nothing is difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.960
It is the simplest thing to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.360
And even more simple to be collective.

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:17.440
To be uncollective you have to do something.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:21.000
Like I said that it is very easy not to drink.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.720
Mean, I mean, drink some wines and things.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.480
Because if you don't want to drink you are sitting at home,

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.000
it's alright, don't have to do anything.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.520
But supposing you have to drink,

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.200
then you have to go a pub or you have to go somebody,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.920
open the bottle, get a particular type of a glass,

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.200
pour it down, this, that.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.400
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.200
you are sitting with a fright.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.400
But for a person who just drinks water he doesn't have to do it.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.120
So to do wrong one has to do something.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.440
But to be good you don't have to do much.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.120
Is absolutely labor saving, energy saving process

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.640
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see,

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.480
I ah want to harm somebody,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.320
I'll have to go out of the way to find out ways, methods.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.280
If I to tell lies I have to think of ten lies to cover that one lie.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.720
But if I tell the truth, finished,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.040
I am still I've told the truth, finished, with few words it's done.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.800
So to be collective is much more easier.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.440
Of course, not for crooked people,

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.600
because crooked people whenever they move

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.120
their angularities trouble others.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.120
You see, like ah ah poking ah of thorns.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.080
But those who are flowers they fitting anywhere,

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.080
people like them.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.360
They like their fragrance,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.360
they look at them, they enjoy them beautiful things.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:57.880
Now see, today they are looking like lotuses.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.000
How is it? Without doing anything they have become lotuses.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.880
How? How they have become like lotuses?

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.240
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies God only knows.

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:15.320
But they have become lotuses Sahaj.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.040
How? Because they are one with God.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.680
When we stand in our own way,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.680
when we try to do something privately,

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.520
then God said, "Alright, go private'.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.440
But when we are public He looks after us.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.480
And then in Sahaj Yoga, as you know,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.360
that collective growth

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:51.280
is the only way we understand Sahaj Yoga.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.520
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something else,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.720
somebody knows something else.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.120
When we are collective,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.440
then we really understand every aspect of Sahaj Yoga.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.040
Supposing, there is somebody a scientist,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.800
somebody is a musician,

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.360
somebody is another thing.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.280
We cannot know everything.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.040
So you know something from this one,

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.320
something from that one,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.760
something from that.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.120
So all the rivers has it's flowing into that collectivity

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:22.240
and you enjoy the ocean of these ah rivers.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.480
You don't have to go to all the rivers in India,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.600
like you go from Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Kaweri

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.960
you thousands of lives.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.360
Go to the sea, all of them are there.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.320
Like that you have to enjoy the sea where everything meets.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:48.520
All kinds of beautiful things are there and you enjoy that.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:53.040
I hope this Puja which is a very remarkable Puja.

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.360
Firstly so many things are Sahaj.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.600
Firstly they told Me

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.520
the telephone number of this place is 32 16 32.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:10.800
He, He's accompanied by 64 Yoginis, Shri Krishna.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.640
So 32 on this side and 32 on that side and He sitting here

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.760
This place is called as Black ah Lake.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.000
Krishna is black.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.360
This place they got suddenly

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.680
and this is the only place in this

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.240
so-called military regime of Switzerland

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.800
where people can sleep on the ground.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.000
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.640
If there's no cot you hang in the

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.920
air, but you cannot touch the ground.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.040
That kind of the stupid military business is here.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:52.280
Where to find such a sensible, practical,

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.320
such a cheap place for you is godsent.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.080
We are here surrounded by beautiful things with the cows,

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:06.280
so many cows at the time when it is Krishna's birthday.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.360
So many cows, so fond of cows

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.760
and the cows when they their bells

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.040
move in the morning I heard, in the evening so beautiful

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.880
and when they are moving home in the evening

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.480
how the as they call [SOUNDS LIKE -guraj] -

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.680
is the dust of their feet was filling the sky

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.400
is just Gokul here I felt.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.240
Today also there's one thing more one has to say,

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:36.120
that is the sixteenth Shri Krishna Puja.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.720
So in so many ways this is a very great Puja

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.600
which you are attending for which

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:50.400
people have to take thousands and thousands of janmas (births)

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.080
do so many punyas, which you have got so Sahaj,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.960
because there must be something about you people also.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.440
May God bless you.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:33.160
Now, what are we decided?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.440
Now they have got ah mantras

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.920
written in Sanskrit that

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.160
and 108 Names of Shri Krishna [NOT AUDIBLE] they got.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.720
The one, one Rustam has done them in Sanskrit

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.640
and Gregoire has done them in.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.920
I think everybody's hearing Me, aren't you?

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.520
And Gregoire has because you have to hear Me from Sahastrara,

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.920
you can.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.880
And Gregoire has done in English language.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:16.040
So we'll have

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.840
two types of Sanskrit and English words,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.440
describing Shri Krishna's nature.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.040
"Now today let the all the Sagittarius to [INAUDIBLE- My Puja?].

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:29.120
It's Krisna's rashi Sagittarius, [SOUNDS LIKE - nurtaras].

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.760
Sagittarius, how many you are? Come along.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.040
"Dhanur dhara - that is one of the Names of Shri Krishna ...

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:37.680
[A FEW INDIAN WORDS] or Madhusudana."
