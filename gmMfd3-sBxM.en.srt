1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:03,357
Talk before award in Turkey at Diwali Puja

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:06,397
After two minutes,

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:10,419
professor Voronov is here

4
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:14,793
and he wants to give Me some special award

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:18,208
from St Petersburg University.

6
00:00:18,473 --> 00:00:23,229
So, I will request you all to be sitted,

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,425
it will take hardly ten minues
 for the whole thing.

8
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:35,864
So, before that, I must say the

9
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:39,865
weddings went off very well despite the fact

10
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:43,464
it’s Turkey and it’s very different

11
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,915
from India where you can get everything very easily.

12
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,453
And you all are looking very happy.

13
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,235
Keep this joy all the time

14
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:01,955
and be kind and gentle with each other.

15
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:04,943
As I’ve said you have to soothe others.

16
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:10,561
You have to take up the problems of each other

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:14,905
and don’t discuss your past, 
don’t talk about your past.

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,981
That’s one thing very wrong,

19
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:22,142
that makes life unnecessarily miserable.

20
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:29,200
Past is over and, now, 
the reality starts.

21
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:34,687
Enjoy each other’s company,
 try to find good points of

22
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,725
another person.

23
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:42,259
If you want to find bad points

24
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,415
that’s not going to give you any joy,
 it’s not going to help you.

25
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,372
But if you start finding 
the good points of another person,

26
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:55,561
that not only that you will be very happy,

27
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:59,729
but also you’ll imbibe those good points.

28
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:04,625
Always try to see each other’s good points,

29
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:08,653
never criticize each other for small things,

30
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:12,060
for petty things. 
We are Sahaja Yogis.

31
00:02:12,264 --> 00:02:15,128
We are saints, we are angels,

32
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:19,607
we cannot be like ordinary 
stupid people who fight

33
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,286
and create problems in their life.

34
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,584
We are here to make each other happy

35
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:29,816
and to make everyone happy;

36
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:32,361
all the Sahaja Yogis to be happy.

37
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,689
The whole society of Sahaja Yoga

38
00:02:34,714 --> 00:02:37,938
 should be of a very different type.

39
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:42,228
And there are so many children 
who are Realized souls,

40
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:46,090
who are great saints, 
seers, who want to be born

41
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:51,864
and they’ll be only born to Sahaja Yogis who are

42
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:58,037
Sahaj by temperament

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,805
and who are peaceful,

44
00:03:01,853 --> 00:03:05,514
who try to seek peace everywhere,

45
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,868
and who are very large hearted.

46
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,903
All such people will have very great children.

47
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:16,976
May God bless you all.
