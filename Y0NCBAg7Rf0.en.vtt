00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Talk before Havan after the Bhoomi Puja
1982-07-12, UK

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:03.051
...was negative or

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:05.691
he was trying to do something absurd  and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:17.464
or whether he was influenced by someone

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.032
 or he was himself a very bad man .

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:21.976
Everything becomes so clear-cut.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.407
You start understanding every sort of an action

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:30.445
in a proper light and by that you understand what

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.249
what is the problem

00:01:32.263 --> 00:01:34.609
and how it should be attacked.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:41.372
Now, you see, how people are identified

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:43.644
with wrong type of people

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:46.902
and how they start acting

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:50.421
with that identification becomes very obvious.

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:55.375
For example, there is Mr. X who is a negative person.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.942
Now there are some people who are identified with that person.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.717
They are more identified with negativity

00:02:03.742 --> 00:02:10.610
than with their own emancipation, their own Realization.

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:12.989
So suddenly you find

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.042
that if you ask that negative person not to come in

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:19.901
you find all the rest who are attached to them are missing.

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:26.476
Actually, they should come very much for the Puja; is very important.

00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:29.820
They should work it out; that’s so essential.

00:02:29.827 --> 00:02:32.015
They have nothing to do with the third person

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.391
who has not given them any Realization, has nothing to do, has nothing common.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:43.084
And if he is stopped from coming it is because there is some problem with him.

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:45.363
But suddenly what you find that some people

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.846
who are attached to that,

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:51.504
that negativity of that person, just stop coming.

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:56.495
Now, suddenly then what you discover that

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.005
in that light you see that how some people

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.118
whom we thought were very good,

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:06.246
were very good Sahaja Yogis, were deeper Sahaja Yogis, are not.

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:10.087
They are still impressed by the negative persons.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:13.798
So we can see that Sahaja Yogis get their light.

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:18.285
Now they are not much impressed by the outward things like

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:26.745
money or any position or any appearance, superficial things as they call it.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.766
I mean, they go definitely deeper.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:35.313
But then there is another subtler type of attraction

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.986
they have and that is this negative force

00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.305
for which we should be very careful.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.355
If somebody is negative, you find him a negative,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.453
if it is said that such a negative person has to not to come.

00:03:46.473 --> 00:03:50.628
He has to go away from the organization for the time being.

00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:53.497
 He has to keep away, to keep the organization healthy

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:56.198
and allow that person to recover.

00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:57.718
Like the tuberculosis.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:03:59.588
You see, when somebody has tuberculosis

00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:00.588
what do we do?

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:04.090
We tell the people who have tuberculosis

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:07.095
to separate themselves from the rest of the people,

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.761
get well and then they can come back.

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:13.625
In the same way if somebody is told like that,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.230
 “You are just now in the negative force

00:04:17.255 --> 00:04:19.547
and if you come more you will become a medium,”

00:04:19.572 --> 00:04:22.764
that person may be sensible enough not to come

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:27.324
but the people who are negative will get attached

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.428
to that person and this is a very subtle attraction

00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:34.014
that Sahaja Yogis have among themselves,

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.451
which so subtle that you can’t imagine.

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.332
For example, one A person gives you Realization.

00:04:40.353 --> 00:04:42.233
You are a B person.

00:04:42.247 --> 00:04:44.097
Now he’s not your guru.

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:45.783
He has given you Realization

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.465
because he becomes the instrument of God

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.522
but he is not your guru in any way.

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:54.012
Now the same person who has given you Realization

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.462
might be a negative person, might turn out to be negative,

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:58.073
later on may get spoilt.

00:04:58.094 --> 00:04:59.819
But doesn’t mean that even if he gets spoilt

00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:01.874
again still you continue with him.

00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:04.231
But these are such subtle things, you know,

00:05:04.256 --> 00:05:06.495
that bind you to another person.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:08.795
So this is the best way to judge,

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.650
that whether anybody drops out or not,

00:05:11.675 --> 00:05:13.196
anybody comes in or not,

00:05:13.213 --> 00:05:16.972
on your own how far you are going to benefit,

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.714
what is your interest in this matter

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:23.055
and this is how you should judge yourself.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:25.405
To judge yourself, as I have told you,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.600
relationship should be of perfection

00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:32.702
that you should perfect yourself because if you have to

00:05:32.727 --> 00:05:34.814
offer something to God,

00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.658
if you have get something connected to God that

00:05:37.683 --> 00:05:39.586
instrument should be perfect.

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.121
So the attitude towards yourself has to be of perfection.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:46.791
But on the contrary the imperfections of others

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:48.688
are more attractive.

00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:51.388
You run to that person because he’s imperfect.

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.478
You start sort of thinking yo must say,

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:55.586
you must help, how can you get it out.

00:05:55.611 --> 00:05:56.913
That’s not your job.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.134
That’s My look-out.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.872
I can work it out Myself.

00:05:59.897 --> 00:06:02.262
You don’t have to run after a person

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.368
who has been discarded just now by Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:05.393 --> 00:06:08.753
I’m looking after him much more than I’m looking after you.

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:12.901
So you don’t have to bother but you keep to the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.918
collectivity, you keep to the sangha, you keep

00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:21.180
with the collective personality

00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:25.537
because he will be lost with that person as he is lost.

00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:28.622
And apart from that My attention will be diverted

00:06:28.647 --> 00:06:30.440
because I’ll think this person

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.170
has such negativity that he’s attracting other people to himself

00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:36.564
so I’ll just forget it.

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:39.186
So in any way you are not helping that person

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:41.536
and you are not helping yourself.

00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.073
Now, one must understand as you get subtler and subtler

00:06:45.098 --> 00:06:47.510
there is always an attack of negativity

00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:50.962
in you which is subtler and which you can feel it also.

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:56.185
So always keep yourself detaching yourself from negativity.

00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:00.815
People are very busy detaching the negativity of other people.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.834
Never bother about their own negative things.

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:05.133
You always give explanations.

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.040
Now you have to perfect yourself.

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:09.533
I hope you understand this simple statement

00:07:09.558 --> 00:07:13.772
that the attitude towards yourself should be of perfection.

00:07:13.797 --> 00:07:16.100
Now I’ve told you also that your attitude

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:21.199
towards others should be of ideal nature or purity nature.

00:07:21.224 --> 00:07:24.314
Like whatever relationship you have another person

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.079
you must keep it in complete purity.

00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:29.636
Like a wife is a wife, husband is a husband, Sahaja Yogi is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:32.282
Now a Sahaja Yogi who is been discarded

00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:35.785
by the collective being is nothing of yours.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.320
Is just finished for you, for the time being.

00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:40.679
Because that is the time you are not to support.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.188
How much are you going to support?

00:07:43.213 --> 00:07:45.654
What can you do about? Just forget him.

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:47.982
By forgetting him you have been kind to him,

00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:49.322
you have been kind to yourself.

00:07:49.342 --> 00:07:52.640
But by trying to be nice to him and by good to him

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:55.360
and trying to share it with him, you are sharing nothing

00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:58.417
but bhoots and you are including his bhoots also.

00:07:58.432 --> 00:08:00.085
He becomes a medium.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.102
Next time you’ll find the same fellow will become medium.

00:08:03.127 --> 00:08:05.407
Now those people who have not come today,

00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:07.758
you better go and wonder. 
This you should not do

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.546
because you’ll make a medium out of that

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.186
person and ruin all chances of his coming up

00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:16.449
and this is not the way to oblige a Sahaja Yogi who is left out.

00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:23.065
Now the third thing I would say that our relationship

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.310
with the sangha, with the collectivity, how should it be?

00:08:26.335 --> 00:08:29.394
How should we deal with the society of Sahaja Yogis?

00:08:29.419 --> 00:08:32.051
I deal it that way and you should deal the same way.

00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:34.999
And that is a very simple way, is pragmatic.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.405
If you remember when I started Sahaja Yoga in this country

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:44.008
I was doing one some sort of a thing, another type of meditation.

00:08:44.033 --> 00:08:48.842
If you ask Gavin he might be able give you the history of My changing positions.

00:08:48.867 --> 00:08:51.221
First I said, “Try this.” Then it worked out.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.211
Then I said, “Try that.” Then that worked out.

00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:56.702
I said, “Try this.” All kinds of things I have tried with you people.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.961
In the same way a society is not bound by any roots

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:01.703
and regulations at all.

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:04.717
It is how much it has achieved by one.

00:09:04.742 --> 00:09:06.303
Try vegetarianism. All right,

00:09:06.328 --> 00:09:09.161
works out well and good. Otherwise forget it.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.431
Try liver treatment.

00:09:11.445 --> 00:09:13.021
Done, finished.

00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:17.896
Nothing you should get attached to, in any system for the society.

00:09:17.921 --> 00:09:19.697
This is what is pragmatic.

00:09:19.722 --> 00:09:23.314
Means attachment for what?

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:27.033
It is for after all achieving something in you.

00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:30.174
What do you achieve by any attachment you should see.

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:32.743
Rules, regulations, all right, up to a point.

00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:34.751
Otherwise, throw them away.

00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:37.281
If they are anti-God better throw them away.

00:09:37.306 --> 00:09:40.093
So one should develop that much adjustment

00:09:40.118 --> 00:09:42.120
that’s I would say is the best way.

00:09:42.145 --> 00:09:44.130
You can call a Sahaja Yogi administrator

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.716
who knows at what to adjust back.

00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.518
When it is necessary all right we can be very strict.

00:09:49.543 --> 00:09:51.920
When it is necessary we can be very joyous.

00:09:51.945 --> 00:09:54.623
When it is necessary we can be absolutely loose,

00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:57.574
no rules and regulations. 
That’s how we should be,

00:09:57.599 --> 00:09:59.939
because that has to be pragmatic.

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:02.416
Now, I hope it is clear-cut to you

00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:05.342
and tell all the people who have not come today

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:07.062
also that you, they have,

00:10:07.087 --> 00:10:10.706
if they have stayed back because of some sort of a sympathy

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:11.796
it’s very wrong.

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:15.533
That shows that they have not understood the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:18.244
In Sahaja Yoga nobody is discarded.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:22.321
Those who are discarded are also for the good of the whole

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:24.336
 and for the good of an individual.

00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:27.988
Once the individual gets all right again he comes back as a good person.

00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:30.376
So nobody is discarded by your Mother.

00:10:30.401 --> 00:10:32.491
Once you are My child, you are My child.

00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:34.852
But you don’t worry about the people like that.

00:10:34.877 --> 00:10:37.781
Otherwise is going to be very dangerous for you

00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:40.304
and very dangerous for the other person.

00:10:42.888 --> 00:10:46.288
I think for today that’s one of the essential things

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:48.241
one has to know and

00:10:48.266 --> 00:10:51.430
even if you have come from any source to Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:51.444 --> 00:10:53.830
makes no difference – it can cleanse you –

00:10:53.855 --> 00:10:59.242
but you must work it out yourself to perfect yourself.

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:02.397
Now you put yourself in juxtaposition

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:05.834
to your being and say that, “I have to correct myself.

00:11:05.859 --> 00:11:08.606
I have to perfect myself. 
I have to do it.

00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:12.822
Who am I to ask others to correct me?

00:11:12.847 --> 00:11:14.393
Why shouldn’t I correct myself?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.546
I should correct myself.” 
But it is the other way round.

00:11:16.572 --> 00:11:18.705
If somebody says, “This is wrong with you,” you sit there,

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.536
get angry, isn’t it? “All right,

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:22.577
I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

00:11:22.585 --> 00:11:24.677
It doesn’t mean you can’t correct yourself.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.532
It doesn’t mean that others can’t correct you.

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:29.391
It doesn’t mean that. 
You see, each is not similar.

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:32.535
What it means that you should assert yourself

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.500
fully to correct yourself and somebody helps you,

00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:37.675
you should thank that person.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.537
I mean, supposing I’m trying to take a load

00:11:40.562 --> 00:11:44.075
somewhere and somebody helps you

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.628
to take that load, why should you be angry?

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:50.842
It’s something very simple.

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:54.937
So one should not be angry with somebody who wants to help.

00:11:54.957 --> 00:11:58.525
But in all wisdom I think it’s better not to help much

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.668
because you’ll be boxed in your nose, you see.

00:12:06.332 --> 00:12:10.381
It’s better to allow them to correct themselves.

00:12:10.406 --> 00:12:13.462
It’s not easy in this world to correct anyone.

00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:15.791
It’s rather a funny world, you know.

00:12:15.816 --> 00:12:18.291
So unless and until you have the tact of your Mother,

00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:19.526
better don’t try such tricks.

00:12:19.551 --> 00:12:22.619
I don’t want your black eyes.

00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:28.149
It’s a funny situation.

00:12:28.174 --> 00:12:30.648
 So let them bear their own load, take it out,

00:12:30.673 --> 00:12:33.226
let them clear out. It’s better.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.236
But I’m rather amazed that

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.155
there are some people about whom

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.474
I was expecting them to be here, they are not here.

00:12:42.668 --> 00:12:43.847
All right,

00:12:43.872 --> 00:12:48.148
let us now have the Havana,

00:12:48.173 --> 00:12:54.042
finish it off; then 
we can have our lunch.

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:55.886
Can you take these things?
