00:29.118 --> 00:39.808
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis, and all the
seekers of truth, may God bless you all.

00:39.808 --> 00:48.718
Is such a great thing to be back home with
all of you and to see you here blooming with

00:48.718 --> 00:52.157
joy and happiness.

00:52.157 --> 00:58.468
That's the fate of a Mother who has so many
children, that she goes from places to places

00:58.468 --> 01:02.468
leaving some children behind but looking forward
to meeting others.

01:02.468 --> 01:08.118
Somehow that compensates for the separation.

01:08.118 --> 01:17.148
Today I think we should start on a very subtler
ideas about Sahaja Yoga, because you people

01:17.148 --> 01:23.998
have understood it on the other plane of mechanism
that works it out, the Kundalini, the chakras

01:23.998 --> 01:26.278
and all those things.

01:26.278 --> 01:32.678
But we have to see what is the problem that
faces actually human beings and why we make

01:32.678 --> 01:35.508
such mistakes in our seeking.

01:35.508 --> 01:41.758
Is a very important thing to understand, because
unless and until we understand why we really

01:41.758 --> 01:47.858
make mistakes or others make mistakes we can
never forgive them, and we might have a kind

01:47.858 --> 01:56.278
of a high handed attitude towards others who
are now coming to Sahaja Yoga, thinking that,

01:56.278 --> 02:02.158
why did they do like that, and why did they
commit this mistake and they could have done

02:02.158 --> 02:03.158
better.

02:03.158 --> 02:10.728
But I personally think that if you look at
yourself you will know that you also committed

02:10.728 --> 02:11.728
mistakes.

02:11.728 --> 02:13.028
Everybody has committed mistakes.

02:13.028 --> 02:16.788
Some have committed more mistakes, and some
have committed less.

02:16.788 --> 02:22.028
But what is the reason why human being has
been committing mistake?

02:22.028 --> 02:24.568
That's what we should look into it.

02:24.568 --> 02:27.488
The first and foremost thing is without getting
-

02:27.488 --> 02:35.938
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: Come along here
you can sit there is a lot of space here,

02:35.938 --> 02:38.017
come along.

02:38.017 --> 02:42.107
Move out, move out you can sit in the center,
come along, come along, come along not to

02:42.107 --> 02:43.338
feel shy there's lot of space in here.

02:43.338 --> 02:48.347
I think you'll have to have a bigger hall
now Matha?

02:48.347 --> 02:57.127
Yes come along, come there's room here you
can sit down here, come along.

02:57.127 --> 02:59.638
So sweet of you.

02:59.638 --> 03:04.898
Thank you very much, so very kind of you thank
you, thank you.

03:04.898 --> 03:06.858
Please make yourself comfortable come along.

03:06.858 --> 03:09.047
So how are you?

03:09.047 --> 03:12.688
Congratulations and God Bless.

03:12.688 --> 03:19.008
Are you all right there all of you?)

03:19.008 --> 03:27.118
Now those who have got Realization and those
who have felt the cool breeze and have matured

03:27.118 --> 03:35.487
in Sahaja Yoga know that automatically you
drop out many things, automatically.

03:35.487 --> 03:39.177
Now why do we do it, you see, why do we drop
things?

03:39.177 --> 03:45.308
Even I don't ask you for it, you just drop
them, why?

03:45.308 --> 03:52.717
The reason is the light of the Spirit within
ourselves empowers us to see that this is

03:52.717 --> 03:53.948
wrong.

03:53.948 --> 04:02.567
Like as we have got eyes, once we have eyes
we know whether we are going to fall here,

04:02.567 --> 04:05.607
or we are going to slip, or what's going to
happen.

04:05.607 --> 04:10.938
In the same way, when you get this vibratory
awareness it is not an awareness only of the

04:10.938 --> 04:17.957
fingers, is the awareness of the whole being
and you just drop out everything that is against

04:17.957 --> 04:19.097
your Spirit.

04:19.097 --> 04:23.258
I don't have to tell you.

04:23.258 --> 04:32.067
But without Self-Realization what happens
that reality is just a myth.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.877
It's only a mental projection with which you
live.

04:34.877 --> 04:37.267
You project your mind and you think this is
reality.

04:37.267 --> 04:40.857
You can call anything as reality.

04:40.857 --> 04:47.574
Any hallucination can be a reality, any theory
can be a reality, any absurd ideas could be

04:47.599 --> 04:48.242
a reality.

04:48.267 --> 04:53.107
I mean all religions have taken that form
now, it's very sad.

04:53.107 --> 05:00.118
But all religions, which came from truth and
from reality, are nothing but mental projections,

05:00.118 --> 05:03.637
and they're very far away from reality.

05:03.637 --> 05:11.339
You can only feel, understand and assimilate
reality if you are a self-realized person.

05:11.489 --> 05:18.328
Unless and until this Self has expressed itself
or manifested within yourself, the light has

05:18.328 --> 05:22.298
come into you, how are you to manage?

05:22.298 --> 05:24.328
Whatever you try is a mental projection.

05:24.328 --> 05:28.298
Like many people who came first, "Oh, we believe
that we are born again."

05:28.298 --> 05:32.697
All right, now how can you challenge it, if
you believe into something?

05:32.697 --> 05:36.128
"I believe" is the one of the great sentences
we use.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.372
But what is that I that believes?

05:38.397 --> 05:40.043
That's that ego.

05:40.249 --> 05:44.597
That's not your Self, because you have not
yet felt the Self.

05:44.597 --> 05:50.218
So to feel the Self is the most important
thing if you have to know the reality.

05:50.218 --> 05:56.347
So you must excuse all others who have not
felt the Self, who have their own mental projections.

05:56.347 --> 05:59.718
They might look like fanatic; they might look
like stupid people.

05:59.718 --> 06:05.847
They may look like to be very high handed
or maybe you might think they are these ego

06:05.847 --> 06:09.428
orientated pseudo-intellectuals and all sorts
of things.

06:09.428 --> 06:16.174
But all that is mythical because that plane
on which they move is mythical itself.

06:16.396 --> 06:22.878
Whatever you know through your mental projection
is imagination itself.

06:22.878 --> 06:29.248
But Spirit is the reality, and to know the
reality you have to be the Spirit.

06:29.248 --> 06:38.080
And once the Spirit starts shining within
you, you just drop everything like hot brick.

06:38.167 --> 06:44.068
Like I would say, as I've many times told
you, that in our human awareness we know what

06:44.068 --> 06:47.347
is beauty is, we know what cleanliness is.

06:47.372 --> 06:50.730
For a dog he doesn't understand cleanliness.

06:50.755 --> 06:58.037
If you don't give him a bath he'll be quite
happy, actually to give him a bath is a problem.

06:58.037 --> 07:02.578
But to a human being, you see, what is a sin
or what is wrong?

07:02.578 --> 07:08.887
Sin is nothing but whatever is against the
Spirit, is sin.

07:08.887 --> 07:14.127
Even fear is a sin.

07:14.127 --> 07:22.428
Any such small little sins or the big sins,
all are nothing, but they are all against

07:22.428 --> 07:24.928
the Spirit.

07:24.928 --> 07:32.062
But if you have not felt the Spirit whatever
you do will amount to something like anti-Spirit,

07:32.087 --> 07:35.058
because you don't know what you are doing.

07:35.058 --> 07:40.528
Now the prophets have tried their level best
to tell you that you must keep your balance,

07:40.528 --> 07:49.678
you have to follow a certain religion as they
call it, or as we call it dharma within yourself.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.387
But that to for what?

07:52.387 --> 07:54.817
Why to have the balance within you?

07:54.817 --> 07:58.778
People will always say, "What's wrong?"

07:58.778 --> 08:01.717
"What's wrong if we are not in balance, what's
there?

08:01.717 --> 08:02.967
What's wrong in drinking?"

08:02.967 --> 08:05.148
I never said don't drink before Realization.

08:05.148 --> 08:08.018
After Realization you yourself drop out.

08:08.018 --> 08:10.248
But they say, "What's wrong, why does he tell
us like this?

08:10.248 --> 08:14.997
Why should we listen to them?"

08:14.997 --> 08:15.997
Why the balance?

08:15.997 --> 08:19.338
The balance is needed for the ascent.

08:19.338 --> 08:23.738
Unless and until you have a balance how will
you ascend?

08:23.738 --> 08:25.988
Imagine an aeroplane without any balance.

08:25.988 --> 08:32.097
Say a wing is missing, will it be able to
take off from the ground, cannot.

08:32.097 --> 08:36.477
So for the ascent it is necessary to have
the necessary balance.

08:36.477 --> 08:38.658
So they said, "Keep in the balance."

08:38.658 --> 08:47.268
But even when we're just told simple thing
to keep to the central path, to lead a life

08:47.268 --> 08:57.538
of balancing yourself or moderation in your
life, in that also the moderation part of

08:57.538 --> 09:01.668
it they have made it an extreme.

09:01.668 --> 09:07.638
Everything has been made into an extreme,
because religion also they want to follow

09:07.638 --> 09:09.528
through their mental conception.

09:09.528 --> 09:12.678
That's why you find all these religions is
a mess.

09:12.678 --> 09:17.898
But I would not blame them for that because
they had no other instrument to go ahead,

09:17.898 --> 09:19.728
and they wanted to go ahead.

09:19.728 --> 09:25.218
They had no other way to proceed further so
they used only one engine they had was this

09:25.218 --> 09:26.218
mental projection.

09:26.218 --> 09:32.608
And they made all these various projections
and that's how they are so diversified and

09:32.608 --> 09:34.848
separated from each other.

09:34.848 --> 09:45.698
But as soon as your Spirit shines, then, everything
drops out by itself because it is beyond mind.

09:45.698 --> 09:53.698
Spirit is beyond mind, I don't have to tell
you anything that you must have balance, you

09:53.698 --> 09:55.208
develop a balance.

09:55.208 --> 09:59.738
If you don't have a balance you'll just get
vibrations in one hand, other hand will be

09:59.738 --> 10:03.228
just cold or will be hot, so you start giving
your balance.

10:03.228 --> 10:08.349
But I don't say that give a balance means
following a particular religion or anything

10:08.349 --> 10:14.918
because if I say that half of you may run
away.

10:14.918 --> 10:28.748
The beauty of Self-Realization lies in secretly
working out within you, everything that is

10:28.748 --> 10:36.743
virtuous, that is beautiful, that is joyful,
secretly, it doesn't tell you.

10:36.768 --> 10:41.818
For example now supposing somebody has an
imbalance on the right hand side.

10:41.818 --> 10:48.478
Very intellectual fellow, and thinking for
the future and futuristic man you see, forgetting

10:48.478 --> 10:50.178
all his past.

10:50.178 --> 10:53.828
Even there are people I've known they have
forgotten their names, and the names of their

10:53.828 --> 10:55.218
wives.

10:55.218 --> 10:58.648
But they are so futuristic.

10:58.648 --> 11:03.628
For such a person if you tell them don't think
about the future, he can't do it because he's

11:03.628 --> 11:05.098
put his attention like this.

11:05.098 --> 11:10.748
The whole ego portion has gone that side and
he's all looking forward to the future.

11:10.748 --> 11:19.158
But if you put him somehow or other, in a
state where his Self-Realization takes place

11:19.158 --> 11:24.668
then immediately he will say, "Mother, my
right hand is burning and there's nothing

11:24.668 --> 11:25.808
in the left hand."

11:25.808 --> 11:32.838
So you start talking on a very mundane way,
not in a very subtle manner like all the philosophers

11:32.838 --> 11:33.838
talk.

11:33.838 --> 11:38.070
All right that means your right is not getting
proper vibrations, so you raise your left

11:38.095 --> 11:39.229
to the right?

11:39.254 --> 11:44.956
Now for an intellectual he can't understand,
"What is this raising left to the right.

11:44.981 --> 11:49.078
I have read Bhagavad-Gita, I have read Bible,
I've done Koran, I have done this, nowhere

11:49.078 --> 11:50.078
written left to the right.

11:50.078 --> 11:52.947
What do you mean by this kind of a nonsense,
you see that you have to put your hand just

11:52.972 --> 11:57.188
left to the right and you get the balance?"

11:57.188 --> 12:05.548
I cannot appeal to a mind which has been thinking
about God, religion, everything, all right.

12:05.548 --> 12:12.908
So the secretive working of the Kundalini
is such, that She goes in that portion where

12:12.908 --> 12:13.908
you need help.

12:13.908 --> 12:22.008
She works it out and She raises you and gradually
She transforms you.

12:22.008 --> 12:30.548
But if it is not awakened, if it has not yet
touched the Sahasrara, means if it has not

12:30.548 --> 12:40.645
touched the feet of your Spirit, it may not
be interested, it may not be interested.

12:40.670 --> 12:47.368
So the first and foremost thing is to raise
the Kundalini, and to let Her at least once

12:47.368 --> 12:50.108
know that She has touched the Spirit.

12:50.108 --> 12:55.608
Then She has interest, otherwise She hasn't
got any interest.

12:55.608 --> 13:00.728
That's why you must have seen some people
who come to Sahaja Yoga and just drop out.

13:00.728 --> 13:04.458
The reason is the Kundalini Itself is not
interested.

13:04.458 --> 13:12.108
So the foremost duty of every Sahaja Yogi
is, first of all, not to be angry or annoyed

13:12.108 --> 13:15.828
with people who have done lots of wrong.

13:15.828 --> 13:21.183
But be very kind to them and gentle because
they are just seekers of truth.

13:21.212 --> 13:23.444
How can you be angry with them?

13:23.469 --> 13:27.412
Already we have lost so many of them because
of their stupidity.

13:27.451 --> 13:30.728
But we must try to salvage as many as possible.

13:30.728 --> 13:38.518
And then the second duty of every Sahaja Yogi
is to slowly steadily to convince the person

13:38.518 --> 13:40.656
that he should become the Spirit.

13:40.681 --> 13:44.288
Of course you'll meet so many who will be
self-appointed people they'll say, "Oh, I've

13:44.288 --> 13:46.865
already met the Spirit, I am the Spirit.

13:46.890 --> 13:47.890
I'm Christ."

13:48.147 --> 13:55.501
They can say anything, so soothe them down
a little, bring them down and raise their

13:55.526 --> 14:00.239
Kundalini, but don't leave it half way, must
touch the Sahasrara.

14:00.264 --> 14:04.898
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, even
in India I've seen, they just give up.

14:04.898 --> 14:09.208
They'll sit down, "Oh Mother forget it, we
don't want to do it, it's like a mountain

14:09.208 --> 14:10.408
we can't raise it."

14:10.408 --> 14:15.508
But we have to work, that's what we have to
do is to work it out.

14:15.508 --> 14:21.771
Raise the Kundalini, pierce through the Sahasrara,
and then Kundalini will work it out.

14:21.796 --> 14:25.948
It was a question asked to Me, "Mother that
we gave Realization to so many people, out

14:25.948 --> 14:30.101
of that only about thirty percent people are
coming up the rest are lost."

14:30.126 --> 14:35.738
The reason is you have left it half done.

14:35.738 --> 14:44.288
So this is one of the reasons why we have
lost some people and there is no connection

14:44.288 --> 14:45.288
still established.

14:45.288 --> 14:52.017
Now those people who come to Sahaja Yoga you
have to really work hard on them.

14:52.042 --> 14:55.586
Instead of arguing with them, because what
will you argue is all mental projection.

14:55.611 --> 15:00.338
On what point are you going to argue with
them because that is not going to give them

15:00.338 --> 15:01.942
the light of the Spirit.

15:02.140 --> 15:07.815
So somehow or other work it out in such a
way that they feel light of the Spirit, then

15:07.840 --> 15:08.840
talk.

15:08.965 --> 15:14.828
But we think that if we talk to them it will
help.

15:14.828 --> 15:21.834
It's not question of conviction, is the question
of happening, is question of becoming, which

15:21.859 --> 15:23.051
is important.

15:23.153 --> 15:28.668
Unless and until they become, what is the
use of argument, there's no law court here.

15:28.668 --> 15:31.008
There is no debate going on, there is no election.

15:31.008 --> 15:36.638
There's nothing of the kind, it is something
that has to happen to all those people that

15:36.638 --> 15:41.506
they should get their light of their Spirit.

15:41.569 --> 15:48.152
And once they get it, then it is very much
easier for you to talk to them and tell them

15:48.177 --> 15:49.152
about it.

15:51.733 --> 15:55.978
The
philosophy of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple.

15:56.003 --> 16:01.013
Is the simplest of all philosophy you can
think of.

16:01.179 --> 16:07.718
Is a very simple philosophy, is that, once
you get your Realization you start feeling

16:07.718 --> 16:13.828
for the first time, the All Pervading Power
and forget everything else.

16:13.828 --> 16:20.018
Once you get that feeling of the All Pervading
Power only you have know how to maneuver it,

16:20.018 --> 16:25.388
how to work it out and how to use it for your
own growth.

16:25.388 --> 16:34.888
It is made easy, it has to be as it is the
most vital force that has to take place in

16:34.888 --> 16:37.044
the realm of spirituality.

16:37.346 --> 16:40.583
Now thank God, many gurus are exposed.

16:40.608 --> 16:44.598
Thank God many myths that were working out
are being now blasted.

16:44.598 --> 16:49.688
When I was telling you people about the promiscuousness
and all those things, that this will never

16:49.688 --> 16:55.598
lead you to God but to hell, I remember when
people criticized Me to be Victorian.

16:55.598 --> 17:01.068
I mean people have ideas, which is a very
Victorian ideas, and also saying that Mother

17:01.068 --> 17:04.605
is very matronly and all sorts of English
language you see, that they could use about

17:04.630 --> 17:05.630
Me.

17:05.907 --> 17:14.068
But now you see, what have recently I've told,
thank God there have been a film showing the

17:14.068 --> 17:19.648
diseases we get by promiscuous life.

17:19.648 --> 17:24.277
The right sane attitude towards life definitely
helps you very much.

17:24.277 --> 17:29.828
But thank God, the grace of God is so great
that once you get Realization you become such

17:29.828 --> 17:35.378
a different person that everything drops out.

17:35.378 --> 17:40.677
You are really a transformed personality and
so that one should know whatever was the past

17:40.677 --> 17:43.407
is finished now, is no more there.

17:43.432 --> 17:46.171
The egg is finished, is the bird.

17:46.718 --> 17:55.038
And whom to blame, whom to talk about is the
bird there, now let the bird find its own

17:55.038 --> 17:57.038
wings and fly.

17:57.038 --> 18:02.907
Once you understand this simple thing of Sahaja
Yoga is that we have to make every one feel

18:02.932 --> 18:05.910
the All Pervading Power of God, to begin with.

18:06.069 --> 18:12.058
Unless and until they have felt it we have
not to accept them as realized souls.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.483
They have to feel it.

18:13.508 --> 18:17.364
Now of course as you know if the Vishuddhi
chakra is not all right they may not feel

18:17.389 --> 18:18.389
it in the hands.

18:18.414 --> 18:23.738
But still no use if you tell them that according
to us you are a realized soul but according

18:23.738 --> 18:26.488
to you, you are not feeling.

18:26.488 --> 18:28.598
You see because the mind is working.

18:28.598 --> 18:34.688
Instead of feeling a little disturbed about
it, upset about it, they may just think that,

18:34.688 --> 18:40.238
you see, it's just a make believe or a psychological
stuff and I didn't feel it, I'm a person of

18:40.238 --> 18:45.568
great will power, that attitude, yes, many
feel like that.

18:45.568 --> 18:50.650
So they can be lost.

18:50.675 --> 18:59.318
For now as our Sahaja Yoga is increasing everywhere
in the world, we have so many good Sahaja

18:59.318 --> 19:01.598
Yogis in England now.

19:01.598 --> 19:08.725
They are sensible people and uniquely placed
in this great country.

19:08.899 --> 19:19.785
And they have to understand that wisdom is
higher than intellect, and discretion is higher

19:19.810 --> 19:22.072
than debating.

19:24.198 --> 19:30.038
Take a very kindly and a compassionate attitude
towards the rest of the people, and then work

19:30.038 --> 19:39.728
it out that they should somehow or other,
feel this subtle force of God's love.

19:39.728 --> 19:45.088
Then gradually try to bring them round and
teach them what you've got.

19:45.088 --> 19:51.425
Is easy to blame their ego, it's very easy,
to say, "Oh, they're ego orientated, throw

19:51.450 --> 19:53.605
them away," very easy to say that.

19:54.384 --> 19:57.288
But that's not their mistake.

19:57.835 --> 19:59.280
That's not their doing.

19:59.352 --> 20:02.618
It was because they never felt the Spirit
before.

20:02.618 --> 20:08.408
Whatever they have they have used that instrument
whether ego or super ego and they have built

20:08.408 --> 20:14.993
up their own self, in that kind of a fort.

20:15.183 --> 20:22.068
But this barrier can be broken very easily
as soon as they get their Realization.

20:22.068 --> 20:25.178
I found the same thing in Australia.

20:25.178 --> 20:27.938
When I went there so many came back, so many.

20:28.380 --> 20:31.530
And now we have everywhere quite a lot of
people.

20:31.555 --> 20:36.748
In every ashram now we have coming at least
thousand to two thousand people.

20:36.748 --> 20:40.268
We have five centers now and it's working
out very well.

20:40.268 --> 20:43.828
Same thing is in England, we can work it out.

20:43.828 --> 20:51.228
But I told them the same thing that reality
is a different thing, and a mental projection

20:51.228 --> 20:52.228
is a different thing.

20:52.228 --> 20:54.438
You still do not talk on that level to these
people.

20:54.438 --> 20:59.858
Because you just increase their mental projection
and their barriers within them and this has

20:59.858 --> 21:00.988
helped them a lot.

21:00.988 --> 21:05.458
And you'll be amazed that those people who
were lost have come back to Sahaja Yoga and

21:05.458 --> 21:09.250
are growing very fast within themselves.

21:09.552 --> 21:15.728
Now for the new people I have to tell, you
have to have patience with yourself.

21:15.728 --> 21:17.211
You have to have patience.

21:17.236 --> 21:24.028
As I have patience for you, I have love for
you, I am here only because of you.

21:24.028 --> 21:30.488
You also must have patience for yourself and
full confidence in yourself that you'll become

21:30.488 --> 21:31.938
the Spirit.

21:31.938 --> 21:36.388
If you have these two things, I'm sure it
will work out.

21:36.388 --> 21:39.268
It is going to work out.

21:39.268 --> 21:44.958
Once you get your Realization you have to
work out on other people, and gradually you

21:44.958 --> 21:53.818
will be amazed that it will grow, and it will
convince you, and you will know that you have

21:53.818 --> 21:56.878
become the realized soul.

21:59.088 --> 22:03.438
But the realized souls are very simple people.

22:03.438 --> 22:08.308
If they say, "I am a realized soul," nobody
can believe them because there are no horns

22:08.308 --> 22:10.028
around them.

22:10.028 --> 22:17.158
No gurudom around them, nothing of the kind,
they're extremely simple people.

22:17.158 --> 22:26.078
So what is going to help you is a simple attitude
toward yourself and toward these Sahaja Yogis,

22:26.078 --> 22:30.728
and towards Sahaja Yoga that you have come
here to become the Spirit.

22:30.728 --> 22:33.058
We have to gain nothing from you.

22:33.058 --> 22:38.668
There's no clientele as such, there's no money
proposition, nothing.

22:38.668 --> 22:45.388
It is you who have come to the Ganges, to
take the holy water, it is you who has to

22:45.388 --> 22:46.388
take it.

22:46.388 --> 22:49.338
We are here to help you.

22:49.338 --> 22:56.988
If that attitude is developed I'm sure, with
your co-operation, we can change the face

22:56.988 --> 22:58.188
of this world.

22:58.188 --> 23:08.674
And as William Blake has said in this Hampstead,
"We have to build up Jerusalem here."

23:08.699 --> 23:12.193
May God Bless you all.

23:23.848 --> 23:31.728
Any questions you have you ask?

23:31.753 --> 23:34.837
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: This is not a loud
speaker.

23:34.862 --> 23:39.261
I think I better present you with a loud speaker.

23:39.316 --> 23:50.096
What happened, you presented one to India
why don't you get one.

23:50.121 --> 24:05.527
Further conversation about the speaker)

24:13.127 --> 24:19.332
Any questions to request Me?

24:19.357 --> 24:47.296
Seeker asks a question: - How can one who
is new this subject distinguish between what

24:47.296 --> 25:09.933
is psychic phenomena and what is actually
the manifestation of the Spirit itself?

25:09.958 --> 25:14.737
[Seeker gives a long introduction to this
question which is unclear.]

25:14.762 --> 25:16.531
Shri Mataji: is good idea.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.036
May God bless you.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.936
You see when they say they have felt the cool
breeze the psychic people they are telling

25:24.961 --> 25:28.281
lies, simple as that.

25:28.656 --> 25:36.734
Because the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,
that you feel, has not only the cool breeze

25:36.783 --> 25:38.121
it has its own powers.

25:38.161 --> 25:41.039
For example, now I say there is a flame here,
all right.

25:41.064 --> 25:45.410
Now if there is a blind man also if he puts
his finger round there he will know it's a

25:45.442 --> 25:49.050
flame isn't it, because he can feel the heat.

25:49.075 --> 25:55.752
In the same way this cool breeze is just to
feel this cool breeze but is a dynamic stuff.

25:55.794 --> 26:05.117
You can, when you get this cool breeze established
within yourself, you'll be amazed that under

26:05.142 --> 26:11.181
your hand the Kundalini will pulsate, it will
rise, and you will feel the cool breeze of

26:11.197 --> 26:13.007
another person.

26:13.032 --> 26:18.573
With this cool breeze you can cure diseases
like cancer and many other.

26:18.613 --> 26:22.273
With this cool breeze you can give balances
to people.

26:22.273 --> 26:25.893
Everything you can do with this cool breeze,
is tremendous.

26:25.893 --> 26:32.204
If you have any, say question, any question,
supposing you are a realized soul, you want

26:32.229 --> 26:36.202
to know about a guru if he is real or not.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.400
If it's a psychic thing you won't get anything.

26:39.425 --> 26:43.767
You won't know why psychic people are all
going to parapsychology, is all wrong, it's

26:43.792 --> 26:44.736
a horrible stuff.

26:44.761 --> 26:48.591
This parapsychology is one of the worst things
that can happen to a human being, but they

26:48.623 --> 26:49.946
don't know what it is.

26:49.971 --> 26:51.677
There's nothing absolute about it.

26:51.702 --> 26:56.718
But the cool breeze is the one that gives
you complete absolute idea.

26:56.743 --> 26:58.505
Like you want to know is there God?

26:58.530 --> 27:02.411
Ask a simple question like that, "Mother is
there God?"

27:02.436 --> 27:04.006
You'll get a cool breeze.

27:04.432 --> 27:11.782
Now it's so, discrimination is so great and
so precise that supposing you want to know

27:11.782 --> 27:18.922
about a guru how he is, supposing he's a devil
then you might get even blisters on your hand.

27:18.922 --> 27:25.000
You might even get tremendous heat in your
hand and vibrations will stop completely.

27:25.025 --> 27:32.205
But supposing he's half way then you may not
get such bad effects but there won't be any

27:32.230 --> 27:33.173
breeze at all.

27:33.198 --> 27:38.928
But supposing he's a realized soul, for William
Blake for example, I don't have to ask I know,

27:38.953 --> 27:43.613
but unless and until you really feel that
cool breeze in your hand in a real way, also

27:43.638 --> 27:51.054
it's coming out of your head then you should
not believe that you have got a Realization,

27:51.079 --> 27:52.871
you should not believe into it.

27:52.896 --> 27:57.962
Now they are many psychic cases I know who
told Me, "We have always felt the cool breeze,"

27:57.964 --> 28:02.649
because they cannot accept it, just say, and
their Kundalini just frozen there.

28:02.674 --> 28:06.862
Nothing of the kind, I'm getting terrible
heat and just praying if this person goes

28:06.887 --> 28:08.945
away for a while will be good rest for Me.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.695
And he says, "No, no but I have felt the cool
breeze."

28:10.720 --> 28:12.170
All the time he's telling Me lies.

28:12.195 --> 28:14.597
"I have always felt the cool breeze everywhere."

28:14.605 --> 28:19.304
But the Kundalini is down below you can feel
it yourself, you can see for yourself.

28:19.518 --> 28:22.862
If the Kundalini is not here how are you feeling
the cool breeze?

28:22.862 --> 28:24.172
You cannot.

28:24.172 --> 28:30.775
Is a phenomena as a result of something it's
not just a phenomena of the cool breeze.

28:30.800 --> 28:35.819
But when the Kundalini rises above the Sahasrara
then only you can feel the cool breeze.

28:35.835 --> 28:37.743
I've seen many people like that.

28:37.768 --> 28:41.019
They don't want to accept, oh that I've got
all this.

28:41.036 --> 28:44.173
But supposing there are people who are born
realized.

28:44.198 --> 28:46.777
There are people, some people who feel the
cool breeze.

28:46.802 --> 28:50.791
Now you have to differentiate between them
and the unreal people.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.458
There can be some people who are born realized.

28:53.483 --> 28:57.744
But nowadays we have decided not to tell them
that they are born realized because, those

28:57.769 --> 29:03.562
who came to us we told them they're born realized,
their ego suddenly inflated like this.

29:03.571 --> 29:07.391
You see absolutely gone cases and we lost
them.

29:07.391 --> 29:12.001
Because you see, if you are a born realized
it's nothing great, nothing great, because

29:12.026 --> 29:13.411
so many are realized.

29:13.435 --> 29:18.624
Supposing you get Realization today all right,
so you'll be a realized soul, but you're not

29:18.649 --> 29:20.448
a Sahaja Yogi.

29:20.539 --> 29:28.103
Sahaja Yogi is a person who not only is a
realized soul but he knows all the technique

29:28.128 --> 29:30.505
of this pure knowledge.

29:30.530 --> 29:41.202
He knows all the laws of the Divine happening
and also he knows how to handle the Kundalini.

29:41.274 --> 29:46.082
Sahaja Yogi is a knowledgeable person the
one who knows all about it.

29:46.107 --> 29:50.879
Who knows all the permutations and combinations,
who knows how to maneuver it and everything

29:50.904 --> 29:52.554
about it.

29:52.579 --> 29:56.477
So he's you can say a boy who enters into
the first class.

29:56.528 --> 29:59.376
He just knows one plus one is two.

29:59.401 --> 30:04.366
But say a professor of mathematics, there's
a big difference between the two.

30:04.485 --> 30:08.788
So even if somebody's a born realized it's
better not to tell him that you are born realized

30:08.813 --> 30:11.806
because he suddenly thinks he has become a
professor.

30:11.831 --> 30:15.392
Imagine a little boy thinking that he's become
a professor.

30:15.417 --> 30:18.501
It is very detrimental to him as well as to
others.

30:18.526 --> 30:25.099
So best thing is to get the cool breeze in
the right sense, in the right way and understand

30:25.156 --> 30:26.496
that it works, it must work.

30:26.496 --> 30:29.928
As you see how do you make out a real note
and an unreal note?

30:29.953 --> 30:32.280
The real note it works.

30:32.439 --> 30:38.536
So it's not a myth it's a reality, again I
say it's a reality.

30:38.640 --> 30:43.130
Supposing this is an artificial thing it won't
work.

30:43.130 --> 30:47.580
Anything that is artificial doesn't work,
all right?

30:47.580 --> 30:53.860
You go to this Madame Tussaud's place and
you'll find so many people sitting looking

30:53.860 --> 31:05.482
exactly like us you see, but they are not
living, all right, you understand My point?

31:05.609 --> 31:08.714
So you have to master it, know it fully.

31:08.739 --> 31:10.962
You have to master it and understand it.

31:10.987 --> 31:15.631
You see unless and until you understand it
to that extent, you cannot reach any conclusion,

31:15.656 --> 31:17.551
all right, and we have to work it out.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.861
May God Bless you.

31:26.626 --> 31:31.839
Is not only thing that is cool breeze, where
is your Kundalini, whether it has risen or

31:31.864 --> 31:33.990
not, if the cool breeze is coming out of the
head.

31:34.015 --> 31:38.906
Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, nobody can say
that.

31:38.931 --> 31:42.238
I've seen many people who get even the cool
breeze coming out of their head they cannot

31:42.263 --> 31:44.654
feel it because their hands are not sensitive.

31:44.686 --> 31:49.538
Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, is true.

31:49.563 --> 31:54.619
But that doesn't mean that a Sahaja Yogi is
something out of the blue, is just like you.

31:54.668 --> 32:02.252
Only thing is he has grown into a new awareness,
which you are going to grow yourself.

32:08.555 --> 32:26.940
(UNCLEAR- Mother speaks to seeker)

32:30.560 --> 32:37.668
In Sahaja Yoga there are so many ways and
methods how we work out all the help from

32:37.693 --> 32:40.898
all the elements, how we work it.

32:40.923 --> 32:45.725
For example, this gentleman say for example,
I find his left side is overloaded.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.830
You can ask the Mother Earth to take away
the problem.

32:48.902 --> 32:51.935
Just put left hand towards Me and right hand
on the Mother Earth, you can get cured, you

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
will feel better.

32:53.798 --> 32:55.497
Feeling better now?

32:56.711 --> 32:58.498
Just wait, have patience.

32:58.498 --> 33:01.260
It will work.

33:06.878 --> 33:08.681
Any other question?

33:13.233 --> 33:16.486
You must see that the person is transformed.

33:16.764 --> 33:20.921
They may say anything the person must be transformed.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.874
He must become a saint.

33:23.104 --> 33:30.176
And the saint is not a person who calls himself
a saint, but a saintly person is that one

33:30.201 --> 33:33.519
who drops out all nonsensical things, automatically.

33:37.544 --> 33:39.132
Nothing sticks to it.

33:39.204 --> 33:46.694
As they say, "The lotus leaf you see, if you
put water on the lotus leaf the water drops

33:46.719 --> 33:48.120
out, nothing sticks to it."

33:54.688 --> 33:59.168
I think in England at least seventy percent
or maybe say sixty percent people have been

33:59.193 --> 34:05.450
drug addicts, Sahaja Yogis, you can't believe
they were.

34:05.475 --> 34:07.739
If not addicts they were something like that.

34:07.764 --> 34:13.755
I used to call them drugists and chemists,
but they're different today.

34:17.826 --> 34:19.788
Any other question please?

34:24.799 --> 34:26.638
(Question- Is the artificial raising of the
Kundalini dangerous?)

34:26.638 --> 34:28.617
Yes first.

34:43.309 --> 34:48.468
You see the trouble is, those who have written
about it have no authority.

34:48.493 --> 34:50.523
I have said about it many a times.

34:50.548 --> 34:55.137
Like say a villager comes to the city and
puts his hand in the plug you see, and gets

34:55.162 --> 35:00.664
a shock and says electricity is very dangerous,
all right, is like that.

35:00.689 --> 35:03.532
But Kundalini is your Mother.

35:03.603 --> 35:07.541
You have only one Mother and She has only
one son.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.326
It's your individual Mother.

35:09.351 --> 35:12.201
You don't share it even with your brother
or sister.

35:12.226 --> 35:13.547
She's your Mother.

35:14.128 --> 35:16.273
She doesn't trouble you at all.

35:16.298 --> 35:20.674
She's your the greatest well wisher who's
born again and again with you waiting for

35:20.699 --> 35:23.219
this time, there's no question.

35:23.277 --> 35:28.017
But those who are unauthorized harm the Kundalinis
of thousands of people.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.292
People have seen that.

35:29.317 --> 35:33.580
Because you see that's My nature perhaps that
I can do it.

35:33.739 --> 35:37.782
But then people feel very hurt you know they
can't understand why should Mother do it.

35:37.807 --> 35:39.105
I said, "You better do it.

35:39.130 --> 35:43.728
It's good I should retire, I'm sixty years
of age is better for Me to retire, you should

35:43.736 --> 35:44.736
do it."

35:44.736 --> 35:48.338
But if you are doing so many things, you know
I don't know how to drive, I don't know many

35:48.387 --> 35:50.292
things that you do.

35:50.317 --> 35:54.507
I know one thing, how to raise Kundalini.

35:54.532 --> 36:01.056
So if something is difficult and is done easily
means that person is a master of that.

36:01.096 --> 36:09.013
And if that person is a master doesn't matter
there are masters of everything, all right.

36:09.038 --> 36:15.326
So far I haven't seen anybody suffering because
of Kundalini and should not.

36:15.326 --> 36:23.935
But it's not an easy thing for many people
because I met some saints this time and they

36:23.935 --> 36:26.157
said, "It's only You who can do it Mother
we can't."

36:26.182 --> 36:29.870
There's a fellow called Gaugan (Not sure of
the name - SG) Maharaja, a very old man and

36:29.910 --> 36:38.579
he lives in a forest on top of a hill and
he's come to Me also.

36:38.596 --> 36:45.016
And he has many disciples and one of them
he told him to do this and do that you see,

36:45.041 --> 36:50.349
the balancing part of it, and he did all those
things for fourteen years.

36:50.388 --> 36:56.400
And suddenly in a program in Kolhapur he just
came to see Me, and got his Realization.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.162
He was shocked that, "Fourteen years I've
been doing all this and I never got it and

36:59.187 --> 37:01.744
how is it in a short time I got it?"

37:01.768 --> 37:06.293
So he went to see Gaugan Maharaja so he told
him about Me.

37:06.318 --> 37:08.697
He said, "She's different."

37:10.108 --> 37:15.612
So that's how it is, and I feel rather embarrassed
to talk about it, all right?

37:15.637 --> 37:18.898
May God Bless you.

37:28.339 --> 37:38.149
(Question by seeker: -: How do you relate
Your experiences or what You are talking to

37:38.149 --> 37:43.578
us about with traditional yogic practices?)

37:43.578 --> 37:45.050
Very much so.

37:45.075 --> 37:48.271
Very much, it is the most traditional thing,
you see.

37:48.296 --> 37:56.207
Because the yogic practices you do here is
some sort of a, I don't know what to call

37:56.232 --> 38:03.465
it, but it's like just a wee bit of it you've
have taken are doing that, that's not yogic

38:03.490 --> 38:05.391
practice at all.

38:05.391 --> 38:10.292
You see Patanjali Yoga, which was practiced
thousands of years back, when people led a

38:10.317 --> 38:12.856
different type of life.

38:12.881 --> 38:18.412
When the children went to school with the
gurus, who was a realized soul.

38:18.468 --> 38:21.412
Nobody who was not a realized soul was called
a guru.

38:21.437 --> 38:27.649
And the children had to lead a very celibate
life because according to your university,

38:27.664 --> 38:30.109
you see, you're called as your gotras.

38:30.134 --> 38:34.575
And you could not believe it today, say my
gotra is Shandilya.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.751
Shandilya was the muni of My family.

38:36.776 --> 38:40.592
I can't marry a man from the same gotra even
today.

38:40.614 --> 38:45.794
Thousands of years have passed since then,
Shandilya lived about forty, fifty thousand

38:45.819 --> 38:48.797
years back, but even today I can't marry a
man who belongs to

38:48.822 --> 38:49.845
the same gotra.

38:49.870 --> 38:55.436
So the celibacy you can imagine, that from
one university you could not marry.

38:55.453 --> 39:00.588
That's how they lived a life and then they
went, after five years of age, they went to

39:00.613 --> 39:06.757
those schools, they lived there and they came
out of that in complete celibate living they

39:06.782 --> 39:07.519
were.

39:07.544 --> 39:12.554
And then they got married and then when they
had children they sent them back, like that

39:12.586 --> 39:13.451
the system was.

39:13.476 --> 39:20.324
But if you read Patanjali Yoga the first thing
that Patanjali Yoga said that, "Ishwara Pranitana

39:20.349 --> 39:22.951
(MAYBE Prathistana - SG)," means the establishment
of God.

39:22.976 --> 39:25.597
First you must establish the Spirit.

39:25.622 --> 39:33.223
It's like we have not yet started the car
for example, all right, it's very logical.

39:33.255 --> 39:38.591
Now I'm coming to Hampstead, I don't know
the way, supposing, and I don't know which

39:38.616 --> 39:39.853
way to go.

39:39.942 --> 39:45.929
Now supposing I say that all right now I have
to go to Hampstead, from the very beginning

39:45.938 --> 39:50.783
I'll turn to the left and not to the right,
can I do it, no?

39:50.830 --> 39:56.599
So when the Kundalini rises then only you
will know which chakra is catching what is

39:56.624 --> 39:58.368
your problem.

39:58.639 --> 40:03.232
Beforehand supposing you are doing any, at
random, any exercises.

40:03.257 --> 40:07.215
Say example, the way people are doing these
days yoga, so called, it has nothing to do

40:07.240 --> 40:08.649
with yoga.

40:08.817 --> 40:14.754
You see these exercises when you do, you are
not aware as to what are your problems.

40:14.850 --> 40:21.518
You don't know what you are suffering from
and what particular asana is needed for a

40:21.543 --> 40:26.022
particular type of a chakra, which is blocked,
all right.

40:26.157 --> 40:30.671
So what you're doing is indiscriminate, taking
medicines without understanding.

40:30.749 --> 40:37.883
But the practice of these things are a very
minimum part of the whole of Patanjali.

40:38.248 --> 40:42.645
First is Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana
- SG) means when you establish the Spirit.

40:42.686 --> 40:45.499
Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana - SG)
means the establishment of the God.

40:45.502 --> 40:51.053
Once you have established that, then the Kundalini
starts moving and then you know where to stop,

40:51.078 --> 40:54.258
where to turn, how to do.

40:55.616 --> 41:00.143
This is real tradition, but the last fifty
years, you see, all sorts of nonsensical people

41:00.168 --> 41:01.544
have come up.

41:01.569 --> 41:05.104
They've changed this, changed that and is
logical, is logical you see.

41:05.160 --> 41:10.345
Supposing you are suffering from Agnya chakra
all right, and you are doing the exercise

41:10.370 --> 41:14.494
of this chakra you will spoil this as well
as spoil this.

41:14.519 --> 41:17.609
There's no logic, there's no understanding,
nothing.

41:17.673 --> 41:22.020
You see this is just physical exercises because
people want to become actors and actresses

41:22.045 --> 41:22.870
I think.

41:22.895 --> 41:26.100
(Seeker speaks to Mother.

41:26.125 --> 41:32.405
Mentions the eight limbs of yoga the whole
astanga going through the nearma and the asanas,

41:32.430 --> 41:44.972
prameara, pratchara to try to work toward
samadhi)

41:45.173 --> 41:51.348
All those things you see, no, no it does not,
it does not, it does not.

41:51.373 --> 41:54.554
That's the other way round you see, this is
the problem.

41:54.579 --> 42:00.885
You see what happens that, unless and until
you get your Realization you have no entry

42:00.910 --> 42:03.798
into yourself you don't know where you are
going.

42:03.823 --> 42:05.143
This will never work out.

42:05.168 --> 42:10.091
On the contrary, all those who have done Hatha
Yoga catch on their heart center very much,

42:10.116 --> 42:13.067
because the whole attention is on the body.

42:13.092 --> 42:16.912
Because the attention is on the body the left
heart catches.

42:16.937 --> 42:21.010
Just now I have been to one organization where
I met three of them.

42:21.035 --> 42:26.279
They all had their left side absolutely frozen,
so they said, "Mother what should we do?"

42:26.303 --> 42:28.669
I said, "You must sing the praise of God.

42:28.728 --> 42:35.833
Forget, you have become so dry like a bamboo
now, fill it up with the love of God."

42:35.937 --> 42:41.533
Forget it all your asanas and everything,
just like, you see, dried fishes.

42:43.470 --> 42:45.618
There's no emotions left.

42:45.698 --> 42:50.226
It's such an imbalance, ha and tha both the
things, they've not said only ha, ha is the

42:50.251 --> 42:52.844
surya nadi they said ha and tha.

42:52.869 --> 42:56.656
What are you doing about tha, nothing?

42:56.862 --> 43:02.868
So you are doing ha yoga, all right.

43:02.893 --> 43:08.410
You have to do Hatha Yoga but, without Ishwara
Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana - SG), without

43:08.453 --> 43:14.378
Realization we also do, not that we don't
do, whatever is needed that we do.

43:14.404 --> 43:21.002
For example, now when I went there I told
them what should be given to a person who

43:21.027 --> 43:23.814
is suffering from mental diseases.

43:23.839 --> 43:30.179
He said, "All this for mental diseases, also
all these for egoistical people, also all

43:30.211 --> 43:34.225
these for liver patients, also all these for,
I mean it's horrible."

43:34.250 --> 43:41.483
I said, "How can that be, on the contrary
to a mental patient if you make him bend forward

43:41.682 --> 43:45.397
he'll suffer more, he must bend backwards.

43:45.422 --> 43:49.025
A person who is ego oriented should bend forward."

43:49.050 --> 43:54.103
They changed of course, I mean they're sensible
people as well as I'm concerned, they believe

43:54.159 --> 43:58.898
in Me, they think in India of course I'm accepted
as some sort of a, something like that.

43:58.962 --> 44:02.801
But you see these are little, little things
they don't know.

44:02.801 --> 44:07.022
Supposing a person is ego oriented, right-sided
person as we call it.

44:07.022 --> 44:15.110
Right-sided person if he tries to bend backwards
he'll become even worse.

44:15.245 --> 44:21.081
And a person who is a superego person, suffering
from mental troubles and all that has to,

44:21.081 --> 44:26.942
not to bend forward at all, he has to bend
backwards.

44:26.942 --> 44:31.926
Because they're two types of people, there
are actually three types as you know.

44:31.951 --> 44:38.716
The people who are, I mean, in vulgar language
we can call it masochist and sadist but they

44:38.772 --> 44:42.832
are extreme cases, but I'm saying that style.

44:42.857 --> 44:47.392
We call them tamo gunis and rajo gunis.

44:48.469 --> 44:54.040
So the rajo gunis the sadists, if they become
more like this, God save the world, see the

44:54.065 --> 44:55.065
point?

44:55.090 --> 45:00.394
And the emotions are drained out of such people,
there no feelings left, no emotions, nothing,

45:00.427 --> 45:01.394
zero.

45:01.498 --> 45:05.115
I met one dentist who came and he said, "Mother
now I have become a sthitapragya."

45:05.140 --> 45:05.965
I said, "How?"

45:05.990 --> 45:07.310
"I have no feelings.

45:07.335 --> 45:09.716
Nothing happens to me.

45:09.772 --> 45:12.671
You see my child is sick I'm not bothered."

45:12.671 --> 45:14.882
What a nice man you are.

45:14.882 --> 45:16.351
"I have no feelings.

45:17.298 --> 45:19.546
My mother calls me I have no feelings.

45:19.571 --> 45:21.320
I am living somewhere alone."

45:21.345 --> 45:22.787
I said, "All right."

45:23.311 --> 45:26.707
I said, "Is that the way the saints have lived?

45:26.732 --> 45:30.442
They have been worried not only about their
people but about everyone."

45:30.467 --> 45:32.471
There's no love.

45:32.496 --> 45:38.274
There's no love in the modern yoga, no love.

45:38.299 --> 45:43.569
Is only the love of God, can be only felt
through Spirit.

45:43.605 --> 45:45.502
You have to have a balance.

45:45.527 --> 45:48.575
Is very one sided, extremely one sided.

45:48.600 --> 45:53.035
One side is those who are singing the devotional
songs and the other side are (inaudible).

45:53.115 --> 45:55.072
Both are equally mad I tell you.

45:55.097 --> 45:57.326
Both can be equally mad.

45:57.351 --> 46:04.274
Come to the balance, again you have to come
to the balance, otherwise you cannot enjoy

46:04.299 --> 46:05.299
Sahaja Yoga.

46:05.653 --> 46:15.314
Sahaja Yoga is an enjoyment, enjoyment of
your balance, of the beauty of God's love,

46:15.386 --> 46:19.938
and the truth of His work.

46:20.457 --> 46:25.243
Everything has to be enjoyed, all right.

46:25.656 --> 46:26.986
You just work it out.

46:27.011 --> 46:28.517
Shri Mataji: Have you done yoga very much?

46:28.542 --> 46:29.247
Seeker: Sorry?

46:29.272 --> 46:32.815
Shri Mataji: Have you done lot of yoga?

46:32.815 --> 46:34.015
Seeker: Reasonable.

46:34.015 --> 46:40.381
I do follow the Buddhist practice which is
based upon...

46:40.406 --> 46:42.246
Shri Mataji: Now Buddhist also!

46:42.246 --> 46:45.575
Now I'll tell you about Buddhism, all right?

46:45.575 --> 46:47.765
What are Buddhists doing?

46:47.765 --> 46:51.596
Is true about everyone Christians, Hindus,
everybody.

46:51.596 --> 46:54.488
Just because you asked about Buddhist I must
tell you.

46:54.513 --> 46:58.220
Where is Buddha placed within us do they know?

46:58.245 --> 46:59.746
Where is Buddha?

46:59.771 --> 47:03.321
Buddha is placed within us at a point...

47:04.198 --> 47:06.242
Seeker: Well, yes...

47:06.267 --> 47:10.358
Shri Mataji: And what does He control within
us?

47:10.423 --> 47:15.771
We have to know this knowledge of the roots.

47:15.796 --> 47:21.099
Unless and until you know the knowledge of
the roots how will you know about the tree?

47:21.124 --> 47:26.982
You cannot treat the tree on its leaves or
branches you have to go to the roots.

47:27.046 --> 47:29.707
And first you find out the roots within.

47:29.707 --> 47:35.870
Buddhism is so superficial now, that I Myself
amazed and Buddha must be thinking, oh God

47:35.895 --> 47:38.565
from where it has come.

47:38.689 --> 47:42.182
He says "Buddham, Sharanam, Gachami."

47:42.207 --> 47:43.816
What is Buddha?

47:43.816 --> 47:45.697
Is an enlightened soul?

47:45.697 --> 47:49.957
Buddham means the one who is enlightened.

47:49.957 --> 47:53.633
"Sangham sharanam gachami" means to the collective
being.

47:53.658 --> 47:55.871
Sangham means the collective being.

47:55.896 --> 47:57.466
"Dhamam sharanam gachami."

47:57.491 --> 47:59.786
Dhamam is the balance within you.

47:59.811 --> 48:01.736
How many Buddhists know about it?

48:01.768 --> 48:04.655
They don't know even where Buddha is sitting
on their heads.

48:04.766 --> 48:10.752
And what I find most of the Buddhists that
their center of Buddha is finished.

48:10.777 --> 48:14.460
Buddha has disappeared from them once for
all.

48:14.485 --> 48:21.524
He controls our ego, and he's settled down
here on the head on the left hand side.

48:21.549 --> 48:23.587
We can prove it on Kundalini.

48:24.648 --> 48:31.398
Supposing somebody is following Buddha immediately
people will know that you are a Buddhist because

48:31.398 --> 48:33.789
there's a catch here.

48:33.789 --> 48:39.676
And then some methods are there to awaken
Him, if you awaken Him your Kundalini will

48:39.701 --> 48:43.414
rise otherwise it won't, all right?

48:43.439 --> 48:49.880
So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

48:49.905 --> 48:55.953
We should not just depend on Budhhism or any
"ism."

48:58.038 --> 48:59.538
That's what I'm saying.

48:59.538 --> 49:03.908
Seeker: Yes, it's just the thing You said
in the beginning, I mean I agree...

49:03.933 --> 49:09.187
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see we have to have
the complete integrated knowledge of the roots,

49:09.212 --> 49:10.934
which nourishes, isn't it?

49:11.054 --> 49:19.424
Seeker ask the question:- Are you advocating
a system or a practice to get closer to these

49:19.449 --> 49:23.265
roots?

49:28.573 --> 49:31.585
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no there is no system
about this.

49:31.610 --> 49:35.484
There is no system no practice, no courses.

49:35.509 --> 49:37.439
Actually it is spontaneous.

49:37.464 --> 49:39.453
I'm talking of your evolution.

49:39.826 --> 49:45.152
Your evolution comes through a living force
of the living God.

49:45.597 --> 49:49.736
You cannot have a course in that, can you
have?

49:49.736 --> 49:52.746
How do you sprout a seed?

49:52.746 --> 49:56.461
You have to just put it in the Mother Earth
it sprouts by itself, is built in.

49:56.486 --> 50:03.766
In the same way within you it's built in and
it sprouts, that's all.

50:03.791 --> 50:05.707
There's no course.

50:05.732 --> 50:11.863
Maybe you may not get it today you'll get
it tomorrow, some seeds sprout faster.

50:11.888 --> 50:24.629
Seeker makes a comment: I see the Buddhist
tradition as growing out of a yogic insight.

50:24.708 --> 50:27.816
No, no, no, you are sadly mistaken about Buddhism.

50:27.827 --> 50:32.518
The trouble is with the western people they're
so fed up with Christianity that they think

50:32.543 --> 50:34.558
Buddhism is going to solve the problem.

50:34.583 --> 50:37.500
They are just like any other Christian church,
take it from Me.

50:37.756 --> 50:41.444
All these lamas should be hanged by the nearest
tree, I tell you.

50:41.469 --> 50:43.760
Horrible people they are, horrible.

50:43.760 --> 50:46.039
You should see their vibrations.

50:46.039 --> 50:51.608
You know this Dalai Lama when they're sitting
next to Me, I was invited to the Prime Minister's

50:51.633 --> 50:53.373
place, I just couldn't bear him.

50:53.398 --> 50:56.206
And the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
himself was a realized soul and he could feel

50:56.220 --> 50:57.728
it and he said, "Is he very hot?"

50:57.753 --> 50:58.753
I said, "Yes."

50:58.778 --> 51:00.625
Is in Hindi he said, "He's an extremely hot
fellow."

51:00.650 --> 51:08.220
He said, "All right, you get on the other
side," he made the foreign minister sit here.

51:08.220 --> 51:11.680
You won't understand, just now you don't understand.

51:11.705 --> 51:15.523
Even a little child who is a realized soul
will understand, but you won't because you're

51:15.548 --> 51:17.518
not yet realized, this is the point.

51:17.543 --> 51:20.473
The difference is you are mentally understanding.

51:20.498 --> 51:25.456
I have a grand daughter she was hardly five
years of age when My daughter and the son-in-law

51:25.481 --> 51:27.708
went to Ladakh, it's an interesting story.

51:28.168 --> 51:32.417
And there was a lama sitting you see like
this, and everybody was touching his feet.

51:32.442 --> 51:36.801
This little child was a realized soul, she
couldn't bear it any more, when the father

51:36.826 --> 51:42.529
went and touched his foot she just stood back
and she said, "What do you mean by shaving

51:42.554 --> 51:46.422
your head and wearing this big stuff you think
you are a realized soul?

51:46.430 --> 51:48.812
Why are you making everybody touch your feet?"

51:48.837 --> 51:50.391
Just she stood up.

51:50.416 --> 51:54.727
And My son-in-law felt quite embarrassed and
he told that he's not even a realized soul

51:54.752 --> 51:56.608
why do you touch his feet.

51:56.633 --> 51:57.920
You won't understand, even a little child
will understand, you won't understand.

52:01.607 --> 52:02.771
Realized soul is a person who can feel it.

52:02.771 --> 52:11.038
This is what Buddha has said, that's the traditional
thing, he has said, "First of all seek yourself."

52:11.473 --> 52:13.233
Buddha didn't talk about God.

52:13.233 --> 52:16.699
Why, because he thought if you talk about
God again another religion will start.

52:16.724 --> 52:21.803
He just said first of all, as I say, "First
of all seek yourself, get your Self-Realization.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.957
Nothing else but get your Realization."

52:28.077 --> 52:29.077
All right that's it.

52:29.077 --> 52:31.929
So better have it, better have it.

52:31.954 --> 52:37.157
You see you have Buddhism there's nothing
like "ism" about Buddha these people are mental.

52:38.196 --> 52:40.860
To have it means to get Realization.

52:40.996 --> 52:45.727
What tradition are they following, carrying
that ring like this, like that, mad kip (sic)

52:45.784 --> 52:46.784
people, horrible.

52:46.784 --> 52:49.522
Is that what Buddha did?

52:50.260 --> 52:51.918
He sought His Realization.

52:52.032 --> 52:54.743
He didn't do all these nonsensical things
these lamas.

52:54.879 --> 52:58.746
And they even beat people and do all kinds
of things, horrible cruel people.

52:58.771 --> 53:01.087
Thank God there out of that Lhasa.

53:01.613 --> 53:06.413
You should see the Tibetans now they're sitting
on our heads like parasites in India and we

53:06.438 --> 53:07.969
had a parliament question on them.

53:08.743 --> 53:13.534
You see they look very attractive because
you are fed up with your Christianity, that's

53:13.559 --> 53:14.304
what.

53:14.329 --> 53:17.221
Don't believe in all these please whether
they're Hindus, Christians or Muslim, all

53:17.246 --> 53:18.246
are just the same.

53:20.699 --> 53:22.149
There's no difference.

53:22.174 --> 53:25.467
You become the realized soul first of all.

53:27.293 --> 53:31.882
You have to be the Buddha, all right, that's
what I am saying as a Mother.

53:34.692 --> 53:37.835
And then they started another one Shambhala
business you see.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.598
This is another new thing.

53:39.678 --> 53:42.856
Taking everybody to Gobi Desert to get samadhi.

53:42.881 --> 53:47.326
Walk in that Gobi Desert even one mile you'll
get a samadhi permanently.

53:49.939 --> 53:53.120
[laughter] You can't even get a glass of water
there to drink, My child.

53:53.145 --> 53:56.453
What things they are preaching, you don't
know, all nonsense.

54:02.095 --> 54:05.434
In Spain some Spanish people have started
this nonsense.

54:06.111 --> 54:09.088
They are recruiting people to go to Gobi Desert.

54:09.198 --> 54:11.217
I mean what is going to happen to them?

54:11.242 --> 54:15.123
Think of the Gobi Desert, is one of the worst
deserts of the world.

54:16.326 --> 54:20.150
Can you imagine going to a desert, how will
you reach God?

54:21.342 --> 54:23.538
You have to seek Him within yourself.

54:24.406 --> 54:30.102
He's within, all right?

54:30.127 --> 54:37.698
Question from seeker:- Mother please tell
us about the dangers of mis-using mantras

54:37.723 --> 54:38.723
by religious sects.

54:38.748 --> 54:45.728
Shri Mataji: Mantras, all right, dangers of
mantras?

54:45.829 --> 54:50.651
You see mantra is a thing by which you awaken
the Deity within you.

54:50.676 --> 54:53.479
The Deity, which is on this chakra.

54:53.504 --> 54:56.228
Now here the chakras and we have deities.

54:56.253 --> 54:59.970
On these we have to awaken the Deities.

55:02.104 --> 55:07.747
So, a person who is awakened himself can only
tell you what mantra to be said, isn't it,

55:07.772 --> 55:09.663
a simple thing as that?

55:09.688 --> 55:14.935
The one who has no eyes, what can he tell
to another blind person?

55:16.016 --> 55:23.494
So first an enlightened soul, who knows about
chakras can only tell you what chakras are

55:23.519 --> 55:26.168
catching within you.

55:26.669 --> 55:28.984
But the Kundalini should solve.

55:29.009 --> 55:33.044
Supposing you are just now caught in your
Nabhi chakra and I tell you that you say the

55:33.069 --> 55:34.069
mantra.

55:34.094 --> 55:39.008
Not that you, but the realized soul should
say the mantra and awaken that.

55:39.033 --> 55:42.454
Maybe the Kundalini has gone there, so from
there you have to come here.

55:42.479 --> 55:45.390
You have to see the movement of the Kundalini.

55:45.415 --> 55:51.899
Like a car is going now, very simple, the
car is going so we come to a toll gate, all

55:51.924 --> 55:52.763
right.

55:52.788 --> 55:55.064
There we have to pay the toll.

55:55.089 --> 56:00.658
But where the car is going, and then there
is a toll gate you pay there to a particular

56:00.683 --> 56:02.643
toll gate, isn't it?

56:02.668 --> 56:05.858
Like when you are going you see -

56:05.883 --> 56:09.349
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: I've given up tea.

56:09.374 --> 56:11.922
I have, just given up.

56:11.947 --> 56:12.947
Just take it.

56:12.972 --> 56:16.453
Sixty years I thought I have drunk too much
of tea.

56:16.478 --> 56:20.302
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

56:20.327 --> 56:21.327
[laughter])

56:23.010 --> 56:28.848
So you see the thing is the movement of the
Kundalini will only tell you which chakra

56:28.873 --> 56:32.278
is catching, all right, otherwise you will
not know.

56:32.303 --> 56:36.486
Unless until you move the car, before that,
how will you know where the car is going to

56:36.511 --> 56:37.570
get the toll.

56:37.595 --> 56:40.844
Can you pay it before the car starts?

56:40.869 --> 56:45.640
So what happens, if they give you a mantra
mostly people don't know what they're doing.

56:45.665 --> 56:48.006
You see it is a big enterprise.

56:48.031 --> 56:50.832
Giving mantras is a very big enterprise.

56:50.857 --> 56:54.634
Like they have given mantras, which I was
amazed to hear, if you tell some Indians,

56:54.659 --> 56:56.516
they'll be laughing at you.

56:56.541 --> 57:03.262
What they say is a great secret, and the mantras
they gave was, one was I heard, was "tinga"

57:03.287 --> 57:07.229
means like this you show to someone you see
this is "tinga", in Hindi language.

57:07.481 --> 57:11.444
There is nothing like "ing" in Sanskrit Language.

57:11.689 --> 57:14.342
Another mantra I heard was "inga".

57:14.367 --> 57:20.356
"Inga" means the tail of the, the sting of
a scorpion, can you imagine that could be

57:20.436 --> 57:21.309
it.

57:21.519 --> 57:28.679
And then, where is the director of the flying
squad, is he there?

57:28.704 --> 57:31.018
He's hiding there at the back.

57:31.043 --> 57:34.406
Now what is the mantra for they gave you for
flying?

57:34.431 --> 57:36.061
What tubes?

57:36.086 --> 57:37.090
Who is there?

57:37.115 --> 57:38.632
Come along where is he?

57:38.657 --> 57:40.514
Yogi: "Bronchial tubes, Mother."

57:40.539 --> 57:42.569
Shri Mataji: Bronchial tubes.

57:43.701 --> 57:49.945
Bronchial tubes, bronchial tubes, they paid
six thousand pounds for getting that mantra

57:49.970 --> 57:51.146
for you.

57:53.805 --> 58:02.662
[laughter] Just imagine this bronchial tube
is one of them.

58:02.687 --> 58:05.191
Then they'll give a mantra of Rama.

58:05.216 --> 58:08.603
Take a more sensible thing, they might give
a mantra of Rama.

58:08.814 --> 58:11.107
But Rama where does He exist?

58:11.132 --> 58:13.644
Supposing I want to give a mantra of Buddha,
for example.

58:13.669 --> 58:15.493
Where is Buddha?

58:15.635 --> 58:19.161
Are you catching on Buddha or not, is the
main point.

58:19.524 --> 58:21.665
Where are you catching?

58:21.690 --> 58:23.072
Where is Rama?

58:23.097 --> 58:25.649
Rama resides in what part?

58:25.796 --> 58:29.050
Is it necessary to give this mantra or not?

58:29.075 --> 58:31.760
They don't know anything, no knowledge of
any kind just at random.

58:31.785 --> 58:41.118
At the age of six years to twenty years give
the mantra what is it, "pinga" then another

58:41.143 --> 58:47.500
one "tinga", another "ringa", according to
the age, not according to the Kundalin where

58:47.525 --> 58:48.525
it is.

58:48.863 --> 58:51.710
Now what is the danger of that, that's the
main point is.

58:52.238 --> 58:56.014
That supposing they give you a name of Rama,
they are not awakened people they are not

58:56.039 --> 58:59.115
connected with God, they are not authorized.

58:59.140 --> 59:02.732
Now you go on saying Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama,
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama like that, you see.

59:02.925 --> 59:07.528
The other way round you say mara, mara means
I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead.

59:08.290 --> 59:14.997
So you go on saying a mantra Rama, Rama, Rama,
now what happens that you are not connected

59:15.022 --> 59:20.371
with Rama at all, because you are not a realized
soul, neither the guru, the one who has taken

59:20.396 --> 59:26.132
three thousand pounds for giving you this
Rama mantra, is a realized soul.

59:26.832 --> 59:31.587
So when you are shouting like that Rama, Rama,
Rama, who will come to your help will be somebody

59:31.612 --> 59:34.927
dead as Mr. Rama somewhere.

59:34.952 --> 59:38.668
He will come to your help and he'll possess
you.

59:39.072 --> 59:44.861
With that you may start thinking because you
get an added personality and suddenly you

59:44.886 --> 59:48.580
feel you see you get more powers so called.

59:48.605 --> 59:52.937
Like Gauguin if you go on saying Gauguin,
Gauguin, Gauguin he might enter into you.

59:52.962 --> 59:58.016
You might start painting something and after
that finished you have no energy left because

59:58.041 --> 01:00:01.102
one horse is riding two men.

01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:06.915
But the worse thing that happens to you by
saying mantra is that you develop a terrible

01:00:06.963 --> 01:00:12.216
dent in this very important center called
Vishuddhi, specially the left Vishuddhi.

01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:14.957
And then they are frightened.

01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:16.566
If you ask them, "What is your mantra?"

01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:18.251
"Mother I won't tell you."

01:00:18.276 --> 01:00:18.766
"Why?"

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:21.727
"No that is not to be told."

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:28.358
All secrets in God's vision, in God's realm
there should be no secret at all, everything

01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:31.974
should be known, everybody should know what
is what.

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:34.838
Why should there be any secrets, I can't understand.

01:00:35.714 --> 01:00:40.097
For example everybody will know those who
are realized souls, where you are catching,

01:00:40.122 --> 01:00:41.775
what is your chakra, they'll tell you.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.862
Everybody will say the same.

01:00:43.898 --> 01:00:48.259
Like one day one gentleman came he said, "Why
are they all coming and asking me 'How is

01:00:48.284 --> 01:00:49.620
your father?'"

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:53.693
I said, "Because your Rama's chakra is catching."

01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:56.635
That's exactly the mantra you will take.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:01.571
So your chakra is caught, that is the one
that the name they give you because you're

01:01:01.596 --> 01:01:07.446
insulting the deity and this Vishuddhi chakra,
by which you say also is caught up, and from

01:01:07.471 --> 01:01:09.470
there it goes as guilt to the left.

01:01:09.548 --> 01:01:14.270
If you should try to correct a person it acts
as a guilt and he gets a problem on the left

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:17.808
hand side Vishuddhi which is a very, very
big problem.

01:01:19.599 --> 01:01:27.473
Seeker: Japanese religious sect gives Buddhist
mantra called Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.625
Shri Mataji: Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, I know.

01:01:31.885 --> 01:01:39.294
You see Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a great thing,
but not by these Japanese people.

01:01:40.084 --> 01:01:42.833
Japanese less said the better.

01:01:42.858 --> 01:01:50.142
I met the person called, his name I have forgotten.

01:01:50.566 --> 01:01:53.333
He was the head of the Zen system.

01:01:53.358 --> 01:01:56.542
Now see Zen is Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:58.019 --> 01:02:00.736
To be realized is to be Zen.

01:02:01.568 --> 01:02:06.473
But this fellow had a frozen Kundalini just
like that there just sitting settled down.

01:02:06.695 --> 01:02:15.119
So I told him, "Sir with very humble understanding
I would like to say, that are you really a

01:02:15.144 --> 01:02:16.144
Zen?"

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.474
He said, "I'm teaching Zen, but I'm not."

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.908
I said, "Why?"

01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:29.992
He said, "Altogether from the sixth century
till today, only up to the eight century we

01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:32.875
had Prashapas [MAYBE Prashapas or Pashyapas
or Kashyapas - SG] means realized souls."

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:37.372
Only till the eighth century and after that
what followed was this kind of people who

01:02:37.397 --> 01:02:39.463
had the Kundalini just settled down there.

01:02:39.488 --> 01:02:41.493
But at least he was honest.

01:02:41.518 --> 01:02:44.852
And he was suffering from a horrible disease
for which he came to Me.

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:50.929
So I said, "At least you do not propagate
now Zen, because you are not a Zen."

01:02:51.055 --> 01:02:53.583
You are a Christian, are you?

01:02:53.608 --> 01:02:55.330
Ask anyone who is he.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.926
This artificial baptism is not Christianity.

01:02:57.951 --> 01:03:02.274
Is the real baptism, raising of the Kundalini.

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:05.261
Is the Kundalini piercing through?

01:03:05.286 --> 01:03:06.705
Are you a muslim?

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:10.764
You are not because you are not a pir, you
are to be a realized soul first.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:18.402
So imagine all these people who are teaching
all these things are not authorized at all.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.910
But they'll come round, I'm sure.

01:03:29.935 --> 01:03:36.302
Seeker asks a question: I was interested in
Your comment when You said Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:40.172
is fine but not any Japanese...

01:03:40.197 --> 01:03:42.100
Shri Mataji: You see now I'll tell you.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:45.470
It is very simple to understand, you understand
one point which you are missing all the time.

01:03:45.495 --> 01:03:52.191
Is this that supposing there is a constable
standing there and he says, "Go this way,"

01:03:52.216 --> 01:03:57.790
all right, we have to obey him otherwise you'll
end in jail he's authorized, isn't it?

01:03:57.815 --> 01:04:03.442
But supposing I go and stand there and say,
"Go this way," they'll put Me in jail.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:07.821
They have no authority from God to do it because
they are not realized souls.

01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:14.392
The same mantra becomes a great mantra when
it comes from an authorized person from God.

01:04:14.774 --> 01:04:22.167
But the same mantra becomes a sinful thing
when it comes from a person who is not authorized,

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:24.520
who's just commercialized it.

01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:33.465
[Seeker interrupts] Is it gone into your head
what I told you, that you are to be authorized

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:34.490
by God?

01:04:34.515 --> 01:04:36.887
That is you should be self-realized.

01:04:36.912 --> 01:04:41.314
If you are not self-realized you have no right
to give any mantras or anything, do you follow

01:04:41.339 --> 01:04:42.042
this point, simple point.

01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:42.583
Seeker: Sure.

01:04:42.608 --> 01:04:44.434
Shri Mataji: Now that's all.

01:04:44.459 --> 01:04:48.549
So you get your Realization, that's important,
which you should.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:53.044
But I don't know how it works out, you see
that is not My guarantee.

01:04:53.334 --> 01:04:56.326
If it works out well and good, may not work
out today.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.668
So better put attention to that, it's important.

01:05:00.693 --> 01:05:02.028
May God Bless you.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:08.338
Is there any other question now?

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:13.445
Put attention to that, that is important.

01:05:21.369 --> 01:05:25.526
But one thing more, when you follow them you
never ask questions.

01:05:25.893 --> 01:05:32.983
I had one lady from a lama she came down from
Norway, she was horrid, absolutely horrid.

01:05:33.008 --> 01:05:36.120
Her vibrations were, what was her name Gavin?

01:05:36.145 --> 01:05:36.891
Gavin: Pia

01:05:36.916 --> 01:05:40.824
Shri Mataji: Pia.

01:05:41.952 --> 01:05:44.490
She came to My house I said, "Baba!

01:05:44.515 --> 01:05:47.608
How to raise her Kundalini, baba, dreadful."

01:05:47.782 --> 01:05:51.289
And she was thinking no end of herself and
arguing, arguing with Me throughout, and all

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.314
that.

01:05:52.594 --> 01:05:55.874
I said, "How did you happen," I mean she has
been to this lama.

01:05:55.899 --> 01:05:57.382
I said, "What happened?"

01:05:57.407 --> 01:06:01.639
She said, "No, he wrote to us that I can't
live in an ordinary house you have to make

01:06:01.664 --> 01:06:02.989
a marble floor.

01:06:03.014 --> 01:06:07.588
So first we all starved ourselves, within
one year we collected money made a marble

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:08.829
floor for the fellow.

01:06:08.854 --> 01:06:13.055
So he came and was sitting on the seventh
step and we were first one year we had to

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.207
just go and bow to him just like this."

01:06:16.087 --> 01:06:21.588
One thousand and one time can you imagine
everyday and "I've done that course."

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.772
But I said, "Didn't you argue with him?"

01:06:25.797 --> 01:06:26.759
She said, "No."

01:06:26.784 --> 01:06:30.162
Then I said, "Why are you arguing with Me?"

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:35.717
Of course I like that you argue because that
shows you are free to argue, I've not mesmerized

01:06:35.933 --> 01:06:38.468
you, but must see the sense.

01:06:39.438 --> 01:06:43.032
How do we accept Buddha, let's see.

01:06:43.057 --> 01:06:45.294
Have you seen Buddha?

01:06:48.999 --> 01:06:51.061
Have you met him?

01:06:51.582 --> 01:06:57.089
Have you met anybody who is a Buddhist who
says he can give Realization?

01:07:00.424 --> 01:07:08.069
But then why are we the pleaders of Buddha
whom we have never seen, who has gone away,

01:07:08.094 --> 01:07:09.883
we don't know anything about Him.

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:10.908
Why?

01:07:11.337 --> 01:07:12.885
Because I am living He is not.

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:17.160
When He was living there were people who were
asking about other people.

01:07:18.394 --> 01:07:24.426
So better be in the present and get it your
Realization, all right, that's what it is.

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:29.264
That's what happened with Buddha he couldn't
give Realization to anyone whatsoever.

01:07:29.289 --> 01:07:32.412
Sariputa, Mogallana, all were wasted people.

01:07:32.437 --> 01:07:33.954
Same with Christ.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.970
Because when Krishna came they said, "What
about Rama?"

01:07:41.447 --> 01:07:45.185
When Rama came they said, "What about Dattatreya?"

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.246
But where is Dattatreya now?

01:07:47.271 --> 01:07:49.343
Rama is standing here why not get it from
Him.

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.072
So everybody failed.

01:07:51.097 --> 01:07:53.783
They said, "They are talking about the past
only."

01:07:54.575 --> 01:07:56.476
What about the present?

01:07:56.501 --> 01:08:00.445
You are sitting before Me, I am sitting before
you, have your Realization.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:03.804
Why argue about it?

01:08:06.024 --> 01:08:12.887
If there's a diamond and if I say you can
have it free will you argue?

01:08:13.443 --> 01:08:16.867
You understand diamond better than our Spirit.

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:20.347
Always we did that but this time better not
miss it.

01:08:20.372 --> 01:08:24.263
I'm telling you better have your Realization,
it's important.

01:08:30.791 --> 01:08:35.909
Of course Buddha plays a very big role within
us but first get your Spirit otherwise it

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.849
has no authority.

01:08:39.357 --> 01:08:43.492
The knowledge of Buddha has no authority within
you unless and until you become the Buddha

01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:44.634
yourself.

01:08:51.383 --> 01:08:53.549
All right, now let's have it.

01:08:53.574 --> 01:08:56.986
At the end of it I would request you to have
your Realization.

01:08:57.314 --> 01:09:00.370
Put your hands like this towards Me just like
this.

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.423
Better now, relaxed, all right, nice.

01:09:06.448 --> 01:09:08.486
Put your hands like this.

01:09:08.659 --> 01:09:14.438
It works, it works that's the point is, it
should work, isn't it?

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:17.829
Now close your eyes, please.

01:09:21.354 --> 01:09:25.412
Just close your eyes, you have to keep your
eyes shut that's important because when the

01:09:25.437 --> 01:09:30.492
Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra if
your eyes are not closed it will fall down,

01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:31.759
so please close your eyes.

01:09:31.784 --> 01:09:34.805
There's no mesmerism that's why you have to
close your eyes.

01:09:46.078 --> 01:09:48.955
Just keep your eyes shut.

01:10:50.182 --> 01:10:53.934
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Take the baby out,
please.]

01:11:44.854 --> 01:11:49.481
Just sit comfortably don't move, don't make
any gestures nothing, nothing outward.

01:11:49.517 --> 01:11:52.509
You have to be inside, it will work out inside.

01:11:52.534 --> 01:11:54.871
Nothing should work out outside.

01:11:54.896 --> 01:11:56.163
Just keep quiet.

01:11:56.188 --> 01:11:57.991
Just put your hand towards Me.

01:11:58.016 --> 01:12:01.221
Whatever has to work out will work out inside,
not outside.

01:13:17.742 --> 01:13:23.579
Don't open your eyes but don't fix your attention
anywhere, keep it loose, just keep it loose,

01:13:23.604 --> 01:13:25.795
don't fix it at a point, please.

01:13:25.837 --> 01:13:32.203
Don't try to fix it at - some people are fixing
it at the point what we call the Agnya chakra

01:13:32.239 --> 01:13:33.239
or anything.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:37.192
At the most you can put your attention on
top of your head.

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:41.773
But don't try to fix it anywhere keep it loose,
absolutely loose.

01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:54.844
Now with your right hand, which is the hand
of your creativity or the action power, you

01:13:54.869 --> 01:14:01.150
have to use the right hand to express your
action and the left hand is a desire.

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:05.841
So you have to put the left hand towards Me
for the desire but don't open your eyes, just

01:14:05.866 --> 01:14:11.240
on the lap you can keep it comfortably as
it is and you have to just move your right

01:14:11.265 --> 01:14:13.749
hand but keep the fingers straight.

01:14:13.774 --> 01:14:17.779
Straight fingers toward Me and move the right
hand as I tell you.

01:14:17.804 --> 01:14:22.760
No, on the lap left hand on the lap and the
right hand I'll tell you how to move it.

01:14:22.785 --> 01:14:25.858
Now put the right hand, no left hand toward
Me.

01:14:25.883 --> 01:14:30.064
Sahaja Yogis should see left hand towards
Me now move the right hand.

01:14:30.089 --> 01:14:35.500
Left hand on your lap comfortably, please
put left hand on your lap.

01:14:36.211 --> 01:14:40.659
Left hand on your lap, yes very comfortably.

01:14:40.684 --> 01:14:45.179
Now the right hand you have to put it on your
heart.

01:14:45.461 --> 01:14:49.010
Heart where resides your Spirit.

01:14:51.428 --> 01:14:59.775
Now in your heart you have to ask a question
to Me, "Mother am I the Spirit?"

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.871
Just put it on the right hand side.

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:09.723
Those who are very much on the left but actually
it is on the left hand side is the heart.

01:15:09.748 --> 01:15:15.449
You see those who are putting it too much
toward the left should put it at the proper

01:15:15.474 --> 01:15:18.292
place of your heart is on the left hand side.

01:15:18.317 --> 01:15:20.588
Now press it with your fingers.

01:15:20.613 --> 01:15:25.282
And just ask a question, "Mother am I the
spirit?"

01:15:28.645 --> 01:15:32.169
Say it thrice, ask a question with full confidence.

01:15:41.061 --> 01:15:47.090
Now please put this right hand, don't open
your eyes, on your stomach on the left hand

01:15:47.115 --> 01:15:48.281
side again.

01:15:48.735 --> 01:15:59.107
Lower part of the stomach and push it and
ask the question again to Me, "Mother am I

01:15:59.132 --> 01:16:03.333
my own Master, am I my own Guru?"

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:09.428
Because you are, and this Spirit is your Guru.

01:16:09.453 --> 01:16:16.089
But when you are asking Me a question, "Mother
am I the Spirit?" you have to ask the second

01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:20.980
question, "Mother am I my own Guru, am I my
own Spirit?"

01:16:21.224 --> 01:16:29.301
Because the Spirit is the Guru, which is awakened
within you, when you get your Realization.

01:16:29.326 --> 01:16:31.563
So you have to say, "Mother am I my own Guru?"

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.260
Say it ten times.

01:16:34.858 --> 01:16:37.969
Ask the question ten times.

01:16:52.758 --> 01:16:55.537
The times are according to the chakras.

01:17:04.528 --> 01:17:12.446
Keep the left hand the same way and now put
again the right hand on the heart.

01:17:13.382 --> 01:17:24.979
And now you assert with confidence that, "Mother
I am the Spirit," which you are.

01:17:35.057 --> 01:17:38.664
This you have to do it twelve times, twelve
times.

01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:46.465
Ten plus two, twelve times you have to say,
"Mother I am the Spirit."

01:17:46.806 --> 01:17:54.132
With confidence, with full confidence you
should say, "Mother I am the Spirit," full

01:17:54.157 --> 01:17:55.110
confidence.

01:18:19.239 --> 01:18:30.325
Now take this right hand across to the left
side of your neck, left side of your neck.

01:18:32.178 --> 01:18:34.951
Again was I said left Vishuddhi.

01:18:34.988 --> 01:18:44.692
Because the Spirit is immaculate, absolute,
it never does any mistakes so there is no

01:18:44.717 --> 01:18:46.665
question of feeling guilty.

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:51.869
So you have to say sixteen times now that,
"Mother I am not guilty."

01:18:51.894 --> 01:19:03.847
Say it sixteen times, again with full confidence,
because we're talking about God Almighty who

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:16.335
is the ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness,
ocean of compassion, sixteen times.

01:20:10.467 --> 01:20:16.210
Now again raise the left hand without opening
your eyes, to your forehead.

01:20:16.446 --> 01:20:22.875
Across your forehead, across your forehead,
and hold your forehead in your hand, right

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.698
hand, left hand being towards Me.

01:20:25.723 --> 01:20:34.849
At this point is the Agnya chakra where you
have to say that, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:20:35.208 --> 01:20:40.047
Now some of you might say that I cannot forgive
is a very common thing people tell Me.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:44.134
But when you don't forgive what you are doing
is to play into the hands of people who try

01:20:44.159 --> 01:20:45.159
to harm you.

01:20:45.264 --> 01:20:50.073
So you just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:20:51.297 --> 01:20:59.062
With full understanding, without any reservation,
"I forgive everyone."

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:05.266
Unless and until you forgive everyone how
can God forgive you?

01:21:05.291 --> 01:21:11.030
So let God forgive you for your mistakes what
you have done in your ignorance but don't

01:21:11.055 --> 01:21:12.459
feel guilty about it.

01:21:12.484 --> 01:21:17.162
Only you just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:21:20.831 --> 01:21:28.044
Now put this hand on top of your head, right
hand again where the soft bone was there when

01:21:28.069 --> 01:21:29.289
you were a child.

01:21:29.314 --> 01:21:34.213
Press it with your palm that portion and move
it in a clockwise manner.

01:21:34.555 --> 01:21:38.981
Press that palm and move it in a clockwise
manner.

01:21:42.122 --> 01:21:46.370
Now at this point I cannot cross your freedom.

01:21:48.122 --> 01:21:52.995
It's your freedom, which I respect, you have
to say that you want realization.

01:21:54.114 --> 01:21:57.769
So, here you have to say, "Mother we want
our realization.

01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:01.457
Please give us the Realization," otherwise
I cannot cross.

01:22:01.482 --> 01:22:03.147
So please say this seven times.

01:22:32.199 --> 01:22:36.586
Now you can raise your hand and see if there
is a cool breeze coming.

01:22:36.611 --> 01:22:40.668
Some people might be getting the heat coming
out of their heads.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:47.023
Raise it higher to see if there is a cool
breeze coming out.

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:50.602
So many of you are still feeling guilty, is
a wrong thing.

01:22:50.627 --> 01:22:52.602
I've told you not to feel guilty.

01:22:52.627 --> 01:22:54.653
Just see if there is a cool breeze coming
out.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:58.644
Now you can take another hand, left hand and
see with your left hand.

01:22:59.113 --> 01:23:03.253
You can change over and see if there is a
cool breeze coming out.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:07.660
Not very much higher say about four inches
higher.

01:23:09.311 --> 01:23:13.771
You can change over another hand.

01:23:16.232 --> 01:23:21.008
You just see if this gentleman has got it,
Ruth see his.

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:31.625
You got it, you feeling in the hand also,
not in the hand.

01:23:31.744 --> 01:23:34.698
He's got in the hand, you got it, it's very
subtle.

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.104
It's a subtle thing.

01:23:36.151 --> 01:23:40.038
You are coming from a gross level to a subtler
place.

01:24:06.295 --> 01:24:08.051
All right, you have to do that left to the
right.

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:12.314
Put your hands toward Me still, see the Sahaja
Yogis will help you now.

01:24:12.453 --> 01:24:15.792
Once you become Sahaja Yogis you have to help
others, all right.

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.411
They know about your chakras.

01:24:19.112 --> 01:24:20.950
Is he all right?

01:24:23.944 --> 01:24:25.903
All right try to help Matha?

01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:32.151
See this gentleman, no.

01:24:40.565 --> 01:24:43.823
Left to the right, put him left to the right.

01:24:45.409 --> 01:24:50.556
Is he all right, all right?

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:52.617
Not yet in the hand.

01:24:55.214 --> 01:24:57.644
You just watch Me without thinking.

01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:59.605
Can you do it?

01:25:03.144 --> 01:25:07.869
Got it, got it she said she's a Sahaja Yogini.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:10.953
What about him?

01:25:12.795 --> 01:25:14.579
Got it, see there.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.060
(Shri Mataji speaks to someone in Marathi)

01:25:20.334 --> 01:25:21.334
See the new people please.

01:25:25.284 --> 01:25:29.935
No, no don't stop yet put (inaudible.)

01:25:31.101 --> 01:25:35.326
Put it left to the right.

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:43.507
(Shri Mataji speaks to someone in Marathi)
Vishuddi , Nabhi (Shri Mataji speaks to someone

01:25:43.532 --> 01:25:46.235
