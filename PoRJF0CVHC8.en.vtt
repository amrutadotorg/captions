00:01.840 --> 00:08.160
I congratulate all the Sahaja Yogis of Melbourne

00:09.440 --> 00:12.760
for doing such a wonderful job of this ashram

00:14.640 --> 00:17.760
and working it out with such dedication.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.440
Dedication is a very great rewarding effort.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.160
Nothing can be more rewarding than dedication,

00:31.360 --> 00:37.640
it's so joy giving and peace giving and satisfying

00:42.160 --> 00:46.440
effort or work you can call it.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.840
When it comes from the heart,

00:50.440 --> 00:51.640
with love,

00:52.640 --> 00:54.240
when you try to do something,

00:55.840 --> 00:57.760
it works out beautifully

01:02.160 --> 01:04.760
and it shows its aesthetics,

01:06.040 --> 01:10.760
expresses, and anyone

01:11.040 --> 01:15.440
who sees that can see that it is done out of dedication.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.160
Example of dedication is Ajanta and Ellora Caves are.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.160
These were the people who were worshippers of Buddha.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.240
Of course they were not realized souls as you are.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.360
They were just worshippers of Buddha

01:32.040 --> 01:35.360
and they wanted to have their moksha, nirvana,

01:35.640 --> 01:36.840
of what you have got already.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.760
But they worked in that cave with such attention

01:43.080 --> 01:47.560
and such love that even when they were not in Yoga,

01:48.280 --> 01:50.480
when they were not in union with God,

01:51.280 --> 01:53.280
they were so much blessed

01:53.560 --> 01:58.160
that in that dark caves where we cannot see with our

01:59.480 --> 02:00.360
normal eyes,

02:00.680 --> 02:07.160
we can't even see those things with ordinary lights,

02:07.480 --> 02:09.680
you have to use very strong lights

02:09.960 --> 02:14.160
to see that - in those days it worked out,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.360
in those dark caves,

02:17.480 --> 02:23.480
such beautiful murals,

02:23.760 --> 02:29.560
paintings, reliefs, statues, every sort of thing,

02:30.760 --> 02:33.160
that it is surprising how they could do it.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.360
When we walk in, we have to use very strong lights

02:36.680 --> 02:39.080
and because of these strong lights,

02:39.760 --> 02:41.160
that is fading now.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.280
But we can see the dedication

02:46.560 --> 02:48.760
that they had to God.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.880
They did not believe in God, but to Lord Buddha

02:53.960 --> 02:57.960
so that they can get their moksha, their Self-realization.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.480
Maybe, so many of them are born again today

03:03.280 --> 03:04.480
to get their realization

03:05.480 --> 03:08.400
and they might be some of the Sahaja yogis

03:09.400 --> 03:11.480
that we are meeting them in Maharashtra,

03:12.200 --> 03:14.280
those who worked for Lord Buddha

03:15.000 --> 03:18.400
to express their love and dedication.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.200
So dedication takes away all the

03:30.880 --> 03:37.000
wastage interest like

03:38.480 --> 03:41.080
how much money we are going to get,

03:43.200 --> 03:47.080
what is our certificate,

03:48.280 --> 03:53.080
whether it's going to be used in the world wide range or not.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.880
All these things are finished.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.800
You just do it for doing's sake.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.680
And you don't feel at all, at all,

04:02.280 --> 04:06.600
any pinch or any,

04:12.400 --> 04:15.600
what you can call the screwing up of your energies

04:15.880 --> 04:17.400
but you just float.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.000
This is what dedication is,

04:21.600 --> 04:24.200
and this dedication comes

04:24.480 --> 04:29.400
when you realize that you are a Spirit.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.400
It's much better because that is the place

04:35.720 --> 04:38.120
where Shri Krishna has said, ananya bhakti,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.920
when there is not the other, you and your God,

04:42.200 --> 04:44.920
in between there is nobody else ananya.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.000
Nobody else. You and your God are one

04:49.320 --> 04:52.720
and that is the best time when the dedication works.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.800
That is the bhakti,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.920
that's what He said that,  "If you give Me flower,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.120
if you give Me water,

05:03.000 --> 05:04.720
or if you give Me leaves,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.320
I accept everything."

05:06.800 --> 05:09.000
But when it comes to His giving,

05:09.320 --> 05:11.920
He said we should get ananya bhakti

05:12.200 --> 05:13.600
This is the blessing of God.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.720
There's one of the sayings about the Goddess is

05:21.000 --> 05:25.720
that, Ya Devi Sarva bhuteshu, bhakti rupena samsthitah

05:26.320 --> 05:28.520
- "The one who gives us that dedication,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.200
that sense of dedication,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.600
You are the one who resides in everyone

05:34.920 --> 05:36.720
with that sense of dedicating."

05:38.240 --> 05:41.720
And it is such a joy that cannot be expressed

05:42.640 --> 05:46.240
what this is, that one you feel

05:46.520 --> 05:47.640
when you are dedicated.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.440
This morning, you all got up, all ready,

05:52.120 --> 05:55.320
all the children are happily dressed, everything was done.

05:55.640 --> 06:00.120
I saw everyone busy getting everything ready

06:00.440 --> 06:03.320
and working it out so beautifully.

06:04.640 --> 06:10.320
It's something so loving

06:11.120 --> 06:13.520
as if the Mother Earth gives flowers

06:14.240 --> 06:15.920
for the worship of your Mother.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.440
You yourself in your dedication look like flowers,

06:20.720 --> 06:22.240
yourself like lotuses.

06:22.920 --> 06:28.800
It's so great to see this work being done,

06:29.120 --> 06:33.720
with such attention, with such care, with such love.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.720
Melbourne I think is a word called from mala born,

06:39.040 --> 06:40.720
we can say born out of mala

06:41.040 --> 06:43.120
and that is the name of the lotus,

06:44.040 --> 06:48.720
that it is born out of the dirt and the filth.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.320
Mala is the dirt or impurity.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.240
So this beautiful thing has come out of that

06:54.440 --> 06:55.920
and you can see that this place

06:56.240 --> 07:00.160
was inhabited by people who were really in a mess.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.960
And out of that mess

07:02.160 --> 07:05.240
you have created such a beautiful thing like this ashram.

07:05.560 --> 07:11.040
And is so much one with the name of Melbourne

07:11.360 --> 07:13.360
that this is a place is created

07:14.160 --> 07:20.040
by you people like a lotus comes out of the pond

07:20.360 --> 07:22.160
which is full of dirt and filth

07:22.440 --> 07:26.360
and then this lotus fills the whole atmosphere

07:26.640 --> 07:30.960
with such fragrance that everyone forgets about the mala.

07:31.240 --> 07:36.240
They just think of the Nirmala which is this flower,

07:36.560 --> 07:39.760
and this is what I felt about your ashram,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.840
the way you have done it with understanding,

07:42.160 --> 07:44.640
it's so good with such a lot of beautiful things

07:45.840 --> 07:50.360
and admirable it is really, to see how your dedication has done.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.440
Warren: There's a lotus for you there, Mother.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.760
I've seen that in the morning also. Beautiful.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.240
I told her that it will have fragrance.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.560
I can see so many lotuses sitting before Me.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.640
It's so beautiful.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.480
So this is all in dedication you see,

08:19.760 --> 08:23.280
this comes out of that mala just for the worship of God.

08:25.080 --> 08:32.160
And this K-mala, K-mala out of the mala,

08:32.480 --> 08:35.560
it is called as K-mala the name is K-mala

08:35.880 --> 08:36.960
it is called as K-mala

08:37.280 --> 08:39.680
it means  the one which is created out of mala.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.280
Same is the name of Melbourne I think,

08:42.560 --> 08:43.680
the way it is said.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.360
I don't know how this name has come Melbourne,

08:47.680 --> 08:51.080
but you can say Mel-born, can be mala born,

08:51.360 --> 08:52.680
could be K-mala like that.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.760
And it is really this place has become like that.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.960
Let anybody else come and see this and they will be amazed,

09:00.280 --> 09:03.560
how the whole thing is so beautiful,

09:03.880 --> 09:10.080
so comforting, so vibrating and so assuring.

09:11.960 --> 09:16.880
Now, we have already started doing such good work in Australia,

09:18.080 --> 09:20.160
and I'm sure you are going to get

09:20.480 --> 09:25.680
lots of people for your ashram to stay here.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.560
And also you might get lot of people also to work on them.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.080
But you have to be rather careful

09:32.400 --> 09:33.560
when you admit them here.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.600
You must see first of all how they work it out.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.480
You first work them out outside,

09:39.800 --> 09:42.800
see how their chakras are, how they are,

09:43.080 --> 09:49.800
how their behavior is, and how they are attached to things.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.000
Once you find them all right,

09:52.280 --> 09:55.800
then you can have them inside, but be careful.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.680
You'd better send Me their photographs.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.680
Let Me see for Myself if they are all right,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.680
because you might get some very good people,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.080
if you are lucky enough,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.280
you will get as you have seen some very good people

10:08.480 --> 10:09.800
have come already.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.880
Such nice, solid people. I'm so amazed to see these new people here

10:14.200 --> 10:16.280
that you can't believe that they have been in Sahaja Yoga

10:16.280 --> 10:19.600
only for such a short time and they are so good

10:19.880 --> 10:21.600
and so beautifully placed there.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.200
I hope you'll get more like this,

10:25.480 --> 10:29.200
many more like this of the same value, same quality

10:30.200 --> 10:35.800
and something good will come out of all their

10:36.400 --> 10:38.920
entry into your ashram.

10:39.520 --> 10:44.720
I bless you for getting all the best people of Melbourne

10:45.520 --> 10:50.000
to be in your contact, of very high level spirituality

10:50.320 --> 10:54.000
and seeking and purity and simplicity.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.720
I find the people in Melbourne are very simple people,

10:59.320 --> 11:02.600
are extremely simple and very expressive.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.920
The simpler you are, you are much more expressive.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.120
The more complicated you are, the worse it becomes.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.920
And for your Mother is difficult to understand

11:12.200 --> 11:13.400
something who is complicated.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.720
See, it can go round and round and round,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.520
so I like when it is a very simple expression of their love

11:22.200 --> 11:25.520
and joy that I can perceive it so clearly

11:25.720 --> 11:29.320
and it gives Me a great love

11:29.600 --> 11:34.720
like the ripples of the shores.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.520
They return back in the same way from My heart

11:38.800 --> 11:45.400
also joy is rebounding again towards you.

11:45.720 --> 11:49.000
It's a kind of a beautiful rapport

11:50.000 --> 11:52.320
where nobody gains, nobody loses,

11:52.600 --> 11:55.400
everybody elevates oneself that's all.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.000
Sort of a thing is something so different

11:58.640 --> 12:02.040
that it cannot be explained in any analogy.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.640
Dedication to Sahaja Yoga,

12:07.240 --> 12:10.920
your purity about it,

12:11.800 --> 12:14.320
without asking for any gains,

12:14.920 --> 12:16.800
asking for any advantage.

12:17.520 --> 12:21.440
Just working it out because now you are the gurus.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.520
You don't have to ask anything, you have to just give.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.440
The more you give the more you'll get.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.640
I don't mean that you have to give any money

12:28.800 --> 12:30.640
or anything but you have to give more love.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.120
The more love you give the more love you'll get

12:34.440 --> 12:37.440
and that is how it is going to work out for all of you.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.040
I'm sure a day will come

12:41.520 --> 12:45.040
when we will become extremely powerful

12:45.920 --> 12:49.720
in every place in Australia.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.720
Now we have chosen only four centers,

12:54.320 --> 12:58.640
and we have to work it out in a proper way

12:58.920 --> 13:03.320
without going into quarrels, fighting, back-biting,

13:03.520 --> 13:05.720
all these small things, and selfishness.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.320
Specially with children it happens,  "It's my child,

13:08.560 --> 13:09.960
it's my child," like that.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.840
Try to share. Try to understand others also.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.640
If you bring sweets for one child,

13:15.840 --> 13:17.040
it should be for all of them.

13:17.360 --> 13:21.960
And also with food, also, don't try to keep back anything

13:22.240 --> 13:25.640
because children will also learn these bad habits, you see.

13:25.960 --> 13:27.040
Nothing to be kept back.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.440
Tell them how to share,

13:28.760 --> 13:30.160
that's something one must learn,

13:30.440 --> 13:33.640
to teach the children that they must know how to share,

13:33.960 --> 13:36.640
how to be gentle, how to be kind,

13:36.960 --> 13:44.240
how to be adjustable and not to be fussy.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.240
If some child is fussy, try to treat the child,

13:47.560 --> 13:50.040
because it's a disease which must be got rid of.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.760
So all these petty things if you just now to look after,

13:53.240 --> 13:55.760
then you'll find your children are great

13:55.960 --> 13:57.240
because they are born realized.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.160
And it's such a blessing to have born realized children

14:00.360 --> 14:02.240
because God's attention is specially on you

14:02.560 --> 14:04.480
because they are born realized children,

14:04.760 --> 14:08.160
so you must have full idea as to what is to be done with them,

14:08.480 --> 14:09.560
how to look after them,

14:09.880 --> 14:15.080
how to give them full nourishment of spirituality.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.280
You yourself should be so good

14:17.560 --> 14:20.160
that they should see you as a foundation

14:20.480 --> 14:22.480
and they should try to follow you.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.560
It is not so much the precept of Sahaja Yoga

14:25.880 --> 14:27.880
which is important, one must know

14:28.160 --> 14:30.760
is the practice because precepts are great,

14:31.080 --> 14:32.280
you know I'm there,

14:32.480 --> 14:35.880
but the children are going to see you, not Me so much.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.080
So it's better that you also

14:38.360 --> 14:40.880
practice Sahaja Yoga in your everyday life.

14:41.160 --> 14:45.080
And one simple word one has to remember is that

14:45.360 --> 14:48.960
you love your Mother and your Mother loves you.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
In the same way, you must love others.

14:51.560 --> 14:56.160
But there's one thing that gives you

14:56.360 --> 14:59.360
the real idea of love, is discretion.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.280
Spoiling somebody is not love.

15:02.560 --> 15:05.080
Ruining somebody is not love.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.400
Love is that which elevates you, takes you higher.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.600
False sympathies, identifications,

15:12.880 --> 15:15.600
always spoil the lives of people.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.800
But discreet love,

15:19.080 --> 15:21.280
and love is the thing that gives you the power,

15:21.600 --> 15:24.400
love itself gives you that wisdom to be discreet.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.600
Love itself teaches you how to be discreet.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.200
In a beautiful way we have to be discreet,

15:30.480 --> 15:34.480
not to be harsh, angry, in a temper,

15:34.800 --> 15:39.280
but in a proper, artistic way you must know how discreetly

15:39.600 --> 15:43.400
you emit your spirituality to your children,

15:43.680 --> 15:46.680
to your friends, to your surroundings,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.880
to Sahaja yogis and to the whole world.

15:50.200 --> 15:56.200
But first step your attachment should be with Sahaja yogis.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.200
Never try to find faults with Sahaja yogis as far as possible.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.680
But if one person becomes too much,

16:03.000 --> 16:04.600
then all of you should oppose him

16:04.880 --> 16:07.800
and see to it that he is out of this place.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.600
But there could be few mishaps like that,

16:11.920 --> 16:14.920
maybe some people, one person like that may go out,

16:15.200 --> 16:16.600
then whosoever it may be,

16:16.720 --> 16:19.520
if he is harmful to Sahaja Yoga by any chance,

16:19.720 --> 16:21.720
and if you find there's something going wrong,

16:22.000 --> 16:23.920
you should see that that person goes out of

16:24.200 --> 16:26.720
the circulation of Sahaja Yoga.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.520
He goes out of Melbourne is the best.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.720
Such a person should get out of this place

16:30.920 --> 16:34.000
and should go to another center where he should be tried.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.120
That's how you can shift people

16:36.400 --> 16:39.400
who are little funny and misbehaving.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.520
For example, now as you told Me about some other center,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.400
send that person to Sydney

16:45.600 --> 16:48.320
or some other place to get corrected.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.520
If it doesn't work out in these four centers,

16:51.800 --> 16:53.920
then that person should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.120
That's the only way for the time being,

16:56.320 --> 16:57.720
get out of it. Stay out.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.400
Or maybe from one center to another center

17:00.720 --> 17:03.600
when you send that person ask him to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

17:03.920 --> 17:06.120
go and stay somewhere else, get lost.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.440
Maybe that person will be all right

17:09.720 --> 17:14.040
because the negative forces are mostly entering

17:14.320 --> 17:15.640
through the people who are weak,

17:17.920 --> 17:19.240
who are low level

17:19.520 --> 17:23.240
or who are attacked by possessions and things like that.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.440
So, because you know the water always goes towards the low level.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.240
In the same way negativity always flows to the low level people

17:31.520 --> 17:34.440
and these low level people try to drag other people

17:34.640 --> 17:37.120
who have gone higher because they feel jealous of them.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.120
If you find any such thing,

17:39.440 --> 17:44.240
then best thing is to ask such a person to get out of the ashrams,

17:44.520 --> 17:46.320
to go and stay somewhere else

17:46.520 --> 17:48.920
or go away from the city for some time

17:49.240 --> 17:50.920
and then return back,

17:51.240 --> 17:54.040
so they realize what it is without Sahaja Yoga

17:54.320 --> 17:56.120
and what it is in Sahaja Yoga.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.040
So they get full idea as to what they are doing.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.800
Sometimes, you know, Sahaja Yoga can be very much taken for granted

18:03.120 --> 18:05.120
because you get every blessing.

18:05.440 --> 18:09.240
You see you get yoga and kshema.

18:09.560 --> 18:13.840
You get children, you get beautiful houses,

18:14.160 --> 18:15.440
you get all the food,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.440
everything is organized for you, God does that.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.160
But then you take it for granted,

18:21.440 --> 18:24.160
and then you start thinking,  "Oh it's why this,

18:24.360 --> 18:27.840
it's why that?" That time one should know that

18:28.560 --> 18:31.240
it's not true, you must know it is God

18:31.560 --> 18:33.240
who is helping you in every way.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.560
We should be grateful to God for all that.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.560
But supposing if such a thing enters into anybody's mind,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.640
then such a person should not get to those ideas

18:42.840 --> 18:44.240
and try to distribute them to others.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.360
It's like a disease again.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.640
Such a person should get out of the ashram.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.040
Go and see for oneself what is it outside.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.960
What is it without Sahaja Yoga?

18:56.240 --> 18:58.840
How you meet people, how they treat you,

18:59.160 --> 19:01.040
what's your situation there.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.840
Then you'll realize what Sahaja Yoga is,

19:04.160 --> 19:07.080
how great it is, how much it has helped you

19:07.360 --> 19:10.160
and how God is kind to you specially,

19:10.480 --> 19:13.680
because those who are outside do not know

19:13.960 --> 19:16.680
these advantages of Sahaja Yoga,

19:16.960 --> 19:18.560
these blessings of Sahaja Yoga.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.560
So as you go out you will see them how they are.

19:22.880 --> 19:27.080
How funny they are, how absurd they are,

19:27.360 --> 19:28.760
and then when you come back

19:28.960 --> 19:31.360
you'll realize the value of Sahaja Yoga.

19:32.160 --> 19:37.360
So one should not accept all these ideas

19:37.680 --> 19:40.360
because it takes then a very long time

19:40.560 --> 19:42.760
for a person to come back, very long time.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.880
Once he goes out of the circulation, he goes out.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.760
As I've told before, many a times,

19:49.080 --> 19:51.680
that we have two types of forces working,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.480
centrifugal, and centripetal.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.080
By centripetal force you are taken inside the Sahaja Yoga.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.160
You are brought in with your Mother's love.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.160
But there's another force which is always equally working

20:03.480 --> 20:06.160
is the centrifugal which makes you

20:06.400 --> 20:09.000
get out of the circulation of Sahaja Yoga

20:09.280 --> 20:10.680
and you go at a tangent.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.600
You see, when you are moving something,

20:12.800 --> 20:14.400
say a stone or something,

20:14.680 --> 20:19.680
fixed with a thread or with a rope and you are moving it,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.400
suddenly you find the same thing

20:22.600 --> 20:24.400
which you are controlling from the center

20:24.680 --> 20:27.400
just gets out in a tangent.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.800
In the same way, it happens in Sahaja Yoga

20:30.080 --> 20:34.400
and once you go out it's very difficult to be picked back

20:34.680 --> 20:36.280
and to put back into circulation.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.680
And such people are always suspected, never trusted

20:40.000 --> 20:42.680
and it's a very difficult thing.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.280
It doesn't work out for months together, sometimes years together.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.680
It's a difficult thing.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
So I would suggest that even if you have certain doubts,

20:51.280 --> 20:52.800
you'd better keep them away.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.600
Try to fix your nails higher and higher

20:55.880 --> 20:58.480
and try to cling on to them and cling on to them

20:58.800 --> 21:02.480
because Sahaja Yoga is something so miraculous and so great.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.720
The whole thing is so great that it is not possible

21:07.000 --> 21:09.920
for human beings to conceive what they're achieving.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.800
You have really entered into the Kingdom of God.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.120
But you cannot conceive this still with your brain

21:16.400 --> 21:17.920
that what you have got,

21:18.200 --> 21:23.000
so must know that the greatest of greatest has happened to you.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.200
And to keep it up you must try to

21:29.000 --> 21:32.400
achieve higher levels and higher levels of spirituality

21:32.720 --> 21:35.120
and forget all that, forget other things,

21:35.400 --> 21:37.800
just try to go higher and higher

21:38.120 --> 21:41.600
with your dedication to yourself and to Sahaja Yoga.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.800
I bless you again and again

21:45.120 --> 21:48.400
for a higher ascent in your being

21:48.720 --> 21:50.920
and a deeper enjoyment in life.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.400
May God bless you.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.400
Yogi: How beautifully they have done everything.

22:14.720 --> 22:17.320
I can't help it, it is so beautiful…

22:27.600 --> 22:29.600
Let them relax, let them relax,

22:29.920 --> 22:31.120
you see children would relax now

22:31.320 --> 22:33.200
because it's so much in the vibrations.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.120
Let them relax, don't you worry.

22:39.720 --> 22:42.040
Let them relax. Let them do what they like.

22:43.120 --> 22:45.520
That's all right. And whatever they are,

22:45.800 --> 22:47.320
they are angels.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.720
They're all angels, really they're angels, you don't know.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.520
Yogi:Shall we worship You as Shri Ganesh first Mother?

23:01.720 --> 23:02.920
Yes, yes. It would be a good idea.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.520
Yogi: Then as the Devi?

23:04.720 --> 23:06.040
This is such a nice idea I tell you.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.640
It has never struck Indians.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.720
We have so much of marble in our country.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.720
It's a wonderful idea I tell you.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.040
It never starts before eleven.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.520
It's always a trial,

23:34.800 --> 23:37.040
today My sari was not ready for Me to wear.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.520
I didn't know what to do.
