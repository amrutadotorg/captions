00:02.640 --> 00:09.120
I told you yesterday how you feel your\h
seeking, why you feel your seeking,\h\h

00:10.640 --> 00:16.400
what is in us that works out this seeking.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.480
And this yoga is spontaneous.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.680
There is no other way you\h
can get your Realisation.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.080
Because if you have to germinate\h
a seed it has to have germination!\h\h

00:34.160 --> 00:38.640
In the same way, if you are to be\h
germinated into your new awareness,\h\h

00:41.200 --> 00:48.080
it has to be through your awakening of\h
Kundalini, because that is what it is there for.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.280
If you have to plug in this one (microphone)\h
to the mains, you have to use the chord,\h\h

00:53.280 --> 00:57.840
there’s no other way about it.

00:58.960 --> 01:04.960
As I told you yesterday that this beautiful\h
instrument is made, all the effort has been put.

01:06.160 --> 01:12.000
You have passed through — how much, much\h
we calculated for thirty-five crores?

01:12.000 --> 01:17.600
Yogi: Three hundred and fifty million.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.360
Shri Mataji: Three hundred and\h
fifty-million types of lives.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.480
And now you have become a human being.

01:24.880 --> 01:29.840
So, after all, there must be some meaning\h
to this beautiful human structure,\h\h

01:32.800 --> 01:35.840
this instrument [and] why it was created.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.840
There must be some reason for it.

01:40.960 --> 01:50.320
And, as you have got your human Realisation,\h
as you have got your human body,\h\h

01:52.240 --> 02:00.880
if you have to get to a more evolved personality\h
it has to be spontaneous, you cannot work it out.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.360
Should be a simple logic.

02:07.760 --> 02:14.720
You have done nothing to be a human being\h
and you are not to do anything to be higher.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.800
But maybe you have harmed yourself a little\h
bit, perhaps, by doing something wrong.

02:27.840 --> 02:33.200
And whatever wrong you have done to yourself also\h
can be corrected if the seed has to germinate.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.880
You are made like that, God has\h
made you specially for this purpose.

02:41.360 --> 02:45.760
He has made you from an\h
amoeba, from a carbon atom.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.720
Whether you believe in Him or not doesn’t matter.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.960
But if you see yourself, whosoever\h\h

02:55.520 --> 03:03.840
achieved this human body and human\h
mind must have been a fantastic artist.

03:05.120 --> 03:09.600
And it has been said that, if you\h
had left it to the Law of Chance,\h\h

03:09.600 --> 03:13.760
you could not have even produced a\h
small, little uni-cellular amoeba.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.640
So, in such a short time as that,\h\h

03:18.640 --> 03:22.720
if such a complex thing like Human Being\h
is created, there is a General behind it.

03:24.880 --> 03:32.160
Whether you believe it or not, that’s not\h
important, the thing is, it exists, and it works.

03:34.160 --> 03:38.560
Now within us we have this instrument placed.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.280
This very, very subtle\h
instrument is placed with us.

03:43.280 --> 03:59.920
Now I will tell you about the Kundalini – how\h
it works and what the different chakras are.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.040
These are all very subtle\h
centres as I told you yesterday.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.640
We cannot see them with your naked eyes,\h
but when the Kundalini starts rising,\h\h

04:09.840 --> 04:16.000
when it starts ascending, then you can see with\h
your naked eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini,\h\h

04:16.000 --> 04:18.400
and the pulsation at these chakras.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.040
Till it reaches here, you\h
can feel the pulsation here\h\h

04:21.600 --> 04:25.680
and till it is pulsating you\h
do not get your Realisation.

04:25.680 --> 04:32.480
Once the pulsation stops then you must know that\h
it has ended into that All-pervading Divine power.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.960
When that happens then you start\h
feeling that cool breeze in your hand.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.520
You start feeling a cool\h
radiation passing through you.

04:44.480 --> 04:48.800
That is the radiation of the\h
Holy Spirit within yourself.

04:51.600 --> 04:59.200
That is the radiation you are feeling from\h
your Spirit that resides in your heart.You\h\h

04:59.200 --> 05:03.120
can also feel your centres on your\h
fingers because now they are enlightened.

05:04.960 --> 05:10.160
Now all this, whatever I am telling\h
you, you can feel and verify.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.200
The time has come for you to\h
verify everything that I say.

05:16.480 --> 05:23.360
It has been said before, thousands of years\h
back, that within us lies the Kundalini.

05:23.360 --> 05:32.080
Adi Shankaracharya, sixth century, he said it\h
very, very clearly, openly, that there is this\h\h

05:32.080 --> 05:38.080
residual power which is awaiting in the triangular\h
bone as you see there, in three and a half coils,\h\h

05:40.160 --> 05:45.120
which ultimately awakens and gives you\h
your Realisation, your second birth.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.000
He had described it very clearly,\h
all the other centres also.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.040
But even much before, much, much\h
before that, thousands of years back,\h\h

05:57.040 --> 06:02.080
people have been working on the Kundalini\h
awakening, but it was kept a secret.

06:02.720 --> 06:12.480
They started working on few people as we\h
also, in our scientific research, first use it\h\h

06:12.480 --> 06:19.120
in a very guarded secret, try to find out\h
the different ways and methods and then,\h\h

06:19.760 --> 06:29.200
when it becomes absolutely perfect, then we make\h
it public and make it known to all of the people.

06:29.920 --> 06:36.480
Because unless and until any discovery is\h
useful to the masses it has no meaning.

06:38.400 --> 06:44.880
Today the time has come for you to know all\h
about it and that’s why now, here in Brighton,\h\h

06:45.520 --> 06:49.120
we are discussing it so openly\h
and trying to understand it.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.920
Now here, as you have seen,\h
in the triangular bone,\h\h

06:54.800 --> 06:58.160
is the Kundalini – three and a half coiled energy.

06:59.920 --> 07:05.040
This energy is pure energy of desire of God.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.200
It is His desire which is\h
within you, lying dormant.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.920
His desire has been throughout in His\h
whole Creation that He should create\h\h

07:17.920 --> 07:22.080
His own children who will understand\h
Him [and] when they understand Him,\h\h

07:22.080 --> 07:25.440
to give them all His powers for them to manifest.

07:26.400 --> 07:31.200
For them to enter into His Kingdom and to\h
reside in complete bliss and happiness.

07:32.240 --> 07:38.720
That He is the Collective Being, He is\h
the macrocosm and you are the microcosm.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.840
That you are cells in the big body, and\h
these cells are to be awakened and have to\h\h

07:45.840 --> 07:52.880
become one with the Whole, by which you get\h
your understanding of the Collective Being.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.840
The Collective Being is conscious of\h
you but you are not conscious of That.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.200
And that’s how the whole device was\h
made within you — how you are going\h\h

08:03.200 --> 08:05.600
to get it and how you are going to achieve it.

08:07.920 --> 08:12.640
You can see there are three lines which\h
are placed parallel to each other.

08:15.840 --> 08:22.800
The first blue line depicts the power to\h
desire — is the emotional side it looks after.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.840
This is manifested outside as\h
left sympathetic nervous system.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.480
Now the doctors do not know that the left\h
and right sympathetic nervous systems\h\h

08:33.200 --> 08:36.560
are there for doing two different types of work.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.040
So the Left Side is the power by which you desire,\h\h

08:44.400 --> 08:53.840
is the energy by which you get yourself\h
conditioned, by which you live in the past.

08:54.560 --> 08:59.840
This channel is called in the\h
Sanskrit language as ‘Ida Nadi’.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.200
The Right Side channel which you\h
see there, yellow coloured channel,\h\h

09:05.760 --> 09:13.680
is the power by which you create, by which\h
you can go to future, you think of the future.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.840
This is the one by which you plan for the future.

09:18.640 --> 09:24.720
This is the one with which you do your physical\h
things, which you want to do for future also.

09:24.720 --> 09:30.880
All sorts of future planning for your physical,\h
mental and your financial, or any such lives,\h\h

09:30.880 --> 09:34.960
is done through this energy of yours,\h
which is on the right hand side,\h\h

09:34.960 --> 09:38.880
which is called, this channel is\h
called, as the Pingala Channel.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.800
Now the colours are of the left side is the\h\h

09:45.520 --> 09:49.280
deep blue colour, as you see\h
there, actually amounting to black.

09:49.840 --> 09:55.120
And the one which is on the right\h
hand side is the yellow colour.

09:55.920 --> 10:04.240
Now when these two energies start working within\h
us, means one is of desiring another is of action.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.960
First we desire something\h
and then we go into action.

10:09.680 --> 10:12.080
When these two energies start working\h\h

10:12.080 --> 10:16.080
we produce a bi-product in our\h
head like the fumes in a factory.

10:16.880 --> 10:21.280
The fumes are called as ego and\h
super-ego, as you see them crossed over.

10:22.080 --> 10:28.880
When you use the blue side, which is the\h
desire, or iccha shakti as they call it,\h\h

10:29.520 --> 10:36.400
then you develop a super-ego and when you\h
work on the right side, you develop the ego.

10:38.160 --> 10:42.560
To understand ego and super-ego\h
in a very simple way, is this way,\h\h

10:42.560 --> 10:47.680
that, say when a child is nursed by the\h
mother, he is in complete bliss and joy.

10:49.120 --> 10:54.880
So the mother changes the sides for the\h
boy, the child, and he feels very much hurt.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.320
When he feels hurt his ego rises, he\h
thinks, “Why should she do it?” you see,\h\h

11:00.320 --> 11:03.520
in a very subtle way, and the ego starts rising.

11:03.520 --> 11:08.480
This is the ego, which you see there,\h
starts rising on the right hand side.

11:08.480 --> 11:13.920
I mean there is nothing wrong in\h
having ego, you have to have it.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.200
It works out that way.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.440
As every factory has to have a chimney,\h\h

11:17.440 --> 11:20.000
you don’t have a chimney so it\h
accumulates there in the head.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.960
On the left hand side, when\h
the child wants something,\h\h

11:24.960 --> 11:30.800
or he’s told not to do this, the mother says,\h
“Don’t do like that!” So you are conditioned.

11:30.800 --> 11:36.560
By that conditioning your super-ego is developed.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.080
When your ego is hurt I\h
would say, your ego develops.

11:40.640 --> 11:46.080
When your desire is hurt\h
then your super-ego develops.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.840
Gradually we start identifying\h
ourselves with our ego\h\h

11:49.840 --> 11:53.040
or super-ego depending on what\h
sort of a personality you are.

11:53.840 --> 11:58.880
Some people think that, “I do\h
this!” “I am this!” you see.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.000
Some of them are frightened,\h
“No, it’s too aggressive."

12:02.880 --> 12:06.640
But whatever it may be, either\h
you have ego or super-ego.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.920
Both of them develop just like\h
this as you see in the thing,\h\h

12:09.920 --> 12:15.280
and if one becomes more heavy\h
then it pushes down the other one.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.320
If this becomes more heavy\h
it pushes down this way.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.840
Now for Kundalini to pass in between\h
you have to have a space like that.

12:24.560 --> 12:31.040
If a person is of an imbalanced personality, then\h
Kundalini takes time to rise, She takes time.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.640
Now you can see the centre below\h
the Kundalini, which is a very,\h\h

12:36.640 --> 12:44.000
very important centre, we must know,\h
about which I have to tell you, in short.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.320
This is the centre which is\h
lying below the Kundalini.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.840
It’s not above.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.680
That means when the Kundalini pierces through\h
other centres it is not pierced through.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.160
But why is he there?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.120
Why is it there?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.840
It is there to give information to the Kundalini.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.480
It is the instrument which receives all the\h
information as to what you are doing, what\h\h

13:08.480 --> 13:14.000
are you up to, what are your desires, what you\h
are doing, what sort of people you are meeting,\h\h

13:14.000 --> 13:17.920
where you are going, what mistakes you are\h
committing, what good things you are committing.

13:17.920 --> 13:23.680
Everything is recorded in that Kundalini,\h
not only of this lifetime, but of many lives.

13:24.560 --> 13:30.320
Its collection of all that you have had\h
with you is inside the Kundalini, recorded.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.840
Kundalini knows what you have been.

13:35.600 --> 13:43.200
So this little thing that you see there is the\h
centre which lies very near the prostate gland\h\h

13:44.320 --> 13:49.680
and is the one who generates innocence within us.

13:53.520 --> 13:58.080
If you are innocent, you are like a child,\h
your Kundalini shoots off just like that,\h\h

13:58.080 --> 14:03.200
no problem! But if you are complicated\h
then it takes time because the\h\h

14:05.280 --> 14:10.640
gentleman sitting there on that\h
centre, informs the Kundalini that,\h\h

14:10.640 --> 14:14.480
“No, still he has to take time, he’s not all\h
right, there’s something wrong with him."

14:15.520 --> 14:18.080
That’s why this innocence is to be preserved\h\h

14:19.040 --> 14:23.200
and those who have not been able to preserve\h
their innocence find it rather difficult.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.080
But, after Realisation, you’ll be surprised,\h
those who have lost their innocence get it back.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.360
That’s the only way you can\h
get back your innocence.

14:32.240 --> 14:38.480
It’s most surprising that after Realisation\h
you get the same innocence that you had before,\h\h

14:38.480 --> 14:41.280
and you start enjoying that\h
innocence within yourself.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.960
So this is the centre of innocence within us.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.440
Now we have innocence, but who can tell?

14:47.440 --> 14:52.320
Which doctor can say, or psychologist can say\h
where is this innocence that is coming to us?

14:53.440 --> 14:54.720
It exists in that part.

14:55.840 --> 15:00.000
Now, we’ll take the third centre,\h
which is very important, within us,\h\h

15:00.000 --> 15:05.680
is called as the Nabhi Chakra, which is\h
the navel point, about the navel point.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.240
You cannot definitely say where\h
anybody’s chakras lie because that’s\h\h

15:10.240 --> 15:14.320
not a definite thing, it’s an energy\h
which moves up and down a little bit.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.960
But about at the back of the navel point.

15:17.680 --> 15:22.160
And it manifests outside, what we\h
call the solar plexus, in the gross.

15:24.160 --> 15:31.440
This centre, the centre that is in the Nabhi, is\h
the navel, is responsible for all our seeking.

15:33.760 --> 15:40.000
We started when we were just amoebas you can call.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.160
That time our seeking was only for food.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.400
Then it grew up within us as we grew up.

15:46.400 --> 15:52.880
At human level we have seeking for food, of\h
course, we have got seeking for possessions,\h\h

15:53.440 --> 16:01.840
money, we have got seeking for power, political\h
or any way, and also we have got seeking for God.

16:03.200 --> 16:08.160
This starts manifesting in a human being alone.

16:08.160 --> 16:17.600
This seeking of God starts when a person\h
starts realising, or seeing, that there must be\h\h

16:17.600 --> 16:25.280
something beyond, there must be something which is\h
fulfilling, something that is really satisfying.

16:26.160 --> 16:31.360
And he starts finding that\h
absolute point, from where there is\h\h

16:34.080 --> 16:44.800
no need to return, where there is no disgust,\h
where there is no frustration, disappointment.

16:45.760 --> 16:50.640
And such a point resides within\h
us in our heart as the Spirit.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.840
We call it Atma in Sanskrit language.

16:55.120 --> 17:03.840
This Spirit in the heart is the witness:\h
which witnesses us, which looks after us.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.440
But we are not we are not conscious of it.

17:07.440 --> 17:10.640
That means the Spirit is not flowing in our,\h\h

17:11.280 --> 17:16.320
is not radiating in our, central nervous\h
system, that we are not conscious of it.

17:17.120 --> 17:23.120
We know there is someone, we know someone\h
inside is there, we’re aware of it, in a way,\h\h

17:23.760 --> 17:29.920
but it is not flowing through our conscious\h
mind, through our central nervous system.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.080
And this is what is the seeking for.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.680
We are seeking our Spirit.

17:35.520 --> 17:40.240
As I have told you yesterday, that\h
you need not take me for granted.

17:40.240 --> 17:46.240
You should treat it as a hypothesis and sit\h
here with an open mind, as a scientist would\h\h

17:46.240 --> 17:48.960
listen to something that is new.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.920
Now the central, centre\h
point, which we call as Nabhi,\h\h

17:56.720 --> 18:05.520
is connected to another point down below, which\h
you see there, is the centre of creativity.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.240
This is the centre that creates.

18:08.880 --> 18:17.360
And this has got six sub-plexuses,\h
which are manifested outside\h\h

18:17.920 --> 18:23.920
and the plexus which is gross, is called as aortic\h
plexus and it also has got six sub-plexuses.

18:25.120 --> 18:32.720
In the spiritual language we do not say that\h
these are sub-plexuses but we say these are the\h\h

18:32.720 --> 18:37.680
six petals of the lotus of Swadishthana chakra.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.480
This works out the Right Side creative\h\h

18:44.480 --> 18:48.800
power, as you can see it, that\h
through it is connected to the brain.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.720
Now the centre one is the\h
one which is very important,\h\h

18:55.440 --> 19:01.120
which gives you the idea that there\h
is a gap between you and the Absolute.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.440
And that gap is shown here as that\h
green coloured Void, all that.

19:09.600 --> 19:16.880
Above that is the channel which is\h
responsible for what we have achieved so far\h\h

19:17.680 --> 19:18.800
up to the human level.

19:19.760 --> 19:23.760
Whatever has come into our conscious\h
mind, up to the human level,\h\h

19:23.760 --> 19:30.480
is expressed by that channel which is\h
broken, and that gap we have to cover.

19:31.120 --> 19:37.200
Once we cover that gap we have finished with our\h
evolution and we are there where we have to be.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.760
We have found out our use, we\h
have found out our meaning.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.720
We become that.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.120
This higher one, the one that is within us,\h\h

19:47.920 --> 19:54.080
is manifested, and is called as parasympathetic\h
nervous system in the medical terminology.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.440
And also the broken, these\h\h

19:56.000 --> 20:02.560
parts, though these centres are there and\h
that is also a part of the parasympathetic.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.280
So we have these three energies shown here.

20:08.080 --> 20:19.840
The one which is for our desire, the another for\h
our action, and the central one for our evolution.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.160
That means in our awareness we\h
have reached a certain point.

20:25.040 --> 20:30.080
For example there is a big difference between\h
animals and human beings in their awareness.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.560
We sometimes condemn ourselves very much\h
and think animals are better than us,\h\h

20:34.560 --> 20:40.400
because they are not that much messed up maybe;\h
or they may not be in such a problems as we are.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.760
Because we are free, we can\h
think, we can understand,\h\h

20:43.760 --> 20:45.840
we are much more sensitive than they are.

20:46.640 --> 20:52.800
But if you ask any animal how does\h
he feel about the smell of a part,\h\h

20:53.520 --> 20:58.560
he’s moving in the dirtiest lane, he\h
doesn’t feel disturbed at all, but we are.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.720
He’s not bothered about what kind\h
of colours and forms you have.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.640
He can live with any colour combination,\h\h

21:05.280 --> 21:12.160
with any kind of horrid aesthetic mistakes\h
people must have made in that stable of his.

21:12.160 --> 21:17.040
He can live in there very happily, as long as\h
he gets his food, he’s perfectly all right!

21:18.320 --> 21:24.160
So our evolution has brought us to a\h
point where we have become much subtler,\h\h

21:24.960 --> 21:27.840
much more sensitive and understanding.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.920
And when we are more understanding\h
and there is a gap, you become\h\h

21:32.640 --> 21:39.440
tensed up, “Oh, this must be covered!” You\h
are also aware that your energy is exhausted.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.840
You are spending your energy through\h
your sympathetic nervous system.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.040
Both of them they play, by your\h
desiring and by your action.

21:50.640 --> 21:56.560
When it is exhausted it is like the petrol in a\h
car, if it gets exhausted, you also get tensed up.

21:56.560 --> 22:01.200
In the same way, you get tensed up and you\h
don’t understand what to do with your tension.

22:01.840 --> 22:07.440
Then to release it you take to tranquillisers,\h
you take to other things, escapes in life.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.680
All these escapes work out\h
because you are so tensed up.

22:11.680 --> 22:15.760
That tension comes to you because of\h
the ego and super-ego in your head.

22:15.760 --> 22:21.280
It can be so strongly tensed up [that] you\h
can get both the things overlapping each other\h\h

22:21.280 --> 22:26.160
and it can be extremely\h
painful also for some people.

22:26.160 --> 22:32.160
And when such things happen you go for\h
your relaxation, you try all these things.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.360
But still it’s not opened out as yet.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.480
It has to open out.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.920
This gap has to be covered.

22:39.920 --> 22:43.440
And this gap only can be covered\h
through the Kundalini awakening.

22:44.320 --> 22:50.160
Now once people come to know that, “Yes, Kundalini\h
awakening is the only way one has to do."

22:50.160 --> 22:52.960
All right, so they bring out a circus for you.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.720
“We’ll do the Kundalini awakening for you!”\h\h

22:55.280 --> 22:58.480
“We’ll give you Self-realisation, we’ll\h
give you this, we’ll give you that."

22:58.480 --> 22:59.600
They promise you things.

23:02.400 --> 23:07.840
But it is the happening that is important.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.840
This they do for making money maybe,\h
because they want to have power,\h\h

23:12.880 --> 23:17.040
because they are sadistic, maybe they are\h
satanic, because they want that you should\h\h

23:17.040 --> 23:22.000
not get your Realisation, that they want\h
to kill all your chances of Realisation.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.600
I don’t know what their purpose is.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.640
But you have got this Kundalini\h
within you, which must be awakened,\h\h

23:32.080 --> 23:35.840
and it can be awakened in thousands of people.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.720
I have done that.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.640
You can do it.

23:38.640 --> 23:46.720
There is one gentleman who has given Realisation\h
to ten thousand people! Who is just very young,\h\h

23:47.840 --> 23:50.880
and he has been moving from villages to villages.

23:50.880 --> 23:58.000
But you know as villagers are very simple people\h
and they cannot be enticed by any such things\h\h

23:59.280 --> 24:02.880
which we call as elaborate\h
circusing (sic) about religion.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.800
They know what it is.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.880
They are too simple to believe\h
all this nonsense of complication.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.520
So they know who is real and who is not.

24:13.520 --> 24:17.840
Their sensitivity is very great\h
because they live with the nature.

24:18.800 --> 24:22.320
And they can make out a person\h
who is real and who is unreal.

24:24.480 --> 24:31.840
This third centre that you see here, or we can\h
say the fourth centre, is the centre of heart.

24:33.040 --> 24:35.840
This centre of heart is the centre that\h\h

24:36.480 --> 24:41.200
is responsible for giving you\h
security, is the centre of the Mother.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.920
This gives you the sense of security.

24:45.600 --> 24:52.400
When you feel insecure you must have seen that you\h
start breathing very fast, the breathing starts.

24:52.960 --> 24:55.200
When you are a child till the age of twelve years,\h\h

24:56.240 --> 25:01.440
all the anti-bodies are built-in, in the sternum\h
bone, which is here — you know the sternum bone?

25:01.440 --> 25:05.120
Which is here — and these\h
anti-bodies are spread out\h\h

25:05.840 --> 25:13.840
throughout, in the body, to fight any\h
invasion or attack on the personality.

25:14.560 --> 25:20.800
These anti-bodies are actually as we would\h
say in Sahaj Yoga terminology, are the\h\h

25:22.240 --> 25:25.600
armies of the Mother.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.720
They are built up there, and this is the\h
centre of the Mother of the Universe.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.840
Now the Deities we have on these centres\h
also I will tell you, one by one.

25:37.040 --> 25:42.240
Here is the another centre which is called\h
as the Vishuddhi Chakra: is very important.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.000
At this point man has raised\h
his head upward like that.

25:46.000 --> 25:54.880
He has raised his head with new\h
aspirations, with new ideas.

25:55.440 --> 26:00.320
When he raised his head only, he started\h
developing this ego and super-ego.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.040
When the head was down below,\h
towards the Mother Earth,\h\h

26:03.040 --> 26:06.960
this could not be developed because the\h
energy would pass into the Mother Earth.

26:07.840 --> 26:10.160
But when you raised your head, like this,\h\h

26:11.680 --> 26:20.320
then the ego and super-ego started developing very\h
fast, by which you developed your own personality.

26:21.840 --> 26:30.800
The meeting of ego and super-ego cuts\h
you out from the All-pervading Power.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.440
When you are a child, if you remember,\h\h

26:35.440 --> 26:40.080
you had a very soft bone in the\h
fontanelle bone area, and suddenly\h\h

26:43.360 --> 26:50.720
it becomes thick and thick and thick; ultimately\h
it becomes thick like a stone in some people.

26:51.520 --> 26:56.640
Now this is the closing of the\h
door to the All-pervading Power.

26:57.280 --> 27:00.480
Why it is done, why are you closed away from that:\h\h

27:01.200 --> 27:05.840
because you are given your own\h
freedom, your own individuality.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.280
You become Mr.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.240
X, you become Mr.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.360
Y, you become Mr.

27:09.360 --> 27:18.320
Z, because you find out what is right and what\h
is wrong through your own experimentation.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.440
You become independent.

27:21.440 --> 27:25.120
Supposing I am making this instrument\h
(microphone): first I’ll have to test\h\h

27:25.120 --> 27:27.680
this separately, then I’ll put it here, isn’t it?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
In the same way you are separated.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.800
And you start experimenting with good and bad.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.960
You start understanding what\h
is good and what is bad.

27:41.120 --> 27:45.440
Once you start discovering it, you\h
start taking to the right path.

27:46.480 --> 27:51.520
But, as you have seen, human beings have\h
not been able to use their freedom properly.

27:51.520 --> 27:56.160
Their sense of freedom has been very much changed.

27:56.960 --> 28:02.800
And this changed attitude, or this\h
changed behaviour towards freedom,\h\h

28:03.600 --> 28:09.200
is also due to freedom itself, because you are\h
free to choose whether you want good or bad.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.640
And when this happens to you, that\h
you become independent and you start\h\h

28:14.640 --> 28:19.200
choosing wrong things, then this becomes\h
even stronger and stronger and stronger.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.880
So, now you have seen the\h
centres up to this point (Agnya).

28:24.880 --> 28:29.840
This is the centre where, in the centre\h
of the brain, is the centre of Christ.

28:30.560 --> 28:38.000
Is the centre where our pineal body\h
and our pituitary body, both are placed\h\h

28:38.640 --> 28:42.560
in the optic chiasma, it is placed in such\h\h

28:42.560 --> 28:47.360
a manner — it is very subtle — that it\h
controls your ego and super-ego, both.

28:48.240 --> 28:52.000
And this centre is called as Agnya chakra.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.920
And it has only two petals by which\h
you control your ego and super-ego.

28:57.920 --> 29:02.800
On top of that, the centre you see\h
is the Sahasrar, is the last centre,\h\h

29:03.360 --> 29:06.640
is of thousand petals and is\h
called as Sahasrar, meaning,\h\h

29:08.080 --> 29:16.000
flow of the seven waterfalls, you can put\h
it like that, not seven [but] thousand.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.600
Thousand is ‘sahast’ and ‘Sahasrar’\h
means: You can say, one thousand,\h\h

29:28.480 --> 29:34.400
the flow of one thousand,\h
the flow of one thousand.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.160
These are one thousand petals there.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.520
You can see them.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.880
Some people have seen them and you\h
can also see them within yourself.

29:42.880 --> 29:48.053
They are placed in the brain and they cover\h
the limbic area which is the vacant area there,\h\h

29:48.053 --> 29:51.120
is the limbic area which\h
is very important nowadays\h\h

29:51.120 --> 29:54.320
because people have started\h
experimenting with limbic area.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.760
When the Kundalini crosses that and\h
pierces this portion, this is the baptism.

30:00.800 --> 30:07.680
Then you find this place becomes soft, and\h
suddenly you find the flow of Kundalini,\h\h

30:07.680 --> 30:12.560
the flow of the Grace, coming into you,\h
when she pierces into the subtle thing.

30:13.360 --> 30:19.360
Now there is this energy around us,\h
it exists, but we have to feel it.

30:19.360 --> 30:19.999
We have not yet felt it that’s why we are lost,\h
that’s why we are confused, we have problems.

30:19.999 --> 30:20.145
All our political problems are because\h
we are dealing with something relative.

30:20.146 --> 30:20.274
Same with our economics, same with\h
all our problems is that we are…

30:20.273 --> 30:20.310
(break in recording)

30:20.310 --> 30:20.464
Now you are connected to the Absolute you\h
can ask any question to the Absolute and\h\h

30:20.464 --> 30:20.595
you get the answer on your fingers,\h
when your fingers are enlightened.

30:20.596 --> 30:20.692
And that’s how you know that you are enlightened.

30:20.692 --> 30:25.600
Then you start feeling yourself, and you feel you\h
have expanded very much, you have become alive\h\h

30:25.600 --> 30:31.120
to yourself and to others, because you can start\h
feeling others also! Sitting down here you can\h\h

30:31.120 --> 30:35.360
tell what’s happening in America to a particular\h
person if you just put your attention to it.

30:35.360 --> 30:42.880
Because now your attention is\h
enlightened and that’s how you feel it.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.200
The problem is it is too fantastic\h
to believe, really it is.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.360
But supposing I make this place\h\h

30:51.360 --> 30:55.840
extremely fantastic, and there is darkness,\h
you can’t see anything, and I tell you,\h\h

30:55.840 --> 31:01.040
“Now it’s a fantastic place, you just come and\h
see for yourself how things start working there.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.880
Every instrument is so nicely placed.

31:02.880 --> 31:04.000
It starts working.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.440
And you’ll get great results.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.720
And you just come in and you switch on the light."

31:08.720 --> 31:12.880
It works! Because it is built-in! And the whole\h\h

31:12.880 --> 31:16.800
fantastic thing starts coming in\h
to you and you start seeing it.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.760
Because it is inside it,\h
only the light has to come,\h\h

31:19.760 --> 31:21.840
and once the light comes in you start seeing it.

31:23.200 --> 31:26.480
So why should you blame anyone for\h
that or why should you be angry?

31:26.480 --> 31:29.280
After all it is all done\h
for your joy and happiness.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.840
It’s just a surprise I should say,\h\h

31:32.400 --> 31:36.400
like a Father Christmas coming in\h
and delivering all the goods to you.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.600
It’s all done before.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.800
It’s all managed before.

31:40.080 --> 31:49.200
Like we can say, first time I saw a\h
television, for example, a colour television.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.320
And suddenly my husband, when he\h
brought it to me he said, “Oh,\h\h

31:52.320 --> 31:54.160
you are going to see something very fantastic."

31:56.000 --> 31:57.040
I said, “What?” I had never seen it before.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.800
He said, “You can see the film show.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.440
You can see everybody moving\h
in it!” I said, “Really?

32:03.440 --> 32:05.280
In the room?” he said, “Yes, you can."

32:05.280 --> 32:09.440
“Well how can that be?” “You\h
just wait and see! You just wait.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.520
A minute is needed."

32:11.520 --> 32:14.240
And he prepared me very nicely\h
to give me a big surprise.

32:15.040 --> 32:18.160
He said, “You can see people\h
here, talking and everything."

32:19.600 --> 32:23.040
And he just opened it, and to\h
my amazement it was working.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.840
It was not connected to anything as\h
such, except for the electricity,\h\h

32:27.840 --> 32:33.360
and the whole thing started working, and I\h
could see everything happening as he had said.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.520
It was really fantastic, one could not believe it!\h
You start feeling it, “Really, it is true or not?”

32:38.560 --> 32:42.640
First time I saw the telephone, in\h
India, absolutely when I was very young,\h\h

32:44.480 --> 32:48.400
and I think, in our house it was\h
remarkable that we got the phone,\h\h

32:48.400 --> 32:51.600
and were of the few, first people who\h
had the telephone, very few people.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.920
And that was, when we got it you see.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.800
We just couldn’t believe, “How can it be you\h
can talk to someone on the phone like that?

33:00.800 --> 33:03.520
You can dial to someone and\h
talk?” Immediately we knew one\h\h

33:03.520 --> 33:06.160
girl who had a telephone so we telephoned to her.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.880
She was not allowed to touch the\h
phone and we telephoned to her.

33:08.880 --> 33:09.760
The father said, “What?

33:09.760 --> 33:10.720
You’ve got the telephone?

33:10.720 --> 33:14.160
Now we’ve had it! And now you are\h
going to telephone to her!” She said,\h\h

33:14.160 --> 33:18.960
“I had told you once, if you remember, that there\h
is an instrument like that on which you can speak.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.440
But you never believed me.

33:21.440 --> 33:26.720
Now see, there is a telephone, isn’t it?” Then we\h
had to believe it, because it was all done for us.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.960
It was just to be connected\h
and we started seeing it.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.920
That is the main thing is, that it is all done.

33:33.920 --> 33:38.320
I have told you that three hundred and\h
fifty-million lives you have passed\h\h

33:38.320 --> 33:41.760
through to get all this thing done\h
and fixed into it; this is built-in.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.040
Now if it fantastic why not have it?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.240
We don’t have to pay for it.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.840
You cannot! What can you pay?

33:51.040 --> 33:55.440
Can you pay for three hundred and fifty-million\h
times you have passed through various lives?

33:55.440 --> 33:56.240
Can you pay for that?

33:59.680 --> 34:05.840
Can you pay for that love\h
which made you a human being?

34:06.880 --> 34:09.040
It is too fantastic the whole thing is.

34:09.040 --> 34:10.800
And now what can we pay for it?

34:11.840 --> 34:15.120
Only thing is to accept it and\h
take it and enjoy it, that’s all.

34:16.320 --> 34:21.520
We can’t think, in modern times, that there could\h
be someone who just invites you for nothing,\h\h

34:22.160 --> 34:25.520
gives you everything for nothing and\h
enjoys only the giving part of it.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.680
We just can’t think of such a beautiful person.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.440
That’s why people are frightened.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.120
You invite them, they are frightened, “Why,\h\h

34:33.120 --> 34:36.400
what is it?” “Because I am dealing with\h
some and something — must be that."

34:37.200 --> 34:38.000
We never trust.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.080
It is true, because we have\h
had very bad experiences.

34:42.720 --> 34:47.840
But we have [also] had people\h
like Christ who gave his life.

34:49.920 --> 34:56.640
Today is very important — because we have started\h
the week where he gave his life — to think of him.

34:58.080 --> 35:04.160
Will there be anyone like that who would sacrifice\h
his life to say something that is the Truth?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.480
He gave his life for Truth.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.400
For what?

35:08.400 --> 35:08.960
Why did he?

35:12.080 --> 35:19.920
Because the giving has much more joy,\h
much more bliss than anything else.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.320
If you reach that state of giving,\h
you will also enjoy giving.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.880
That has to happen.

35:26.880 --> 35:34.800
We have to discover that beauty within us\h
which enjoys giving, which enjoys generosity,\h\h

35:34.800 --> 35:40.400
which enjoys fearlessness, which enjoys all\h
the virtues of the world that reside within us.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.680
We have to just go deep down into ourselves.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.000
And it’s all done for you, it’s all done.

35:46.000 --> 35:46.560
It is there.

35:48.240 --> 35:52.160
So I think we should go in for\h
the experience, that’s the best.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.440
Because what’s the use of\h
talking about it all the time.

35:55.440 --> 36:02.240
You see, the cake, if I have made\h
it, better have it hot and enjoy it.

36:02.240 --> 36:05.920
So many of them have enjoyed, and I\h
want all the new people should enjoy.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.520
Because as I told you yesterday,\h
you cannot give me anything.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.040
I don’t need anything.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.120
I’ve not come here to do Sahaj Yoga.

36:15.120 --> 36:21.120
I’ve come in London because my husband\h
got posted here and that’s how I am here.

36:21.680 --> 36:26.320
I should say it’s your own calling that I am here.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.520
So you are not to give anything\h
to me, nothing is needed.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.640
Only thing is: accept it and just enjoy it.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.200
It’s a gift.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.240
It’s a gift that you deserve, it’s your own right.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.200
You are the son of God and\h
you have to become that.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.600
May God bless you all.

36:45.600 --> 36:53.840
Let’s have the experience.

36:53.840 --> 36:56.320
Now, if you have any questions\h
you can ask questions.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.680
No harm in asking questions.

36:59.040 --> 37:04.800
But I would say that first have the experience\h
and then ask the question, would be a better idea.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.720
Now you put your hands just like this towards me.

37:13.200 --> 37:18.080
I would request you to clear out your\h
forehead, is important for me, because,\h\h

37:18.080 --> 37:21.210
you see, sometimes there are problems\h
on the forehead — mostly they are.

37:21.210 --> 37:23.280
So can you clear out your forehead for me?

37:23.280 --> 37:24.080
Just clear out.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.520
I mean, open it out.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.080
Remove your hair I mean, all the hair.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.720
Can you also remove your hair a little bit?

37:38.720 --> 37:39.440
Ya, it’s good.

37:42.640 --> 37:49.840
Just put your hands towards me like this.

37:53.760 --> 37:59.600
This cures your ailments, your physical ailments,\h
it cures cancer, it cures many diseases.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.640
We have cured.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.320
Cancer can only be cured by this.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.240
There’s no other way out.

38:04.960 --> 38:11.200
But what’s the use of coming to me after you have\h
got cancer or you have got some serious disease?

38:11.200 --> 38:12.960
Better get rid of it beforehand.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.840
It’s working out.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.200
Now close your eyes all of\h
you, just close your eyes.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.760
Can you remove your red scarf a little?

38:28.720 --> 38:30.000
Yes, will be a good idea.

38:30.560 --> 38:35.040
You see the Kundalini has to pierce\h
through and I would like to see here also.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.120
First of all watch your mind: is there\h
any thought coming into your mind.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.920
First of all watch your mind.

38:50.960 --> 38:56.000
Just ask your mind, “What are you thinking?”\h
Don’t put your attention anywhere fixed,\h\h

38:56.000 --> 39:00.240
into concentrated form, but just\h
leave it loose, absolutely loose.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.920
Do not concentrate anywhere.

39:05.360 --> 39:10.480
Now, just see if you are feeling the cool\h
breeze in your fingers, because these fingers,\h\h

39:10.480 --> 39:20.080
as I told you, at the end of it, are the\h
sympathetic nervous systems which get enlightened.

39:20.080 --> 39:27.840
So you just start feeling on the tip of your\h
fingers, if you are feeling the cool breeze.

39:28.560 --> 39:33.760
If you cannot keep your attention steady you\h
can put your attention to the top of your head\h\h

39:33.760 --> 39:41.840
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.505
Thik hai?

39:42.505 --> 39:42.874
(ok?)

39:42.874 --> 39:45.978
It’s all right I think, it’s working.

39:45.978 --> 39:48.786
Most of the chakras have cleared out.

39:48.786 --> 39:51.520
I think you are getting cool breeze.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.760
Now you can see, when you are\h
getting cool breeze in your\h\h

39:53.760 --> 39:57.040
hand also there will be cool breeze\h
from your head here, you can see it.

39:57.040 --> 40:03.440
Put your left hand on your head and\h
see for yourself, if it is hot or cool.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.080
Could be cool, could be hot also.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.920
If it is cool it’s all right, it’s good.

40:14.000 --> 40:14.400
Got it?

40:16.400 --> 40:17.600
You got the cool breeze too?

40:18.480 --> 40:19.280
Not yet?

40:19.280 --> 40:21.040
In the head in the hand?

40:21.600 --> 40:22.000
Not yet?

40:22.000 --> 40:23.280
It will work out don’t you worry.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.200
Now those who haven’t got\h
it please raise your hands.

40:33.840 --> 40:34.240
All right.

40:34.240 --> 40:38.960
If you don’t mind I’ll ask them to look after you\h
and I’ll also come down to see them, all right?

40:41.200 --> 40:43.680
Please raise your hands those who\h
haven’t got the cool breeze as yet.

40:45.360 --> 40:48.880
Just attend to them! Keep it like\h
that so that somebody comes to you.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.840
Will you please?

40:49.840 --> 40:54.720
I think best is the, if people\h
from Brighton do it, it’s better.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.040
You also should, also you should\h
also you should all come and help.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.520
But what I’m saying [is] basically\h
because they will know who they are,\h\h

40:59.520 --> 41:00.720
what is their name and all that.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.080
It would be better for\h
Brighton people to work it out.

41:04.640 --> 41:05.840
And also others.

41:06.960 --> 41:09.520
Just see for yourself.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.400
And others should join them\h
just to help them out, you see.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.520
What’s the problem, let’s see!

41:17.093 --> 41:18.320
Is also left to the right.

41:18.320 --> 41:21.200
Most of them need sort of a\h
balance from left to the right.

41:21.200 --> 41:24.000
Raise it from left to the right,\h
with your left hand towards me,\h\h

41:24.000 --> 41:25.760
you just raise it from left to the right.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.400
It will work out.

41:29.360 --> 41:33.920
John, you see, he’s also same thing\h
is, left to the right, you see.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.560
Now this gentleman has got it?

41:36.560 --> 41:38.160
You’ve got the cool breeze?

41:38.160 --> 41:38.400
Good.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.000
You can join, you can join\h
John and see what it is.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.640
Just now you can see the whole fantasy of it.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.040
Come along.

41:47.760 --> 41:48.400
What’s your name?

41:49.680 --> 41:50.000
Yogi: Ross.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.400
Shri Mataji: All right, you\h
join John and let’s see.

41:55.120 --> 41:55.440
John?

41:56.400 --> 41:58.560
You can see yourself, your vibrations will know.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.600
Now come along! Call him!

42:01.760 --> 42:05.120
Those who got Realisation yesterday\h
also must work it out for themselves.

42:05.120 --> 42:05.920
Come along!

42:09.440 --> 42:10.720
Just see.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.480
Is it cool breeze coming now?

42:15.440 --> 42:16.880
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

42:18.640 --> 42:20.080
You are not feeling in the hand?

42:20.080 --> 42:21.600
It’s coming out of your head all right.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.360
Are you feeling now?

42:27.040 --> 42:27.680
It’s Vishuddhi.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.200
He’s got a Vishuddhi, that’s why.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.440
You put your hand on his Vishuddhi.

42:31.440 --> 42:31.680
John?

42:34.240 --> 42:37.280
Come along you also work it out,\h
all of you who have got Realisation.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.880
You’ve got the cool breeze?

42:39.440 --> 42:41.040
All right, what about you?

42:41.040 --> 42:41.840
He’s very good too!
