00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.120
I told you yesterday how you feel your\h
seeking, why you feel your seeking,\h\h

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.400
what is in us that works out this seeking.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.480
And this yoga is spontaneous.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.680
There is no other way you\h
can get your Realisation.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.080
Because if you have to germinate\h
a seed it has to have germination!\h\h

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.640
In the same way, if you are to be\h
germinated into your new awareness,\h\h

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:48.080
it has to be through your awakening of\h
Kundalini, because that is what it is there for.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.280
If you have to plug in this one (microphone)\h
to the mains, you have to use the chord,\h\h

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
there’s no other way about it.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.960
As I told you yesterday that this beautiful\h
instrument is made, all the effort has been put.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.000
You have passed through — how much, much\h
we calculated for thirty-five crores?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.600
Yogi: Three hundred and fifty million.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.360
Shri Mataji: Three hundred and\h
fifty-million types of lives.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.480
And now you have become a human being.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.840
So, after all, there must be some meaning\h
to this beautiful human structure,\h\h

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.840
this instrument [and] why it was created.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
There must be some reason for it.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.320
And, as you have got your human Realisation,\h
as you have got your human body,\h\h

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.880
if you have to get to a more evolved personality\h
it has to be spontaneous, you cannot work it out.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.360
Should be a simple logic.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.720
You have done nothing to be a human being\h
and you are not to do anything to be higher.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.800
But maybe you have harmed yourself a little\h
bit, perhaps, by doing something wrong.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.200
And whatever wrong you have done to yourself also\h
can be corrected if the seed has to germinate.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.880
You are made like that, God has\h
made you specially for this purpose.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.760
He has made you from an\h
amoeba, from a carbon atom.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.720
Whether you believe in Him or not doesn’t matter.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.960
But if you see yourself, whosoever\h\h

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.840
achieved this human body and human\h
mind must have been a fantastic artist.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.600
And it has been said that, if you\h
had left it to the Law of Chance,\h\h

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.760
you could not have even produced a\h
small, little uni-cellular amoeba.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.640
So, in such a short time as that,\h\h

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.720
if such a complex thing like Human Being\h
is created, there is a General behind it.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.160
Whether you believe it or not, that’s not\h
important, the thing is, it exists, and it works.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.560
Now within us we have this instrument placed.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.280
This very, very subtle\h
instrument is placed with us.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:59.920
Now I will tell you about the Kundalini – how\h
it works and what the different chakras are.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.040
These are all very subtle\h
centres as I told you yesterday.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.640
We cannot see them with your naked eyes,\h
but when the Kundalini starts rising,\h\h

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.000
when it starts ascending, then you can see with\h
your naked eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini,\h\h

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.400
and the pulsation at these chakras.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.040
Till it reaches here, you\h
can feel the pulsation here\h\h

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.680
and till it is pulsating you\h
do not get your Realisation.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.480
Once the pulsation stops then you must know that\h
it has ended into that All-pervading Divine power.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.960
When that happens then you start\h
feeling that cool breeze in your hand.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.520
You start feeling a cool\h
radiation passing through you.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.800
That is the radiation of the\h
Holy Spirit within yourself.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.200
That is the radiation you are feeling from\h
your Spirit that resides in your heart.You\h\h

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.120
can also feel your centres on your\h
fingers because now they are enlightened.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.160
Now all this, whatever I am telling\h
you, you can feel and verify.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.200
The time has come for you to\h
verify everything that I say.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.360
It has been said before, thousands of years\h
back, that within us lies the Kundalini.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:32.080
Adi Shankaracharya, sixth century, he said it\h
very, very clearly, openly, that there is this\h\h

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.080
residual power which is awaiting in the triangular\h
bone as you see there, in three and a half coils,\h\h

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.120
which ultimately awakens and gives you\h
your Realisation, your second birth.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.000
He had described it very clearly,\h
all the other centres also.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.040
But even much before, much, much\h
before that, thousands of years back,\h\h

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.080
people have been working on the Kundalini\h
awakening, but it was kept a secret.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:12.480
They started working on few people as we\h
also, in our scientific research, first use it\h\h

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:19.120
in a very guarded secret, try to find out\h
the different ways and methods and then,\h\h

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:29.200
when it becomes absolutely perfect, then we make\h
it public and make it known to all of the people.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:36.480
Because unless and until any discovery is\h
useful to the masses it has no meaning.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.880
Today the time has come for you to know all\h
about it and that’s why now, here in Brighton,\h\h

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.120
we are discussing it so openly\h
and trying to understand it.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.920
Now here, as you have seen,\h
in the triangular bone,\h\h

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.160
is the Kundalini – three and a half coiled energy.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.040
This energy is pure energy of desire of God.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.200
It is His desire which is\h
within you, lying dormant.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.920
His desire has been throughout in His\h
whole Creation that He should create\h\h

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.080
His own children who will understand\h
Him [and] when they understand Him,\h\h

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.440
to give them all His powers for them to manifest.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.200
For them to enter into His Kingdom and to\h
reside in complete bliss and happiness.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.720
That He is the Collective Being, He is\h
the macrocosm and you are the microcosm.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.840
That you are cells in the big body, and\h
these cells are to be awakened and have to\h\h

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.880
become one with the Whole, by which you get\h
your understanding of the Collective Being.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.840
The Collective Being is conscious of\h
you but you are not conscious of That.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.200
And that’s how the whole device was\h
made within you — how you are going\h\h

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.600
to get it and how you are going to achieve it.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.640
You can see there are three lines which\h
are placed parallel to each other.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.800
The first blue line depicts the power to\h
desire — is the emotional side it looks after.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.840
This is manifested outside as\h
left sympathetic nervous system.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.480
Now the doctors do not know that the left\h
and right sympathetic nervous systems\h\h

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.560
are there for doing two different types of work.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.040
So the Left Side is the power by which you desire,\h\h

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:53.840
is the energy by which you get yourself\h
conditioned, by which you live in the past.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.840
This channel is called in the\h
Sanskrit language as ‘Ida Nadi’.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.200
The Right Side channel which you\h
see there, yellow coloured channel,\h\h

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.680
is the power by which you create, by which\h
you can go to future, you think of the future.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.840
This is the one by which you plan for the future.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.720
This is the one with which you do your physical\h
things, which you want to do for future also.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.880
All sorts of future planning for your physical,\h
mental and your financial, or any such lives,\h\h

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.960
is done through this energy of yours,\h
which is on the right hand side,\h\h

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.880
which is called, this channel is\h
called, as the Pingala Channel.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.800
Now the colours are of the left side is the\h\h

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.280
deep blue colour, as you see\h
there, actually amounting to black.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.120
And the one which is on the right\h
hand side is the yellow colour.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:04.240
Now when these two energies start working within\h
us, means one is of desiring another is of action.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.960
First we desire something\h
and then we go into action.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.080
When these two energies start working\h\h

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.080
we produce a bi-product in our\h
head like the fumes in a factory.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.280
The fumes are called as ego and\h
super-ego, as you see them crossed over.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.880
When you use the blue side, which is the\h
desire, or iccha shakti as they call it,\h\h

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:36.400
then you develop a super-ego and when you\h
work on the right side, you develop the ego.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.560
To understand ego and super-ego\h
in a very simple way, is this way,\h\h

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.680
that, say when a child is nursed by the\h
mother, he is in complete bliss and joy.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.880
So the mother changes the sides for the\h
boy, the child, and he feels very much hurt.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.320
When he feels hurt his ego rises, he\h
thinks, “Why should she do it?” you see,\h\h

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.520
in a very subtle way, and the ego starts rising.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.480
This is the ego, which you see there,\h
starts rising on the right hand side.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.920
I mean there is nothing wrong in\h
having ego, you have to have it.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.200
It works out that way.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.440
As every factory has to have a chimney,\h\h

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.000
you don’t have a chimney so it\h
accumulates there in the head.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.960
On the left hand side, when\h
the child wants something,\h\h

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.800
or he’s told not to do this, the mother says,\h
“Don’t do like that!” So you are conditioned.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.560
By that conditioning your super-ego is developed.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.080
When your ego is hurt I\h
would say, your ego develops.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.080
When your desire is hurt\h
then your super-ego develops.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.840
Gradually we start identifying\h
ourselves with our ego\h\h

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.040
or super-ego depending on what\h
sort of a personality you are.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:58.880
Some people think that, “I do\h
this!” “I am this!” you see.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.000
Some of them are frightened,\h
“No, it’s too aggressive."

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.640
But whatever it may be, either\h
you have ego or super-ego.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.920
Both of them develop just like\h
this as you see in the thing,\h\h

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.280
and if one becomes more heavy\h
then it pushes down the other one.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.320
If this becomes more heavy\h
it pushes down this way.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.840
Now for Kundalini to pass in between\h
you have to have a space like that.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:31.040
If a person is of an imbalanced personality, then\h
Kundalini takes time to rise, She takes time.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.640
Now you can see the centre below\h
the Kundalini, which is a very,\h\h

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:44.000
very important centre, we must know,\h
about which I have to tell you, in short.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.320
This is the centre which is\h
lying below the Kundalini.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.840
It’s not above.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.680
That means when the Kundalini pierces through\h
other centres it is not pierced through.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.160
But why is he there?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.120
Why is it there?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.840
It is there to give information to the Kundalini.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.480
It is the instrument which receives all the\h
information as to what you are doing, what\h\h

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.000
are you up to, what are your desires, what you\h
are doing, what sort of people you are meeting,\h\h

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.920
where you are going, what mistakes you are\h
committing, what good things you are committing.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.680
Everything is recorded in that Kundalini,\h
not only of this lifetime, but of many lives.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.320
Its collection of all that you have had\h
with you is inside the Kundalini, recorded.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.840
Kundalini knows what you have been.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:43.200
So this little thing that you see there is the\h
centre which lies very near the prostate gland\h\h

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.680
and is the one who generates innocence within us.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.080
If you are innocent, you are like a child,\h
your Kundalini shoots off just like that,\h\h

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.200
no problem! But if you are complicated\h
then it takes time because the\h\h

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.640
gentleman sitting there on that\h
centre, informs the Kundalini that,\h\h

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.480
“No, still he has to take time, he’s not all\h
right, there’s something wrong with him."

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.080
That’s why this innocence is to be preserved\h\h

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.200
and those who have not been able to preserve\h
their innocence find it rather difficult.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.080
But, after Realisation, you’ll be surprised,\h
those who have lost their innocence get it back.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.360
That’s the only way you can\h
get back your innocence.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.480
It’s most surprising that after Realisation\h
you get the same innocence that you had before,\h\h

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.280
and you start enjoying that\h
innocence within yourself.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.960
So this is the centre of innocence within us.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.440
Now we have innocence, but who can tell?

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:52.320
Which doctor can say, or psychologist can say\h
where is this innocence that is coming to us?

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.720
It exists in that part.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.000
Now, we’ll take the third centre,\h
which is very important, within us,\h\h

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.680
is called as the Nabhi Chakra, which is\h
the navel point, about the navel point.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.240
You cannot definitely say where\h
anybody’s chakras lie because that’s\h\h

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:14.320
not a definite thing, it’s an energy\h
which moves up and down a little bit.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.960
But about at the back of the navel point.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.160
And it manifests outside, what we\h
call the solar plexus, in the gross.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.440
This centre, the centre that is in the Nabhi, is\h
the navel, is responsible for all our seeking.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.000
We started when we were just amoebas you can call.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.160
That time our seeking was only for food.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.400
Then it grew up within us as we grew up.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.880
At human level we have seeking for food, of\h
course, we have got seeking for possessions,\h\h

00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:01.840
money, we have got seeking for power, political\h
or any way, and also we have got seeking for God.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.160
This starts manifesting in a human being alone.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:17.600
This seeking of God starts when a person\h
starts realising, or seeing, that there must be\h\h

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:25.280
something beyond, there must be something which is\h
fulfilling, something that is really satisfying.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.360
And he starts finding that\h
absolute point, from where there is\h\h

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:44.800
no need to return, where there is no disgust,\h
where there is no frustration, disappointment.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.640
And such a point resides within\h
us in our heart as the Spirit.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.840
We call it Atma in Sanskrit language.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:03.840
This Spirit in the heart is the witness:\h
which witnesses us, which looks after us.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.440
But we are not we are not conscious of it.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.640
That means the Spirit is not flowing in our,\h\h

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.320
is not radiating in our, central nervous\h
system, that we are not conscious of it.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:23.120
We know there is someone, we know someone\h
inside is there, we’re aware of it, in a way,\h\h

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.920
but it is not flowing through our conscious\h
mind, through our central nervous system.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.080
And this is what is the seeking for.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.680
We are seeking our Spirit.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.240
As I have told you yesterday, that\h
you need not take me for granted.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.240
You should treat it as a hypothesis and sit\h
here with an open mind, as a scientist would\h\h

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.960
listen to something that is new.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.920
Now the central, centre\h
point, which we call as Nabhi,\h\h

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:05.520
is connected to another point down below, which\h
you see there, is the centre of creativity.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.240
This is the centre that creates.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:17.360
And this has got six sub-plexuses,\h
which are manifested outside\h\h

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.920
and the plexus which is gross, is called as aortic\h
plexus and it also has got six sub-plexuses.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:32.720
In the spiritual language we do not say that\h
these are sub-plexuses but we say these are the\h\h

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.680
six petals of the lotus of Swadishthana chakra.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.480
This works out the Right Side creative\h\h

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.800
power, as you can see it, that\h
through it is connected to the brain.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.720
Now the centre one is the\h
one which is very important,\h\h

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.120
which gives you the idea that there\h
is a gap between you and the Absolute.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.440
And that gap is shown here as that\h
green coloured Void, all that.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:16.880
Above that is the channel which is\h
responsible for what we have achieved so far\h\h

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.800
up to the human level.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.760
Whatever has come into our conscious\h
mind, up to the human level,\h\h

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:30.480
is expressed by that channel which is\h
broken, and that gap we have to cover.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:37.200
Once we cover that gap we have finished with our\h
evolution and we are there where we have to be.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.760
We have found out our use, we\h
have found out our meaning.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.720
We become that.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.120
This higher one, the one that is within us,\h\h

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:54.080
is manifested, and is called as parasympathetic\h
nervous system in the medical terminology.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.440
And also the broken, these\h\h

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.560
parts, though these centres are there and\h
that is also a part of the parasympathetic.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.280
So we have these three energies shown here.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:19.840
The one which is for our desire, the another for\h
our action, and the central one for our evolution.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.160
That means in our awareness we\h
have reached a certain point.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.080
For example there is a big difference between\h
animals and human beings in their awareness.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.560
We sometimes condemn ourselves very much\h
and think animals are better than us,\h\h

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.400
because they are not that much messed up maybe;\h
or they may not be in such a problems as we are.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.760
Because we are free, we can\h
think, we can understand,\h\h

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.840
we are much more sensitive than they are.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:52.800
But if you ask any animal how does\h
he feel about the smell of a part,\h\h

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.560
he’s moving in the dirtiest lane, he\h
doesn’t feel disturbed at all, but we are.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.720
He’s not bothered about what kind\h
of colours and forms you have.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.640
He can live with any colour combination,\h\h

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:12.160
with any kind of horrid aesthetic mistakes\h
people must have made in that stable of his.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.040
He can live in there very happily, as long as\h
he gets his food, he’s perfectly all right!

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:24.160
So our evolution has brought us to a\h
point where we have become much subtler,\h\h

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.840
much more sensitive and understanding.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.920
And when we are more understanding\h
and there is a gap, you become\h\h

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:39.440
tensed up, “Oh, this must be covered!” You\h
are also aware that your energy is exhausted.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.840
You are spending your energy through\h
your sympathetic nervous system.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:49.040
Both of them they play, by your\h
desiring and by your action.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:56.560
When it is exhausted it is like the petrol in a\h
car, if it gets exhausted, you also get tensed up.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:01.200
In the same way, you get tensed up and you\h
don’t understand what to do with your tension.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.440
Then to release it you take to tranquillisers,\h
you take to other things, escapes in life.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.680
All these escapes work out\h
because you are so tensed up.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.760
That tension comes to you because of\h
the ego and super-ego in your head.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.280
It can be so strongly tensed up [that] you\h
can get both the things overlapping each other\h\h

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.160
and it can be extremely\h
painful also for some people.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:32.160
And when such things happen you go for\h
your relaxation, you try all these things.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.360
But still it’s not opened out as yet.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.480
It has to open out.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.920
This gap has to be covered.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.440
And this gap only can be covered\h
through the Kundalini awakening.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:50.160
Now once people come to know that, “Yes, Kundalini\h
awakening is the only way one has to do."

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.960
All right, so they bring out a circus for you.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.720
“We’ll do the Kundalini awakening for you!”\h\h

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.480
“We’ll give you Self-realisation, we’ll\h
give you this, we’ll give you that."

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.600
They promise you things.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.840
But it is the happening that is important.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.840
This they do for making money maybe,\h
because they want to have power,\h\h

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.040
because they are sadistic, maybe they are\h
satanic, because they want that you should\h\h

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.000
not get your Realisation, that they want\h
to kill all your chances of Realisation.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.600
I don’t know what their purpose is.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.640
But you have got this Kundalini\h
within you, which must be awakened,\h\h

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.840
and it can be awakened in thousands of people.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.720
I have done that.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.640
You can do it.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.720
There is one gentleman who has given Realisation\h
to ten thousand people! Who is just very young,\h\h

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.880
and he has been moving from villages to villages.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:58.000
But you know as villagers are very simple people\h
and they cannot be enticed by any such things\h\h

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.880
which we call as elaborate\h
circusing (sic) about religion.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.800
They know what it is.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.880
They are too simple to believe\h
all this nonsense of complication.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.520
So they know who is real and who is not.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.840
Their sensitivity is very great\h
because they live with the nature.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.320
And they can make out a person\h
who is real and who is unreal.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:31.840
This third centre that you see here, or we can\h
say the fourth centre, is the centre of heart.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.840
This centre of heart is the centre that\h\h

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.200
is responsible for giving you\h
security, is the centre of the Mother.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.920
This gives you the sense of security.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.400
When you feel insecure you must have seen that you\h
start breathing very fast, the breathing starts.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.200
When you are a child till the age of twelve years,\h\h

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.440
all the anti-bodies are built-in, in the sternum\h
bone, which is here — you know the sternum bone?

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.120
Which is here — and these\h
anti-bodies are spread out\h\h

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:13.840
throughout, in the body, to fight any\h
invasion or attack on the personality.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.800
These anti-bodies are actually as we would\h
say in Sahaj Yoga terminology, are the\h\h

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.600
armies of the Mother.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.720
They are built up there, and this is the\h
centre of the Mother of the Universe.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.840
Now the Deities we have on these centres\h
also I will tell you, one by one.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:42.240
Here is the another centre which is called\h
as the Vishuddhi Chakra: is very important.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.000
At this point man has raised\h
his head upward like that.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:54.880
He has raised his head with new\h
aspirations, with new ideas.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.320
When he raised his head only, he started\h
developing this ego and super-ego.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.040
When the head was down below,\h
towards the Mother Earth,\h\h

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.960
this could not be developed because the\h
energy would pass into the Mother Earth.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.160
But when you raised your head, like this,\h\h

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:20.320
then the ego and super-ego started developing very\h
fast, by which you developed your own personality.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:30.800
The meeting of ego and super-ego cuts\h
you out from the All-pervading Power.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.440
When you are a child, if you remember,\h\h

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.080
you had a very soft bone in the\h
fontanelle bone area, and suddenly\h\h

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:50.720
it becomes thick and thick and thick; ultimately\h
it becomes thick like a stone in some people.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.640
Now this is the closing of the\h
door to the All-pervading Power.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.480
Why it is done, why are you closed away from that:\h\h

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.840
because you are given your own\h
freedom, your own individuality.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.280
You become Mr.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.240
X, you become Mr.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.360
Y, you become Mr.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:18.320
Z, because you find out what is right and what\h
is wrong through your own experimentation.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.440
You become independent.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.120
Supposing I am making this instrument\h
(microphone): first I’ll have to test\h\h

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.680
this separately, then I’ll put it here, isn’t it?

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240
In the same way you are separated.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.800
And you start experimenting with good and bad.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.960
You start understanding what\h
is good and what is bad.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.440
Once you start discovering it, you\h
start taking to the right path.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.520
But, as you have seen, human beings have\h
not been able to use their freedom properly.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.160
Their sense of freedom has been very much changed.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.800
And this changed attitude, or this\h
changed behaviour towards freedom,\h\h

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.200
is also due to freedom itself, because you are\h
free to choose whether you want good or bad.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.640
And when this happens to you, that\h
you become independent and you start\h\h

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.200
choosing wrong things, then this becomes\h
even stronger and stronger and stronger.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.880
So, now you have seen the\h
centres up to this point (Agnya).

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.840
This is the centre where, in the centre\h
of the brain, is the centre of Christ.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:38.000
Is the centre where our pineal body\h
and our pituitary body, both are placed\h\h

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.560
in the optic chiasma, it is placed in such\h\h

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.360
a manner — it is very subtle — that it\h
controls your ego and super-ego, both.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.000
And this centre is called as Agnya chakra.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.920
And it has only two petals by which\h
you control your ego and super-ego.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.800
On top of that, the centre you see\h
is the Sahasrar, is the last centre,\h\h

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.640
is of thousand petals and is\h
called as Sahasrar, meaning,\h\h

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:16.000
flow of the seven waterfalls, you can put\h
it like that, not seven [but] thousand.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.600
Thousand is ‘sahast’ and ‘Sahasrar’\h
means: You can say, one thousand,\h\h

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:34.400
the flow of one thousand,\h
the flow of one thousand.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.160
These are one thousand petals there.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.520
You can see them.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.880
Some people have seen them and you\h
can also see them within yourself.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:48.053
They are placed in the brain and they cover\h
the limbic area which is the vacant area there,\h\h

00:29:48.053 --> 00:29:51.120
is the limbic area which\h
is very important nowadays\h\h

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.320
because people have started\h
experimenting with limbic area.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.760
When the Kundalini crosses that and\h
pierces this portion, this is the baptism.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:07.680
Then you find this place becomes soft, and\h
suddenly you find the flow of Kundalini,\h\h

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.560
the flow of the Grace, coming into you,\h
when she pierces into the subtle thing.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:19.360
Now there is this energy around us,\h
it exists, but we have to feel it.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.999
We have not yet felt it that’s why we are lost,\h
that’s why we are confused, we have problems.

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:20.145
All our political problems are because\h
we are dealing with something relative.

00:30:20.146 --> 00:30:20.274
Same with our economics, same with\h
all our problems is that we are…

00:30:20.273 --> 00:30:20.310
(break in recording)

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.464
Now you are connected to the Absolute you\h
can ask any question to the Absolute and\h\h

00:30:20.464 --> 00:30:20.595
you get the answer on your fingers,\h
when your fingers are enlightened.

00:30:20.596 --> 00:30:20.692
And that’s how you know that you are enlightened.

00:30:20.692 --> 00:30:25.600
Then you start feeling yourself, and you feel you\h
have expanded very much, you have become alive\h\h

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:31.120
to yourself and to others, because you can start\h
feeling others also! Sitting down here you can\h\h

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.360
tell what’s happening in America to a particular\h
person if you just put your attention to it.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:42.880
Because now your attention is\h
enlightened and that’s how you feel it.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.200
The problem is it is too fantastic\h
to believe, really it is.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.360
But supposing I make this place\h\h

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.840
extremely fantastic, and there is darkness,\h
you can’t see anything, and I tell you,\h\h

00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:01.040
“Now it’s a fantastic place, you just come and\h
see for yourself how things start working there.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.880
Every instrument is so nicely placed.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.000
It starts working.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.440
And you’ll get great results.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.720
And you just come in and you switch on the light."

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.880
It works! Because it is built-in! And the whole\h\h

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.800
fantastic thing starts coming in\h
to you and you start seeing it.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.760
Because it is inside it,\h
only the light has to come,\h\h

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.840
and once the light comes in you start seeing it.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.480
So why should you blame anyone for\h
that or why should you be angry?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.280
After all it is all done\h
for your joy and happiness.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.840
It’s just a surprise I should say,\h\h

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.400
like a Father Christmas coming in\h
and delivering all the goods to you.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.600
It’s all done before.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.800
It’s all managed before.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:49.200
Like we can say, first time I saw a\h
television, for example, a colour television.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.320
And suddenly my husband, when he\h
brought it to me he said, “Oh,\h\h

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.160
you are going to see something very fantastic."

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.040
I said, “What?” I had never seen it before.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.800
He said, “You can see the film show.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.440
You can see everybody moving\h
in it!” I said, “Really?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.280
In the room?” he said, “Yes, you can."

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.440
“Well how can that be?” “You\h
just wait and see! You just wait.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.520
A minute is needed."

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.240
And he prepared me very nicely\h
to give me a big surprise.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.160
He said, “You can see people\h
here, talking and everything."

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.040
And he just opened it, and to\h
my amazement it was working.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.840
It was not connected to anything as\h
such, except for the electricity,\h\h

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.360
and the whole thing started working, and I\h
could see everything happening as he had said.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.520
It was really fantastic, one could not believe it!\h
You start feeling it, “Really, it is true or not?”

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.640
First time I saw the telephone, in\h
India, absolutely when I was very young,\h\h

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.400
and I think, in our house it was\h
remarkable that we got the phone,\h\h

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.600
and were of the few, first people who\h
had the telephone, very few people.

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.920
And that was, when we got it you see.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.800
We just couldn’t believe, “How can it be you\h
can talk to someone on the phone like that?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.520
You can dial to someone and\h
talk?” Immediately we knew one\h\h

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.160
girl who had a telephone so we telephoned to her.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.880
She was not allowed to touch the\h
phone and we telephoned to her.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.760
The father said, “What?

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.720
You’ve got the telephone?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.160
Now we’ve had it! And now you are\h
going to telephone to her!” She said,\h\h

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.960
“I had told you once, if you remember, that there\h
is an instrument like that on which you can speak.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.440
But you never believed me.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.720
Now see, there is a telephone, isn’t it?” Then we\h
had to believe it, because it was all done for us.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.960
It was just to be connected\h
and we started seeing it.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.920
That is the main thing is, that it is all done.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.320
I have told you that three hundred and\h
fifty-million lives you have passed\h\h

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.760
through to get all this thing done\h
and fixed into it; this is built-in.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.040
Now if it fantastic why not have it?

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.240
We don’t have to pay for it.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.840
You cannot! What can you pay?

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.440
Can you pay for three hundred and fifty-million\h
times you have passed through various lives?

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.240
Can you pay for that?

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.840
Can you pay for that love\h
which made you a human being?

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.040
It is too fantastic the whole thing is.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.800
And now what can we pay for it?

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.120
Only thing is to accept it and\h
take it and enjoy it, that’s all.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.520
We can’t think, in modern times, that there could\h
be someone who just invites you for nothing,\h\h

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.520
gives you everything for nothing and\h
enjoys only the giving part of it.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.680
We just can’t think of such a beautiful person.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.440
That’s why people are frightened.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.120
You invite them, they are frightened, “Why,\h\h

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.400
what is it?” “Because I am dealing with\h
some and something — must be that."

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.000
We never trust.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.080
It is true, because we have\h
had very bad experiences.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.840
But we have [also] had people\h
like Christ who gave his life.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:56.640
Today is very important — because we have started\h
the week where he gave his life — to think of him.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.160
Will there be anyone like that who would sacrifice\h
his life to say something that is the Truth?

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.480
He gave his life for Truth.

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.400
For what?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:08.960
Why did he?

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:19.920
Because the giving has much more joy,\h
much more bliss than anything else.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.320
If you reach that state of giving,\h
you will also enjoy giving.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.880
That has to happen.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:34.800
We have to discover that beauty within us\h
which enjoys giving, which enjoys generosity,\h\h

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.400
which enjoys fearlessness, which enjoys all\h
the virtues of the world that reside within us.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.680
We have to just go deep down into ourselves.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.000
And it’s all done for you, it’s all done.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.560
It is there.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.160
So I think we should go in for\h
the experience, that’s the best.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.440
Because what’s the use of\h
talking about it all the time.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:02.240
You see, the cake, if I have made\h
it, better have it hot and enjoy it.

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.920
So many of them have enjoyed, and I\h
want all the new people should enjoy.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.520
Because as I told you yesterday,\h
you cannot give me anything.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.040
I don’t need anything.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.120
I’ve not come here to do Sahaj Yoga.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.120
I’ve come in London because my husband\h
got posted here and that’s how I am here.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.320
I should say it’s your own calling that I am here.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.520
So you are not to give anything\h
to me, nothing is needed.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.640
Only thing is: accept it and just enjoy it.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.200
It’s a gift.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.240
It’s a gift that you deserve, it’s your own right.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.200
You are the son of God and\h
you have to become that.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.600
May God bless you all.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:53.840
Let’s have the experience.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.320
Now, if you have any questions\h
you can ask questions.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.680
No harm in asking questions.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.800
But I would say that first have the experience\h
and then ask the question, would be a better idea.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.720
Now you put your hands just like this towards me.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.080
I would request you to clear out your\h
forehead, is important for me, because,\h\h

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.210
you see, sometimes there are problems\h
on the forehead — mostly they are.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.280
So can you clear out your forehead for me?

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.080
Just clear out.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:25.520
I mean, open it out.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.080
Remove your hair I mean, all the hair.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.720
Can you also remove your hair a little bit?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.440
Ya, it’s good.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:49.840
Just put your hands towards me like this.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.600
This cures your ailments, your physical ailments,\h
it cures cancer, it cures many diseases.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.640
We have cured.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.320
Cancer can only be cured by this.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.240
There’s no other way out.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:11.200
But what’s the use of coming to me after you have\h
got cancer or you have got some serious disease?

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.960
Better get rid of it beforehand.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.840
It’s working out.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.200
Now close your eyes all of\h
you, just close your eyes.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.760
Can you remove your red scarf a little?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.000
Yes, will be a good idea.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.040
You see the Kundalini has to pierce\h
through and I would like to see here also.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.120
First of all watch your mind: is there\h
any thought coming into your mind.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.920
First of all watch your mind.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.000
Just ask your mind, “What are you thinking?”\h
Don’t put your attention anywhere fixed,\h\h

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.240
into concentrated form, but just\h
leave it loose, absolutely loose.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.920
Do not concentrate anywhere.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:10.480
Now, just see if you are feeling the cool\h
breeze in your fingers, because these fingers,\h\h

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:20.080
as I told you, at the end of it, are the\h
sympathetic nervous systems which get enlightened.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:27.840
So you just start feeling on the tip of your\h
fingers, if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.760
If you cannot keep your attention steady you\h
can put your attention to the top of your head\h\h

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:41.840
where you have a soft bone in your childhood.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.505
Thik hai?

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:42.874
(ok?)

00:39:42.874 --> 00:39:45.978
It’s all right I think, it’s working.

00:39:45.978 --> 00:39:48.786
Most of the chakras have cleared out.

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:51.520
I think you are getting cool breeze.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.760
Now you can see, when you are\h
getting cool breeze in your\h\h

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.040
hand also there will be cool breeze\h
from your head here, you can see it.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:03.440
Put your left hand on your head and\h
see for yourself, if it is hot or cool.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.080
Could be cool, could be hot also.

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.920
If it is cool it’s all right, it’s good.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.400
Got it?

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.600
You got the cool breeze too?

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.280
Not yet?

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.040
In the head in the hand?

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:22.000
Not yet?

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.280
It will work out don’t you worry.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.200
Now those who haven’t got\h
it please raise your hands.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.240
All right.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.960
If you don’t mind I’ll ask them to look after you\h
and I’ll also come down to see them, all right?

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.680
Please raise your hands those who\h
haven’t got the cool breeze as yet.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.880
Just attend to them! Keep it like\h
that so that somebody comes to you.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.840
Will you please?

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.720
I think best is the, if people\h
from Brighton do it, it’s better.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.040
You also should, also you should\h
also you should all come and help.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.520
But what I’m saying [is] basically\h
because they will know who they are,\h\h

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.720
what is their name and all that.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.080
It would be better for\h
Brighton people to work it out.

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.840
And also others.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.520
Just see for yourself.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.400
And others should join them\h
just to help them out, you see.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.520
What’s the problem, let’s see!

00:41:17.093 --> 00:41:18.320
Is also left to the right.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.200
Most of them need sort of a\h
balance from left to the right.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.000
Raise it from left to the right,\h
with your left hand towards me,\h\h

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.760
you just raise it from left to the right.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.400
It will work out.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.920
John, you see, he’s also same thing\h
is, left to the right, you see.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.560
Now this gentleman has got it?

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.160
You’ve got the cool breeze?

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.400
Good.

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.000
You can join, you can join\h
John and see what it is.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.640
Just now you can see the whole fantasy of it.

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.040
Come along.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.400
What’s your name?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.000
Yogi: Ross.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.400
Shri Mataji: All right, you\h
join John and let’s see.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:55.440
John?

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.560
You can see yourself, your vibrations will know.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.600
Now come along! Call him!

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.120
Those who got Realisation yesterday\h
also must work it out for themselves.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:05.920
Come along!

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.720
Just see.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.480
Is it cool breeze coming now?

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.880
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.080
You are not feeling in the hand?

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.600
It’s coming out of your head all right.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.360
Are you feeling now?

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.680
It’s Vishuddhi.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.200
He’s got a Vishuddhi, that’s why.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.440
You put your hand on his Vishuddhi.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.680
John?

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.280
Come along you also work it out,\h
all of you who have got Realisation.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.880
You’ve got the cool breeze?

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.040
All right, what about you?

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.840
He’s very good too!
