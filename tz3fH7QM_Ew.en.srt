1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,898
Sahajayoga and essential medicine

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:13,994
Shri Mataji Nirmaladevi- grandmother,
scholar and freedom fighter.

3
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:20,770
As a child she lived in Gandhiji’s ashram,
as a student she studied medicine

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,259
and as cry for freedom swept India
she fought for her nation’s independence.

5
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:31,455
The year 1970 was about her most important role.

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:39,611
The discovery of development of sahajayoga,
 a movement which is now spreading in worldwide.

7
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:44,390
Sahajayoga is a science of
integration which results

8
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:48,391
in man’s mental, physical
and spiritual wellbeing.

9
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,393
The union of mind heart and spirit
is a achieve through the working

10
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:56,619
of a subtle energy system
within each one of us.

11
00:00:56,803 --> 00:01:13,596
“That you are not this body, this mind, these
conditionings, this ego but we are the spirit.

12
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:25,147
You don’t have to accept what I am saying blindly because
blind faith leads to fanaticism.

13
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:31,151
But as scientist you must keep
your mind open and see for

14
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:39,819
yourself what I am saying if it is
so honestly you must accept it.”

15
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,910
In today’s society this subtle energy system which
has its origins in very 

16
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,999
roots of our being has been neglected.

17
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,039
It is out of balance.

18
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:55,785
Today’s physical and psychological diseases
are gross expressions of a subtle system in

19
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:59,408
dire need of repair and nourishment.

20
00:01:59,434 --> 00:02:03,063
Our collective desire of a peace and rejuvenation 

21
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:06,310
is a yearning coming from deep within.

22
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,970
It is a reflection of our internal condition.

23
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:26,352
“We know so much though science about
our civilization our advancement .

24
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:36,329
This is a advancement of a tree which has
grown outside very much but if we do not

25
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:42,656
know our roots we will be destroyed.

26
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:48,954
So it is important to know about our roots.

27
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,245
"Within each individual the subtle energy
system or subtle body is divided into 3 channels

28
00:02:56,568 --> 00:03:00,297
right, left and centre.

29
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,682
The right side channel corresponds
to right sympathetic chain

30
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:08,982
of the autonomic nervous system and
left hemisphere of the brain.

31
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:12,541
While the left side connects to
the right hemisphere of the brain

32
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:15,968
 and corresponds to the left sympathetic chain.

33
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:20,538
If a person suffers a stroke in
the right lobe of the brain

34
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:25,731
it is commonly known that the left
side of the body becomes effective.

35
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:29,451
In line with the opinion of
the psychologist sahajayoga

36
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:32,469
identifies the right hemisphere of the brain has

37
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:35,318
been responsible for the
functions of the lateral,

38
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,575
artistic, expressive thinking. Those
functions traditionally believed

39
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:45,547
to be more predominant in a females.
The left hemisphere corresponds

40
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:50,457
to functions of the linear,
computational and mathematical logic

41
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:56,426
traditionally considered to be
predominant brain activity in males.
 

42
00:03:56,539 --> 00:04:02,137
Dr. Carl Gustakh Jung well known analytical psychologist

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,588
identifies the left and right side as the anama and anami

44
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:12,374
with the collective unconscious lying in the central channel.

45
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:16,924
Through he studies he observe that in the every women

46
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:22,777
there is a masculine aspect within her
psyche the architect of the animus and

47
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,753
for every men the feminine counterpart the anima.

48
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:33,876
Jung was always aware of the imbalance in
western culture in favour of the masculine

49
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:39,130
seen in a preference for logic,
analysis and external achievement.

50
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:42,597
These are all claims for mascular side or right

51
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,887
side of the psyche
within all human beings.

52
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:54,883
A right side channel also provides the energy
needed for plan, act, analyze and predict.

53
00:04:54,955 --> 00:05:00,823
On the physical level it
corresponds to liver and pancreas.

54
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:10,387
“This power of action moves on the
right side of the spinal cord

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,180
and coming to the optic
chiasma it crosses over;

56
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:24,294
passes to the left side and creates
an institution called ego.

57
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:31,122
The institution of ego is a myth.

58
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:39,990
What we do is to get something dead like
some trees dead so make some platform

59
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:46,291
or some furniture, we take
some stones and make a hall

60
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:49,525
and we think we have done a great job.

61
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:54,750
Actually what we have done is to reconstructed the dead.

62
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:58,679
But while doing it we get the feeling

63
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,663
that we have done it something.

64
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:04,629
That is how our ego develops.

65
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:15,848
This channel on the right hand side caters
to your future.

66
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:27,246
So those people who plan too much think too much
exhaust the energy of this centre

67
00:06:27,246 --> 00:06:33,772
because this centre has
the first responsibility

68
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:39,283
to convert the fat cells in the
stomach for the use of the brain

69
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:45,973
which is overused to make them into gray cells.

70
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:58,179
So when you start thinking too much it has to
work more for this very important function.

71
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:05,212
When it starts working for one function the other functions are neglected

72
00:07:05,288 --> 00:07:10,766
and the other functions are it has to cater,

73
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:18,407
to nourish or to give energy to your liver, to your pancreas, to your spleen,

74
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:23,260
to your kidneys and part of your intestine.”

75
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:27,282
Western medicine has followed the path of right side

76
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,980
pulling a part dissecting or analyzing

77
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:34,074
with little regard for the whole working mechanism of the human being.

78
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:40,291
“Of course when you neglect your liver you know liver as they say you

79
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,854
will live till your liver will allow.

80
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:49,761
Now this liver has to clean all the

81
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:57,875
poison from your body. It comes out as
heat and is delivered to the blood stream.
。

82
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:02,748
But when this is neglected
this poor liver doesn’t know

83
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:10,242
how to function without the energy and all
the heat is accumulated in the liver.

84
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:14,651
So a person suffers
from liver trouble

85
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,840
and symptoms are he gets migraine,

86
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:24,351
he cannot see the sun then also
he gets very hot tempered,

87
00:08:24,377 --> 00:08:29,830
irritable, angry because
there is so much of heat.

88
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:37,083
Then this heat passes; I was telling
in Canberra most of the Bureaucrats

89
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,472
have this problem

90
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:44,337
because they plan too much and where do we land with

91
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,948
that planning oh God all knows.

92
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:54,950
So then this heat passes
upward and downward

93
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:04,407
so when it passes downward it gives you a
very bad problem of terrible constipation

94
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,055
because the heat constitutes
your intestine large intestines.

95
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:15,725
It also coagulates your kidneys
by which you have kidney trouble

96
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:18,003
you cannot pass your urine.

97
00:09:18,036 --> 00:09:25,114
Then you go on the dialysis and
you are certified as really dead.

98
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,256
Because you cannot last longer.

99
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:33,004
So very expensive treatment but
doctors do not tell you frankly

100
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,814
that oh, you are not going to live.

101
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:40,862
Then this heat can pass upward
and when it goes upward

102
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:46,166
it goes say to your right
heart as shown there.

103
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:50,094
As a result of that you develop asthma.

104
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:54,487
Of course asthma is connected  also with the left side.

105
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:58,590
So when this triggering is
done by the left side

106
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:02,541
then you get this horrible disease called asthma.

107
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:09,230
Then this heat can go upward and can ruin your throat.

108
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,610
It can freeze your right arm.

109
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:22,148
It can make your left eye red
and also your left ear deaf.

110
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:30,960
But by chance if such a person is
young and using too much physical

111
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:37,259
energy and mental energy as well as
drinking a lot he can have a very

112
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:42,299
fatal heart attack very massive one
and he may die in very early in age.

113
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:45,493
You must know that all such attacks in

114
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,999
young age always are fatal.

115
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:56,289
But when you see to the
other side is that there

116
00:10:56,325 --> 00:11:00,270
is a pancreas which is neglected

117
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:03,967
as a result of the
neglect of the pancreas

118
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,958
you develop a disease called diabetes.

119
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,520
Even the mothers who are extremely
planning type and thinking

120
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,281
type give that disease
to their children

121
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:18,299
and children are
born with diabetes.

122
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,443
Then you have the third problem with the spleen.

123
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:27,602
This is the most dangerous one.

124
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,992
Now a days as the life is
we are all time bound

125
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:35,054
very particular about time.

126
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:39,309
As a result of that we have
become extremely hectic.

127
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:42,538
Supposing if you sleep very late in a night

128
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,163
then you have to get up early in the morning somehow.

129
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:50,251
Somehow get into your clothes
and run to the office.

130
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:55,059
Don’t even take your breakfast; your
wife will give you so on the way in

131
00:11:55,075 --> 00:12:00,926
the car you are eating your breakfast
and then you read the newspaper.

132
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,111
You get a shock of your life because
so many horrible things are happening.

133
00:12:05,244 --> 00:12:09,802
Newspaper will never give something
that is good or is doing well.

134
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,549
But something that is gone wrong to
give a sensational feeling.

135
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:19,476
It’s just a sometimes horrible
thing so early in the morning

136
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:23,357
if you read something that is horrible being
a human being then you sometimes shocked.

137
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:28,470
Then you find there is a
jam on the way and you

138
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,557
get so upset and all
your peace is disturbed.

139
00:12:31,606 --> 00:12:38,079
Now this spleen is responsible for
creating red blood corpuscles

140
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:42,112
when you are in emergency.
You must have seen when you eat

141
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,725
your food and you run you get a pain here.

142
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:49,679
That’s because your spleen is
trying to pump out new RBC’s.

143
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:58,952
Now to create that poor this spleen has
to work very hard but it cannot

144
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,728
understand the crazy hectic personality.

145
00:13:01,776 --> 00:13:05,206
Every time it tries to cope with it.It goes crazy.

146
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:09,831
So such a spleen becomes crazy and ultimately leads

147
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,420
some triggering on the left hand side;
最终这种情况触发了左边的问题；

148
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:18,068
you develop a horrible disease called as leukemia or blood cancer.

149
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:24,704
also your intestinal problems, the pain
in stomach and all that indigestion

150
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:28,638
all go hand in hand
only because of the

151
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:35,570
one centre only on right hand side. I have
not even described the left side centre.

152
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:41,702
So if I describe all this the whole
Materia Medica will be described.

153
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:46,965
It’s like that. So all the permutations
and combinations of these centres

154
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:55,943
give you physical problem then the left
side gives you the mental problem.”

155
00:13:56,046 --> 00:14:00,869
Jung called the left side the
collective subconscious.

156
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:04,496
This side of our psyche
is very complex and

157
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:09,121
affects it can have on our physical
wellbeing are devastating.

158
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:19,932
“Because as it has been hypothesized in
Sahajayoga that there are 7 main plexuses

159
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:27,320
and their functioning is dependent upon
the individuals psycho social behavior.

160
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:35,091
This is advancement in the understanding of
psychosomatic medicine and human physiology.

161
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:43,215
For the first time it is possible to find the links between the behavior and the disease.

162
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:48,468
Because up till
now it was only thought that stress

163
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:54,597
can cause a variety of diseases
from diabetes, hypertension, asthma,

164
00:14:54,653 --> 00:15:00,883
rheumatoid arthritis, etc. etc. cancer even.
But it was not known 

165
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,660
why a particular individual will get a particular
disease.”

166
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:08,947
“ if you read disease in
medical literature you find

167
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:11,990
you could say that it
is psychological stress

168
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:16,179
which is responsible for increasing
incidence of hypertension

169
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:21,163
in most of the western countries, developing
countries as well as the developed countries

170
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:25,247
and we found by our first thesis you
see on which work was done that

171
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,793
this could be a very important if
a person practices sahajayoga

172
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,627
this stress factor can be managed very nicely.

173
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:37,036
Because all the parameters you see
for testing whether a person is in a

174
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:40,132
state of stress,
tension or anxiety are

175
00:15:40,183 --> 00:15:43,214
in his relaxed
strain who are done

176
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:46,473
and that we found that a
person who do sahajayoga

177
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:51,791
only for 20 minutes a day
you see in about 3-4 months time that

178
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,331
there were changes in the blood,

179
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,640
there were changes in heart,

180
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,201
there were changes in the lactrine cyclograph,

181
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,236
there were changes in
the muscle activity

182
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,456
and the changes
in the neurotransmitter.”

183
00:16:02,474 --> 00:16:05,003
In the essential  hypertension group we have taken

184
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:09,813
25 female patients of
a similar age group

185
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:13,099
and socioeconomic status

186
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:18,737
and out of these 15 patients
voluntarily consented

187
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:23,486
to practice sahajayoga while 10
patients acted as controls

188
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:30,819
and these patients initially both the groups
were on drugs also.

189
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:40,523
The initial blood pressure in the sahajayoga group
was 169/109 mm of mercury

190
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:49,136
and in the control group it
was 166/111 mm of mercury

191
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:54,793
and as the study
progressed for four months

192
00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:00,646
we observed that many of the
patients gradually could be taken

193
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:07,345
of the antihypertense of medication
and at the end of 4 months all the

194
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,830
patients in the sahajayoga group could be taken

195
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:15,204
of the antihypertense of
medication and the blood pressure

196
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:20,768
had reached the level of
135/83 mm of mercury.

197
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:28,459
While the control group blood pressure remained
at 167/111 mm of mercury

198
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:33,866
and this shows that it is possible to treat this condition

199
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:40,164
essential hypertension by practice of
sahajayoga and without taking medicines.”

200
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:46,182
“ In my hospital I began to hold
 

201
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,938
use sahajayoga treatment on children and

202
00:17:49,052 --> 00:18:00,066
it so nice to see how it’s possible
to resolve many questions, many problems

203
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:09,078
corresponds child 7 yrs and
he had big liver 1 cms

204
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:17,558
and lot of problems with joints and doctors
could not make correctly diagnose.

205
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:23,289
But when
I feel what chakras were affected.

206
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:28,833
It was most swadhishthan, nabhi and agya

207
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:36,998
and after first my cleaning liver decreased 4 cm

208
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:43,682
and everyday more one cm and after
10 days he was absolutely well.

209
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:52,674
He had lot of neurological problem
like teak like neurotic reaction

210
00:18:52,761 --> 00:18:58,200
and when he came back father
couldn’t recognize him.

211
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:03,082
He sit quietly without problem. But of course

212
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:08,563
you can’t introduce sahajayoga only
in children mother has to be very very

213
00:19:08,612 --> 00:19:16,308
with the children and the same
and its usefull in other disease

214
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:23,131
or for reference I worked in department of
intensive care and recepation.

215
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:33,344
Sometimes I rise kundalini and severe attack of
bronchial asthma disappear and many other cases .

216
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:43,798
Now I began to with one group of
sahajayoga in hospital doctors,

217
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:53,465
nurses and other during about
2 months we began to start probably hospital

218
00:19:53,497 --> 00:19:56,472
and it gives effect.

219
00:19:56,472 --> 00:20:01,633
I am so happy that I stay in sahajayoga.

220
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:05,067
and everyday thanks Shri Mataji.
Jai Shri Mataji.”

221
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:10,529
Western medicine has enhanced the quality
of our life enormously

222
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:15,556
and enables us to experience hillo to
unknown heights in medical efficiency.

223
00:20:15,556 --> 00:20:21,957
 But in doing so it has lost sight of the whole.

224
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:26,960
By contrast medical doctrines
such as traditional Chinese medicine

225
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,961
approach the human being as a whole
personality the emotional stability,

226
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,858
mental attitude spiritual requirement and

227
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:42,259
also sense morality are considered in a
traditional chinese process of medical treatment.

228
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:46,113
As a result traditional
Chinese medicine treatment

229
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,539
has a subtlety which
western medicine lacks.

230
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,240
With this realization we have tried to

231
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,652
translate Chinese medicines into western
culture and into western contexts

232
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:03,104
but in doing so the foundation has largely been lost.

233
00:21:03,104 --> 00:21:06,769
The focus in western medicine remains set up on the element

234
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:13,340
and not upon a whole person or his
subtle relationship with the universe.

235
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,775
Like Jung’s anima and animus the
yin and yang represents the

236
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:23,968
masculine or feminine or right
or left side of our psyche.

237
00:21:23,984 --> 00:21:27,755
The yang being masculine active right side and

238
00:21:27,755 --> 00:21:33,327
yin being the feminine passive side.

239
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,985
Viewed in a light of sahajayoga we can see

240
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,970
how this parallel is the subtle system.

241
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,909
In sahajayoga Tao refers to the
balancing of right and left side.

242
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:50,871
When this balance is maintained the
healing energy is able to travel

243
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:55,228
on the central channel to integrate
and nourish all the energy centers

244
00:21:55,228 --> 00:22:00,575
and ultimately keep us in harmony
with the balance of nature.

245
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:05,069
“As we have two sides in our system of

246
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,408
autonomous nervous system left and right

247
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:10,505
which we call as left and right
sympathetic nervous system.

248
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:20,185
The left side caters for our emotions, for our
past, our desires.

249
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:26,730
The right side caters for our action physical and mental.

250
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,758
If we indulge into one too much and go too far with it

251
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:34,586
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

252
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:39,992
In the centre lies the third power which
we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

253
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,599
This is channel which is the central
path of ascent.

254
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,448
When the kundalini rises through it, it brings you in
the balance

255
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:53,191
because it rises in the
centre of the system.

256
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:57,616
So this is a minimum that happens
that you develop your balance.”

257
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:06,979
The ascent which is the awakening
of this feminine energy coiled

258
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:13,234
and sleeping in our sacrum bone nourishes
and revives the subtle system.

259
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:18,898
She is like the Mother Earth
or our own Mother soothing,

260
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:24,663
nourishing and sustained the
powers of gentle and strong.

261
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:29,824
She is the kundalini the very root of our existence.

262
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:36,034
Within her lies the potential for us to
become complete in knowledge of ourselves.

263
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:42,017
“All right what I tried to show them that this
is the left side this is the right side.

264
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:44,775
This is the left sympathetic nervous system

265
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:47,040
and same this is the right
sympathetic nervous system

266
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,197
and really spinal cord
looks like this and

267
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:55,038
inside here is the spinal cord which has
the centres in it.

268
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,118
The subtle centres.

269
00:23:57,118 --> 00:24:00,539
Now when you start using
the energy of these

270
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:07,482
centres say too much on the right
and it starts moving more towards

271
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:11,839
the right and there is a constriction
and the power becomes less because

272
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,242
you are exhausted going more towards
the right side.

273
00:24:16,242 --> 00:24:19,935
Suddenly something happens that from left there is a jerk

274
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:23,634
then the connection is completely broken.

275
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,585
This is on its own.

276
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:28,901
It starts
working on its own that’s we say

277
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:33,935
that this has become malignant and no
relationship with the whole

278
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:36,413
to have the proportionate growth.

279
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,218
So if the nose starts developing it can cover

280
00:24:39,218 --> 00:24:42,226
your eyes and cover your mouth everything.

281
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:46,181
This is how a cancer is set
in or any other disease

282
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:52,323
so many psychosomatic disease are nothing but
somatic is from right side and when

283
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:56,838
the psyche gives in then it becomes a
psychosomatic.

284
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:02,442
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic
than the physical

285
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:09,953
and these we call them as incurable can be easily cured
by kundalini awakening

286
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:14,286
because when kundalini passes through this she
just integrates them for example

287
00:25:14,286 --> 00:25:20,099
she going like this then she goes into
this integrates them.

288
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:25,320
Just like she strings them like pearls and so they

289
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,577
are brought round and also
she nourishes that centre

290
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:36,009
that’s how people get cured automatically
by themselves by their own power.”

291
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,981
Again if we look at traditional Indian medicine

292
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:45,573
the purpose of Ayurvedic medicine was
to integrate the mental, physical

293
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:48,295
and spiritual wellbeing of patient.

294
00:25:48,295 --> 00:25:52,826
The identification of three
points of reference bile,

295
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:56,937
phlegm and wind corresponds
in sahajayoga to the

296
00:25:56,937 --> 00:26:01,364
manifestation of right, left and
central channels respectively.

297
00:26:01,364 --> 00:26:05,707
“As you know that health is normally that is not diseased
 

298
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:10,070
but it is the state of
complete mental, physical,

299
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:13,735
emotional, spiritual
and social wellbeing.

300
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:19,506
Now this spiritual aspect of health
has been missed in modern medicine.

301
00:26:19,506 --> 00:26:24,155
It is not known, taught or practiced in modern medicine.

302
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:30,287
This word kundalini does not find
mention in the modern medical textbooks

303
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:37,339
but it was mentioned in and may
mentioned Indian medical textbooks

304
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:41,329
of Ayurveda and many other religious
textbooks religious scriptures.”

305
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:46,928
“There is a subtle power which is
all pervading of God’s love which
 
306
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:56,348
manifests all the thing like living
work, all nourishment all balancing.

306
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,345
It’s so balanced.

307
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:05,554
If the pacific was slightly deeper than
this; there would have been problems.

308
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:15,630
If Himalaya was say one and half times than what it is there
would have been problems.

309
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,981
So everything is so balanced in nature.”

310
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:26,269
"Which is the subtle energy
all around us which organizes us and

311
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:31,243
which nourishes us, does all the
living work and above all it loves us”
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:38,544
Sahajayoga takes us back to this original
desire and in practice for future.

312
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:43,905
In adressing of spiritual needs
of the human being sahajayoga has

313
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:49,666
potential to bring balance back into
west and back into western medicine.

314
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:54,632
The essence of sahajayoga is not to cure
people.

315
00:27:54,657 --> 00:28:00,067
This is a side effect of the subtle
system bring itself into balance

316
00:28:00,067 --> 00:28:05,680
As its called sahajayoga enables
us to discover our true selves

317
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,503
the purpose of our being, the true meaning of why we are here.

318
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:19,796
“The reason is you
have to now become the spirit

319
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:39,899
go beyond your physical, emotional,
mental being and become the spirit.

320
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:51,060
Because spirit is the
reflection of God all mighty

321
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,883
and spirit is the universal being within you.

322
00:28:57,883 --> 00:29:10,139
When you become the spirit you
become a universal being.”
