1
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:13,564
Today, we have gathered here to do
Ganesha Puja.

2
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:20,122
I know very well that Ganesha is the symbol

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,316
of purity, of sanctity,

4
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:36,191
and worshipping the innocence.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,683
When you are worshipping Shri Ganesh,
you have to know

6
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:48,376
that He is the embodiment of innocence.

7
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:55,544
I wonder if we understand the meaning
of innocence or not.

8
00:00:56,134 --> 00:01:02,293
Innocence is a quality, which is innate,

9
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,960
which cannot be forced, which cannot
be trained into.

10
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:15,729
It’s just a quality, innate quality,
within a human being.

11
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:23,842
When he becomes Shri Ganesha’s disciple,
he becomes an innocent person.

12
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:28,187
Maybe you say that innocent persons

13
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:33,724
are attacked by the cunning,
by the aggressive.

14
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:40,285
But innocence is such a great thing
that it cannot be destroyed.

15
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:46,350
Is the quality of the Spirit. Innocence is
the quality of the Spirit.

16
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:55,022
And when this Spirit within you is
awakened, you get the power of innocence,

17
00:01:55,223 --> 00:02:02,288
by which you overcome all that is negative,
all that is wrong,

18
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:11,087
all that is detrimental to your growth,
spiritual understanding.

19
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:16,369
So to be innocent is not possible.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,197
You have to be innocent, in the sense
that you are innately innocent.

21
00:02:24,398 --> 00:02:30,313
This happens after Sahaja Yoga,
after Realization.

22
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:37,550
And your power to fight all these

23
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:43,105
wrong, negative feelings within you,
and without,

24
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:53,190
are absolutely supported, protected
by the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

25
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:04,444
It’s difficult these days to tell somebody
about innocence.

26
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:12,203
But you know the life of Christ.
He was a innocent - innocence.

27
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:16,931
He didn’t know what sort of people
He was around.

28
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:23,813
He thought they were all innocent. And so
He was talking to them in a manner

29
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:34,331
that nobody who was cunning would
have done that.

30
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:38,163
Because cunning always understand
the cunning of others.

31
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:45,740
And He said things which may not have
been understood by people;

32
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:52,446
but whatever He said had the vibrations
of innocence.

33
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:58,996
That should have put all these people
in a proper sense,

34
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,255
in a proper relationship with Him.

35
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,494
But somehow, that was not the time
perhaps for them

36
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,942
to be realized souls.

37
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:17,143
So the innocence of Ganesha was not,
that we should we say, defeated,

38
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:26,585
but was very much - created an atmosphere
of such sanctity

39
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:31,135
and beauty that you can see in the life
of Christ.

40
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,046
I’m happy you all have heard about
your marriages.

41
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:44,229
Why the marriage? What is the need
to have a marriage?

42
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,643
After all, these days people are living
without marriage.

43
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:53,117
But marriage means the sanctity
of marriage.

44
00:04:53,677 --> 00:05:02,104
Sanctity of your physical, mental
and emotional integration.

45
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:07,831
If you do not have the sanctity and you
live with a person,

46
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:15,120
then it is not perfect. The children you
will produce will not be all right.

47
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,882
That’s why the marriage is necessary.

48
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:23,792
And as you know, Christ went to attend
a wedding.

49
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,561
Why did He pay so much attention
to a wedding?

50
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:33,112
Because that sanctifies your relationships
with each other.

51
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:38,317
Anything is all right, but relationship

52
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:42,085
between husband and wife have
to be sanctified.

53
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:48,046
Otherwise, the children you produce
could turn out to be anything.

54
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:56,565
They may be robbers, they may be cheats,
they may be liars,

55
00:05:56,766 --> 00:06:03,003
they may be very, very cruel people,
if there’s no sanctity about the marriage.

56
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:07,374
That’s why He went to sanctify the marriage
institution.

57
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:13,194
But is absolutely wrong and nonsense
that He created alcohol.

58
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:23,198
What He did was to change the water
into the taste of grape juice.

59
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,511
“Alcohol” is called as “grape juice”
in Hebrew language.

60
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:35,792
You can say it is not called, but “wine”
means alcohol

61
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:40,518
as well as grape juice. But it cannot be,

62
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:45,581
because instantly you cannot create
alcohol.

63
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:49,874
Alcohol takes time, it has to rot
and rot and rot.

64
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:57,268
Then it becomes an alcohol. But if Christ
has made it

65
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:05,065
 in such a sahaj manner, spontaneously,
how can it be an alcohol that intoxicates?

66
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:08,499
So, many people, specially in Christian
religion,

67
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,968
believe that Christ sanctified wine,
which is absolutely wrong.

68
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,311
He never sanctified alcohol. He changed

69
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:28,206
the grape juice into wine tasting.

70
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,968
The other day, I happened to meet person,

71
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,016
as you know him, Romano Battaglia.

72
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:39,483
And he said: “Mother, You give me
Realization”.

73
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:42,925
I said: “Alright, get me some water.”

74
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:47,659
Brought some water, I put my fingers
into it.

75
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,425
And then he tasted and said: “Mother,
it tastes like wine!” I said: “That’s it!

76
00:07:52,626 --> 00:07:58,519
That’s what Christ has done.” So,
there is no sanctity of alcohol.

77
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,574
How can you expect Christ to do
something like that,

78
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,083
by which your awareness absolutely
goes wrong.

79
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,624
Those people who drink, you know,
are not normal people.

80
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,816
Something goes wrong with their brains.
When they drive, they create problems.

81
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:25,234
When they are talking to somebody,
you can make out that they are not normal.

82
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,675
They try to be very aggressive,

83
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:32,757
sometimes they can be very passive also.
Mostly they are very aggressive,

84
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,199
and very much behaving in a manner
that doesn’t behove a human being.

85
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,183
So, we must understand that

86
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:48,503
this wine, so-called, which is being
fermented for days together,

87
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:53,759
is very wrong and against the spiritual
life.

88
00:08:54,911 --> 00:09:04,109
All those countries where alcohol
is accepted as a very sanctified thing,

89
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,136
are just going to dogs.

90
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:12,574
It is against Shri Ganesh. It’s against
innocence.

91
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:18,081
And so, such a person can become
very cunning, very shrewd,

92
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:22,909
very dominating – all kinds of bad things
can come through him.

93
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,550
And one cannot trust a person who drinks
and becomes a drunkard.

94
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:33,874
He can get after his wife, his children,
anybody.

95
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:40,174
And try to destroy their lives, because
he knows he is himself destroyed.

96
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:46,261
So the one thing one has to understand,
innocence doesn’t allow you

97
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:51,152
to have anything like that, that goes
against your awareness.

98
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:56,624
Your human awareness is very important.
That must be respected.

99
00:09:56,825 --> 00:10:01,593
Anything that you take that spoils
your awareness or spoils your health

100
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:06,367
is all wrong for - specially for sahaj
yogis.

101
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:11,499
You have to keep your health all right.
How do you keep your health all right?

102
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,232
By avoiding all such things – those which
destroy your health.

103
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:22,089
So the married life is a sanctified life.

104
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,722
Is a life which is been blessed.

105
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:32,152
Now we have peace, but I would say
in Sahaja Yoga, they are all blessed by Me.

106
00:10:32,353 --> 00:10:38,589
So one should understand that this is
a very big thing that you have got.

107
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,425
But there are many I have known, who come
round saying: “Mother, we want a divorce.

108
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:47,437
We are trying to make up a good marriage…”

109
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:50,646
All kinds of stories they tell Me.

110
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:54,320
If you know it’s a sanctified marriage –

111
00:10:54,547 --> 00:11:04,894
is a marriage which is been done under
all the ceremonies of Sahaja Yoga –

112
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:12,070
it cannot be a bad marriage. But if you
are bad, nobody can help you.

113
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:17,726
If you have funny ideas about marriages,
you should try to correct it.

114
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,370
If you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga,
then please see

115
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:26,527
that you respect the sanctity of married
life.

116
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,999
I know, sometimes women can be bad,

117
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,269
men can be bad, there can be problems.

118
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:38,081
But a person who is wise will try
to endure all that.

119
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:46,085
Because she wants or he wants to respect
the sanctity of marriage.

120
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:53,812
This one is a very contradictory thing
then, which comes to,

121
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,720
that Christ was born without the marriage.

122
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:02,053
And Ganesha was also born without
the marriage.

123
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:06,210
They Themselves are sanctity.

124
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:09,574
They don’t need any sanctity from outside.

125
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,273
They are innocence, and for innocent
people,

126
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:21,183
They don’t need any kind of a ritual
or a kind of a ceremony.

127
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:27,316
That’s how They have been born,
absolutely pure, of innocence.

128
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:32,472
But that doesn’t mean that we should
take Their example into ourselves.

129
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:36,882
They were divine personalities, and They
were to be born like that.

130
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,985
While we have to be sanctified and leading
a sanctified life.

131
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:48,564
This is a difference between an incarnation
and a human being.

132
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:56,362
Is easy to criticise incarnations.
Very simple to criticise Them.

133
00:12:56,563 --> 00:13:00,362
All incarnations have been criticised
by human beings,

134
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,534
because human beings cannot understand
Them.

135
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:09,624
But try to be really very pure and
innocent,

136
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:14,796
 and then you will understand that why
Their lives were on a different line,

137
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:17,479
different style.

138
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,701
Now, if you say: “We can develop
innocence, Mother”, you cannot.

139
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:31,905
Which is the way to become innocent?
In Sahaja Yoga,

140
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:38,835
we have a proper method how we can
become innocent.

141
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:45,866
It happens through our thoughtless
awareness.

142
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:50,011
If you are in the state of thoughtless
awareness,

143
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:53,444
then what happens, you do not react.

144
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:58,845
You do not get involved into wrong things.

145
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,190
You do not get involved into any
discussions, arguments. But you just watch.

146
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:08,397
And the innocence within you rises
beautifully,

147
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:13,416
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond.

148
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,190
So, whatever may be the circumstances,

149
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:21,038
when you are in thoughtless awareness,
you do not react.

150
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:27,808
That is the sign of innocence. And people
who do not react keep young.

151
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:31,140
They will never show their age,
they keep young.

152
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:40,925
Because to react is not a very good thing,

153
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:45,753
which makes you get involved into
another person.

154
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:51,479
But if you don’t react, if you are just
watching, and you are a witness,

155
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,753
then you don’t get involved into anything.
You are away from everything.

156
00:14:55,954 --> 00:15:02,673
And that’s how your innocence grows
and you get very confident.

157
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:09,790
I’ve read a story about a Chinese king,
who went

158
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:19,585
to a saint, and asked Him that he wants
some boon from Him. He said, “What?”

159
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:25,925
He said: “I want my son to be developed
into a person

160
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,976
who can face all kinds of people.

161
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:32,925
Whatever people may do, he should
be able to face them”.

162
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:36,645
He said: “Alright, you leave your son
with me”.

163
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,663
So, when the arguments started,
when the fighting started,

164
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,675
his son was just standing straight,

165
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,733
watching everything in thoughtless
awareness.

166
00:15:46,934 --> 00:15:54,358
So, everybody from the arena went back,
they all went away.

167
00:15:54,559 --> 00:16:02,209
And they couldn’t stand the innocence
of this boy, who was very young.

168
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,252
And the king was surprised how his son
could face

169
00:16:06,453 --> 00:16:10,397
all of them, all their arguments,
all their aggression

170
00:16:10,598 --> 00:16:14,811
and all kinds of horrible things
they said to him.

171
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:20,889
If anybody says anything to you, you should
just be innocent.

172
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,901
At that time, your power of innocence
will show

173
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:29,705
that this person, who is trying
to dominate you,

174
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:34,240
to trouble you, is very much in the wrong.

175
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:39,834
And the person himself might realise that:
“I’m doing all these things

176
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:45,140
and this fellow, the one on whom I’m trying
to dominate,

177
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,658
is not taking any note of it.”

178
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:52,238
So he feels very weak.

179
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:55,699
He thinks he has no power to dominate
a person.

180
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,070
So this is we have now as sahaj yogis:

181
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:01,933
we can get into thoughtless awareness.

182
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:06,140
Try to reduce your reactions, reaction
to anything.

183
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:11,453
People have such funny ideas about
themselves that they react.

184
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:16,047
Now for example, somebody showed me
those carpets,

185
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,121
I’ve started watching, I was very happy.
And they told me

186
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:25,394
all the sahaja yoginis have made these
with their hands, so beautifully.

187
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:30,461
I mean, it was really so joyful to know
that they have done it.

188
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:37,355
But if I was a very normal person, I would
have said: “Oh, My God,

189
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,285
what a colour! What a thing!” and all
that ... like that.

190
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:45,218
So whatever they have done, I can’t even
enjoy that.

191
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:51,203
One thing is the enjoyment is lost.
For a child, enjoyment is complete.

192
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:56,929
Whatever he sees, he makes a joy,
joyful thing out of it.

193
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,808
You look at children - I’ve seen children,

194
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:03,793
they find anything, they make a toy
out of it.

195
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:10,324
The other day, we had gone to Genoa and
I saw there were big blockets kept there.

196
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,422
Some children came from somewhere.
They just climbed on that

197
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,629
and made horses out of them. And were
enjoying them.

198
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,273
You see, they find anything, any space,

199
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:24,648
they make a joyful thing for them to,
a play for them.

200
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:33,082
For them, life is also a play.
Just a thing of enjoyment.

201
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:35,937
And they make you also enjoy everything.

202
00:18:36,138 --> 00:18:41,211
If you are not in a good mood, they’ll
come and behave in such a manner

203
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:51,070
that you’ll have to come round and become
a very simple, natural person.

204
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:54,277
So to see, a simple natural person,
we always say:

205
00:18:54,478 --> 00:18:59,164
“See, they are like children”. Means they
do not understand the cunning.

206
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:03,820
They do not understand the stupidity
of the people,

207
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:07,082
and they live in their own world
of innocence.

208
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:13,961
In the same way, all the Sahaja Yogis
have to develop that aura around them.

209
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:19,250
Let people see you, how innocent you are,
how sweet you are!

210
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:24,578
No arguments, no quarrelling, no fighting
is needed.

211
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:31,086
It is just the inner satisfaction
of thoughtless awareness.

212
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,898
Many people say: “Mother, we cannot
become thoughtless!”

213
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,472
Why? Why can’t you become thoughtless?

214
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:41,386
Because all the time, whatever you see,
you want to react.

215
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:44,914
If you gradually start stopping reaction -

216
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:48,215
introspect yourself, see for yourself.

217
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:57,806
If you are all the time trying to react,
tell your mind to behave itself.

218
00:19:58,728 --> 00:20:02,972
If there’s any reaction, you just don’t say
anything. Keep quiet.

219
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:07,121
Gradually, you’ll be amazed and surprised

220
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:14,769
how you become thoughtlessly aware,
how beautiful you become.

221
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,152
And everybody who sees you will know that

222
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:23,500
you are something different – you are not
like the normal person.

223
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:27,805
But the normal reaction of human beings is
this, that, if there’s a quarrel going on,

224
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:34,344
say, on the street, everybody will join in
the quarrel. They like to fight.

225
00:20:34,545 --> 00:20:41,532
They want to be part and parcel of that
quarrel or fight or whatever it is.

226
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,965
They don’t want to get out of it.

227
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:49,285
At that time, if you just have your
innocence, that will act.

228
00:20:49,486 --> 00:20:53,093
I told you, innocence is the Spirit,
and Spirit is the innocence,

229
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:58,562
which cannot be destroyed by anything.
The fact is that it cannot be destroyed

230
00:20:58,763 --> 00:21:05,385
by anything, and it can be re-established
through Sahaja Yoga.

231
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:08,424
You might have been a very aggressive
person,

232
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,168
you might have been a very unhappy person,

233
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:16,215
you might have been a person who is
all the time disturbing others – maybe.

234
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:21,390
But after Sahaja Yoga, you can make
your personality so sweet and beautiful,

235
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:26,430
that not only you can enjoy, but others
can also enjoy.

236
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:36,665
This innocence is something which is
absolute, honest intelligence.

237
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:47,410
It is not that it works for the purpose,
some purpose.

238
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:52,621
But it is purposeless. It’s absolutely
purposeless.

239
00:21:52,822 --> 00:22:01,132
And thus it achieves that height of joy
because there is no purpose in anything

240
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:06,069
It sees the futility of all kinds
of endeavours that we have,

241
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,144
and it just enjoys: “Why people are running
up and down, why are they fighting?”

242
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:16,066
Just stands up and sees, that: “Why
should they do it?” – like that.

243
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,183
Some may think they are all right,

244
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:21,664
there’s nothing wrong with them,
but it’s not so.

245
00:22:21,865 --> 00:22:26,296
Innocence is something, I told you,
is an innate quality,

246
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:32,208
and you should not deceive yourself
by thinking you are innocent.

247
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:37,081
On the contrary, you just put some
introspection upon yourself,

248
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:40,751
and see for yourself what have you been
doing so far,

249
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:46,246
as far as others are concerned?
What is your attitude?

250
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:50,093
I have already talked to you about
emotional intelligence.

251
00:22:50,294 --> 00:22:54,902
Emotional intelligence is the expression
of innocence.

252
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:59,621
It is the expression of Shri Ganesha
within you.

253
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:05,347
Children who are gifted with this will
always try to please you.

254
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:08,585
They know what you want, what you need.

255
00:23:08,786 --> 00:23:12,011
They’ll give you all the joy that you want,

256
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:15,757
they’ll do all the things that you like,
just to please you.

257
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:20,789
They don’t have their own wants. They don’t
want to have their own demands.

258
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,160
They never say: “I want this”,
“You do for me” – never!

259
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:29,730
They just want to see what you want,
what do you want to have.

260
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:36,042
And they put all the effort to supply you
with that, whatever you want.

261
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:39,289
It’s very interesting how the children
behave

262
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:47,636
towards others, elders. Just like, I would
say, a great understanding, we should say,

263
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:51,968
like a very elderly personality.

264
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,250
So, in innocence, you become extremely
grown up, matured.

265
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,519
Very matured. With that maturity you know

266
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,410
what this person needs, and what
the other person should not have.

267
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,500
And the way they establish is very
interesting.

268
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:11,722
Children are the most interesting things,
I think, in the world.

269
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:17,824
For me, roses are very beautiful, but
children are the most interesting things.

270
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:24,304
And they teach you so many things that
you are surprised at their innocence.

271
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:29,242
So many jokes are there about the children
– how they behave, how they talk.

272
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:34,203
And they are so innocent that they will
tell everything to everyone.

273
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:40,679
They have no way of hiding anything,
it’s very difficult.

274
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:48,273
I know one joke: when a gentleman
came to the house for dinner.

275
00:24:48,474 --> 00:24:51,997
So the child was looking at him
very intensely.

276
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:55,926
And then he says: “Mother, he doesn’t eat

277
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,032
like a horse, as you told me!”.
So everybody was shocked!

278
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,817
“You see, he doesn’t eat like a horse!”.

279
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,298
Mother must have told him: “He eats
like a horse”.

280
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:07,192
So he looked at him: “He doesn’t
eat like a horse!”. You see,

281
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:10,883
they are so innocent sometimes,
they say things,

282
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:13,872
by which you can get exposed completely.

283
00:25:14,073 --> 00:25:19,575
There are so many jokes about it. And if
you write some books,

284
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:24,485
writing the jokes of children, I tell you,
people will just enjoy it.

285
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:30,133
Because so innocently they say things,
which are nothing but the truth.

286
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:34,438
And they cannot tell lies. They are
so truthful,

287
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,258
that’s the quality of innocence.
They never tell lies.

288
00:25:39,459 --> 00:25:41,676
“You did this?” “Yes, I did.”

289
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:46,235
“You didn’t do this?” “No, I didn’t do.”
They never tell lies.

290
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:55,521
It is we, the grown-ups teach them to how
to tell lies, how to be cheating.

291
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:00,235
Then we teach also our children another
bad thing,

292
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:03,567
that is, “You must possess everything.”

293
00:26:03,768 --> 00:26:08,059
Especially in the West, is a thing they do.

294
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,783
They tell the child that: “This is yours,
you should not give it to anyone,

295
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,153
this is your own.”

296
00:26:16,354 --> 00:26:21,294
On the contrary, you should tell them:
“You can do what you like.”

297
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:22,978
Leave it to their innocence.

298
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,911
You’ll be amazed, they’ll give up
everything that they have.

299
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:30,688
In such a beautiful manner they’ll behave,
that you’ll be amazed

300
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:38,223
how they try to please everyone, and try
to do something to entertain you.

301
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:42,930
All their capacity of this is so great
that sometimes

302
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:47,555
one wonders how these little things
have developed these capacities.

303
00:26:47,756 --> 00:26:52,067
It is the blessings of Shri Ganesha.
Is His blessings

304
00:26:52,268 --> 00:26:59,415
that children are so very sweet and
so much entertaining, and so beautiful.

305
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:03,036
Try to become like them. We have to be
like them.

306
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:07,001
You might have read many books, you might
have got lots of degrees,

307
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:11,868
you might be something great, but you are
not a childlike.

308
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:20,215
You have to be a childlike person.
Otherwise, no one likes your company.

309
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:24,235
We call them bores. But actually boring
comes with the people

310
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:29,609
who have no innocence in their heart.
They are trying to tell you:

311
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:35,079
“You must do this. If you want to be
successful, you do that.”

312
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,145
All these lectures are useless
for children.

313
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:42,657
In the same way, it should be within
your own understanding

314
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:45,778
that it’s all nonsense they are talking.

315
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:49,907
As the children don’t care for what
you suggest to them –

316
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:54,485
to be nasty, to be horrid – in the same
way, if you are innocent

317
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:58,911
you will not accept it. You may listen
to anything,

318
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:02,923
let them tell you anything they want to,
doesn’t matter.

319
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:07,639
You’ll never do that, because you cannot,
because you are innocent.

320
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:11,739
And the innocence will guard you, it will
give you proper guidance

321
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,923
what is to be done, what is not to be
done.

322
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:21,149
Now try to introspect and see for yourself:
“Are you innocent or not?”

323
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,749
People think that somebody is trying
to overpower you,

324
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:34,313
is trying to harm you, is trying to put
you down.

325
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:37,141
Nobody can put down innocence.

326
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:42,958
Innocence is a quality that survives
all kinds of nonsense.

327
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:51,080
And not only that, but age, your health,
your mind,

328
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:57,602
your thinking, and your emotions,

329
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:04,354
are extremely innocent and you enjoy
yourself.

330
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:10,722
Nowadays, there’s a big wave

331
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:16,755
of shamelessness. Sometimes they have.

332
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:21,219
The people I’ve seen, they have no Lajja.

333
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,989
I don’t know, some men want to attract
women

334
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,372
and some women want to attract men.
Children never do like that.

335
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:32,641
They don’t know what is this ‘to attract
men’ or ‘to attract women’,

336
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:39,083
 or ‘attract’ anyone. They’ll try to please
the dog, they’ll try to please a horse,

337
00:29:39,284 --> 00:29:45,778
but they never I’ve seen going all out
to attract someone.

338
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:51,870
The reason is this, that their self-esteem
is complete.

339
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,528
They know about themselves fully.

340
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,669
So why should they do all this nonsense

341
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:03,559
of running after women, running after men
and creating problems for themselves?

342
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,048
Their self-esteem is complete. Innocence
is like that.

343
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:12,001
It gives you a complete self-esteem.

344
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:16,626
You don’t bow to anyone, nor you make
anybody else to bow.

345
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:21,501
 This is the beauty of innocence, which
works out so well within you.

346
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:26,676
That’s why I always say that: “Worship
Shri Ganesha!”

347
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:34,673
I know of somebody who was very highly
placed.

348
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:41,493
And suddenly I was surprised how
he was paralysed.

349
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:47,624
What happened? He was a very good man,
he should not have been paralysed.

350
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:57,767
Then I found out that he had very bad
intentions about women,

351
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:01,985
and that’s how he got this problem.

352
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:06,809
So I told him: “You’d better worship
Ganesha. You worship Shri Ganesha”.

353
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,915
Worshipping the Shri Ganesha improves
your Mooladhara,

354
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:19,122
improves your sense of shame, improves
of your own dignity, self-esteem.

355
00:31:19,323 --> 00:31:25,110
You dress up in a way that shows that
you respect your body.

356
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:30,301
You talk in such a way that shows that
you respect your tongue,

357
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:35,673
your language. You cannot have a foul
mouth if you are an innocent person.

358
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:43,204
Cannot have a mind that can abuse
or can say horrible words.

359
00:31:43,405 --> 00:31:48,969
I have seen, in America, they talk in such
a funny manner that you are shocked.

360
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,438
There’s no need to use these dirty words
to express yourself.

361
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:59,915
With that, your tongue gets spoiled.
So innocence is gone from your tongue.

362
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:02,247
If you have lost innocence from
your tongue,

363
00:32:02,448 --> 00:32:06,579
whatever you say will never come true –
will never come true.

364
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,794
But if you are innocent, and your tongue
is innocent

365
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,376
and respects… So the basic, as you
can see,

366
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:16,270
is respect your innocence in every manner.

367
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:22,505
Like, when you have to get angry with
somebody or say something,

368
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:24,626
just keep quiet is the best way.

369
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:30,907
Or else you must respect your tongue,
respect your eyes.

370
00:32:31,143 --> 00:32:36,141
Some people have a very bad habit of roving
their eyes all over, looking at women;

371
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:41,165
or some women are like that. You don’t
respect your eyes,

372
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:46,891
then they develop problems of the eyes.
Not only that, but mind also.

373
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:54,118
Mind gets so much ruined by this kind
of behaviour that it has no sense.

374
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,829
It cannot enjoy anything. Such a person
cannot enjoy anything.

375
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:06,420
If you are a person who respects your eyes,
your nose, your ears –

376
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:13,012
I tell you, you’ll be amazed. Everything is
so enjoyable.

377
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:16,454
In this world there are so many things
to be enjoyed.

378
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:19,426
But people can’t hear anything that is
good.

379
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:22,665
There are birds who are chirping –
they can’t hear.

380
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:25,544
There are trees, which are growing,
they can’t see.

381
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:29,317
There are flowers, which have fragrance –
they cannot smell.

382
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:33,837
Because they are so much low
in their self-esteem,

383
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:37,497
because they are very low-level people,
I should say,

384
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:40,735
who cannot enjoy everything around.

385
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,602
And they should be a source of enjoyment.

386
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:47,645
You see children, how they are source
of enjoyment!

387
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:51,735
Anybody who comes on the stage and
runs about, I mean, how we enjoy.

388
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:54,872
Why? Why do we enjoy a child running
about?

389
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:59,700
We don’t say he’s gone amuck, or he’s
drunk, but we enjoy the child. Why?

390
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:04,766
What is the sweetness of that child that
makes us so happy?

391
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:09,684
Because that’s innocence. His power
is innocence.

392
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:14,840
With that power, he is just looking
so sweet, so beautiful

393
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:18,376
that it gives us the real joy within us.

394
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:23,555
So the second thing is that innocence
is joy-giving.

395
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:29,086
Innocence gives joy to people. Anything
said innocently,

396
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:34,618
anything done innocently is very,
very joy-giving.

397
00:34:34,819 --> 00:34:42,497
And, in that, you see the person
so transparent, so beautiful,

398
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:52,172
that you enjoy that transparency and
that sanctified innocence.

399
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:55,497
That’s why Ganesha is worshipped first.

400
00:34:55,698 --> 00:35:02,688
Because Ganesha was the first Deity
that was created by Adi Shakti.

401
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:08,876
Because, if She has to create something,

402
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,598
She must know that there has to be
power of innocence.

403
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:15,985
Otherwise people will go wrong, they’ll
do all kinds of wrong things.

404
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:20,516
So first She created Ganesha, whose
innocence –

405
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:26,251
you can call the vibrations – are so strong
that it controls.

406
00:35:26,452 --> 00:35:30,543
Of course, there are people who have
abandoned completely

407
00:35:30,744 --> 00:35:35,145
their innocence and they think no end
of themselves. Just forget about them!

408
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:41,942
But normally, normally, you are always
guided by your innocence,

409
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:47,395
whether you are aware of it or not,
and that is such a sweet thing.

410
00:35:47,596 --> 00:35:50,948
Such a sweet thing that it makes

411
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,774
people rise in their nobleness,
in their greatness.

412
00:35:54,975 --> 00:35:59,727
And that is what we have to develop in us,
the sahaj yogis.

413
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:03,653
When sahaj yogis go anywhere, try to do
anything,

414
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:06,161
meet anybody, any social work

415
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:12,024
anything, people should feel that joy that
you have within yourself.

416
00:36:12,225 --> 00:36:15,635
It’s for that joy only

417
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:20,770
the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha.

418
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:26,145
Because that joy within, of innocent joy,
which doesn’t harm anybody,

419
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:29,344
which doesn’t expect anything, which
doesn’t demand anything,

420
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:35,176
which doesn’t want anything, but just
emitting joy all over -

421
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,473
that sort of a personality you should have.

422
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,766
There’s nothing wrong in wearing good
dresses,

423
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,555
nothing wrong in eating good food,

424
00:36:44,756 --> 00:36:49,258
nothing wrong in having conversations
with people.

425
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:54,001
But in all that, it is the respect
of the innocence,

426
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:57,036
the expression of innocence should be
there.

427
00:36:57,237 --> 00:37:01,657
With this innocence we can solve
the problems –

428
00:37:01,858 --> 00:37:04,387
all the problems of the world can be
solved.

429
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:07,891
That’s why Shri Ganesha is so important.

430
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:14,165
If you do not have proper understanding
of Shri Ganesha,

431
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:20,852
and if your Shri Ganesha is in a jeopardy,
I don’t know what can happen to you.

432
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:26,352
These days, see, so many horrible diseases
are coming,

433
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:31,446
because they are not sanctified. Their
relationships are not sanctified.

434
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:35,958
Every relationship has to be sanctified
with your innocence.

435
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,700
Like, you have a sister, you have a mother,
you have a brother,

436
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,872
you have a father, you have all these
relationships.

437
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:49,727
And these all relationships they are
so good, so beautiful and sanctified,

438
00:37:49,928 --> 00:37:54,485
because there is the relationship
of innocence.

439
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:59,961
You love your father out of innocence, and
you love your daughter out of innocence,

440
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:04,555
you love your mother out of innocence.
Why should you love,

441
00:38:04,756 --> 00:38:08,379
for some sort of a gain? Then it’s
cunning.

442
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:14,692
For some sort of an overpowering?
Then it’s cunning.

443
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:19,293
It’s just for love’s, love’s sake. That’s
possible if you are innocent.

444
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:23,266
So now I’m happy: tomorrow you are
all going to get married.

445
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,059
And those people who are getting married
should understand

446
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,813
that it’s a sanctified marriage.
It’s very important.

447
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:36,645
It’s not like any other marriage. It’s the
marriage taking place in my presence.

448
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:42,012
So be careful! Now, if you do not want
to marry, all right, finish it.

449
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:45,118
You have been given a chance to know
the person, to understand it.

450
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:49,293
But afterwards, if you try to be funny,
it’s going to be very difficult

451
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:54,778
for you and for me. I may give up having
marriages.

452
00:38:54,979 --> 00:39:00,854
So I don’t like people to talk of divorce
from the very first day.

453
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:05,036
But if there is really a problem,

454
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:10,508
it’s all right, in Sahaja Yoga, we have
allowed divorce.

455
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,645
Not, say, the Catholic Church, they don’t
allow divorce.

456
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:17,494
So men have all kinds of relationships
and women have all kinds of relationships.

457
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:22,700
That’s not there. Instead of doing this
kind of a nonsense, you can have a divorce.

458
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:28,318
But it should be very innocent happening.

459
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:32,837
That if you are divorcing a person because
your innocence is challenged,

460
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:37,446
it’s all right. There, I agree with you
that you should have.

461
00:39:37,647 --> 00:39:39,840
So preserve your innocence.

462
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,614
In these modern times, it’s very important
to preserve your innocence,

463
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:53,461
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened
within you, and also in other people.

464
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:57,404
That is going to save this world.
Nothing else,

465
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:02,301
but the innocence that you have,
is going to save the world.

466
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:08,208
 Whatever you may know, whatever you
may say, whatever you may write,

467
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:13,739
please see that you are not hurting
the innocence within you.

468
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:20,114
It’s not necessary to lead a life
of morality, this, that.

469
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,558
What is needed is your innocence.

470
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:28,253
Innocence itself gives you moral strength,
moral understanding.

471
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:33,401
You don’t have to read books for that,
you don’t have to go to any guru for that.

472
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:39,511
Innocence will guide you and tell you
that: “This is what is sahaj,

473
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:44,089
this is what you have to have.” You all
have got Realization,

474
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,413
is a very big thing, that has happened
to so many people.

475
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:53,382
And I always want you to worship
Shri Ganesh within you.

476
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:57,772
Shri Ganesh is your innocence, it is
the Spirit within you.

477
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:02,808
When you want to know your Spirit,
it is Shri Ganesha you become one,

478
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:06,304
one with Shri Ganesh. It is within you,

479
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,737
and is absolutely possible for all of you

480
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:17,216
to be completely enlightened by the power
of Shri Ganesha.

481
00:41:18,091 --> 00:41:22,163
I’m very happy that you have accepted
all the marriages,

482
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,398
and you have decided to marry.

483
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,343
But, even now, if you say no, it’s better
to finish it off.

484
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:31,894
But don’t try any tricks, and don’t try
to be funny,

485
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:36,503
because that is not going to help you
in any way to enjoy your marriage.

486
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:41,917
From the very first day, try to understand
that you have to be very kind.

487
00:41:42,118 --> 00:41:45,890
 Kind to your partner, very respectful,

488
00:41:46,091 --> 00:41:50,561
very caring, very loving. That’s a very
important thing,

489
00:41:50,762 --> 00:41:54,261
which people don’t understand. And do not
take for granted:

490
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:57,561
“It’s alright because it’s a sahaj
marriage”, people take it for granted.

491
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:01,245
No, never take it for granted. If you want
to have real joy,

492
00:42:01,446 --> 00:42:05,901
then have innocent love between yourself
and enjoy yourself.

493
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:08,724
May God bless you. Thank you.
