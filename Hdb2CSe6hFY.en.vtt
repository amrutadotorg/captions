00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.220
So do we start? Please do yes. Oh my gosh all right. You want to start? Ladies first.

2
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:38.780
Okay let us start from long time back and from when I was 16 and it was a time where

3
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.620
Shimataji came to Rome Ashram so we were hosting her and she was to the old Nirmala house in

4
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.620
Rome where mother was staying in a special side of the of the ashram and had a beautiful

5
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.700
room with all the windows that were given to the garden and I had the immense blessing

6
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.900
to look after her. I was one of the many that were looking after her but being like little

7
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.100
you know I had this great blessing to make sure that Shimataji had breakfast and tea

8
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.500
and everything. So being these days there I decided this is my moment you know I am

9
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:36.260
gonna be alone with Shimataji and then I can ask her what is in my heart my greatest desire

10
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.700
which is to be Brahmacharini in my life and you know just to be at the service of the

11
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.140
collective and never get married never have a family because the Sajayogis are my family.

12
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.260
After all I came to Saj when I was 12 and I always lived collectively so for me it was

13
00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.380
clear and this was my mission and I said this is a perfect time you know to ask this to

14
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.300
mother. So I arrived I really prepared my my sentence you know to to ask her and I got

15
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.620
I said this is the right moment I'm serving the tea and I look at Shimataji and I just

16
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.460
said ma not even mother but just ma and Shimataji stopped me immediately and she told me I have

17
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:34.700
to find a nice boy for you. I said no ma not mother and Shimataji immediately in two

18
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.060
seconds there was lots of movement around the room and lots of energy going around and

19
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.580
Shimataji called uncle Guido immediately in the room and I don't know what happened suddenly

20
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.180
my life changing one second and so I didn't know what was happening I felt very confused

21
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.580
and Shimataji was really already talking to uncle Guido about finding a nice boy for me

22
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.020
and I said this is all wrong this is all wrong this is not what I meant mother not at all

23
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.140
and I remember going down the staircase from our room and already all the ashram was down

24
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.940
the stairs and everybody was sort of you know say yoohoo I said cheering say what's happening

25
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:30.500
exactly I don't understand things didn't go exactly the way I meant and then from there

26
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.980
you know one day while I was having my food sock at the top in the room at the roof of the ashram

27
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:50.100
Shimataji called and my parents were eating in the dining room all together and there was this phone

28
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:58.340
call that said that Shimataji had found someone for me to marry and I just remember getting a

29
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.900
very big bang on my head because I stood from my food sock very fast and the roof was very small

30
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.780
so this was the first shock and the second was just to see just to see my parents not getting

31
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.820
any food from their plate because they were missing all the pieces of food they were totally

32
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:33.060
in some sort of strange cloud and then that came the moment at Guru Puja in Gudmunden

33
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:43.860
where I met with her for the first time where she announced the engagement I remember and when she

34
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.700
announced the engagement I remember everybody start cheering and doing you know and all that

35
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.540
I could become like red pepper I remember in my face and I was so shy I couldn't actually reach

36
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.420
the place to go near Shimataji's feet and so Shimataji told them off a little bit and said

37
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.900
you shouldn't do like this because they're very young and they're very shy so you know she sort of

38
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:18.100
quite a little bit the atmosphere until I reached the Shimataji's feet and Vito at the side and I

39
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:25.940
didn't even look at him and Shimataji asked me if I was happy yes of course I don't know I don't

40
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:34.340
see him I don't know yes fine it's good you know and this was the first meeting so at this point

41
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.500
I leave you for the other part and then we move on but isn't there a little bit of a pre I mean

42
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.860
just before then which is the performance yeah but this is your part not mine your reaction though

43
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.740
her reaction was shock I think ah when I saw you the first time with your leotard leotard I was

44
00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.860
wearing a leotard painted hand painted and I just performed a Blake song some Blake songs for

45
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.700
Shimataji dressed in this kind of costume and I don't know what she thought I didn't look at you

46
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:16.980
I just went down anyway I've got to sort of rewind a little bit because I think I think my side

47
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.460
happened a little bit earlier I was in the third year of my university degree in drama

48
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:29.620
American studies and I to be honest had been sort of you know in Sajyoga for about three years

49
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:38.020
and I'd lived a sort of almost like a monk's life at university and I was getting a bit lonely and

50
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.620
you know the strain of being probably the only student there who didn't have some sort of

51
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.660
romantic attachment and I was sort of you know it was like my final sort of couple of months

52
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.260
before the finals and I had to study and it was all getting much I was on my own and intense and

53
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.740
one morning I was sitting in front of the photograph and had a huge photograph so many

54
00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.060
students passed through my room and I asked them to feel the vibrations they felt cool

55
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:17.380
mostly felt cool and I hardly ever felt cool I don't know why that was unfortunately but

56
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:26.020
there I was that morning in supplicant for mother's love and vibrations and then I just

57
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.620
opened up my heart to the photograph and spoke out loud and I asked mother please please can I have

58
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:37.540
a partner in my life can I have a wife can you please find me someone because the alternative

59
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:46.580
was to find someone who you liked but who wasn't necessarily you know spiritually dedicated or

60
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.220
somebody who who would recognize mother or want to do sahaja yoga and that would have been a

61
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.940
complicated scenario that I wasn't prepared to contemplate and so there I was and I prayed to

62
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:06.420
mother mother please find me a wife and his fiance or a wife because that was the alter

63
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.060
and those days that was it you know and a sister or wife and and nothing in between and so I asked

64
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:21.220
her for that and and then I continued studying and actually got fed up with studying sasrara

65
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:26.740
pooja was coming up my finals were on the monday after the pooja and the pooja wasn't in england

66
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.420
it was in switzerland no what was it so I had to go to the pooch and get back in time for monday

67
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:38.260
morning to sit my finals everybody thought I'd done a runner they didn't see me for the weekend

68
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.140
and I went to to the pooja and it was in switzerland in alp oh no it was initially

69
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:52.660
it was alpima but it was kind of in the alps and it was as everybody who went to that pooja

70
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.460
remembers it was like quite difficult to get up there and it was kind of mist and there was this

71
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.220
golden madonna at the top I remember that occasionally if the sky the clouds parted and

72
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:09.060
you saw it was very auspicious and that happened actually when mother was there and what happened

73
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:16.020
was basically that night that on the saturday night there was a program an evening program and

74
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.740
there were some attempts at songs those days we were still trying to we were still learning I

75
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:30.340
think we knew a few bajans like haribol and and other things like that but there wasn't very much

76
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.740
really I remember there was a suddenly an announcement and now there's a dance

77
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:42.900
and uh and then the music was kind of began it was Federico Marin Cola and he played he was playing

78
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:51.220
a keyboards and the music was quite and Antonio Seracino as well and then this apparition comes

79
00:09:52.740 --> 00:10:00.260
to the stage and doesn't begin although the music had begun she didn't begin dancing she actually

80
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.100
before she's actually went to Sri Mataji's feet and she bowed down to mother's feet

81
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.420
as that and that was the most important thing that she was doing there that wasn't the dance it was

82
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.260
you felt she was bowing to mother's feet and in that moment I just felt the devotion of an artist's

83
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:23.780
soul dedicating herself to shemataji I kind of felt oh my gosh oh my goodness she's an artist

84
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.740
she's a dancer oh I wish in my life if I could marry someone like that you know

85
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.580
I felt part in that namaskar I felt kind of this the movement inside myself the wish to do that

86
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:45.860
so um she started dancing it was totally amazing I was really way the back somewhere and there was

87
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.260
just movement I remember and it was my Kundalini just just just came up very very strongly and it

88
00:10:52.260 --> 00:11:00.740
was like a very powerful spiritual experience um far I mean you know it was like it was really

89
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:08.660
special and um what happened at the end was was nothing I didn't you know even go up and

90
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:16.580
congratulate her I was too too too shy I didn't go anywhere near her but um this feeling persisted

91
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.780
that if I if I should marry someone it would be someone who had that depth inside and that

92
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:29.300
devotion and dedication in that that she had sort of then manifested in her dance I remember I met

93
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.140
her mother I didn't realize it was her mother very nice lady um I remember her adjusting the sari on

94
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:40.500
a throne with such love and attention I thought oh my god this is this is the motion devotion this

95
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:48.660
is bhakti I remember I met her father as well I hadn't realized that long time later a scenario

96
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:56.100
had anyway to cut a long story short um after the puja mother called all the children to her feet

97
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:02.180
for names and amongst the very very short short girls and boys that went to shimachis there was

98
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:07.780
a much taller one they pushed me I didn't want to go they just pushed me there it was

99
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:14.740
purna and by the time she got to her mother did she take your hand no you were there no she asked

100
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:22.740
you how old you were I don't remember no anyway um I think she did and and then purna swears mother

101
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:29.700
never said this but I heard she said uh she gave her the name purna and then she said I'll find you

102
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:35.620
a nice boy no it's not true you just had that there is even the video you just all right

103
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:41.380
inside okay then it was something that you know maybe whatever that's exactly what I remember

104
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:47.940
and I felt in that moment oh I hope it's me and I that thought splashed across my mind I immediately

105
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:57.060
pulled my ears what are you and I just I just couldn't help it I put a bandana on it look I mean

106
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.660
is that how it works I mean I'm being honest this is it you know this is how it was

107
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:10.020
and that's it that's all I never saw her never talked to her and completely forgot

108
00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:19.460
went back to university did my finals thought I'd failed miserably went to sort of wait you know

109
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:25.460
for the results in in in the king's cross ashram which I don't know if anybody ever went

110
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:33.860
to act but but it was dignified by the vibrations that were always there and we could call it an

111
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:40.500
ashram but otherwise you would call it a squat I think that would have been an ex squat I mean

112
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:47.700
but it was the ashram because there was the altar there we meditated together we ate together

113
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.420
I don't know what I think there was a gas burner I don't know

114
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:59.380
and and but what happened next was amazing I was I was there everybody had gone to work

115
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:05.700
I was a student I had an excuse I was waiting for my results my finals results the phone rang and

116
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:15.540
that somebody said uh victor uh she matters is leaving at Gatwick airport and um you know we

117
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:22.900
should go and see her off and I I felt oh gosh I'm in no condition I felt completely sort of

118
00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:30.500
run down I felt like an unironed shirt you know that's how I felt and and and then so I kind of

119
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.340
immediately thought I must find an excuse not to I had no excuse and then I suddenly felt but she's

120
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:43.940
my mother I can't let my mother leave on her own I have to go and see her off that that in that

121
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:51.220
frame of mind I was able to gather myself and go and see her off at Gatwick airport looking around

122
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.100
and you could always find where she matched because there's a huge crowd and it was around

123
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:02.020
Garfunkel's mother was having a refreshment at Garfunkel's while all the yogis were trying

124
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:10.420
discreetly to be unseen pretending not to be there but I mean it was obvious you know trying to give

125
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:18.100
mother her space but that we were there mother got up time to go the crowd everybody stood up and

126
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:25.380
I was I was kind of at the back somewhere in a corner where I actually wanted to be and then

127
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:33.380
suddenly the crowd sort of moved it's like a hive you know around the queen you know of and then

128
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.700
suddenly mother was in front of me with her back turned and I was in a corner

129
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.380
and I had nowhere to go I pulled my ears with this because I it was a sense of unworthiness

130
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:55.380
that I felt at the time and then suddenly mother turns towards me beams at me and says

131
00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:02.580
Victor how are you very well thank you do you want to get married

132
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.540
and I said the only thing that I could say was yes of course mother

133
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:21.700
is please and she said I found a lovely a girl for you she's very beautiful she's a dancer

134
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:31.620
she lives in Rome Ashram and her name is Monia and I was just overwhelmed

135
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:42.020
you know in a sort of stupor almost and but then mother said where so she she decided where she

136
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.980
was going she didn't say where is the terminal where I'd incidentally been asked to go off

137
00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:54.100
earlier to find the the the the the gate but something had pulled me and told me don't go

138
00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:02.660
I had to stay there anyway she takes me by the arm she puts like this she takes me by the arm

139
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.740
and I accompany she matters you to the gate and everybody else coming around we were just like a

140
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:18.740
family a big huge family seeing mother off and she went to the through the um the gate and

141
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:26.340
she turned around and she waved at all of us and and that was it it was a fairy tale it was

142
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:35.780
completely a fairy tale uh I promise I when mother said it to me I couldn't picture her because I

143
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:43.460
hadn't gone anywhere near her I was too shy and and it was really a surprise when we actually

144
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:49.620
first met in Gemunden it really was the first meeting it was the first time we'd she'd sent me a

145
00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:58.180
present I think before a package full of full of sweeties and a little mouse with a tail and

146
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:04.180
a heart sewed on the tail oh come on sweet so you don't have to tell these anyway um we met in

147
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.220
Gemunden and I remember to think we were at mother's feet where Purna left off and mother

148
00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:16.100
said to me do you like her and like 800 or a thousand people so you could hear a pin drop

149
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:25.620
waiting for the answer we barely we barely see yes mother thank you so much

150
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.780
really having fun teasing us having fun and and it was

151
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:45.140
it was funny that was that was the situation uh late later on um oh later on later on what

152
00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:51.540
happened is then we had to have a meeting to get to know each other so I was supposed to go and see

153
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:59.540
it in England in London but uh at the moment it was at the time Ashimataji was in the Versiliana

154
00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:07.140
where she had this amazing um program with Romano Battaglia it was a very special period and all the

155
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.580
yogis from Rome were following mother and we were with her and I was supposed to catch this plane

156
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:20.980
from Pisa and everybody was there and they say to my mom okay just leave your daughter here and come

157
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:26.020
with us to Volterra because that's where we're going to meet Ashimataji and my mother said you

158
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:31.860
are all completely mad I'm not going to leave my daughter at 16 first time she takes a plane by

159
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:37.620
herself in the airport I will wait with her and everybody of course at the time oh you're so

160
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.940
attached that's blah blah blah anyway she stayed there with me finished and we had to wait quite

161
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:51.300
a long time so we decided to go to Pisa for a walk and there is a main square which is called

162
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:59.540
Miracle Square in Pisa where there is the tower and we were reaching the arch to the square when

163
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:07.380
suddenly I see uncle Guido so as usual as I was doing oh uncle Guido and I was running and it and

164
00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:14.980
it tells me Ashimataji is here so oh my gosh Ashimataji is here so Ashimataji comes out of the

165
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:21.380
car and she looks at us and she wants to know why I'm there what's happening and all this and uncle

166
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:27.460
Guido tells her that I was supposed to catch a plane to go and see Victor and so she looks at me

167
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:36.500
she looks at my mom and she said Victor is in my home now and she can't travel by herself so

168
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.660
suddenly another miracle in the middle of middle Miracle Square she changed the ticket of the

169
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:52.020
person that was supposed to live with her with me and so my mother suddenly started crying of course

170
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.660
because that's what we do in Italy uh we just you know it was just all too much you know her daughter

171
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:04.900
16 she was going to see the fiancé and the fiancé what as mother's house and I was not

172
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.100
living anymore by myself but I was actually traveling with her mother so everything was just

173
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:17.780
all too much and crying crying and crying and all that so I went back to the collective and the day

174
00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:26.180
after I traveled with mother and it was just everything was a dream basically I mean it was

175
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.580
a dream not because I was going to see Victor but because I was traveling with Ashimataji

176
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:37.540
so I was there with my little luggage and my little hat all ready you know to meet him and

177
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.220
I remember uncle Guido say okay now you have to remember to do this and to take this document

178
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:49.380
and to take this back and you know I was so confused and then Ashimataji told him

179
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.020
don't worry I'm going to look after her it's not the first time I travel

180
00:21:54.020 --> 00:22:01.860
so at that moment you know I had Ashimataji's beauty case in my hand and I was supposed I took

181
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:08.580
my hat and gave it to my mommy and Ashimataji took my hat and she hold my hat she wanted me to bring

182
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:16.900
it with me I mean all these delicate details you know it was just unbelievable and there is this

183
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:22.260
beautiful photo that you see you know that the time you were actually walking from the stairs

184
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:29.860
walking from the stairs down and then to the plane of Ashimataji holding my hat and me near

185
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.020
mother holding her beauty case you know saying goodbye to all the yogis it was just incredible

186
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:43.780
and then when we got on the plane Ashimataji kept talking to me about Victor and what a beautiful

187
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:50.740
person he was and how precious and what a very happy life together we would have and that we

188
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:57.300
had to be friend with Robert and Natalie because Robert was his best friend so we had to be friend

189
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:03.700
she was building up all this beautiful life then we were going to have together you know advertising

190
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:15.220
Victor all the time to me and then and then we arrived in England and of course I was behind her

191
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:22.500
and I didn't know where to go because I knew then Victor was at his at her house but me no

192
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.060
and and so when we arrived there the car was there was behind and then she called me

193
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.580
say come come inside the car so I just went trotting inside and we arrived in front of

194
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:41.700
Ashimataji's house and Dalit it was in Dalit and Ashimataji went out of the car and Victor was there

195
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:48.980
ready with a tray to do aarti and she looked at Victor and she said I have a nice surprise for you

196
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:56.580
I got out of the car and Victor dropped all the plate with the aarti and Ashimataji started

197
00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:02.100
laughing laughing laughing saying look at this man you know and and and Victor didn't know what to do

198
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:09.220
with himself I mean I tried lighting the candles it was a mess so Ashimataji told him to give himself

199
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:16.260
a good bandam and start all over again because it was just not possible otherwise and isn't it

200
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:24.900
and then and then we went inside the house and then there were two three days that it was like

201
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:30.260
fairy tale it was fairy tale but I mean she she actually mother was had to actually encourage us

202
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.900
to actually communicate and have any sort of contact because we were really very shy

203
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.620
I remember one of the first things was she said go and watch television together you know and

204
00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:50.500
we went into the tv room and there was a big television and even there was a huge sofa I never

205
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:57.220
seen such a long sofa in my life and we were at either end I never see I mean it was impossible

206
00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:04.820
looking at the tv occasionally occasionally dancing at each other and it really didn't know what to say

207
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:11.140
in the end what happened and then oh there were some magical moments like waking up in the morning

208
00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:18.740
and bringing mother her tea in her room and being able to sit before her and even sing her song you

209
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.540
know and I mean there were some amazing things and one day she actually said to us in the afternoon

210
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:32.740
I remember she said why don't you go out into the garden there's a swing and and we went to this

211
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:40.420
swing and it was kind of rusty you know and sort of yes but she matter she was looking from the

212
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:47.780
window she was looking from the window we realized so and she she looked at us like so what are you

213
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:58.900
gonna do it's like she sat on the swing and I it was it made a sound that the rusty the rusty

214
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:04.340
thing you made us out it was it was quaint and almost sort of victorian and and and and sweet

215
00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:12.820
and lovely I remember then mother another day said I'm going shopping and you you can go out

216
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:18.180
for a walk in the park and you can also hold hands

217
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:29.060
but also she wanted to know if my parents were happy she would make sure that my parents were

218
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:35.860
happy about it that they would know that I was okay you know and I know that and then

219
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:47.140
the ring at a certain point when I then moved to antonio shallows house and

220
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:54.100
and and then she matched you said have you bought a ring I said well actually

221
00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:01.780
I've got a ring for her and now I haven't shimata g and she said well you must get her a ring and

222
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:11.940
you know so should I tell the whole so you got me a ring I got I got you I got you there's a

223
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.660
love there's a lovely side to it which she actually told me not to tell anyone so you don't

224
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:22.900
but I I won't so you got me a beautiful ring that she wanted to see in the day of direction band I

225
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:27.780
remember she made she wanted to make sure that you know I would show the ring and there is a

226
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:33.780
beautiful photo which we haven't got no no I have I have got it where she actually sees the ring

227
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:41.060
he was like a ring with four rubies in form of petals and so that was like really the mooladhara

228
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:49.380
and in the middle there was a little um uh brilliant how you call it um um

229
00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.900
brilliant is is like a well it's a diamond well no no it wasn't a diamond it wasn't

230
00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:05.060
it was it it it looked well but it shone brightly no but she was saying that it was like uh the the

231
00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:12.180
the color of the heart but the four petals or the mooladhara so it was she she really liked it but

232
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:18.660
I mean it was it was it was really quite magical because um it was like I mean

233
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:27.140
I mean for me I'd been I'd been disowned by my family by my own mum and she Mataji was saying

234
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:34.420
well maybe you can take her to me home with you and and I kind of I didn't want to open that

235
00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.900
subject with I didn't want to uh she said I mean she Mataji immediately she kind of under

236
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:47.460
she knows everything so she immediately said that I could stay with the because she thought I

237
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.460
maybe she could have been a guest at my place but that would have been um so I mean there was there

238
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.540
was that that all that all that but I mean most of everything of anything is just this constant

239
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:09.940
care for the details and for the human side of things that was always so full of love so full

240
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:16.900
of attention for everything and also the care today motion that emotions they should have been

241
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:24.580
there in some ways you know and connect so that we should get to know each other yes I think that

242
00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:30.420
was the the main thing that we got the impression from was to actually and go out enjoy ourselves

243
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.220
go out to the relationship and see London together there are so many things to do mother was really

244
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:40.820
encouraging us uh to to have there was that period of getting to know each other she even

245
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:47.300
she even wanted us to go and do the katak classes together this was another very interesting thing

246
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.300
with

247
00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.420
everything and then and then we got married and then and then what happened is when I went back

248
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:07.220
to Italy I went on and did various things I don't know what our work yeah I did I did some work

249
00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:14.420
I worked from time to time in in theatre and and then um mother one day two years later

250
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:24.180
uh said to me are you ready to get married now and I said yes mother the real question which I didn't

251
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:30.020
even didn't cross my mind at the time was you know what it implied was do you have a job do you have

252
00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.900
an income can you look after all of these things hadn't occurred to me so I just said yes of course

253
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.340
like I meant am I I thought she was saying are you prepared to go ahead with it I said yes of course

254
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:47.700
because I we nothing was set at all nothing was happening I didn't have a any sort of there

255
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:54.180
wasn't there wasn't really the there weren't the conditions for for for that you know in fact um

256
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.740
that it was a beautiful life but it was said it was quite it's quite it's quite interesting

257
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.500
in those days you just got married and then got your act together and and and and you know

258
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.780
became more more serious and I think that that was it it was just very very beautiful

259
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:21.620
and magical and mother's maternal care and love and attention that you know you can you wonder

260
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:27.620
how that could even be possible and then you hear all the your stories and everybody's stories and

261
00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:33.460
thousands of stories you wonder how can that have happened in one single lifetime mother touched so

262
00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:40.180
many lives and looked after sorted so many people out you know had time without ever making anybody

263
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:48.340
feel that she was in a rush there was her the attention was entirely on you at that given moment

264
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:55.620
it's not like the sort of I mean you know it's just divine and unbelievable and the blessing

265
00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:00.420
that you then have to try and live up to because it's not like you deserve it it's an opportunity

266
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:06.260
for growth and development and you just have to embrace it and and and count your blessings and

267

287

and we'll try and join this group more and I really am so happy to see everybody it's

288
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.780
I mean I mean my brothers and sisters that you know we've we know and love so much

289
00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.820
thank you and thank you John for the meditation yes beautiful thank you so much

290
00:34:52.820 --> 00:35:12.180
so much so my story um goes through a little bit of uh difficulties first

291
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.140
before um before it ends happily it ends happily so then all the difficulties I think had to be

292
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:28.580
there uh interestingly uh at the very beginning it started with when Chris came to Sagioga and

293
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:34.500
he got his realization of Shimachi and he'd been seeking already for a little bit and he'd already

294
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.820
decided that uh that being sort of having anything to do with the opposite sex was something that was

295
00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:47.940
going to bring you down similar to what uh Pawna was saying but um he felt that he had to renounce

296
00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:56.820
women in order to um ascend properly and when he got his realization from Shimachi she put her

297
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:03.140
her foot on his left nabi and she said to him are you married and he said oh oh no mother

298
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:09.940
and she said well we'll have to do something about that um and she married him to his first wife uh

299
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:18.580
which was Thelma so sort of our joint story starts well before I met him it starts when Thelma decided

300
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:26.580
or decided that she couldn't remain married to him and um and asked him to tell Shimachi about this

301
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:34.260
so uh Chris went to Shimachi and she said well oh well I'll have to marry you to somebody else she

302
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:40.900
said so I wonder who I'm married to you you two next I wonder if that'll be maybe an English woman

303
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.940
or maybe an Italian and Chris said well actually Shimachi I would like to marry an Indian

304
00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:58.420
so uh I went on uh I came to Sagioga in September 1988 and I was very relieved to find that there

305
00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:03.620
were such things as arranged marriages because I'd been absolutely hopeless at trying to find

306
00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.980
a partner for myself so when Javier told me that um that it would all be sorted for me I was

307
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:17.780
delighted and I went on uh India tour in 1989 there was a I was able to do the full tour that

308
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:25.620
year because it started 15th of December went through the 15th of January and um although I

309
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:30.900
didn't know Chris was also there uh getting engaged to the Indian that he'd asked for

310
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:38.660
and I got engaged quite early in the tour to a um banker um an Indian banker who had then

311
00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.620
had to then go back to work but was going to come back for the marriages

312
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.420
so I was like I was quite content I'd been I was engaged I was settled uh and I was enjoying the

313
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:54.660
rest of the tour so I was quite surprised when we had some more engagements uh later on in the tour

314
00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.380
some later ones uh to that my name uh was being called I couldn't understand this at all because

315
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:07.380
I was engaged um and but nothing sort of came out of that partly because Javier was telling

316
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:15.620
me to sit down every time there the organizers asked me to stand up and um I was lying uh on the

317
00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:21.780
grass afterwards and Yogi Mahajan came up to me and said that he'd had a letter from the banker

318
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:29.700
in which the banker had said that um he could very easily be surrendered to a tall blonde woman

319
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:37.700
but he couldn't be surrendered with me um so so I discovered that I hadn't actually been engaged

320
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:43.540
for quite some time um but anyway like two or three days before the actual weddings

321
00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.740
I was at the side of the stage one night and Yogi Mahajan introduced me to um

322
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:57.940
a tall Yogi from Delhi and said you know this would be a good match so we went and we took

323
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:05.140
Darshan at Srimash's feet and she was very happy with the with the engagement so then we got

324
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:14.500
married three days later and I stayed on after the tour to visit his family and I could already see

325
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:22.020
that it was it it wasn't going to be an easy um thing to work out um but you know I'd uh

326
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.940
surrendered my to Srimashi that she'd choose my husband for me so

327
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:36.580
I went back to Italy from India and uh and I started arranging with him that I should go out

328
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:48.100
again to India in late March and um yes I arrived there to find out that he'd been trying to tell me

329
00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:54.500
not to come he'd been trying desperately to phone and tell me not to come um but every time he tried

330
00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:02.900
to phone from the Indian uh phone boxes he could never get through so I knew I had to be there and

331
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:09.380
um the very beautiful thing about it was that Srimashi was doing a small tour of

332
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:19.620
uh northern India at the time I'd arrived in Delhi and um so I saw her quite a few programs and one

333
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:26.340
beautiful puja in Delhi but also I was invited into her room shortly after I arrived so that she

334
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.380
could talk to me about my marriage and she was talking to me about me maybe getting an extended

335
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:37.780
visa and staying on in India and um well that was just beautiful beautiful to have the opportunity

336
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:50.580
to talk to Srimashi and at the puja in Delhi also I suddenly had a revelation of what I was meant to

337
00:40:50.580 --> 00:41:00.020
learn from this marriage I suddenly had a strong feeling of of um of the Lakshmi tatva which was

338
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:08.580
just amazing um so on the one hand the marriage the the relationship with uh with Rajee was was

339
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:19.780
getting more and more complicated um I found out that he practiced uh TM before sajoga for about

340
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.340
six years and clearly it was becoming more and more difficult for him and in fact he started

341
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:31.220
um showing signs of madness and the Delhi collective all said that that was my fault

342
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:36.900
that he'd been fine before he got married and clearly it was me that was uh sending him off

343
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:44.580
center and everything anyway I went back to Italy and he had a very very uh difficult mother she was

344
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:51.700
I think she was a bit of a rakshasa so I really um put everything I could into persuading him to come

345
00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:57.380
to Italy because I felt that the best thing to do would be to get him away from his mother as

346
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:06.100
for a start and he did come he came in about the July and it only occurred to me today when I was

347
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.620
writing a few notes about this that the reason why he came was because she was just about to come

348
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:19.220
because at this point the point the poor man was really at the end of his own resources and he was

349
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.940
really just following shemash around

350
00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:32.980
um at the time that I came back from uh India in April so Chris had married an Indian girl

351
00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:41.700
in the same weddings and she'd been uh given a job with uh one of Shamash's daughters I think

352
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:50.740
Kalpana in her household working in her household and in about the April she was uh caught stealing

353
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:56.980
from the daughter so she was immediately sent out to Sajyoga and the marriage was annulled

354
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:05.380
and she started um sort of um proposing all these matches for Chris uh so every now and then he'd

355
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:15.060
suddenly sort of find himself in an engagement with with somebody else um Rajeev came to Italy

356
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:22.020
Shamash arrived shortly afterwards and she said that we should live separately so Rajeev was

357
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:28.020
living in my flat and I was sleeping on the um it's a shame Victor's not still here because it

358
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.740
was the ashram in Milan I was sleeping on the dining room floor because they didn't actually

359
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:43.940
have any other room for me um and uh yeah she actually went from Milan to the eastern europe

360
00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:49.460
eastern europe and Rajeev followed her there without saying where he was going he just went

361
00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:57.220
so I didn't know what he where he was um but our Ganesh suggested that we ring uh Shamash

362
00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:05.540
and see if he'd had gone there and in fact um it was confirmed that he had and this was on a

363
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:13.860
Thursday and Shamash she um passed word back to me through our marriage was also annulled so I

364
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:21.300
was no longer married to him on the Friday he came back to Milan um this is this is really the lowest

365
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:26.820
point after that it'll start coming back up again I promise uh he came back to Milan and he packed

366
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:33.780
his bags and he went to India because she was about to go to India and on the Monday I was at

367
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:38.980
work our Ganesh rang me and said that I should go around to her house in the evening and I went

368
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.620
around and she said she said it's the hardest thing she's ever had to say to anybody she said

369
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:49.380
your husband's dead but don't worry because she's engaged due to somebody else

370
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:57.780
um he'd Rajeev even arrived in Delhi uh Shamash he he knew that Shamash was going to Mumbai to to

371
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:04.100
visit her family so it was private and he said that he was going to go down and and try and see

372
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.900
her there in the delhi collective trying to persuade him not to but he caught the train and

373
00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:16.580
at some point on the journey he fell off the train and I think I I had the opportunity to talk to

374
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:23.140
I think I I had the opportunity to talk to Shamash about it afterwards and um and I asked if he was

375
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:28.180
taking a rebirth and she said yes and I really think the poor man had just reached the end of

376
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:34.500
what he could what he could manage in this life I think that the marriage had kind of it was sort of

377
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.460
make or break for him and unfortunately it broke rather than making and hopefully he's back around

378
00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:53.700
now living a different life so anyway I went to the um I went down to rome ashram um just to spend

379
00:45:53.700 --> 00:46:03.140
some time you recovering and I was there for a week and on the saturday of the my fan or the

380
00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:09.540
sate of the the weekend there was a the usual collective meditation in rome ashram and Guido

381
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:17.300
put on a video that was filmed when Shamash had been had visited the ashram after a samsarapuja

382
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:24.260
and they'd had bhajans and so there was film also of the everybody the collective singing the

383
00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:32.420
bhajans to Shamash and a certain point in front of everybody Guido um froze the video and pointed

384
00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:35.700
and said that's uh Chris Caroline that's the man you're engaged to

385
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:44.180
and um the really strange thing for me like Chris was the pujari he was pujari at all the

386
00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:50.420
European pujas and I had no memory whatsoever of ever having seen him and we were both on

387
00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.380
India tour together year the the year before no memory at all of having seen him at all it was

388
00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:01.700
really it was kind of a little trick of pram chaitanya it's really very strange and then

389
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:11.940
so I went to Krishna puja in the August and um I arrived there and I met somebody I knew because

390
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.260
I was part of the Italian collective I wasn't part of the English collective and I met somebody I

391
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:22.260
knew from the English collective a yogini and I said oh I said you know do you know this uh

392
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.740
Chris Patmore I said I'm engaged to him and she said oh no that's impossible he's engaged to a

393
00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:28.020
Russian

394
00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:34.820
and in fact he'd already started having Russian lessons

395
00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.180
and another kind of trick the pram chaitanya Shamash's car arrived on the Friday evening

396
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:48.420
and I realized that I was standing next to Chris literally next to him but he didn't know about the

397
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.620
engagement so I couldn't say anything to him but I just thought it was so strange that all out all

398
00:47:53.620 --> 00:48:01.620
those people by shumash's car who were standing next to each other and then I was called shumash's

399
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:08.500
rooms and she asked me uh if it was okay for the if the engagement was okay with me if I was okay

400
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:16.260
with it she said she wouldn't uh talk to Chris about until I said whether I was okay so I of

401
00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.060
course I said it was and that was where I was able to have a conversation also about the the first

402
00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:27.700
husband in a baton um taking rebirth I was in her rooms for quite a while

403
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:36.020
and during that time uh we had to talk about what was going to happen and she said well maybe Chris

404
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.900
could go to Italy and then she said well no we've had quite a lot of English people gone to Italy

405
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:46.980
it's about time somebody came back which was dreadful news for me because I didn't like

406
00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:54.820
England at all so in fact the next morning I found myself sitting in a field um in south

407
00:48:55.540 --> 00:49:01.220
the south of England which I think it was the pooja was uh in the pouring rain because I I

408
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.340
couldn't let anybody hear me crying in the tent crying my eyes out of the prospect of having come

409
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:14.420
to come back to the UK um and we had uh that day we had a haven a thousand name haven

410
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:22.420
and then the evening program and then the morning of the uh pooja finally uh Chris was called to

411
00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:29.220
show actually in order to discuss discuss the stage decorations um so with that excuse she got

412
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:36.660
him into her room and then she said uh and by the way I'm engaging you to this um Italian English

413
00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.620
Italian English girl which if you recall is what she'd said at the beginning

414
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:50.580
and so my first official meeting with him was uh as I was going to the showers to clean my teeth

415
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:59.620
how he called me over and said so this is Chris and uh I was I felt I was completely completely

416
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:06.580
um awkward about the whole thing and all I can remember was that I kept picking up my toothpaste

417
00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:11.860
and putting it in my pocket and it kept falling out onto the floor and it took me like three or

418
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:16.420
four times before I realized there was a huge hole in my pocket and it just wasn't going to stay in

419
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:23.700
there and then we had the pooja in the evening it was a Krishna pooja so it was an evening uh pooja

420
00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:30.100
and at the very end of the pooja Shumashi um got us both to stand up and she announced our

421
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:39.540
engagement to the collective um and in fact that year there were uh three couples that were engaged

422
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:48.820
at uh at pooja so I Chris and I were engaged at Krishna um there was um an Italian boy and

423
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.500
a French girl who engaged at Navaratri and then Danya and Enzo were engaged at Diwali

424
00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:03.220
um so I went back to Italy and Chris stayed in the UK obviously and then suddenly I found my job

425
00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:12.020
uh more and more often bringing me to the UK so I was getting my train my flights to visit Chris

426
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.940
during our engagement paid for by the company which was that was an American in itself and

427
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:25.060
then we had the additional miracle one time of um I found we were on the same flight as Shumashi

428
00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:32.340
coming back to Italy and I had business class tickets from my company and Chris was in economy

429
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:41.940
um and I was sitting in the row in front of Shumashi and the cabin staff said that Chris

430
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.700
could come and sit with us but he wouldn't be able to have any food because he didn't have a

431
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:52.580
business class ticket so Shumashi fed him her food which is very nice

432
00:51:55.140 --> 00:52:02.180
and uh so we saw each other a few times he came over to Italy and I have to say that then I just

433
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:07.380
started developing the fear that um that there would be another trick when I got to India and

434
00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:12.660
I'd find that Shumashi gone I well no that that was just a tryout you're going to be married to

435
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:19.140
somebody else so I was quite relieved when I finally arrived in India halfway through the tour

436
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:23.140
and Chris's first words were to me were we're still engaged

437
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:35.060
uh and I think that's it we got married in uh in India in 1990 oh no so essentially Chris and I

438
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:39.620
got married twice in the same year because the the weddings at the end in 89 had been at the

439
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:46.340
beginning of 1990 and the weddings our year at the end of 1990 and Jyogi Mahajan said that we

440
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.980
didn't need to pay the marriage money because it was what we paid the year before was still good

441
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.140
and I think that is yeah that's the story of our marriage

442
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:13.060
so um Meera you wanted to say something actually it's very difficult to say something I am really

443
00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:23.860
speechless um because this is to me another miracle um I am collecting for the IMC since

444
00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:30.980
maybe one year testimonies and also we had this beautiful evening out of all these videos and

445
00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:38.100
talks and photos we got already and then and the idea comes up we would like to create

446
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:48.100
not sure yet what definitely probably a book or a video or both on the occasion of Shri Mataji's

447
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:57.380

448
00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:04.900

450
00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:21.940
