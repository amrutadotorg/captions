00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:55.019
In Perth, we had this Ganesha Puja, and I really spoke
very nicely on equilibrium.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:07.640
And the rain, expressed its equilibrium, but
when they were singing, it was very quiet.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.372
And when it stopped for a short time suddenly
it came with a complete gusto and sang some

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.512
songs and went away again.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.902
Just for the aarti to start with.

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:17.712
It’s very beautiful it was.

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:19.742
So dramatic.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:23.622
Very interesting.

00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:36.642
So all preparations are done for the puja?

00:01:36.642 --> 00:01:41.792
Maybe some people might come up from abroad,
I don’t know.

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:42.792
Maybe.

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:58.762
Have you written to some leaders or not, about
this puja that

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:00.552
we are going to have?

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:07.771
Yogi: I think yes some invitations were sent
out.

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:12.832
Shri Mataji: Might have gone out.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:21.492
Yogi: There are one or two people coming.

00:02:21.492 --> 00:02:26.902
Shri Mataji: They might come.

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:30.152
Yogi: Only individuals.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:38.092
I invited a few people at Ganapatipule and
they said; ‘Oh, it’s such a long way.’

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:45.542
And I said: ‘But you always expect us to
come to yours.

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:50.362
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:56.782
They have to move.

00:02:56.782 --> 00:03:15.762
Columbus could go to America, why not you
people go to Australia.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:21.032
Can’t understand.

00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:39.462
Yogi: And a much more comfortable trip.

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:52.632
Shri Mataji: Much more comfortable.

00:03:52.632 --> 00:04:18.962
They found a much more comfortable place to
live in.

00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:29.502
He was really lost.

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:56.992
But in a way thank God, you see.

00:04:56.992 --> 00:06:12.372
Otherwise there would have been no Indian
left in India, if he had come here by chance.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:30.101
So many flowers, beautiful.

00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:42.402
In Singapore I bought a book, very interesting,
called as: ‘Faces of Islam.’

00:06:42.402 --> 00:06:49.821
And I was surprised that the whole concept
of Islam is Sahaja.

00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:50.821
Absolutely.

00:06:50.821 --> 00:07:02.652
And all the, authors and all the people, who
have discussed there, are saying that Muslims

00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:03.922
are not Islamic.

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.631
They don’t follow Islam.

00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:09.472
That’s why their whole thing has become
so rigid.

00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:15.812
I mean so surprising that book has revealed
to Me the confessions, of these people.

00:07:15.812 --> 00:07:21.812
And the society that Mohammed Sahib has talked
about is ours.

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:22.812
Muslims are nowhere.

00:07:22.812 --> 00:07:28.752
Absolutely the way He has described how the
brotherhood would be there, how righteousness

00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:31.002
would be there.

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:35.652
But one thing is missing I feel, that He said:
‘You must seek the knowledge.

00:07:35.652 --> 00:07:37.952
You must seek the Truth.’

00:07:37.952 --> 00:07:43.222
Despite that, whatever was Islam, they have
failed to seek the knowledge, and to learn

00:07:43.222 --> 00:07:44.222
from others.

00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:45.631
Can you imagine?

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:49.152
And He has said how to deal with non-Muslims
also.

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:52.932
And they said that there are many who are
just minimal Muslims.

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:55.282
Some of them are just for name’s sake, they
are not Muslims.

00:07:55.282 --> 00:07:57.482
I mean I was so amazed.

00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:03.321
We have such a misunderstanding, that I always
said that all these Incarnations and Prophets,

00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:10.262
came to establish a religion which was really
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:10.262 --> 00:08:13.422
All their expectations were Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:20.142
And they have deviated so much, that you start
wondering what is this, as in Christianity,

00:08:20.142 --> 00:08:21.142
you see.

00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:26.842
How much it has deviated, Christianity, to
what level it has gone, it is shocking, really

00:08:26.842 --> 00:08:27.842
shocking.

00:08:27.842 --> 00:08:33.651
I don’t know if you know of a book written
‘In God’s Name’.

00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:42.831
And in that book, it reads like a novel actually,
I mean it’s very interesting.

00:08:42.831 --> 00:08:49.271
In that book the writer has suggested that
this present pope, is responsible for the

00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:50.561
murder of the previous one.

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:57.251
And there were thirteen or fourteen murders
took place, just to hide this.

00:08:57.251 --> 00:08:59.052
Can you believe it?

00:08:59.052 --> 00:09:03.151
And recently one of the persons was murdered
was Calvi.

00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:12.121
And they say, that this Calvi was murdered,
I mean every week in Italy since I am there,

00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.842
some new exposures are coming.

00:09:13.842 --> 00:09:22.491
But this Calvi was murdered in a way that
he was hanged, on one of the bridges of London.

00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:34.121
And if he was, he was the one, the one who
murdered him, he said that: ‘I am a member

00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:40.282
of mafia all right, but I was paid by this
Vatican by this pope, for murdering that man.’

00:09:40.282 --> 00:09:42.472
Is a confession from him.

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:50.042
And Mr Heard was, questioned: ‘Why didn’t
you take action against this when these things

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:51.042
happen in England?’

00:09:51.042 --> 00:09:53.071
He says: ‘What’s the use?

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:56.732
Because they would kill all our lawyers, our
judges everyone.

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:58.172
It’s all mafia.’

00:09:58.172 --> 00:10:03.611
So the whole system of Catholic Church is
nothing but mafia.

00:10:03.611 --> 00:10:13.451
Nine million, dollars of counterfeit, were
printed and were distributed through their

00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:16.252
bank, that is Vatican Bank.

00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:18.282
Can you believe it?

00:10:18.282 --> 00:10:21.671
I mean this is Christianity.

00:10:21.671 --> 00:10:24.141
Is this what Christ preached?

00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:27.991
Killing people, doing all kinds of things?

00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:31.352
I mean nowhere I find Mohammed decrying anyone.

00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:34.072
He said: ‘You have to believe in everyone’.

00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:39.111
Only these people are saying, that He was
the last.

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:43.662
He went to this limit to say that: ‘I am
not Divine.

00:10:43.662 --> 00:10:46.352
I follow the Divine laws but I am not Divine.’

00:10:46.352 --> 00:10:52.612
May be just He wanted people to follow.

00:10:52.612 --> 00:11:00.342
Surprising I was really surprised that, if
Koran is teaching such great things, the Muslims

00:11:00.342 --> 00:11:07.141
are just on the other side of it and they
admit, that Islam should not be confused with

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.141
Muslims.

00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:17.612
In the same way we can say that Christianity
should not be confused with Christians.

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:20.122
What about Judaism?

00:11:20.122 --> 00:11:21.802
Same thing.

00:11:21.802 --> 00:11:27.172
I mean nowhere in that religion taught, to
be like this the way they are behaving.

00:11:27.172 --> 00:11:30.352
They are following Hitler, out and out.

00:11:30.352 --> 00:11:36.571
The one who killed them, tortured them, they
are becoming just like them.

00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:48.111
So what to say about these human beings as,
under the name of God, under the name of religion,

00:11:48.111 --> 00:11:49.111
behaving like this.

00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.992
The reason they have given many: ‘Because
of this and because of that.’

00:11:52.992 --> 00:12:08.842
So, this aspect, that they are saying that:
‘Because the people didn’t read Koran

00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:17.391
properly, they didn’t understand properly,
they should have been educated properly.’

00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:36.412
It will take thousand years to educate every
Muslim about it.

00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:43.621
And if they think that by teaching through
their Book, it will be imbibed, it’s not

00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:44.621
possible.

00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:50.481
Everybody reads Bible everybody reads Koran,
but nothing goes inside just reading reading

00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:51.481
reading.

00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:55.801
So their idea is that if they read and analyze,
I mean you have to have big universities for

00:12:55.801 --> 00:13:06.032
that, it could be taught to people and, still
then not necessary, that they would imbibe.

00:13:06.032 --> 00:13:12.521
I know of Mahatma Gandhi, see He was a Realized
soul was a, and He was of course, over-disciplined

00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:14.342
according to Me.

00:13:14.342 --> 00:13:18.842
And He put these ideas on to His followers.

00:13:18.842 --> 00:13:22.961
As long as He lived they were all right.

00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:27.321
As soon as He died, they came out in their
true colors.

00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:32.782
Everything dropped off like some sort of a
mud on their body, and they became horrible

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:34.561
people in India.

00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:40.441
So the thing missing is this, that, they are
not Realized souls.

00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:45.331
Because they are not Realized, all these things
they cannot bear.

00:13:45.331 --> 00:13:48.232
They cannot bear money, they cannot bear power.

00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:51.141
Now I think they cannot bear the religion.

00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:58.011
So you have to have your Realization.

00:13:58.011 --> 00:14:01.701
Unless and until you have your Realization,
you cannot bear anything.

00:14:01.701 --> 00:14:08.901
Moreover in Sahaja Yoga I mean there are no
compulsions, no disciplines as such, I mean

00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:14.641
compared to what we see in all these religions.

00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:24.631
Suddenly I find people coming up, to the expectations
of righteousness, goodness, and they are also

00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:28.472
very compassionate.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:35.742
So the change has come from inside, that means
it’s the innate, change.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.592
The innate religion has been awakened.

00:14:37.592 --> 00:14:43.131
It’s not just forced on you, that you should
be Vishwa Nirmala Dharmis but you become,

00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:44.352
you just become that.

00:14:44.352 --> 00:14:50.381
This is the point you will see, these Prophets
did not know, I think Christ did not know

00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:55.121
that these people will never change unless
and until they get their Realization.

00:14:55.121 --> 00:15:00.751
I think He knew also because He always said
that you have to be born again.

00:15:00.751 --> 00:15:07.561
So when He said: ‘You are to be born again,’
they have a, brand you see again, one are

00:15:07.561 --> 00:15:11.831
Christian, another Born Again, another are
Seventh Day, another, something.

00:15:11.831 --> 00:15:13.912
All just the same stupid people.

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:18.521
But Sahaja Yoga is the only way.

00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:23.701
Where what you, say that’s what you follow.

00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:26.782
Practice and precepts are just the same for
Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:26.782 --> 00:15:30.342
They just can’t do it something else.

00:15:30.342 --> 00:15:34.631
They are dreaming also that the occident had
a very bad influence on Islam and all that.

00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:35.811
I don’t think it’s that.

00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:43.201
You are coming from the occident, still you
have jumped into the right culture of religion,

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:47.981
when you understand what is righteousness
what is good.

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.921
You can bear it.

00:15:49.921 --> 00:15:57.681
You’re not to be told do this, do that,
but in the light of your Spirit you do it.

00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:01.162
And you achieve it.

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:07.631
It’s a very, interesting thing to note,
that a little thing was missing in all of

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:15.151
them, and they just went away as if they never
knew where to land.

00:16:15.151 --> 00:16:18.231
All these religions, one better than the other.

00:16:18.231 --> 00:16:20.092
Hindus, same thing.

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:25.311
Hindus had of course one advantage they were
never organized, thank God, because if you

00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:28.871
are organized and misled, then the whole party
goes astray.

00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:36.412
But Hindus, Hindu scriptures were never organized
into a religion like that.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.951
But still, so many points they have missed.

00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:44.901
Like it is said that: ‘In everyone there
resides the Spirit’.

00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:47.141
Then how can you have caste system?

00:16:47.141 --> 00:16:49.561
You cannot.

00:16:49.561 --> 00:16:53.641
But they have caste system.

00:16:53.641 --> 00:17:01.671
So, also so many other rituals and things
nonsense is there, absolutely nonsense.

00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:16.002
And Hindu religion became, a kind of a, ritualistic
religion where, the priests uneducated useless

00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:18.222
priests became in charge.

00:17:18.222 --> 00:17:34.431
And they’re so stupid, worse than pope sometimes,
that they say that if you want to have…

00:17:34.431 --> 00:18:04.562
I’ve also found out a solution for children
our western children, what is the problem.

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:11.362
I went to Japan, and what I found there, that
till the age of twelve years, they don’t

00:18:11.362 --> 00:18:18.541
allow children to have much sports, to go
out much, and, mostly they are in the house

00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:24.411
or in the school, learning to do things with
their hands.

00:18:24.411 --> 00:18:29.872
And medically I know that, till the age of
twelve years, there is myelin sheath that

00:18:29.872 --> 00:18:33.702
grows on your nerves.

00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:37.222
And this myelin sheath gives you the deftness.

00:18:37.222 --> 00:18:42.302
Like if you go to the villages like [SOUNDS
LIKE: Saranti or all these?], where they are

00:18:42.302 --> 00:18:48.512
producing artistic things, what happens, that
the children also start doing the same.

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:51.302
It’s so easy for them when they grow up.

00:18:51.302 --> 00:18:55.921
So that is the time when they have to develop
that deftness.

00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:06.322
That deftness is, also makes them more concentrated,
they get involved into it, and also, that

00:19:06.322 --> 00:19:08.901
you can never acquire later.

00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:14.192
So that is just a precious time of twelve
years, that that is the time children should

00:19:14.192 --> 00:19:23.031
be made to do some drawings, not at random,
but properly, to do some carvings, to do some

00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:24.072
other clay work.

00:19:24.072 --> 00:19:32.052
You’ll be surprised by the age of twelve
years, the boys in Japan could repair a watch,

00:19:32.052 --> 00:19:35.782
could repair televisions, and one boy produced,
produced.

00:19:35.782 --> 00:19:39.362
At that time when I had gone, there were not
many televisions also.

00:19:39.362 --> 00:19:47.212
I was surprised that the boy produced a television,
at the age of twelve years.

00:19:47.212 --> 00:19:51.342
And also they are given violins in their hands
when they’re about five years.

00:19:51.342 --> 00:19:52.992
They start playing.

00:19:52.992 --> 00:19:58.021
So the music, art and all this side is developed
till the age of twelve years.

00:19:58.021 --> 00:20:04.702
And then the children are made to go out and
play and do all kinds of exercises and also

00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:06.102
sports.

00:20:06.102 --> 00:20:10.242
But they are not let loose at a young age.

00:20:10.242 --> 00:20:17.401
Now here I think about twenty years back or
may be twenty-five years back a new theme

00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:24.921
started with children that, you should allow
the children to do what they like, let them

00:20:24.921 --> 00:20:28.612
express themselves, let them be free, this
that.

00:20:28.612 --> 00:20:30.652
I think it’s not proper.

00:20:30.652 --> 00:20:35.202
Otherwise they would be hanging from some
trees trying to do without parents you see.

00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:39.641
After all this is the way the parents escape
their duty I think.

00:20:39.641 --> 00:20:43.141
You have to tell children what they have to
do.

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:48.812
You have to, talk to them, you must have a
rapport with them.

00:20:48.812 --> 00:20:54.242
You must talk to them, and you must also try
to guide them, with your experience, tell

00:20:54.242 --> 00:20:58.602
them what is good what is bad.

00:20:58.602 --> 00:21:05.901
But this kind of a, thing that the child should
be allowed to do what they like, express themselves

00:21:05.901 --> 00:21:07.212
the way they like.

00:21:07.212 --> 00:21:12.551
I’ve seen the western children always will
ask parents: ‘Why, why?’

00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:15.421
They are not to know, they have limitations.

00:21:15.421 --> 00:21:17.942
They can’t know every ‘why’.

00:21:17.942 --> 00:21:19.242
How can they understand?

00:21:19.242 --> 00:21:22.301
They are limited and so, first of all, they
are to build up.

00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.511
You can you see this aeroplane now.

00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:32.852
Supposing it is not built up and allowed to
go because: ‘It’s all right.

00:21:32.852 --> 00:21:35.323
Let it go in the sky’.

00:21:35.323 --> 00:21:36.323
What will happen?

00:21:36.323 --> 00:21:40.881
In the same way we have to put the nuts and
bolts properly, into them, and see that they

00:21:40.881 --> 00:21:45.631
develop a personality.

00:21:45.631 --> 00:21:48.872
That doesn’t mean that you should be in
any way cruel to them.

00:21:48.872 --> 00:21:49.872
Not necessary.

00:21:49.872 --> 00:21:53.632
There’s no need to beat them or do anything
of the kind.

00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:59.192
But only thing is, with love you should be
able to change them.

00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:02.342
And also dignity, sense of dignity should
be there.

00:22:02.342 --> 00:22:05.862
Because if you develop their sense of dignity,
they will not misbehave.

00:22:05.862 --> 00:22:10.262
That’s very important from childhood to
give them a sense of dignity, that they are

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:14.362
Sahaja Yogis and they have to behave.

00:22:14.362 --> 00:22:21.472
Because when we started this school one year,
first year, one month, it was such a problem

00:22:21.472 --> 00:22:23.842
I mean, impossible situation.

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:30.352
The teachers gave up and they wrote to me:
‘Better send typhoon take children.’

00:22:30.352 --> 00:22:31.511
It’s terrible.

00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:37.452
Not only that, they trouble them but they
used to beat them and bite them and do all

00:22:37.452 --> 00:22:39.531
kinds of thing and make fun of them.

00:22:39.531 --> 00:22:40.572
So wild.

00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:46.901
And that place is full of cliffs and full
of, all kinds of dangerous heights and they

00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:48.342
would just run out.

00:22:48.342 --> 00:22:49.791
Just like dogs.

00:22:49.791 --> 00:22:52.692
Dogs are better I would say.

00:22:52.692 --> 00:22:57.362
They had no caution about themselves and for
one month, they all gave up.

00:22:57.362 --> 00:22:59.102
And the Principal has now run away he said:
‘I can’t manage these children.

00:22:59.102 --> 00:23:00.642
They don’t want to study.

00:23:00.642 --> 00:23:03.232
They have come here to trouble us, that’s
all.

00:23:03.232 --> 00:23:05.141
They don’t want to study.’

00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:09.412
And first thing when I met them they came
and told Me: ‘Mother, we don’t want to

00:23:09.412 --> 00:23:10.412
study.’

00:23:10.412 --> 00:23:19.462
Now we have put a one, masseur on them, who
massages their body.

00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:22.322
He was telling Me: ‘They are really funny
children.’

00:23:22.322 --> 00:23:23.622
They don’t want to brush their teeth.

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:25.902
If you ask them to brush their teeth they
start crying.

00:23:25.902 --> 00:23:26.921
They don’t want to have a bath.

00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:29.262
Tell them you have to have your bath, they
start crying.

00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:34.242
Anything you tell them they start doing like
that.’

00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:40.171
So we can say one thing, that disciplining
children in a indirect way is very important

00:23:40.171 --> 00:23:41.732
like that you see.

00:23:41.732 --> 00:23:46.421
Because this idea, that you should leave the
children as they are, is very wrong.

00:23:46.421 --> 00:23:50.141
You have to guide them and tell them how to
behave.

00:23:50.141 --> 00:23:55.161
Now see, you must have seen Indian children
how quiet they are.

00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:57.431
But I think the attention of children is quite
a lot.

00:23:57.431 --> 00:24:03.752
And the mothers are not working also, so they
look after the children.

00:24:03.752 --> 00:24:07.651
Now in our schools that we have here you should,
train them up that way.

00:24:07.651 --> 00:24:12.602
You can talk to them that: ‘You are Sahaja
Yogis, you see, you are special people.’

00:24:12.602 --> 00:24:18.572
The other day there was one Indian child,
he’s living in Singapore, where he has picked

00:24:18.572 --> 00:24:20.401
up all these bad habits.

00:24:20.401 --> 00:24:24.072
He came and he was talking to Me: ‘Grandma,
Grandma.’

00:24:24.072 --> 00:24:28.822
And he said: ‘I will tell you in Your ear
something’.

00:24:28.822 --> 00:24:31.371
And he said something funny.

00:24:31.371 --> 00:24:33.452
I said: ‘Are you a servant?’

00:24:33.452 --> 00:24:34.482
He said: ‘No.’

00:24:34.482 --> 00:24:36.322
‘Then only servants talk like this.

00:24:36.322 --> 00:24:37.992
How are you talking like this?’

00:24:37.992 --> 00:24:38.992
‘Is it?’

00:24:38.992 --> 00:24:39.992
I said: ‘Yes.

00:24:39.992 --> 00:24:41.681
This is how the servants talk.’

00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:42.681
He got such a fright.

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:45.452
He said: ‘All right, I will never talk like
that.

00:24:45.452 --> 00:24:46.452
It’s dirty.

00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:48.131
I’ll not talk like that.’

00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:50.051
You see, suddenly he changed.

00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:52.931
So we have to talk to them, we have to have
rapport with them.

00:24:52.931 --> 00:24:58.901
After all they are born Realized so they have
special powers and they are special children.

00:24:58.901 --> 00:25:05.712
But, one thing is definite, that children
cannot be avoided, and you cannot avoid your

00:25:05.712 --> 00:25:07.021
duty towards your children.

00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:13.001
You have to look after them because, they
are in your trust as it is.

00:25:13.001 --> 00:25:15.511
They are after all born Realized children.

00:25:15.511 --> 00:25:18.031
They are special children with tremendous
brains.

00:25:18.031 --> 00:25:24.122
They are cleverer than you and they can outwit
you, because they are so clever, so intelligent.

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:27.171
But if they get spoiled at this age, then
later on it will be very difficult to bring

00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.502
them…You were better, because you were not
born with Realization.

00:25:30.502 --> 00:25:32.382
So you understood the value of Realization.

00:25:32.382 --> 00:25:33.382
But they don’t.

00:25:33.382 --> 00:25:38.492
So they are to be told that: ‘You are Realized
children, God sent you here, you are special

00:25:38.492 --> 00:25:41.411
children,’ and what should happen.

00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:46.161
Gradually they will pick up, and understand.

00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:51.181
Of course I am happy that so many marriages
are successful, and people are behaving all

00:25:51.181 --> 00:25:52.181
right.

00:25:52.181 --> 00:25:54.572
Of course there are some stray cases of fighting
going on which I hear about.

00:25:54.572 --> 00:25:58.062
This is stupid of course again, that we should
fight.

00:25:58.062 --> 00:26:02.051
When we are both Sahaja Yogis, what is there
to fight?

00:26:02.051 --> 00:26:04.612
I mean, there’s no question.

00:26:04.612 --> 00:26:10.082
We believe in all the religions, so we can’t
fight on religions.

00:26:10.082 --> 00:26:20.582
On what subject can we fight, I just don’t
know.

00:26:20.582 --> 00:26:25.931
We know the ethics of Sahaja Yoga and we like
it, so we cannot fight on ethics.

00:26:25.931 --> 00:26:30.982
Economics of Sahaja Yoga we understand, we
cannot fight on that.

00:26:30.982 --> 00:26:38.062
I just don’t understand what is the, point
of difference where they start fighting.

00:26:38.062 --> 00:26:43.712
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, you can really
be, enjoying your married life.

00:26:43.712 --> 00:26:49.641
Should be enjoying your married life and the
children should see to it, that our parents

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:51.482
are so nicely, quietly settled down.

00:26:51.482 --> 00:26:57.181
But if they see you quarreling, next day they’ll
be quarreling too.

00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.192
Then we have only monogamy.

00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:04.681
We don’t have three wives or four wives
as the Muslims have.

00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:09.011
We don’t have four husbands or something
like that.

00:27:09.011 --> 00:27:15.051
We have simple monogamy, a very peaceful life,
very beautiful life, then why should there

00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:17.501
be problem between husband and wife?

00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:24.112
Culturally we are just the same, we believe
in all the good cultures of all the world.

00:27:24.112 --> 00:27:26.661
There’s no problem.

00:27:26.661 --> 00:27:33.572
One gentleman told Me that: ‘My wife quarrels
with me on one point.’

00:27:33.572 --> 00:27:34.572
I said: ‘Which?’

00:27:34.572 --> 00:27:36.822
She said: ‘You do not meditate, you must
meditate more.’

00:27:36.822 --> 00:27:37.822
I said: ‘That’s a good point’.

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:38.822
He thinks as well.

00:27:38.822 --> 00:27:47.742
But I told the wife that: ‘You need not
tell him, he’ll do it on his own.’

00:27:47.742 --> 00:27:49.362
Because you see cannot force things.

00:27:49.362 --> 00:27:51.902
This has to work out by themselves.

00:27:51.902 --> 00:27:53.491
You must accept them as they are.

00:27:53.491 --> 00:28:01.031
Gradually they’ll all improve and gradually
they will get there.

00:28:01.031 --> 00:28:03.212
You cannot just force them.

00:28:03.212 --> 00:28:09.411
We cannot just tell each other, do this way
or that way.

00:28:09.411 --> 00:28:11.612
Sahaja Yoga is a thing is to be imbibed.

00:28:11.612 --> 00:28:15.712
People don’t understand that.

00:28:15.712 --> 00:28:23.381
They think by forcing people, by jumping at
them, that’s not the way.

00:28:23.381 --> 00:28:28.791
Of course if somebody is very difficult, then
we have divorce in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:28.791 --> 00:28:32.342
We have not banned divorce as in the Catholic
religion or anything.

00:28:32.342 --> 00:28:33.371
There is divorce.

00:28:33.371 --> 00:28:36.531
But there should be something sensible about
it.

00:28:36.531 --> 00:28:37.661
One has to work it out.

00:28:37.661 --> 00:28:42.602
Normally there should not be many cases of
Sahaja Yoga, of divorce.

00:28:42.602 --> 00:28:47.934
But we have because of the background certain
types of funny relations they have had or

00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:52.911
I don’t know, what to say.

00:28:52.911 --> 00:28:59.541
On the whole, ninety percent or I should say
ninety-five percent marriages are quite successful,

00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:05.312
and will be more now the number will be much
more, I’m sure.

00:29:05.312 --> 00:29:08.942
This time we had seventy-six marriages, so
you can imagine.

00:29:08.942 --> 00:29:15.732
And in this one month, Yogi was after My life
with his file there.

00:29:15.732 --> 00:29:22.501
So there, also there’s some misunderstanding
that Yogi decides, he does not, poor man.

00:29:22.501 --> 00:29:23.891
He cannot.

00:29:23.891 --> 00:29:29.692
But it happens sometimes, like at the last
minute they’ll bring somebody, now we cannot

00:29:29.692 --> 00:29:35.422
locate the name of that person, we just can’t
find out if he’s there or not, or she’s

00:29:35.422 --> 00:29:36.422
there or not.

00:29:36.422 --> 00:29:41.482
Suddenly they bring somebody, and he may say
or she may say that I am there on the form

00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:42.482
and all that.

00:29:42.482 --> 00:29:44.072
Then you have to accept it.

00:29:44.072 --> 00:29:49.631
If you accept such a thing then what happens
that, you find that person is not a Sahaja

00:29:49.631 --> 00:29:53.121
Yogi or was not a Sahaja Yogi for such a long
time.

00:29:53.121 --> 00:29:54.312
Something like that.

00:29:54.312 --> 00:29:59.062
So because of three hundred to four hundred
requests you see, what can we do.

00:29:59.062 --> 00:30:05.651
I mean after all, can’t know who is who.

00:30:05.651 --> 00:30:08.962
This is one thing that is very good.

00:30:08.962 --> 00:30:12.082
At least we can control all that.

00:30:12.082 --> 00:30:19.742
If something is wrong we can find out, we
can work it out and we can manage things.

00:30:19.742 --> 00:30:21.942
It’s not so difficult.

00:30:21.942 --> 00:30:27.631
But the leaders must be careful because the
leaders who recommend should not, do something

00:30:27.631 --> 00:30:33.312
out of just some sort of a pity, or some sort
of a consideration.

00:30:33.312 --> 00:30:37.582
The main consideration should be, how are
the vibrations and what is the commitment

00:30:37.582 --> 00:30:38.781
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:38.781 --> 00:30:44.702
If they are committed to Sahaja Yoga and if
their vibrations are all right, then it’s

00:30:44.702 --> 00:30:46.222
all right it’s perfect.

00:30:46.222 --> 00:30:52.801
But sometimes, you know, some people do have
problems which do not come up and later on

00:30:52.801 --> 00:30:54.062
it is discovered.

00:30:54.062 --> 00:30:59.232
Still, I am so happy our society is so great.

00:30:59.232 --> 00:31:02.671
There’s no such society existing in the
whole world.

00:31:02.671 --> 00:31:08.712
And this is the society I think all these
Prophets and everybody dreamt of, of such

00:31:08.712 --> 00:31:11.411
love, understanding.

00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:19.111
Gradually I think we all will, grow and grow
and grow.

00:31:19.111 --> 00:31:27.732
The growth is going on, but the atmosphere
I must say is very nice, and it helps each

00:31:27.732 --> 00:31:28.732
other.

00:31:28.732 --> 00:31:41.931
In Australia we had more problems in Melbourne,
not in Sydney I must give credit to your leader

00:31:41.931 --> 00:31:50.041
here, he has managed the things well.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:55.952
There are many after him also it’s rather
funny but, I just don’t know, because Australia

00:31:55.952 --> 00:32:01.801
always had a problem, this kind and gradually
we have sorted it out.

00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:06.781
It’s a, leadership means nothing but I call
it hocus-pocus.

00:32:06.781 --> 00:32:09.781
It has no meaning at all.

00:32:09.781 --> 00:32:12.602
But then somebody has to be there to contact
and all that.

00:32:12.602 --> 00:32:17.332
It’s something so limited.

00:32:17.332 --> 00:32:22.801
But there is jealousy, there is all these
things still, lingering behind and then the

00:32:22.801 --> 00:32:25.352
problems come in.

00:32:25.352 --> 00:32:37.092
Gradually I am sure all of us will grow well
and everything will work out, in a proper

00:32:37.092 --> 00:32:38.092
way.

00:32:38.092 --> 00:32:39.092
Should work out in a proper way.

00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:42.982
Our society has to show to the world that
there can be a society like this.

00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:50.401
Now there’s a good news which is very good
I think, we can start the calendar from that

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:57.141
date perhaps because such a transformation
is coming, that the Russian Embassy has invited

00:32:57.141 --> 00:33:17.641
Me to honor Me for the work I

00:33:17.641 --> 00:33:18.641
have done in Russia.

00:33:18.641 --> 00:33:21.812
And the another good news is that Gorbachov
wants to meet Me.

00:33:21.812 --> 00:33:41.452
And you must be aware that in Tagliatti, is
one place, Tagliatti which is an industrial

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:47.342
town where a gentleman called [SOUNDS LIKE:
Pagliati] from Italy went down, he was a revolutionary.

00:33:47.342 --> 00:33:57.361
And he started this place called as Pagliati
and the best motorcar that they make is made

00:33:57.361 --> 00:33:59.651
in this place Tagliatti, beautiful one.

00:33:59.651 --> 00:34:03.343
They gave Me a model here, very beautiful,
quite big.

00:34:03.343 --> 00:34:04.671
Looked like a limousine sort.

00:34:04.671 --> 00:34:05.962
Quite big.

00:34:05.962 --> 00:34:11.991
And in that one city we have twenty-two thousand
Sahaja Yogis practising, twenty-two thousand.

00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:19.521
And you’ll be amazed that in Russia nowhere
is less than sixteen thousand people, nowhere.

00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:29.582
Any time you go there at least sixteen thousand
people practising Sahaja Yoga, very seriously.

00:34:29.582 --> 00:34:33.801
So can imagine in that country what is going
to happen, though it hasn’t got food as

00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:43.981
you have here, too much to eat, but still
look at the way, look at the way it has worked

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:44.981
out.

00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:46.162
How deeply they have gone into it.

00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:48.322
They had never heard a word about Ganesha.

00:34:48.322 --> 00:34:50.681
They never believed in God.

00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:54.051
They were in a way atheist.

00:34:54.051 --> 00:34:56.941
And how much they have achieved in just…look
at that.

00:34:56.941 --> 00:34:57.941
How did they achieve that?

00:34:57.941 --> 00:35:04.342
The depth that they have, they just touched
it.

00:35:04.342 --> 00:35:08.542
And also they invited some scientist, or two
hundred scientists were there.

00:35:08.542 --> 00:35:13.701
And when I started telling about science,
said: ‘Mother, don’t tell us about science,

00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:14.991
had enough of it.

00:35:14.991 --> 00:35:18.652
Now please tell us about Spiritual science,
spirituality.

00:35:18.652 --> 00:35:19.652
That’s it’.

00:35:19.652 --> 00:35:21.922
Wonderful I tell you, such experiences.

00:35:21.922 --> 00:35:25.392
And in My lecture only, just giving a lecture
at the time when there were about sixteen

00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:31.162
thousand to eighteen thousand people, people
got cured, just got cured.

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.162
Such wonders.

00:35:32.162 --> 00:35:38.672
There was one lady who came to see Me after
the lecture and she was just sitting in front

00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:39.672
of Me.

00:35:39.672 --> 00:35:40.772
They brought her on a wheelchair.

00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:42.832
She said: ‘I couldn’t even sit.’

00:35:42.832 --> 00:35:43.832
All right.

00:35:43.832 --> 00:35:45.421
And then I said: ‘You are all right,’
She said: ‘Really?’

00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:46.502
I said: ‘Yes.

00:35:46.502 --> 00:35:47.981
You get up.’

00:35:47.981 --> 00:35:48.981
Got up.

00:35:48.981 --> 00:35:54.971
She started walking and then she started running
and everybody started…

00:35:54.971 --> 00:35:55.971
Such faith.

00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:56.971
Such faith.

00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:59.721
And in Czechoslovakia, there was one old lady.

00:35:59.721 --> 00:36:05.421
They brought her with great difficulty just,
held her out and brought her on the stage

00:36:05.421 --> 00:36:07.981
and she was trying to sit down.

00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:13.172
Then she said: ‘Mother I have complete faith
in You.

00:36:13.172 --> 00:36:16.921
I know You can cure me.’

00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:18.352
I said; ‘Really?’

00:36:18.352 --> 00:36:19.352
‘Yes.

00:36:19.352 --> 00:36:22.662
I am sure You can.’

00:36:22.662 --> 00:36:26.252
I said: ‘You are cured.’

00:36:26.252 --> 00:36:27.252
She got up.

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.252
Everybody was surprised.

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.252
I said: ‘Now walk.

00:36:29.252 --> 00:36:30.252
Walk now.’

00:36:30.252 --> 00:36:31.252
And then she started walking fast, and everybody
started laughing.

00:36:31.252 --> 00:36:36.191
But that faith, you see, is something so special.

00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:42.512
I mean I have seen so many miracles happening
with this faith that…

00:36:42.512 --> 00:36:49.512
There was one fellow called Mr Shukla, who
is a big boss in this hotel management of

00:36:49.512 --> 00:36:52.282
Taj Mahal.

00:36:52.282 --> 00:36:58.112
And this Mr Shukla heard that his mother was
very sick she was going to die.

00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.112
Very serious.

00:36:59.112 --> 00:37:05.731
So he went to Rotak which is very far away,
beyond Delhi from Bombay, and he saw his mother

00:37:05.731 --> 00:37:08.252
in a very bad condition, very painful.

00:37:08.252 --> 00:37:15.452
The doctor said she has a galloping cancer
and at the most she can live for three days.

00:37:15.452 --> 00:37:17.012
He got very much worried.

00:37:17.012 --> 00:37:18.252
He came back home.

00:37:18.252 --> 00:37:24.032
He thought that: ‘I couldn’t even talk
to my mother, she’s in a coma, what will

00:37:24.032 --> 00:37:25.342
happen to her.’

00:37:25.342 --> 00:37:31.012
He just sat before My Photograph and prayed:
‘Mother, please cure my mother.

00:37:31.012 --> 00:37:36.782
I don’t want anything just now, You just
cure my mother, I know You can cure her.’

00:37:36.782 --> 00:37:41.152
And within three days before, instead of dying
she was out of the hospital.

00:37:41.152 --> 00:37:43.132
He brought her to Bombay.

00:37:43.132 --> 00:37:49.492
They took her to the hospital of Thata, Thata
Memorial Hospital we have, and when they examined

00:37:49.492 --> 00:37:52.742
her they said she has no cancer.

00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:54.482
He has papers.

00:37:54.482 --> 00:37:59.252
He has papers from the first hospital and
from this one.

00:37:59.252 --> 00:38:02.122
Recently, Rajesh told me a story about himself.

00:38:02.122 --> 00:38:06.012
He said: ‘Mother, You don’t know how many
powers You have given me.’

00:38:06.012 --> 00:38:07.852
I said: ‘No it’s your faith.’

00:38:07.852 --> 00:38:09.842
His uncle was just dying.

00:38:09.842 --> 00:38:11.971
They had removed his oxygen and everything.

00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:14.812
His aunt sent for him and she said: ‘Now
he’s about to die.

00:38:14.812 --> 00:38:19.782
You pray for his salvation, at least to Mother.

00:38:19.782 --> 00:38:25.782
Just somehow or other try to see that he’s
also gets his salvation’.

00:38:25.782 --> 00:38:29.402
He’s not a Sahaja Yogi uncle nothing of
the kind.

00:38:29.402 --> 00:38:38.502
So Rajesh just had his pendant, just twisted
it, and then closed his eyes and prayed: ‘Mother,

00:38:38.502 --> 00:38:40.412
please cure my uncle.’

00:38:40.412 --> 00:38:41.412
That’s all.

00:38:41.412 --> 00:38:48.072
He said it was too much of a venture to say
but I did say.

00:38:48.072 --> 00:38:54.632
And the uncle who was dying got all right,
went to America and he’s back and still

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.632
kicking.

00:38:55.632 --> 00:38:58.882
So this is something you see.

00:38:58.882 --> 00:39:01.062
We have to go deep down into ourselves.

00:39:01.062 --> 00:39:05.592
Superficiality is not going to help.

00:39:05.592 --> 00:39:08.822
If we are superficial by nature, it will not
help us.

00:39:08.822 --> 00:39:09.932
We have to understand ourselves.

00:39:09.932 --> 00:39:15.772
The whole mechanism is within us to attract
the attention of this all-pervading Power,

00:39:15.772 --> 00:39:18.262
to use it, to work it out.

00:39:18.262 --> 00:39:20.382
We can do marvels.

00:39:20.382 --> 00:39:26.052
If we really go deep down, and become good
vehicles of that all-pervading Power.

00:39:26.052 --> 00:39:28.182
That’s what we have to do.

00:39:28.182 --> 00:39:29.602
Everything can work out.

00:39:29.602 --> 00:39:37.142
There are so many examples of this, but specially
these two recently I heard about and, I was

00:39:37.142 --> 00:39:38.142
amazed.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:43.402
We have to have that depth within us to understand:
What are we doing?

00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:44.882
Where are we?

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:47.852
We are born at this time.

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:53.961
It’s an important time, and that at this
time, we have got Self-realization.

00:39:53.961 --> 00:39:57.162
Very few people got it.

00:39:57.162 --> 00:40:03.902
Not only that, we have been blessed with so
many things.

00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:06.852
But above all we are so powerful.

00:40:06.852 --> 00:40:13.182
And all these powers must be manifested, must
be used, must be worked out.

00:40:13.182 --> 00:40:23.412
And this superficiality of living on a very
mundane style is not going to help us.

00:40:23.412 --> 00:40:25.961
We have to really go deep down into ourselves.

00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:28.602
I mean you are seekers, no doubt, you are
seekers of truth.

00:40:28.602 --> 00:40:31.062
And you have found it also.

00:40:31.062 --> 00:40:33.342
How many have found it?

00:40:33.342 --> 00:40:39.922
So many are already lost if you see as hippies,
as this, as that, as TM, as another this Rajneesh.

00:40:39.922 --> 00:40:42.542
I’ve seen some other lady here, two months
she came.

00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:44.431
How much she was caught up.

00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:46.752
She was just worried.

00:40:46.752 --> 00:40:47.931
So many are lost like that.

00:40:47.931 --> 00:40:52.161
But you are the people who have got the knowledge,
you are God’s people, you have got the truth

00:40:52.161 --> 00:40:57.272
with you, and all these powers are within
you, but you must use them.

00:40:57.272 --> 00:41:02.012
But I’ve seen even after coming to Sahaja
Yoga some people get lost in the temptation

00:41:02.012 --> 00:41:03.562
because they get money.

00:41:03.562 --> 00:41:06.612
Some people get some talents, they get lost
in the talents.

00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:10.512
Some people get some powers, they’ll get
lost with them.

00:41:10.512 --> 00:41:12.471
That’s not the way.

00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:22.241
You see if God has given you this Realization,
He expects you, to give Realizations to others,

00:41:22.241 --> 00:41:23.241
to go deep down into your Self.

00:41:23.241 --> 00:41:30.461
This is what we have to do is to really work
out, our depth.

00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:31.461
It all exists within us.

00:41:31.461 --> 00:41:32.461
You never knew there is Spirit within us.

00:41:32.461 --> 00:41:33.461
Is there.

00:41:33.461 --> 00:41:34.461
You never knew there is Ganesha within us.

00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:35.461
Is there.

00:41:35.461 --> 00:41:41.961
And when you started awakening them, you found
it works, it works.

00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:47.721
It has worked such wonders, health wise, wealth
wise, in every way.

00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:50.711
But spiritually, how far we are?

00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:59.262
How do you judge a person who is spiritually
evolved, is that, even a desire works out.

00:41:59.262 --> 00:42:03.732
Any, desire works out.

00:42:03.732 --> 00:42:07.232
And such a person doesn’t have any funny
desires.

00:42:07.232 --> 00:42:09.582
Absolutely it works out.

00:42:09.582 --> 00:42:17.102
And that’s what I want Australians to do
because you are special people born in this

00:42:17.102 --> 00:42:19.092
country of Ganesha.

00:42:19.092 --> 00:42:26.411
Perhaps we forget sometimes that you are born
in the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:42:26.411 --> 00:42:29.421
Very special people [INAUDIBLE: you are?].

00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:30.421
Very special.

00:42:30.421 --> 00:42:32.921
So have respect for yourself.

00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:38.082
And also must, manifest your glory.

00:42:38.082 --> 00:42:43.991
That otherwise, of all the places from Russia,
Sahaja Yoga will spread, it’s not, I mean,

00:42:43.991 --> 00:42:45.211
never expected that.

00:42:45.211 --> 00:42:50.441
But it may, it may I tell you they are so
deep, so very deep people.

00:42:50.441 --> 00:42:51.731
Extremely deep.

00:42:51.731 --> 00:42:54.951
I don’t know what has given this.

00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:59.132
Materialism I think is responsible for our
superficiality.

00:42:59.132 --> 00:43:00.132
They are not materialistic.

00:43:00.132 --> 00:43:03.772
About thirty percent people are materialistic,
the rest are not.

00:43:03.772 --> 00:43:09.052
They are all seeking the spirit in the real
sense of the word.

00:43:09.052 --> 00:43:11.322
Not just for fashion.

00:43:11.322 --> 00:43:13.942
Very remarkable.

00:43:13.942 --> 00:43:16.562
Very loving.

00:43:16.562 --> 00:43:19.182
Very beautiful.

00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:25.721
I was there, they came.

00:43:25.721 --> 00:43:33.241
They arranged that, from one place, some people
will come only for two days then two days.

00:43:33.241 --> 00:43:39.372
And where I had purchased a little cottage,
they, there are some places where they can

00:43:39.372 --> 00:43:41.852
live in a small little huts like that.

00:43:41.852 --> 00:43:43.812
They all came and stayed there.

00:43:43.812 --> 00:43:44.812
I didn’t know where they were living or
anything.

00:43:44.812 --> 00:43:51.252
Early in the morning they would come, bring
some flowers, and plant the flowers in the

00:43:51.252 --> 00:43:53.382
garden, flowers, itself.

00:43:53.382 --> 00:43:56.422
And would not say anything and go away.

00:43:56.422 --> 00:43:58.312
Sit down for meditation.

00:43:58.312 --> 00:44:03.642
One day suddenly I discovered all of them
sitting there meditating.

00:44:03.642 --> 00:44:04.642
So surprised.

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.032
And then it was this Gorbachov problems came
up.

00:44:06.032 --> 00:44:07.741
So I said: ‘Now what are you going to do?’

00:44:07.741 --> 00:44:10.421
‘What are we doing?

00:44:10.421 --> 00:44:15.312
We are in the kingdom of God.

00:44:15.312 --> 00:44:23.981
Why should we worry about Gorbachov or anyone,
why should we?’

00:44:23.981 --> 00:44:24.981
We are not worried.

00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:25.981
Beautiful people.

00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:26.981
Beautiful.

00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:27.981
Very collective.

00:44:27.981 --> 00:44:29.072
Also this is the blessing of, communism they
are very collective.

00:44:29.072 --> 00:44:33.942
I have seen that also in Calcutta.

00:44:33.942 --> 00:44:34.942
People are extremely collective.

00:44:34.942 --> 00:44:35.942
They don’t talk ill of others.

00:44:35.942 --> 00:44:37.471
Very collective people.

00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:42.532
It’s not like: ‘Come to my house.

00:44:42.532 --> 00:44:43.711
Oh You must visit.

00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.842
This thing, this is my daughter...’

00:44:45.842 --> 00:44:48.852
That ‘my-ness’ I didn’t see, in Russia
and in Calcutta.

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:49.852
I was surprised.

00:44:49.852 --> 00:44:52.721
Calcutta also has communistic, communist government.

00:44:52.721 --> 00:44:55.382
How it has worked out, I can’t say.

00:44:55.382 --> 00:44:56.382
So are you spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:56.382 --> 00:44:57.382
How many people give Realization?

00:44:57.382 --> 00:44:58.922
Yogi: [INAUDIBLE] We all do it together collectively.

00:44:58.922 --> 00:45:08.062
Shri Mataji: Now you are doing.

00:45:08.062 --> 00:45:17.191
You all have to do it.

00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:21.762
It’s very important.

00:45:21.762 --> 00:45:37.542
All of you should ask this question: ‘What
have I done for God?’

00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:42.372
Look at these flowers that you brought.

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:45.132
They are so fragrant.

00:45:45.132 --> 00:45:47.892
They are so beautiful.

00:45:47.892 --> 00:45:53.372
They are going to live for a very short time.

00:45:53.372 --> 00:45:54.372
But what pleasure.

00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:56.432
What expression of your love they give.

00:45:56.432 --> 00:46:06.612
How beautiful they are.

00:46:06.612 --> 00:46:10.102
Australians have a very big role to play.

00:46:10.102 --> 00:46:57.732
As I expect from Ganesha, I expect from you
also.

00:46:57.732 --> 00:47:03.461
Yogi: …from Hong Kong, from Alex and Kate.

00:47:03.461 --> 00:47:15.592
And they managed to get some editorial in
the newspaper, for their programs as a run-up

00:47:15.592 --> 00:47:16.592
to your visit.

00:47:16.592 --> 00:47:20.481
And in the first program they got sixty Chinese
people, very good quality people.

00:47:20.481 --> 00:47:25.772
Shri Mataji: Oh Look at Alex. Alex is really
special I must say.

00:47:25.772 --> 00:47:28.602
Such a beautiful boy.

00:47:28.602 --> 00:47:36.211
When his mother died, and he was staying with
Me, so I said: ‘Alex won’t to go to your

00:47:36.211 --> 00:47:37.211
mother?’

00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:38.312
So he said: ‘Mother, there’s no seat available.

00:47:38.312 --> 00:47:45.911
Will take about four, five days to get a seat
by the time it goes on.

00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:49.362
So what is the need.

00:47:49.362 --> 00:47:52.122
I am with You.’

00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:54.882
Said: ‘You did try?’

00:47:54.882 --> 00:48:01.272
Said: ‘I did little bit, not much, because
I saw You, and I knew that my mother will

00:48:01.272 --> 00:48:05.852
have Eternal life, so why should I worry.’

00:48:05.852 --> 00:48:12.602
Now he’s saying that Alex has got sixty
Chinese people in Hong Kong.

00:48:12.602 --> 00:48:26.181
I couldn’t get even one.

00:48:26.181 --> 00:48:29.882
Chinese are another one.

00:48:29.882 --> 00:48:38.892
If Sahaja Yoga gets into their heads, they’re
very traditional, very, very deep, very deep

00:48:38.892 --> 00:48:40.741
people, Chinese.

00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:49.802
The Prime Minister of China, I met him when
I went there, in a photograph he’s just

00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:51.701
next to Me standing.

00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:55.481
After that he became Prime Minister, not that
time.

00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:57.471
A very nice man.

00:48:57.471 --> 00:49:02.421
And he was asking Me about spiritual life,
all the time.

00:49:02.421 --> 00:49:04.302
I showed complete ignorance, you see.

00:49:04.302 --> 00:49:08.441
I said these communists God knows what they
are up to.

00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:09.441
I didn’t tell him.

00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:11.471
But I think we can approach him now.

00:49:11.471 --> 00:49:19.012
Somehow or another they got very fond of Me,
all the Chinese government and all.

00:49:19.012 --> 00:49:20.012
Somehow.

00:49:20.012 --> 00:49:22.842
Some sort of an auspiciousness they felt about
Me.

00:49:22.842 --> 00:49:29.451
I couldn’t understand them, what made them,
respect Me so much.

00:49:29.451 --> 00:49:41.191
They had one exhibition, one which they had
invited Me and My husband, and I couldn’t

00:49:41.191 --> 00:49:44.122
go at this point.

00:49:44.122 --> 00:49:50.292
And, the next day was closed, that exhibition
must be closed but they kept it open for Me

00:49:50.292 --> 00:49:51.292
alone.

00:49:51.292 --> 00:49:53.862
And they said: ‘You must see the exhibition,
it’s important.’

00:49:53.862 --> 00:50:01.562
I don’t know, they have their own ways of
understanding.

00:50:01.562 --> 00:50:03.441
We had Confucius there.

00:50:03.441 --> 00:50:13.852
They follow more Confucius now, our Confucius
who has talked about general well-being and

00:50:13.852 --> 00:50:15.471
all that.

00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:23.022
But not so much about Tao, that they don’t
talk.

00:50:23.022 --> 00:50:29.221
But they are extremely humble Chinese.

00:50:29.221 --> 00:50:30.701
Very humble.

00:50:30.701 --> 00:50:34.562
You try to praise them and they say: ‘No,
no.

00:50:34.562 --> 00:50:36.991
We have to do much better than this, nothing.’

00:50:36.991 --> 00:50:48.612
They can never get pampered you see, you couldn’t
praise them, never.

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:59.461
They are very much like Russians, in so many
ways.

00:50:59.461 --> 00:51:17.741
I can see Sahaja Yogis here.

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:25.052
Any questions?

00:51:25.052 --> 00:51:34.931
Tania is very happy with her husband.

00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:36.352
Very happy.

00:51:36.352 --> 00:51:40.582
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji she’s happy.

00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:44.112
Shri Mataji: She’s very happy.

00:51:44.112 --> 00:51:49.762
Yogi: Mother did you know she has hepatitis?

00:51:49.762 --> 00:51:53.292
Shri Mataji: She has what?

00:51:53.292 --> 00:51:54.701
She too?

00:51:54.701 --> 00:51:59.461
I’ve told him what is the thing.

00:51:59.461 --> 00:52:06.231
Can you fax to Dr Spiro?

00:52:06.231 --> 00:52:09.622
[HINDI EXCHANGE] Faxes.

00:52:09.622 --> 00:52:15.562
She is on the liver… or her husband, was
just like a child.

00:52:15.562 --> 00:52:21.322
But see him when he sings, absolutely.

00:52:21.322 --> 00:52:22.362
Remarkable.

00:52:22.362 --> 00:52:31.682
There’s that one with a super- intelligence
I see.

00:52:31.682 --> 00:52:32.711
Wonderful.

00:52:32.711 --> 00:52:38.352
She’s happy because she can come to pujas,
we are now there.

00:52:38.352 --> 00:52:41.982
She is very happy about that.

00:52:41.982 --> 00:52:45.012
She’s happy in Spain also.

00:52:45.012 --> 00:52:49.242
Italians are better but not Spanish people.

00:52:49.242 --> 00:52:58.322
Spanish are little [INAUDIBLE] I think this
American conquering has reflected in their

00:52:58.322 --> 00:52:59.632
character.

00:52:59.632 --> 00:53:08.352
There are also some misunderstanding of people
think that I have said that the men should

00:53:08.352 --> 00:53:10.171
dominate women.

00:53:10.171 --> 00:53:11.441
Never.

00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:20.602
I am Myself a woman and then, if men start
dominating Me what will happen?

00:53:20.602 --> 00:53:24.852
But the man is the, head of the family.

00:53:24.852 --> 00:53:32.181
So the woman, should get her authority from
him but she has her own authority, as a mother,

00:53:32.181 --> 00:53:34.582
and the husband must respect her.

00:53:34.582 --> 00:53:37.721
Otherwise he’ll never be respected.

00:53:37.721 --> 00:53:43.452
So it’s kind of mutual understanding between
the two as I have said that, they are the

00:53:43.452 --> 00:53:46.471
two wheels of a chariot, one on the left one
on the right.

00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:53.022
If you change the wheels, then what will happen?

00:53:53.022 --> 00:53:56.562
They are absolutely, equal no doubt.

00:53:56.562 --> 00:53:57.752
Absolutely equal.

00:53:57.752 --> 00:54:02.502
Only they are not similar, which we must understand
that we are not similar.

00:54:02.502 --> 00:54:07.142
Is nice to be a woman, I tell you, it’s
much better.

00:54:07.142 --> 00:54:12.642
Because men have to face so many people, face
so many bosses.

00:54:12.642 --> 00:54:18.822
You have only one boss, and if you know how
to manage him…

00:54:18.822 --> 00:54:25.981
But should be done sweetly, with understanding.

00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:32.112
It works out with your, wisdom.

00:54:32.112 --> 00:54:34.362
Must have the wisdom, how to manage it.

00:54:34.362 --> 00:54:40.072
But that’s a part of the game, and one has
to play it well.

00:54:40.072 --> 00:54:45.352
Not to feel any way dominated by anything,
but it’s a, kind of a framework one has

00:54:45.352 --> 00:54:46.832
to work with.

00:54:46.832 --> 00:54:49.132
Now supposing this is on our head.

00:54:49.132 --> 00:54:53.171
This is not dominating us, but it has to be
there.

00:54:53.171 --> 00:54:58.172
So a kind of a framework is there, and that
framework is to be accepted.

00:54:58.172 --> 00:55:05.902
Both of them should accept and the husband
should never make her feel that he is dominating

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:06.921
her.

00:55:06.921 --> 00:55:13.572
Actually, in India the custom is that husbands
are also very clever, not only the women.

00:55:13.572 --> 00:55:19.102
So normally they’ll give all the money to
the wife to be managed, and later on take

00:55:19.102 --> 00:55:21.151
away all of that.

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.231
And always they’ll say: ‘All right’.

00:55:24.231 --> 00:55:30.401
They’ll say: ‘All right’, the son to
her, like guru and all that.

00:55:30.401 --> 00:55:33.842
Means: ‘You are my lord and this and that
and…’

00:55:33.842 --> 00:55:35.392
That’s how they keep it up.

00:55:35.392 --> 00:55:40.572
Because one thing they must understand is
that if wife is all right the family is all

00:55:40.572 --> 00:55:41.572
right.

00:55:41.572 --> 00:55:43.602
If wife is all right your life is all right.

00:55:43.602 --> 00:55:46.241
So you must look after your wife.

00:55:46.241 --> 00:55:47.612
Very important.

00:55:47.612 --> 00:55:50.262
If you understand that point the men will
never try to dominate.

00:55:50.262 --> 00:55:54.522
Is a wrong idea is I don’t know from where
it has trickled down that I have said, the

00:55:54.522 --> 00:55:57.322
men should dominate a woman.

00:55:57.322 --> 00:56:01.491
But false prestige should not be there.

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.862
Like in America we went first.

00:56:03.862 --> 00:56:07.932
You know American women, how they are.

00:56:07.932 --> 00:56:11.183
They’ll divorce ten times, and have all
the money of the men.

00:56:11.183 --> 00:56:13.762
The men are just like beggars and they are
so rich.

00:56:13.762 --> 00:56:16.132
It’s a profession with them.

00:56:16.132 --> 00:56:21.372
The women have this profession of divorcing
men.

00:56:21.372 --> 00:56:23.711
So they had cooked and all that.

00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:26.772
So I said: ‘All right let the boys eat first
and then you can eat later on.’

00:56:26.772 --> 00:56:28.901
They said: ‘Mother this is domination.’

00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:29.901
I said: ‘Why?

00:56:29.901 --> 00:56:32.681
Eating first is domination or later on domination.’

00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:37.032
I think eating there, later on is domination,
because you are at peace you see.

00:56:37.032 --> 00:56:38.952
Eat as much as you like.

00:56:38.952 --> 00:56:44.482
But if somebody is eating first, then he’s
in a hurry to finish for the next lot that

00:56:44.482 --> 00:56:45.702
has to come up.

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:53.211
But if you are the second one then you are
relaxed you are eating the way you like.

00:56:53.211 --> 00:56:54.211
There’s nothing to feed.

00:56:54.211 --> 00:57:00.092
And moreover, it’s an attitude I think that:
‘I love to cook, I love to serve I enjoy

00:57:00.092 --> 00:57:01.092
it.

00:57:01.092 --> 00:57:02.092
I enjoy.’

00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:03.092
It’s a, temperament of a woman.

00:57:03.092 --> 00:57:05.522
She wants to feed people, she likes it.

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:12.471
I tell you, My grandchildren, daughters, both
of them, they were quite small, I asked them

00:57:12.471 --> 00:57:15.042
what do you want to be in life.

00:57:15.042 --> 00:57:18.661
So they said: ‘We want to be a nurse or
an airhostess.’

00:57:18.661 --> 00:57:21.411
So I said: ‘Why these two?’

00:57:21.411 --> 00:57:23.726
‘In these only two professions you can give
food to people.

00:57:23.726 --> 00:57:24.726
That’s why.’

00:57:24.726 --> 00:57:28.352
And they play, you know, they play like that.

00:57:28.352 --> 00:57:31.832
They’ll make a tray in that they will [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:31.832 --> 00:57:34.981
So this is actually innate feeling of a child.

00:57:34.981 --> 00:57:39.802
Like once My daughter told girls, that if
somebody comes from outside you must make

00:57:39.802 --> 00:57:41.642
him sit on the sofa there.

00:57:41.642 --> 00:57:43.622
You must see that the fan is open.

00:57:43.622 --> 00:57:47.632
Give them something to eat, take out from
the fridge and all that.

00:57:47.632 --> 00:57:49.982
So one washerman, the dhobi came in.

00:57:49.982 --> 00:57:52.212
They called for [INAUDIBLE] to sit on the
sofa.

00:57:52.212 --> 00:57:53.532
Said: ‘I can’t sit.’

00:57:53.532 --> 00:57:54.852
‘You have to sit.’

00:57:54.852 --> 00:57:56.172
‘I’m in a hurry.’

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:57.332
‘Nothing you have to sit.’

00:57:57.332 --> 00:58:01.092
They made him sit, opened the fan, got everything
from the fridge, put it before him.

00:58:01.092 --> 00:58:03.922
‘You have to eat, otherwise we’ll feed,’
you see.

00:58:03.922 --> 00:58:08.981
And when My daughter entered the house she
saw these girls feeding him with their own

00:58:08.981 --> 00:58:09.981
hands.

00:58:09.981 --> 00:58:10.981
Got such a fright.

00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:13.721
He said: ‘I’m sorry these girls I don’t
know what are they are.’

00:58:13.721 --> 00:58:16.335
They said: ‘You told us and we’re very
happy we are doing that.’

00:58:16.335 --> 00:58:22.342
So innately children have this feeling in
their hearts, as girls.

00:58:22.342 --> 00:58:27.661
And then when we get a chance we want to do
it.

00:58:27.661 --> 00:58:31.752
I mean, it’s such a pleasure, to feed someone.

00:58:31.752 --> 00:58:37.741
You must have seen with Indian women, it’s
very common they love to feed others, they’re

00:58:37.741 --> 00:58:39.522
very happy.

00:58:39.522 --> 00:58:46.832
And, I mean there’s no domination I mean
if you have to feed someone, that doesn’t

00:58:46.832 --> 00:58:51.822
mean that somebody’s dominating you these
are all nonsensical norms.

00:58:51.822 --> 00:58:56.152
On the contrary it’s a privilege.

00:58:56.152 --> 00:59:06.142
Otherwise after sometime we’ll find, that
men will be sitting at home and the women

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:20.292
will be going out.

00:59:20.292 --> 00:59:54.582
That will be, that’s already a situation
I mean.

00:59:54.582 --> 01:01:09.882
[It’s hot for children I think we are in
a cabin, like the ship I think, without the

01:01:09.882 --> 01:01:10.882
sea.

01:01:10.882 --> 01:01:11.882
And there’s no air-conditioning properly.

01:01:11.882 --> 01:01:12.882
Outside is better.]

01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:13.882
So, any questions?

01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:15.741
[INAUDIBLE something about entrepreneurs and
a book] Entrepreneurs?

01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:16.741
I see.

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:17.741
It’s quite a small book I have to say.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:18.741
Yogini: …the entrepreneurs, plastic surgeons,
the cosmetic industry, fashion industry…

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:19.741
Shri Mataji: So what are they saying?

01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:20.741
Yogini: I think the bottom line is that women
have got very poor, self image through those

01:01:20.741 --> 01:01:21.741
[INAUDIBLE] It’s a multimillion dollar business
[INAUDIBLE] people are forcing women into

01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:22.741
and women are trapped…

01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:23.741
Shri Mataji: So that, and then they’re saying,
so women can’t do this and...

01:01:23.741 --> 01:01:24.741
Yogini:…

01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:25.741
talk about how women are frightened to grow
old, that there is no culture…

01:01:25.741 --> 01:01:26.741
Shri Mataji: You see in, I can have the book?

01:01:26.741 --> 01:01:27.741
In Germany, when I went, there was a lady
and she was telling Me that in Germany, if

01:01:27.741 --> 01:01:28.741
you get old then the men go after younger
girls, because you are left alone.

01:01:28.741 --> 01:01:29.741
Then you have to marry some older man, who
is left by his wife or something.

01:01:29.741 --> 01:01:30.741
It’s a big danger.

01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:31.741
I said: ‘Why don’t you produce children.

01:01:31.741 --> 01:01:32.741
I mean they get, if you have four children
they get more money than the Prime Minister.’

01:01:32.741 --> 01:01:34.211
They said: ‘But then you cannot have a husband.’

01:01:34.211 --> 01:01:37.542
Either you have children or you have a husband.

01:01:37.542 --> 01:01:38.802
It’s like that.

01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:44.651
It is because, I tell you, it’s very superficial,
very materialistic superficial ideas, about

01:01:44.651 --> 01:01:45.651
women also.

01:01:45.651 --> 01:01:46.741
They’re a commodity.

01:01:46.741 --> 01:01:54.322
In Sahaja Yoga woman, is a person, as equal
as a man, you see.

01:01:54.322 --> 01:01:56.372
It’s very different.

01:01:56.372 --> 01:02:03.241
They are just a commodity to be used, whenever
they want to.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:10.952
And I must say also some women know the weaknesses
of men and try to work it out in such a manner.

01:02:10.952 --> 01:02:15.162
Sometimes the women only, trouble women, also.

01:02:15.162 --> 01:02:20.222
They don’t understand that she’s a woman
and I’m a woman I should not try to trouble.

01:02:20.222 --> 01:02:28.812
But in sort of competitiveness, they do wrong
things and try to destroy another’s life.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:34.522
But men will have to change now, it’s coming
to that.

01:02:34.522 --> 01:02:40.032
All these tricks they have tried and they
are now having, lot of problem.

01:02:40.032 --> 01:02:41.862
There are diseases that are coming up.

01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:44.542
Already there’s lots of already these secret
diseases there.

01:02:44.542 --> 01:02:51.221
Apart from these secret diseases there are
diseases which are stopping them, new diseases.

01:02:51.221 --> 01:02:53.712
So now they’ll have to come to monogamy.

01:02:53.712 --> 01:02:58.481
Once they come to monogamy, then they’ll
have to realize the value of women, what they

01:02:58.481 --> 01:02:59.481
are.

01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:04.682
And in this all, quarrel about ordination.

01:03:04.682 --> 01:03:12.382
Imagine Christianity is so stupid that they
can’t have women for ordination.

01:03:12.382 --> 01:03:18.112
Now I am a Woman after all.

01:03:18.112 --> 01:03:26.272
And now as a reaction, women are so angry,
that a girl came to Me the other day I was

01:03:26.272 --> 01:03:31.292
in Perth she said: ‘Mother, why did you
call God as ‘He’, why don’t you call

01:03:31.292 --> 01:03:32.292
as ‘She’?’

01:03:32.292 --> 01:03:37.102
I said: ‘Because I am ‘She’ that’s
why I have to call Him ‘He.’

01:03:37.102 --> 01:03:40.882
But this concept is only, is still there.

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:49.762
In the Indian scriptures nowhere, that there’s
God, and His Power is Adi Shakti.

01:03:49.762 --> 01:03:58.401
But nowhere, even Islam, in Christianity,
in Judaism, in what you call, Buddhism, Jainism,

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.401
nowhere.

01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:05.981
They have not talked of the woman at all.

01:04:05.981 --> 01:04:12.812
As if the whole world is made of men.

01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:15.481
And this is surprisingly for developed countries
in Sweden countries like this, they are talking

01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:16.481
this nonsense.

01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:19.872
But the solution is only Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:24.292
There’s no other solution.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:34.152
Even women go and fight with men what’s
the use?

01:04:34.152 --> 01:04:36.522
Men fight with women no use.

01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:41.152
So the best thing for them is to get to Sahaja
Yoga to understand the value of women.

01:04:41.152 --> 01:04:49.441
They understand what they are for, and what
is our relationship means you see.

01:04:49.441 --> 01:04:52.411
It’s such an enjoyment.

01:04:52.411 --> 01:04:55.412
Stupid those people who do not want to have
that enjoyment.

01:04:55.412 --> 01:05:00.911
Also your media is responsible whenever you
open the television you just find husband

01:05:00.911 --> 01:05:03.141
wife fighting …It’s too much.

01:05:03.141 --> 01:05:07.872
All the time fighting, fighting, they show…they
never show good relationship.

01:05:07.872 --> 01:05:12.312
Once I asked Derek Lee: ‘Is there any novel
where they show the romance of husband and

01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:13.312
wife?’

01:05:13.312 --> 01:05:15.542
He said: ‘There’s no book’.

01:05:15.542 --> 01:05:17.691
No book in English.

01:05:17.691 --> 01:05:20.372
The whole of English language there’s no
romance of husband and wife, can you imagine.

01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:23.931
I mean that is how you get into tragedies.

01:05:23.931 --> 01:05:30.731
But in India if you see, the literature has
certain ethics.

01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:34.631
One of them is only the romance between husband
and wife is a romance.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:37.151
The rest of it is, vulgarity.

01:05:37.151 --> 01:05:50.152
This is the concept it shows.

01:05:50.152 --> 01:05:56.161
Also because mostly they are arranged marriages,
so they don’t know all this romanticism

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:57.201
before marriage.

01:05:57.201 --> 01:06:05.872
So they are waiting for their wife and whole
thing, and the wife becomes everything to

01:06:05.872 --> 01:06:06.872
the husband, and same, vice versa.

01:06:06.872 --> 01:06:07.931
So the whole cultural concept has changed.

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:14.832
It used to be the same way before, in every
country, but now we are advanced you see.

01:06:14.832 --> 01:06:22.092
In that advancement we have done this kind
of a thing, is to make antagonistic societies

01:06:22.092 --> 01:06:23.522
of men and women.

01:06:23.522 --> 01:06:25.572
It’s very sad.

01:06:25.572 --> 01:06:28.981
But we are very superficial.

01:06:28.981 --> 01:06:32.822
But the concept itself is wrong.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:42.762
I think the basic fundamental thing, in the
western culture is, to see and to be seen.

01:06:42.762 --> 01:06:45.382
This is what I’ve realized.

01:06:45.382 --> 01:06:46.951
That’s the culture.

01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:51.162
That people should see you, and you should
be able to see others.

01:06:51.162 --> 01:06:53.362
I mean, it is so superficial.

01:06:53.362 --> 01:06:59.411
Now they see somebody’s legs and somebody’s
knees, I mean, what’s the use of a joyless

01:06:59.411 --> 01:07:00.411
pursuit.

01:07:00.411 --> 01:07:01.411
That person doesn’t belong to you nothing
of the kind.

01:07:01.411 --> 01:07:02.411
What’s the use of seeing these things?

01:07:02.411 --> 01:07:05.131
But this, we have become very superficial.

01:07:05.131 --> 01:07:11.162
And it’s going on and on.

01:07:11.162 --> 01:07:19.971
But I think this will all stop in Sahaja Yoga,
gradually we’ll start seeing the beauty

01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:21.022
inside.

01:07:21.022 --> 01:07:26.241
You know Chris Marlow you know from London.

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:29.161
He had a wife Jane.

01:07:29.161 --> 01:07:31.881
She was quite a dry person.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:38.452
She herself was saying that: ‘Mother I am
no good for him.’

01:07:38.452 --> 01:07:39.452
So they divorced.

01:07:39.452 --> 01:07:42.632
Then he told Me: ‘Mother I want to marry
a girl who has lots of vibrations.’

01:07:42.632 --> 01:07:44.182
I said: ‘What about looks?’

01:07:44.182 --> 01:07:46.042
‘No I don’t see any looks.

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:48.572
I want to see a girl with vibrations.’

01:07:48.572 --> 01:07:50.522
And we had a girl from Amalhabad.

01:07:50.522 --> 01:07:53.262
Very dark, extremely dark, and village-like,
absolutely.

01:07:53.262 --> 01:08:00.812
You will never, I mean, I don’t think from
your standards she may not be beautiful from

01:08:00.812 --> 01:08:02.612
My standards she was very good.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:03.612
Full of vibrations.

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:04.612
Full of vibrations.

01:08:04.612 --> 01:08:08.381
As soon as she came on the stage he jumped,
said: ‘This is the one.’

01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:13.431
He’s so tall, she’s short and [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:13.431 --> 01:08:16.522
And he looks after her so well I tell you.

01:08:16.522 --> 01:08:22.382
And then he went to her place, her village,
all the way to Amalhabad.

01:08:22.382 --> 01:08:24.102
My sister saw, she said: ‘What a couple.’

01:08:24.102 --> 01:08:27.632
I said: ‘The couple has chosen each other,
I can’t help it.’

01:08:27.632 --> 01:08:32.172
He’s so fond of her, he looks after her.

01:08:32.172 --> 01:08:36.282
She’s very sweet, I mean I really love with
that.

01:08:36.282 --> 01:08:41.322
But I didn’t know that this fellow will
have the same sort of a feeling.

01:08:41.322 --> 01:08:51.522
Because we are superficial these things are
accepred.

01:08:51.522 --> 01:08:54.932
You should see the inner being.

01:08:54.932 --> 01:08:58.142
How beautiful it is.

01:08:58.142 --> 01:09:08.082
Look at that Elizabeth Taylor, that stupid
country of America.

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:10.982
This was her eighth divorce, I mean eighth
honeymoon.

01:09:10.982 --> 01:09:16.702
So they had three thousand or four thousand
people just standing outside her house to

01:09:16.702 --> 01:09:19.422
see, she is going for her honeymoon.

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:20.972
Can you imagine stupid.

01:09:20.972 --> 01:09:24.712
And there were ten helicopters hovering round.

01:09:24.712 --> 01:09:35.872
And they were parachuting, and some of them
fell on the trees and some fell on the people

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:36.872
who were there.

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.222
And they were quite excited, very sensational.

01:09:39.222 --> 01:09:43.032
You know such stupid people these Americans
are.

01:09:43.032 --> 01:09:45.312
I don’t know what to say.

01:09:45.312 --> 01:09:48.452
And this lady had divorced eight.

01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:58.092
And this husband of hers, this one, he’s
I think, I don’t know how many years younger

01:09:58.092 --> 01:09:59.472
to her, like her son.

01:09:59.472 --> 01:10:00.472
And also he’s an ordinary man or something.

01:10:00.472 --> 01:10:03.012
But just for the heck of it.

01:10:03.012 --> 01:10:07.612
She has no sense of marriage, nothing.

01:10:07.612 --> 01:10:15.232
But what she has done is she’s operated
her eyelids and she’s put her up and all

01:10:15.232 --> 01:10:19.892
that, and she looks younger now and she says:
‘I can…’

01:10:19.892 --> 01:10:22.522
There’s no, in that country you cannot mature.

01:10:22.522 --> 01:10:23.522
So stupid.

01:10:23.522 --> 01:10:27.442
I mean, I was yet to come across people in
a group so stupid as that.

01:10:27.442 --> 01:10:29.672
Stupidest people you see.

01:10:29.672 --> 01:10:30.672
Stupidest.

01:10:30.672 --> 01:10:36.152
You can never mature this way.

01:10:36.152 --> 01:10:41.712
Still Sahaja Yoga is now working.

01:10:41.712 --> 01:10:44.562
Gregoire feels so exhausted.

01:10:44.562 --> 01:10:52.672
Every time he footsoaks he just lies flat,
saying: ‘Mother, please save me from New

01:10:52.672 --> 01:10:53.672
York.’

01:10:53.672 --> 01:10:54.672
It’s terrible.

01:10:54.672 --> 01:10:56.752
There’s no way of maturity.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:11:01.952
[INAUDIBLE] They invited me for this Jungian
Society.

01:11:01.952 --> 01:11:05.811
And I went there.

01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:09.191
Of course I didn’t read Jung much but that
day I got hold of a book and I found out the

01:11:09.191 --> 01:11:12.391
reason why Jungians have failed.

01:11:12.391 --> 01:11:18.661
So I talked to them they were very much impressed
and all that.

01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:22.711
Then the president of that society is eighty
years of age, and he said that: ‘Mother

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.201
I must see You I have some private thing to
talk.’

01:11:24.201 --> 01:11:25.201
I said: ‘All right.’

01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:26.201
This old man came about eighty years of age.

01:11:26.201 --> 01:11:27.201
He said: ‘I have a very serious problem.’

01:11:27.201 --> 01:11:29.301
I said: ‘What’s the serious problem.’

01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:33.201
He says: ‘You see I had a keep.

01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:41.151
Because I am a Catholic I could not marry
the keep but I never told my wife.

01:11:41.151 --> 01:11:44.731
[INAUDIBLE] I never told my wife.’

01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:51.231
‘So now what am I supposed to do ?’ He
said: ‘Now that my wife is dead and I want

01:11:51.231 --> 01:11:52.641
that keep to stay with me but she has refused.

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:59.231
Can you do something to see that the keep
stays with me.’

01:11:59.231 --> 01:12:02.261
I said: ‘It’s all right.’

01:12:02.261 --> 01:12:03.261
Eighty year-old man.

01:12:03.261 --> 01:12:05.721
I was turning sixty by that time.

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:08.471
An eighty year-old man talking like this to
Me.

01:12:08.471 --> 01:12:12.751
I said: ‘Now what is happening to this man?’

01:12:12.751 --> 01:12:22.641
And he is the chairman of the Jungian Society,
International.

01:12:22.641 --> 01:12:24.921
See the maturity of that person.

01:12:24.921 --> 01:12:27.371
Eighty year-old.

01:12:27.371 --> 01:12:33.551
In America, such cases so much.

01:12:33.551 --> 01:12:36.481
Terrible.

01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:41.171
Extremely stupid and I don’t know, they
have no confidence in themselves.

01:12:41.171 --> 01:12:43.771
All the time they think we should not get
old.

01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:50.541
So there was, on the television they showed
the cinema actors and actresses coming for

01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:55.421
a dance of ‘shake’ and they were all about
ninety years of age.

01:12:55.421 --> 01:12:57.391
Then when they got down from the car only
they were shaking.

01:12:57.391 --> 01:12:58.391
I said: ‘What’s the use, of going to shake?’

01:12:58.391 --> 01:13:00.451
In ninety years they have not grown.

01:13:00.451 --> 01:13:06.211
Funny dresses they were wearing and all that.

01:13:06.211 --> 01:13:08.851
So when are they going to grow.

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.291
There’s no maturity.

01:13:10.291 --> 01:13:21.541
The atmosphere is the other way round I think.

01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:25.621
Very stupid.

01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:29.701
Really mad.

01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:32.421
But people start copying them.

01:13:32.421 --> 01:13:34.931
Whatever they say people listen to them even
English I’m surprised.

01:13:34.931 --> 01:13:36.531
I said that: ‘You are sensible people.

01:13:36.531 --> 01:13:40.661
Why do you follow these stupid Americans,
or the French?’

01:13:40.661 --> 01:13:42.861
English people are rather mature.

01:13:42.861 --> 01:13:46.291
Maybe they lived in India so they have matured
quickly I don’t know why.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:49.111
But compared with these stupid people they
are much more mature.

01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:52.171
And now they are following the American style.

01:13:52.171 --> 01:14:02.631
They used to follow first the French style,
now the American style.

01:14:02.631 --> 01:14:03.631
They don’t stand on their own legs.

01:14:03.631 --> 01:14:04.711
But Italians have a good sense of ridicule.

01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:09.171
They understand what is ridiculous, that’s
something about them.

01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:12.881
A great sense of ridiculous.

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:20.721
It will all change in Sahaja Yoga it will.

01:14:20.721 --> 01:14:24.001
You are in the Kingdom of God.

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:27.151
You shouldn’t worry about these things.

01:14:27.151 --> 01:14:33.201
But what to do, if they join us they can come
up.

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:46.841
But they don’t want to, let them be like
as they are.

01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:48.321
What else?

01:14:48.321 --> 01:14:51.261
Yogini:…lymphatic system…

01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:57.151
Shri Mataji: Lymphatic system?

01:14:57.151 --> 01:15:13.341
If the lymphatic system is under attack you
may be left-sided.

01:15:13.341 --> 01:15:22.491
You see it is, on the whole, there are only
two types of problems actually.

01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:26.261
Third type doesn’t exist, or doesn’t bother
us.

01:15:26.261 --> 01:15:30.131
One is the left another is the right, you
see.

01:15:30.131 --> 01:15:33.931
Now the lymphatic system is actually, the
combination of both.

01:15:33.931 --> 01:15:35.491
It’s a psychosomatic disease.

01:15:35.491 --> 01:15:38.581
For that you have to do just three-candle
treatment.

01:15:38.581 --> 01:15:45.631
You see it is reduced to such a simple thing
either you do three-candle treatment, or you

01:15:45.631 --> 01:15:47.301
do water treatment.

01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:57.971
The third type is the one where you have been
to wrong gurus, in the center.

01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:01.021
If I run some wrong type of meditation [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:01.021 --> 01:16:05.181
For that also it’s three-candle treatment,
mostly.

01:16:05.181 --> 01:16:10.761
Or maybe if the [INAUDIBLE] comes there’s
a little change also sometimes.

01:16:10.761 --> 01:16:13.711
But whatever it is, this is very simple for
physical.

01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:17.791
Anybody has lymphatic system problem has to
do left side first.

01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:18.791
So this is psychosomatic.

01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:23.821
First you must get rid of the psycho side,
so do the left side.

01:16:23.821 --> 01:16:28.631
When it is cleared out, then right side is
not difficult.

01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:35.441
If you are too right-sided, then what happens,
it’s like a pendulum, you move from right

01:16:35.441 --> 01:16:36.671
to left.

01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:39.421
Then psychosomatic troubles start.

01:16:39.421 --> 01:16:44.061
The best is first to remove the left, then
is look after the right.

01:16:44.061 --> 01:16:49.131
Sahaja Yoga is a very simple way of clearing.

01:16:49.131 --> 01:16:51.271
It works.

01:16:51.271 --> 01:16:57.811
Somebody should help you in left side is to
give you bandhan on your chakras with a candle.

01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:09.121
Put a candle on one side of the left swadisthana
and also one before the Photograph.

01:17:09.121 --> 01:17:14.281
Because it’s all due to viruses.

01:17:14.281 --> 01:17:15.761
And the viruses are there because your attention
in the left.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:20.471
Once your attention goes away from there you
are rid of that.

01:17:20.471 --> 01:17:21.881
All right?

01:17:21.881 --> 01:17:24.001
It’s not complicated.

01:17:24.001 --> 01:17:27.531
Sahaja Yoga is very simple.

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:33.801
You know we have cured people who were about
to go on the dialysis.

01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:37.021
Kidney has been cured.

01:17:37.021 --> 01:17:38.021
Can you imagine?

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:40.911
Of course [INAUDIBLE] blood cancer that has
been cured no doubt.

01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:55.431
But imagine the kidney, people were going
on the dialysis.

01:17:55.431 --> 01:18:00.981
[INAUDIBLE QUESTION] Of course.

01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:03.431
I mean, we make the human beings.

01:18:03.431 --> 01:18:12.671
[INAUDIBLE] You first, if you are evolving,
you are also evolving human beings with you.

01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:19.381
So it’s for the emancipation of the whole
world.

01:18:19.381 --> 01:18:23.271
It’s not only your evolution.

01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:25.461
No no not at all.

01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:26.471
That was over.

01:18:26.471 --> 01:18:34.251
Now I have told about that in [INAUDIBLE],
is that, from Buddha’s future they say there

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:38.781
will be a future Buddha who will be Maitreya.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:42.961
Maitreya means Three Mothers together, will
be the future Buddha.

01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:45.831
And that is called as Bodhisattva.

01:18:45.831 --> 01:18:51.261
Now the Bodhisattva is the One, who will become
Buddha, means who will get Enlightened right,

01:18:51.261 --> 01:18:53.471
and will work for the other people.

01:18:53.471 --> 01:19:00.921
So is already described, and you don’t have
to suffer, you don’t have to do anything

01:19:00.921 --> 01:19:05.821
as it was before individually, but now you’ll
work with the collective.

01:19:05.821 --> 01:19:12.461
So, you have to work with the collective otherwise
you have no meaning.

01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:16.981
Also you cannot be cleansed unless and until
you come to collective.

01:19:16.981 --> 01:19:21.051
If you say: ‘I’m staying at home and I’m
doing all the puja and all that,’ doesn’t

01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:22.051
work out.

01:19:22.051 --> 01:19:31.731
Like a nail if it is cut, it doesn’t grow.

01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:35.041
Very simple.

01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:42.631
It’s not for one person no doubt.

01:19:42.631 --> 01:19:45.371
I mean how can it be, for one.

01:19:45.371 --> 01:19:47.881
Because the time has come for doing collective
work now.

01:19:47.881 --> 01:19:56.741
The whole world has to change.

01:19:56.741 --> 01:20:11.751
Yogi: Shri Mother, will we ever be able to
go to Tasmania?

01:20:11.751 --> 01:20:15.431
Shri Mataji: [HINDI] That’s [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:15.431 --> 01:20:19.121
Yes they have to come.

01:20:19.121 --> 01:20:21.411
They have to come here.

01:20:21.411 --> 01:20:25.591
Like you see, Sicily, we are now having lots
of Sahaja Yogis there.

01:20:25.591 --> 01:20:26.591
They all came down.

01:20:26.591 --> 01:20:28.161
Then I can now go to Sicily.

01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:31.671
We have very great people in Tasmania.

01:20:31.671 --> 01:20:33.971
Now that’s the point.

01:20:33.971 --> 01:20:37.451
So when they will come and they’ll get their
Realization then I can go.

01:20:37.451 --> 01:20:49.421
You see, if I go to a place it is like the,
should I say, the seeds being sprouted nobody

01:20:49.421 --> 01:20:52.341
to look after.

01:20:52.341 --> 01:21:01.651
Yogi: There were quite a number of people
who came from Tasmania.

01:21:01.651 --> 01:21:05.081
I think some of them wonder if they could
ever go back.

01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:06.081
Shri Mataji: They should.

01:21:06.081 --> 01:21:07.081
They should.

01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:08.081
They should go with their bandhans and try
to save their country.

01:21:08.081 --> 01:21:09.081
They should.

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.081
If they go and establish it I’ll definitely
go.

01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:13.171
It’s quite a remarkable place that Tasmania
is.

01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:15.531
Talismad means, all these secret, magic.

01:21:15.531 --> 01:21:21.971
From that Tasmania word must have come.

01:21:21.971 --> 01:21:30.151
Yogi: How many Tasmanians are there here?

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:39.501
Shri Mataji: Still very few, to fight those
negativities there.

01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:41.201
Very negative.

01:21:41.201 --> 01:21:44.611
Very negative, isn’t it.

01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:48.871
That’s like, we have Calcutta.

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:53.131
Too much of black magic.

01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:54.831
Too much.

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:58.261
But gradually we have now, got it out.

01:21:58.261 --> 01:21:59.261
It’s changed.

01:21:59.261 --> 01:22:02.611
One side is they are all full of black magic,
those who believe in God.

01:22:02.611 --> 01:22:03.611
The another side are communists.

01:22:03.611 --> 01:22:04.671
But still now we have thousands.

01:22:04.671 --> 01:22:05.671
It is remarkable.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:17.361
But people had to work very hard for it, very
hard.

01:22:17.361 --> 01:22:25.861
So many people went from Nagpur, from Bombay,
from Delhi to help them.

01:22:25.861 --> 01:22:32.671
Still some places I’ve not been, like Ceylon,
Assam.

01:22:32.671 --> 01:22:35.002
We have some coming from there.

01:22:35.002 --> 01:22:36.002
I told them next year I’ll try to be there.

01:22:36.002 --> 01:22:37.002
Yogi: Shri Mataji, …Photograph where Hands
are like that.

01:22:37.002 --> 01:22:40.301
Can you tell us the significance of that please?

01:22:40.301 --> 01:22:57.201
Shri Mataji: Hands like that.

01:22:57.201 --> 01:23:02.961
You want to know what’s the symbol?

01:23:02.961 --> 01:23:04.901
This is for assurance.

01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:07.461
See this is for assurance.

01:23:07.461 --> 01:23:09.111
It has powers.

01:23:09.111 --> 01:23:11.861
This Hand has tremendous powers.

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:13.381
And this One is for giving.

01:23:13.381 --> 01:23:14.381
You see.

01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:18.871
So these are two aspects.

01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:27.591
But actually as you know this is the, power
of action.

01:23:27.591 --> 01:23:28.781
So it acts.

01:23:28.781 --> 01:23:32.131
And this is the power of desire.

01:23:32.131 --> 01:23:49.261
So this is the Love that’s flowing of your
Mother, and this is how She [INAUDIBLE] it.

01:23:49.261 --> 01:24:12.131
But now I have given up.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:30.841
I used to do it in the beginning it was needed,
but now it’s not necessary.

01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:44.201
It works even without that.

01:24:44.201 --> 01:25:05.371
They are called as mudras which I used in
the beginning.

01:25:05.371 --> 01:25:22.250
Now I don’t use that, mostly.
