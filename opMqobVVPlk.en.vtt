00:00.435 --> 00:06.435
Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 27 July 1992.

01:07:02.459 --> 01:07:06.042
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:07:12.209 --> 01:07:18.167
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:27.125
We cannot imagine about it,

01:07:27.417 --> 01:07:30.834
think about it or conceptualize it.

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:46.542
Also unfortunately, at this human level we cannot feel it.

01:07:52.626 --> 01:07:56.501
We have to become a subtler being

01:07:56.709 --> 01:08:00.709
to feel our subtle being.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.918
We have to be the Spirit.

01:08:13.209 --> 01:08:18.542
Otherwise whatever we think about it

01:08:18.751 --> 01:08:20.834
is not reality.

01:08:34.209 --> 01:08:39.751
Reality has to be known by ascending

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:43.083
to another state of Spirit.

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.876
Now, let us know what is the truth.

01:08:57.999 --> 01:09:03.792
The truth is we are not this body, this mind

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:08.375
Is... Sorry, go ahead.

01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:17.751
This is not your conditionings,

01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:20.834
nor your ego, emotions,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.959
but it is pure Spirit.

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:37.501
The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power

01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:39.876
of Divine Love,

01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:50.542
which does all the living work.

01:09:54.584 --> 01:09:59.584
We see these beautiful flowers –  it’s a miracle,

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:05.292
but we take it for granted.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.459
Look at our eyes,

01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:14.626
which is a miracle itself – it’s a camera.

01:10:20.501 --> 01:10:24.542
Look at our brain, which is such a computer.

01:10:28.834 --> 01:10:31.459
But we take it for granted

01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:36.125
and do not think about it.

01:10:38.417 --> 01:10:40.417
Who does this work?

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:45.792
Who runs our heart?

01:10:56.417 --> 01:10:59.584
What's the matter? Please take the child out.

01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:11.250
We call it in medical terminology

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:14.834
that autonomous nervous system runs the heart.

01:11:20.417 --> 01:11:22.876
But who is this auto?

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:30.792
All this living work is done by

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:34.626
this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:47.501
Whatever I’m telling you, you need not take it blindfolded.

01:11:52.459 --> 01:11:56.999
But you have to keep your mind open

01:11:57.626 --> 01:12:00.042
like a scientist

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:06.125
and treat it as a hypothesis.

01:12:08.918 --> 01:12:13.083
And if you find that it is true

01:12:13.334 --> 01:12:17.584
then you have to accept it as honest people.

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:26.250
Because it is for your benevolence

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:30.501
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

01:12:39.042 --> 01:12:45.042
So now, within us is based this mechanism,

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:49.209
which has been shown to you and about which they have told you.

01:12:56.999 --> 01:13:00.125
And there is this power

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:03.042
which is going to connect you

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:06.626
to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:18.209
We are all born

01:13:18.417 --> 01:13:22.834
with that Divinity within us in a potential state.

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:32.542
And it is quite intact.

01:13:34.459 --> 01:13:36.417
Whatever you might have done,

01:13:36.626 --> 01:13:39.792
whatever so called mistakes you might have committed,

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:44.501
this faith of Divinity is also within us.

01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:55.584
We had this faith from our childhood,

01:13:55.792 --> 01:13:58.459
but gradually we lost it.

01:14:03.959 --> 01:14:07.292
We had faith that there is something beyond

01:14:07.584 --> 01:14:10.459
and that’s what we have lost it.

01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:17.626
Or we are misled.

01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:26.459
We have to understand that

01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:31.584
this Divinity is absolutely there,

01:14:31.876 --> 01:14:36.250
untarnished, without any problem,

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:47.834
because it is of eternal nature.

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:56.626
Like clouds, maybe some of the actions

01:14:56.834 --> 01:15:00.250
in our life might have covered it.

01:15:08.459 --> 01:15:14.083
But you’ll be amazed to see that it is there, alive.

01:15:19.584 --> 01:15:23.792
Now, the second problem we have to understand

01:15:23.999 --> 01:15:28.751
that all world problems come from human beings.

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.959
And all human problems come from

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:39.918
these fundamental centers within us.

01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:50.000
When these fundamental centers go into problems

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:54.250
we get all kinds of physical, mental,

01:15:54.459 --> 01:15:57.292
emotional, social, political

01:15:57.584 --> 01:16:00.501
and also spiritual problems.

01:16:06.918 --> 01:16:10.999
Physical, mental, emotional,

01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:15.999
political, economical and social.

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:23.083
So, if these centers could be corrected, nourished,

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:27.083
made healthy all the problems will be solved.

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:42.375
The time has come for us to achieve that state of Spirit.

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:53.375
Is a special time. I call it the blossom time.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:59.667
In the Bible they called it the Last Judgment.

01:17:04.459 --> 01:17:07.292
In the Koran, Puranas,

01:17:07.542 --> 01:17:11.959
also it is described as ”Satya Yuga”.

01:17:17.042 --> 01:17:21.125
And in the Koran it is described as

01:17:21.334 --> 01:17:23.834
”Kiyama”, meaning Resurrection time.

01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:32.542
It is fortunate that at this time you are all born

01:17:32.751 --> 01:17:35.751
and that you are seekers of truth.

01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:46.751
Sahaja Yoga – ”Saha” means ‘with you’, is born the right

01:17:47.125 --> 01:17:49.626
to achieve the state of Spirit.

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:57.334
”’Ja”’ is born.

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:15.209
So, this right you have. All of you have got that right.

01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:18.834
And you have to achieve that state of Spirit.

01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:30.292
In short I’ll tell you what is this nature of the Spirit.

01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:38.501
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty.

01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:44.999
So, it is a universal being.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:55.417
It exists as a witness in our heart.

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.667
It watches whatever we are doing.

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:08.751
But when it manifests in our attention

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:15.334
then we can feel

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:20.125
the our centers and the centers of others.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:33.501
Thus we get self knowledge – selfhood.

01:19:35.918 --> 01:19:40.542
And also we develop a new dimension in our awareness

01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:44.167
called as collective consciousness,

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:54.751
when you can feel the centers of others.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:01.501
If you can understand

01:20:01.918 --> 01:20:07.626
and master the art of Divine working

01:20:07.834 --> 01:20:10.626
you can cure your centers

01:20:10.834 --> 01:20:14.250
and you can cure the centers of others.

01:20:23.584 --> 01:20:29.417
When this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area

01:20:29.626 --> 01:20:34.125
it connects you to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:20:41.876 --> 01:20:45.542
Just like this instrument has got this

01:20:45.751 --> 01:20:49.375
connection with the mains, in the same way

01:20:49.584 --> 01:20:52.876
you get connected with that power.

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:03.375
Once this connection is fully established

01:21:03.584 --> 01:21:07.626
all the time this dynamic energy starts flowing through you.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:20.709
You become dynamic – at the same time extremely compassionate.

01:21:26.542 --> 01:21:31.626
You become very wise, with divine discretion.

01:21:35.417 --> 01:21:37.709
On your fingertips you can feel

01:21:37.918 --> 01:21:40.918
your centers and the centers of others.

01:21:46.417 --> 01:21:48.834
Everybody feels the same.

01:21:50.417 --> 01:21:53.042
If you want to know this is wrong or right

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.209
you can feel it on your fingertips.

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.042
Thus you know the absolute truth.

01:22:07.626 --> 01:22:10.626
If everyone feels the same way,

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:15.417
then how can there be quarrels? How can there be wars also?

01:22:24.542 --> 01:22:29.709
So, this is a new awareness,

01:22:29.959 --> 01:22:34.042
a new dimension, which manifests within us.

01:22:40.417 --> 01:22:43.959
And it takes us much beyond mental activity,

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:48.125
where your thoughts cannot overpower you.

01:22:56.209 --> 01:23:00.042
Thoughts come from the future or from the past

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:03.334
and we are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.

01:23:10.501 --> 01:23:16.542
But with this happening we enter into our present.

01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:24.999
In between these thoughts there is a space

01:23:25.209 --> 01:23:27.667
where there is peace

01:23:27.918 --> 01:23:30.834
and we enter into our peace.

01:23:39.584 --> 01:23:44.000
This state, in this state you become

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:47.292
thoughtlessly aware.

01:23:56.042 --> 01:24:02.542
When you start growing in your spiritual being

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:07.918
then the second thing that happens to you

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:12.334
is that you become

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:19.167
one with reality.

01:24:26.999 --> 01:24:30.626
All kinds of falsehood start dropping out.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.250
And you know that you have become a saint.

01:24:39.584 --> 01:24:43.876
And you become extremely confident with your knowledge.

01:24:51.626 --> 01:24:54.834
The Spirit is the source of joy.

01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:02.501
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

01:25:06.959 --> 01:25:10.167
Joy has no duality.

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:16.834
It does not have happiness and unhappiness.

01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:22.167
It is absolute.

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:27.000
All this is your own.

01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:32.125
You have to just get it.

01:25:35.501 --> 01:25:38.125
It’s a very easy thing,

01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:42.042
it’s very spontaneous, it’s a living process.

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:51.167
For this process you don’t have to pay.

01:25:54.834 --> 01:25:57.834
You don’t have to put in any efforts.

01:26:00.292 --> 01:26:02.375
It’s spontaneous.

01:26:04.584 --> 01:26:07.584
It spontaneously sprouts.

01:26:10.417 --> 01:26:14.959
You have to only look after it like a gardener.

01:26:22.292 --> 01:26:26.834
Whatever I am telling you is not a sermon or a lecture,

01:26:32.417 --> 01:26:35.792
it’s the actualization of the experience.

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:45.375
And actualization of your baptism.

01:26:48.834 --> 01:26:52.042
Because you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost

01:26:52.250 --> 01:26:54.501
coming out of your head.

01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:04.334
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

01:27:08.501 --> 01:27:12.501
And Kundalini is the Primordial Mother.

01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:21.209
This is what is reflected in you

01:27:21.417 --> 01:27:24.459
as your own individual mother.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:32.209
And she gives you your second birth.

01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.709
Christ has said,

01:27:38.918 --> 01:27:42.959
“The humble in heart will inherit the Earth.”

01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:54.959
So one has to be humble.

01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:02.999
If you are arrogant about it, your own Kundalini won’t rise.

01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:14.209
Moreover

01:28:15.459 --> 01:28:19.667
this Kundalini knows all about you.

01:28:23.876 --> 01:28:26.876
She does not give you any trouble.

01:28:29.459 --> 01:28:34.667
And just spontaneously She manages to connect you

01:28:34.876 --> 01:28:37.999
to that All-pervading Divine Power.

01:28:44.834 --> 01:28:49.292
And for the first time you start feeling on your fingertips

01:28:50.375 --> 01:28:54.375
this All-pervading Power as cool breeze.

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:06.709
I respect your freedom,

01:29:06.918 --> 01:29:12.292
and your Self Realization cannot be forced on you.

01:29:18.834 --> 01:29:24.792
Those who really want it, in a humble way, can have it.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.125
Those who do not want

01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:38.125
are not forced – cannot be forced.

01:29:42.334 --> 01:29:45.459
All such people should please leave the hall.

01:29:50.751 --> 01:29:55.792
It will take about 10 or 15 minutes to get your Realization.

01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:04.626
In this short time you should appreciate I cannot tell you

01:30:04.834 --> 01:30:07.959
everything about this vast knowledge,

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:16.417
but if you get your enlightenment

01:30:16.626 --> 01:30:19.792
you’ll understand this subtle knowledge very easily.

01:30:30.876 --> 01:30:34.834
So, those who do not want can leave the hall.

01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:42.250
It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes.

01:30:45.999 --> 01:30:49.167
The lights are very dim, I can’t see the people.

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:06.250
I know, some of you have questions –

01:31:07.209 --> 01:31:11.042
but just now keep them away from yourself.

01:31:17.626 --> 01:31:19.918
And you can write them down

01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:23.083
and we’ll try to answer them later on.

01:31:32.542 --> 01:31:34.751
Can’t see them.

01:31:42.834 --> 01:31:44.876
It's good.

01:32:00.042 --> 01:32:04.751
There are three conditions which are very simple.

01:32:09.375 --> 01:32:13.042
The first condition is that

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.375
you all have to have  full confidence

01:32:16.584 --> 01:32:21.000
that you will all get your Self Realization tonight.

01:32:33.792 --> 01:32:37.959
Second is you are not to feel guilty

01:32:38.125 --> 01:32:41.292
about anything whatsoever.

01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:53.250
This idea of sin – please take it out of your mind.

01:32:58.209 --> 01:33:00.209
This gives you a guilt,

01:33:00.417 --> 01:33:03.584
which makes your left Vishuddhi here – this chakra –

01:33:03.834 --> 01:33:06.375
very weak.

01:33:15.999 --> 01:33:20.918
And this causes a disease called angina,

01:33:21.083 --> 01:33:25.999
spondylitis and the lethargy of the organs.

01:33:35.334 --> 01:33:40.334
If you have done mistakes, it’s all right.

01:33:40.584 --> 01:33:43.918
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:54.417
And if you have done mistakes you should face them,

01:33:54.626 --> 01:33:58.959
instead of putting them as guilt here and torture yourself.

01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:07.751
In short, forgive yourself

01:34:07.959 --> 01:34:12.250
and be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

01:34:17.667 --> 01:34:23.334
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:34:29.918 --> 01:34:35.334
This Divine Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:34:42.292 --> 01:34:44.959
And you cannot commit any mistake

01:34:45.125 --> 01:34:50.250
that cannot be dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:04.292
The third condition is also very simple.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.959
Third ccondition is that you have to forgive everyone.

01:35:19.918 --> 01:35:23.209
You have to forgive in general, you don’t have to think

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.999
about each one of them.

01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:32.501
Logically,

01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:36.751
whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

01:35:42.042 --> 01:35:46.626
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:35:50.918 --> 01:35:55.918
Those who have tortured you, or troubled you are happy

01:35:56.083 --> 01:36:00.584
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:15.501
So, what’s the use of not forgiving?

01:36:20.292 --> 01:36:26.292
Moreover, the chakra which we call as the Agnya chakra,

01:36:26.751 --> 01:36:30.042
in the optic chiasma,

01:36:30.334 --> 01:36:33.834
it's closed like this, constricted like this.

01:36:40.584 --> 01:36:44.375
It won’t open unless and until you forgive.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000
But once you forgive it opens like this.

01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:57.792
You have to just say, “I forgive everyone of them.”

01:36:57.999 --> 01:37:01.250
Don’t even think of them, because it’s a headache.

01:37:09.334 --> 01:37:11.918
These are the only three conditions.

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:18.542
If you really accept them, it will work out very fast.

01:37:21.959 --> 01:37:24.999
You have to cooperate with Me.

01:37:29.501 --> 01:37:31.876
Now

01:37:32.459 --> 01:37:35.999
we have to take out our shoes. That will help us a lot,

01:37:36.167 --> 01:37:41.083
because this Mother Earth sucks in our problems.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.959
Now, they have already told you about the left and right side.

01:38:17.584 --> 01:38:19.417
And

01:38:19.626 --> 01:38:22.626
as they are two powers, we have to put both the feet

01:38:22.834 --> 01:38:25.209
little away from each other.

01:38:33.999 --> 01:38:38.751
You don’t have to stay in yourself, you have to be comfortable

01:38:38.999 --> 01:38:41.667
only thing, don’t bend yourself too much

01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:44.792
or don’t stretch yourself too much till I tell you.

01:38:50.834 --> 01:38:52.999
You have to be very comfortable.

01:38:55.959 --> 01:38:58.584
You don’t have to go to Himalayas for that.

01:39:02.167 --> 01:39:04.459
And you don’t have to suffer.

01:39:06.501 --> 01:39:08.709
Christ has suffered for us already.

01:39:14.834 --> 01:39:17.125
Just have faith in yourself.

01:39:19.876 --> 01:39:23.751
Don’t be doubts about yourself.

01:39:28.167 --> 01:39:33.250
I assure you, you all can get your Self Realization tonight.

01:39:41.125 --> 01:39:45.876
So, now we’ll show you how we’ll nourish

01:39:46.042 --> 01:39:49.375
our own centers, you will nourish your own centers.

01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:59.209
Please put your left hand towards Me like this.

01:40:03.501 --> 01:40:09.626
This is symbolic that you want your Self Realization,

01:40:09.959 --> 01:40:14.999
because left side is the power of ordinary desire.

01:40:24.792 --> 01:40:26.792
All of you have to do it.

01:40:26.999 --> 01:40:30.167
Those who don’t want to do should go away.

01:40:38.501 --> 01:40:42.792
Then we have the second power,

01:40:42.999 --> 01:40:45.626
the power of action on the right hand side,

01:40:45.834 --> 01:40:49.083
with which we’ll be nourishing our centers.

01:40:59.167 --> 01:41:02.751
Third is the power of Kundalini

01:41:02.959 --> 01:41:06.459
which is the power of pure desire.

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:17.375
So, all of you should have pure desire in your heart

01:41:17.584 --> 01:41:22.584
that you should all get your Self Realization.

01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:32.751
So, just put your left hand towards Me like this,

01:41:32.959 --> 01:41:40.000
very comfortably on your lap or on your legs,

01:41:48.501 --> 01:41:51.375
resting like this.

01:41:52.959 --> 01:41:55.417
Now, with the right hand we’ll be nourishing

01:41:55.626 --> 01:41:58.375
our centers on the left hand side.

01:42:02.876 --> 01:42:07.959
First we do it, we’ll show you and then we'll close our eyes

01:42:08.125 --> 01:42:10.375
and the process will start.

01:42:16.876 --> 01:42:19.999
Please put your right hand on your heart.

01:42:23.959 --> 01:42:29.792
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

01:42:36.125 --> 01:42:40.083
If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit,

01:42:40.292 --> 01:42:43.375
you become your guide, your master.

01:42:50.334 --> 01:42:54.667
Then you put your hand... Please come. put your hand

01:42:54.834 --> 01:42:59.751
on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:43:05.876 --> 01:43:09.667
This is the center of your mastery.

01:43:15.167 --> 01:43:18.709
This is being created by great prophets.

01:43:22.999 --> 01:43:25.501
We have to just enlighten it.

01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:30.876
Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion

01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:34.125
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:39.375
Lower, lower, lower here.

01:43:43.501 --> 01:43:46.167
This is the center

01:43:46.375 --> 01:43:51.125
for pure divine knowledge.

01:43:57.959 --> 01:44:02.083
Again we raise our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:44:08.501 --> 01:44:12.125
Then we raise our right hand on our heart.

01:44:16.999 --> 01:44:19.209
Now we raise our right hand

01:44:19.417 --> 01:44:21.542
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

01:44:21.751 --> 01:44:23.792
and turn our head to our right.

01:44:29.751 --> 01:44:31.999
This is the center as I told you –

01:44:34.999 --> 01:44:38.292
I told you this center

01:44:38.501 --> 01:44:41.751
gets in trouble when you feel guilty.

01:44:48.584 --> 01:44:52.375
Now, please take your right hand

01:44:52.584 --> 01:44:56.834
on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

01:45:03.709 --> 01:45:08.584
This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness

01:45:09.999 --> 01:45:13.000
no, no, you have to forgive others, I am sorry.

01:45:13.459 --> 01:45:16.792
This is the center where you have to forgive others.

01:45:20.083 --> 01:45:23.334
Now please take your right hand back side of your head

01:45:23.542 --> 01:45:25.709
and push back your head.

01:45:30.292 --> 01:45:36.125
Here. Here, without feeling guilty,

01:45:36.334 --> 01:45:40.626
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:43.125
you have to ask forgiveness

01:45:43.334 --> 01:45:46.459
from the All-pervading Divine Power.

01:45:59.250 --> 01:46:03.209
Now, the last center which is very important.

01:46:06.125 --> 01:46:09.667
Please stretch your palm

01:46:13.042 --> 01:46:15.501
and put the center of your palm

01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:19.626
on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:46:19.834 --> 01:46:22.292
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.584
Now, very important is to push back your fingers,

01:46:32.792 --> 01:46:34.042
there is a good pressure,

01:46:34.250 --> 01:46:36.751
there should be a good pressure on your scalp.

01:46:43.292 --> 01:46:45.834
Now, please put down your head.

01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:57.709
Here now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

01:47:11.918 --> 01:47:13.999
That’s all we have to do.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.209
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:47:39.042 --> 01:47:42.584
And till I tell you please don’t open your eyes.

01:47:47.459 --> 01:47:49.459
Just turn it towards Me.

01:47:50.459 --> 01:47:53.375
Both the feet away from each other.

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:06.125
Now please take out your spectacles.

01:48:11.626 --> 01:48:13.501
No, it doesn't work out here.

01:48:18.584 --> 01:48:21.334
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:48:25.918 --> 01:48:27.959
Now it's better.

01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:33.000
Put it on here. Much better.

01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:37.375
It’s terrible, such heat I’m absorbing from all of them.

01:48:37.918 --> 01:48:41.501
Terrible heat they have. All right, doesn’t matter.

01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:44.834
Please put your right hand on your heart.

01:48:51.876 --> 01:48:56.083
Here now you have to ask Me a very fundamental question

01:49:02.125 --> 01:49:04.375
three times,

01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:11.375
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:49:14.999 --> 01:49:20.999
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.626
It's better now. Little bit [strike] it more.

01:49:44.334 --> 01:49:47.083
I have already told you

01:49:47.292 --> 01:49:51.459
that if you become the Spirit

01:49:52.209 --> 01:49:58.209
you become your own master.

01:50:06.209 --> 01:50:08.584
So, now please take your hand

01:50:08.792 --> 01:50:12.626
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:50:19.876 --> 01:50:26.209
Here, here you have to say again another question.

01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:35.918
Three times please ask,

01:50:36.083 --> 01:50:40.083
“Mother am I my own master?”

01:51:09.959 --> 01:51:13.626
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom.

01:51:17.584 --> 01:51:22.250
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:51:26.334 --> 01:51:28.918
You have to ask for it.

01:51:30.999 --> 01:51:35.959
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

01:51:36.375 --> 01:51:39.501
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:51:45.876 --> 01:51:49.459
Here you have to ask six times,

01:51:49.667 --> 01:51:53.292
because this center has got six petals.

01:52:01.375 --> 01:52:04.876
Please say, “Mother,

01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:08.999
give me pure knowledge.

01:52:09.167 --> 01:52:13.042
Please Mother, give me pure knowledge.” Six times.

01:52:30.209 --> 01:52:33.918
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

01:52:34.083 --> 01:52:38.042
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:52:45.542 --> 01:52:51.542
So now, we have to nourish our higher centers

01:52:52.083 --> 01:52:55.792
so that Kundalini can pass easily through them.

01:53:02.292 --> 01:53:06.167
It has to be nourished with our self confidence.

01:53:09.959 --> 01:53:12.334
So, now please take your right hand

01:53:12.542 --> 01:53:15.334
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:53:20.584 --> 01:53:26.834
And here you have to say with full confidence

01:53:27.042 --> 01:53:32.125
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:53:32.334 --> 01:53:34.334
Please say it ten times.

01:53:55.626 --> 01:53:58.709
I’ve already told you that you are not this body,

01:53:58.918 --> 01:54:02.626
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

01:54:02.876 --> 01:54:06.125
but you are pure Spirit.

01:54:16.209 --> 01:54:20.292
So, now please raise your right hand on your heart.

01:54:24.417 --> 01:54:27.999
And here

01:54:28.375 --> 01:54:32.417
with full confidence say twelve times,

01:54:32.751 --> 01:54:38.042
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

01:54:57.751 --> 01:55:02.417
The All-pervading Divine Power is the Ocean

01:55:02.626 --> 01:55:06.209
of divine knowledge.

01:55:14.083 --> 01:55:18.042
It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss.

01:55:21.999 --> 01:55:25.501
But above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:55:28.626 --> 01:55:31.292
So whatever mistake you have committed

01:55:31.501 --> 01:55:35.709
can be easily dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:55:44.584 --> 01:55:48.250
So, now please raise your hand

01:55:48.584 --> 01:55:56.334
on to the corner of, between your neck and your shoulder,

01:55:56.542 --> 01:55:59.417
and turn your head to your right.

01:56:06.250 --> 01:56:12.918
Here now with full confidence, please say 16 times,

01:56:13.083 --> 01:56:16.209
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all.”

01:56:23.918 --> 01:56:26.918
Please turn your head to your right.

01:56:38.209 --> 01:56:40.792
I have already told you whether you forgive

01:56:40.999 --> 01:56:43.999
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

01:56:49.876 --> 01:56:54.334
But you torture yourself and play into wrong hands.

01:56:58.999 --> 01:57:01.999
So,

01:57:07.876 --> 01:57:11.459
please take your right hand on top of your forehead

01:57:11.667 --> 01:57:14.542
and put down your head.

01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:25.626
Here you have to forgive everyone in general,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.918
not how many times, but from your heart.

01:57:37.167 --> 01:57:39.876
If you do not forgive

01:57:40.042 --> 01:57:44.292
then you will also miss your Self Realization,

01:57:44.501 --> 01:57:47.459
because Kundalini cannot pass

01:57:47.667 --> 01:57:50.584
through the constricted Agnya chakra.

01:58:11.375 --> 01:58:15.709
Now, please take back your hand, on the back side of your head,

01:58:15.918 --> 01:58:21.667
and put it up as far as possible.

01:58:30.999 --> 01:58:34.250
Here without feeling guilty,

01:58:36.751 --> 01:58:39.751
without counting your mistakes,

01:58:41.292 --> 01:58:45.792
for your satisfaction you have to say,

01:58:46.334 --> 01:58:48.375
“Oh Divine Power,

01:58:48.584 --> 01:58:53.083
please forgive me, if I have done any mistakes.”

01:59:14.375 --> 01:59:19.125
Now,  this has to be said from your heart,

01:59:19.334 --> 01:59:21.501
not how many times.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.959
Now, please stretch your palm fully.

01:59:51.792 --> 01:59:54.375
And put the center of your palm

01:59:54.584 --> 01:59:58.626
on top of the fontanel bone area.

02:00:03.542 --> 02:00:07.083
Push back your fingers. Why are you not doing, madam?

02:00:09.167 --> 02:00:12.167
Why is she not doing it? This lady.

02:00:16.334 --> 02:00:19.125
She wants to listen only. She only wants to listen.

02:00:19.334 --> 02:00:21.667
Then let her go away. She should go.

02:00:21.876 --> 02:00:25.501
She should not try to be arrogant like that, not proper.

02:00:41.542 --> 02:00:46.792
All right. Now put your right hand on your fontanel bone area

02:00:51.542 --> 02:00:54.292
and please put down your head.

02:00:58.209 --> 02:01:02.792
Here now, you have to move your scalp

02:01:03.792 --> 02:01:07.375
seven times, clockwise.

02:01:09.042 --> 02:01:11.417
But here again

02:01:11.626 --> 02:01:17.667
I cannot force Self Realization on you.

02:01:28.667 --> 02:01:32.334
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

02:01:35.584 --> 02:01:41.375
So while moving your scalp seven times you should just say,

02:01:41.584 --> 02:01:45.000
“Mother, please give me my Self Realization.”

02:02:01.334 --> 02:02:04.834
Seven times, please.

02:02:11.167 --> 02:02:13.959
Litlle like that. Yes.

02:02:54.751 --> 02:02:57.459
Now please take down your hands.

02:03:09.125 --> 02:03:11.876
Put both the hands like this towards Me.

02:03:13.959 --> 02:03:16.876
Open your eyes.

02:03:18.751 --> 02:03:24.000
Watch Me. Watch Me without thinking, you can do it.

02:03:31.375 --> 02:03:34.542
Now please put right hand towards Me.

02:03:36.999 --> 02:03:40.501
And put down your head and see with your left hand

02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:45.751
if there is a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

02:03:55.542 --> 02:03:58.501
You shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head,

02:04:01.999 --> 02:04:04.999
but away from it.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.999
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

02:04:16.834 --> 02:04:19.417
And now bend your head and see with your right hand

02:04:19.626 --> 02:04:22.083
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

02:04:22.292 --> 02:04:25.626
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

02:04:36.417 --> 02:04:40.167
Now please put your right hand towards Me again

02:04:40.375 --> 02:04:43.000
and with the left hand you can see it again.

02:05:02.083 --> 02:05:06.417
Now raise both your hands towards the sky

02:05:10.125 --> 02:05:12.751
and ask a question

02:05:12.959 --> 02:05:16.709
one of these three questions, anyone of them, three times.

02:05:20.959 --> 02:05:24.292
Push back your head and ask the question,

02:05:24.542 --> 02:05:27.667
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

02:05:34.459 --> 02:05:37.334
Or ask the question three times,

02:05:37.542 --> 02:05:42.167
“Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?”

02:05:48.375 --> 02:05:50.999
Or ask the question three times,

02:05:51.167 --> 02:05:53.751
“Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

02:06:00.167 --> 02:06:02.459
Please take down your hands.

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.584
It’s hot.

02:06:07.501 --> 02:06:13.459
All those who have felt cool breeze

02:06:14.417 --> 02:06:19.626
or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area

02:06:19.918 --> 02:06:24.501
or on their fingertips or on their palms

02:06:24.999 --> 02:06:27.999
please raise both your hands.

02:06:41.375 --> 02:06:43.999
The whole of Austria.

02:06:44.167 --> 02:06:47.709
May God bless you all! May God bless you! May God bless you!

02:06:52.667 --> 02:06:54.918
Vienna!

02:06:55.375 --> 02:07:00.334
I bow to you all. You have now started your saintly life.

02:07:05.751 --> 02:07:09.792
Now respect, respect your Self Realization.

02:07:14.125 --> 02:07:18.209
Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

02:07:23.125 --> 02:07:26.000
You cannot do it individually.

02:07:28.042 --> 02:07:30.626
Of course, at home you can meditate,

02:07:30.834 --> 02:07:34.375
but you have to come to collective to grow.

02:07:40.292 --> 02:07:43.334
Like this finger, if it is sick,

02:07:43.542 --> 02:07:47.459
the whole body runs for the help of this.

02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:52.999
In the same way now you have become the whole.

02:08:00.999 --> 02:08:05.167
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

02:08:09.999 --> 02:08:15.417
You’ll have so many blessings and so many miracles

02:08:15.751 --> 02:08:18.876
that you may not believe them even.

02:08:26.959 --> 02:08:33.292
And you’ll be amazed how fantastically you are so glorious.

02:08:40.417 --> 02:08:44.417
But you must learn how to use this power.

02:08:48.959 --> 02:08:52.999
You’ll hardly take a month to master it.

02:08:58.584 --> 02:09:01.876
You don’t have to pay for this at all.

02:09:05.167 --> 02:09:08.959
No one is going to pay for it,

02:09:09.918 --> 02:09:13.375
only thing you have to give little time

02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:16.417
for your Self Realization.

02:09:24.876 --> 02:09:29.876
May God bless you all!
