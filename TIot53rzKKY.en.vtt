00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.350
I told him yesterday to work, but once
you are engaged, you are still working.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.970
Those who were on Satya
Guna were, in fact, very few.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.820
moved towards Tamo Guna,
because we now have become

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:30.236
developing, so now Rajo qualities
have arrived. When we have

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.709
reached Rajo Guna then Houses
have to be built, big palaces have

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:43.290
to be built, factories have to
be opened, a lot of plastic should

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.870
be brought into the country, now we
are eating food in plates, then in plastic.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.409
Will eat, later will eat in the paper,
it's our development, that we are doing.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.470
At this time man becomes
extremist. If one starts doing too

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.420
much work then the balance within him gets
disturbed., the balance gets disturbed,

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:14.336
it has a strange arrangement

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:22.183
in its Kundalini Yoga. The Swadhishthan Chakra
is intact in Kundalini, which is formed in the

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:30.216
is on the way, the
Chakra of which

00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:38.199
Kundalini passes through the
chakra due to which the entire

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.933
universe was created. The
chakra due to which all the planets,

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:49.793
spheres and stars of the sky
came into this world, the place of

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:57.673
that chakra is within us, in the stomach. This chakra
emerges from the navel chakra and surrounds it. ,

00:01:57.707 --> 00:01:58.957
around it.

00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:08.190
It moves in every angle, it
can also move forward and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.188
backward; just like the
stem of a lotus, it is flexible

00:02:16.238 --> 00:02:20.938
like that, on top of that, there
is the place of Shri Brahmadev

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.950
and his wife or his wife, you
should not say wife because

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.930
its saying that she was a virgin; his companion,
that Saraswati ji, or may be called His

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.864
power, that is Saraswati

00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:46.898
This chakra we can see, in
human being, even from outside.

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:53.475
we cannot see it with bare

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:59.742
but its root form,
its gross form

00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:07.380
is what doctors call aotic plexus. This Chakra
also has six petals, similarly the aotic

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.075
plexus also has six sub-plexuses.
But doctors will not agree to it.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:21.013
when I will say that this chakra, the main
function is to convert the fat in the stomach,

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:28.046
the fat that is there,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.096
Means what you call your brain

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:40.196
Or what you call brain, it is said
that it replaces the cells of that brain,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.900
by transforming the fat there

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.940
by evolution to enable it to
become one's own brain cell.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.318
When we think too much, we
do planning when we think a lot,

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:11.340
when we use Rajoguna, then this
work happens very fast, hence the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.240
speed increases; all the time people
keep thinking and then we can't stop

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.240
thinking all the time. We get entangled
in thoughts, we can not stop our thoughts

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.760
even for a minute. We go on loading
thousands of different thoughts, we keep

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.780
imposing one on over the other
and plan, these tasks remain endless.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.504
It keeps happening but when its
speed becomes very high, if it increases

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:45.513
excessively, then the other functions
of this cycle which are That we can say

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:53.563
that our liver, our spleen, our pancreas, our
kidney, our heart all these are cared by this Chakra

00:04:53.829 --> 00:05:01.820
then this function gets reduced. And
sometimes there are blockades too,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.200
because again gets engaged
in the same work. So the people

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.955
who do a lot of brain work, they
are the ones who get diabetes,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:22.680
They are the ones who get heart attack because
as right side is in much use, the left side

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.940
side that is there, tries to balance it ;
When a man works too much, it's surprising

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.600
that if you are exerting physically,
if you are doing physical labor

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.700
then your heart must not catch because
heart is emotional issue. The heart is an

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:47.101
emotional functionary, but for
balancing the heart occurs. And your body

00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:55.093
signals you to look out, son, work
slowly and then lie down on the bed.

00:05:55.143 --> 00:06:02.860
It is due to this imbalance that
the signal from the heart is given

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.920
and due to this imbalance diabetes occurs because
your Pancreas, that is there, its fuction ceases.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.180
Kidneys stop working The functioning
of the kidneys stops, the utrus

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.213
is so much affected that such women
can't bear children, become infertile.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.695
All this happens due to
imbalance and medical science has

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:34.410
nothing to say about this imbalance. We have
cured diabetes thousand times in Sahaj yoga.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.536
Although we will not fix it, The reason is that
you may not collect all the diabetics here.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.410
But those Sahaja Yogis who transcend,
their diabetes gets cured. May take it

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:53.390
like this is a by poduct. Due to
diabetes human eyes go weak, you know!

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.323
Sometimes he goes completely
blind, can't even see. Diabetes can

00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:06.130
cause many other diseases as from inside the
human goes weak. Urea level in kedney rises

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:14.101
and all the similar

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:22.120
left sided diseases are due to
the excesses of the the right side.

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:29.700
And then thinking also becomes
such that when a person thinks too much

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.480
a kind of momentum gets
set in his bain, means he then.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:41.060
can't stop it and he goes
thinking so wildly continuously.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:48.520
There are so many people like this in the West.
So where Rajogun has reached to such extremes,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:56.400
Where the Rajogun has reached its
last extreme, there people have resorted to

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:04.390
drugs; Otherwise also,
Rajoguni drinks alcohol and now

00:08:04.422 --> 00:08:12.406
Rajoguni drink alcohol because to them it seems
that this brings some balanced, an escape.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.160
To avoid excessive
brain activity, people drink

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.360
alcohol to escape it, but that is not the
cure. Then you come in Tamo Guna and from

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.620
this extreme you reach the second
extreme. Then from same extreme you then

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.919
go to the other extreme you
keep swinging like a pendulum.

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:38.580
If you take one extreme then you
reach another extreme; So when you

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:45.800
go crazy to do extreme
work. In those countries

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.556
where there lot of planning has
been done, where Rajogun has peaked,

00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:59.160
now there among young boys,
children under 30 years of age

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:06.080
or people under 35 years
of age, you will find two or

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.130
three in a hundred who
have not yet tasted drugs.

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:16.430
Think about it! Imagine how far it has
gone there and at least 30% people, there

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:24.455
start taking drugs regularly. There people
above the age of 13 start taking drugs.

00:09:26.555 --> 00:09:34.525
This way escape
Started; it's natural.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:40.720
Because when you get so upset that
you can't live with your thoughts then

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.873
you will run away from yourself somewhere, you
can not see yourself. You can't face youself.

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:54.890
Then more things
get added to this,

00:09:54.916 --> 00:10:01.450
After the issues of sex etc. are
also its balance. On any extreme

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:07.650
that you go, its extreme
come alive and it pulls you

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:13.950
so badly that then it goes to the extreme,
then it pulls you to the other side and in this

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:21.330
disarray, in running around the man collapses,
ends up. occurs, man dies and that is why there is

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:28.230
And for this so many suicides are
there and people don't understand

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:36.016
that where so much affluence is there, where so much
power has come, why are people dying? Their childeren

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:43.050
leave their parents at an
early age, old people are lying

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:48.790
in orphanages, small children are
orphans. Each person marrying ten

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.510
times. In that too so much distortion. I told
you yesterday how distorted they have become,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:01.510
i.e. their deformity has occurred to such
an extent. Now we are coming to Rajogun.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.976
Aliright!

00:11:05.026 --> 00:11:10.950
But we will have to set norms, therefore,
to lay our norms, Maryada Purushottam

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:18.470
Shri Ram was established
above Rajoguna

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:26.459
that you will have to follow your rules. Whole
of our lives are bound to the norms, but when

00:11:26.843 --> 00:11:34.826
when Rajogun becomes stronger,
then the norms get violated, breaks badly.

00:11:34.876 --> 00:11:41.942
now that you are developing countries, then,
when you started developing out of proportion

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:49.664
So you said sir we are eradicating
poverty, that we are developing. But if

00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:54.163
you give even one rupee more to your
servant, and if he starts smoking and

00:11:54.188 --> 00:12:00.479
drinking alcohol, then he is not poor; It's
over, it's over, his poverty ends there.

00:12:04.413 --> 00:12:05.996
when a person gets into any addiction,

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:12.211
then it must be taken that
now he is no more poorer.

00:12:12.245 --> 00:12:18.909
he will become adicted only
when he has some extra money.

00:12:18.942 --> 00:12:24.676
it does not mean that if someone
I am not saying it should be kept anywhere.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:29.705
This means that unless
in the human being

00:12:29.729 --> 00:12:34.725
any such event doesn't occurs

00:12:34.758 --> 00:12:42.108
due to which whatever material development
is there, or root development,

00:12:42.174 --> 00:12:50.140
that should impact his humanity.

00:12:50.165 --> 00:12:58.035
Means that if the person is
wealthy, becomes vey rich,

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:01.369
it is not necessary that

00:13:01.402 --> 00:13:06.154
he is a very respectable one; may be
there is none other more wicked then him.

00:13:06.204 --> 00:13:14.187
If there is a great learned and scholar,
it is not necessary that such person

00:13:14.237 --> 00:13:19.370
becomes a very religious person,
of course it is not necessary,

00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:24.520
there will be none uglier than him.

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:30.110
We hear that those mafia people,
their sons have done MA from Oxford

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:36.619
University, Cambridge University and
John Hopkins universities everywhere.

00:13:36.669 --> 00:13:38.678
And what kind of business
do they do these days?

00:13:38.702 --> 00:13:41.619
Sons of Mafia leader
are doing muder killings.

00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:45.144
So we must follow that path which connects

00:13:45.177 --> 00:13:50.977
man with the centre point of humanity, the
soul.

00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:55.194
If he is not connected to that center,

00:13:55.227 --> 00:13:58.090
whatever
his development you may do is immaterial.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.409
we will tell you with an example;
Here in our Shipping Corporation,

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.559
the salaries of all the
drivers were increased,

00:14:07.592 --> 00:14:12.158
each one of them started getting
salary of thousand rupees. After few days

00:14:12.192 --> 00:14:15.990
all their wives came and asked,
Mother, why did Sir increase everyone's

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:20.790
salary. I said why? They said earlier
we used to earn four hundred rupees and

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:26.310
were happy, now everyone is drinking
alcohol. These people have kept women, and

00:14:26.335 --> 00:14:30.989
now live in 'Gutte', They don't come home
at all, everyone just (unintelligible).

00:14:31.014 --> 00:14:35.247
Earlier they were better, they
were able to balance till four hunded,

00:14:35.314 --> 00:14:39.721
and after that a little more money
became available, started drinking alcohol.

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:43.386
This does not mean at all that They should
be given only four hundred rupees only,

00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:51.410
and they should be given balance, by which
he can care Lakshmi, else richer

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:57.117
will become demons,
and not be 'Lakshmi Pati'.

00:14:57.142 --> 00:15:05.098
Its connection must be established with the
soul within us which flourishes humanity.

00:15:05.148 --> 00:15:12.432
Until this connection is there your
entire education is completely useless.

00:15:12.481 --> 00:15:20.459
That is why Surdas ji also said, Nandlal,
remove all the ignoance of Surdas.

00:15:20.516 --> 00:15:25.516
Even after completing all the education,
until you have gained the light of your

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:30.732
soul, then your education also becomes
useless. It doesn't seem to make any sense.

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:36.213
therefore it is extremely necessary
that you reach to your self element.

00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:43.340
Then you will understand the meaning of all
things that these seven chakras,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:50.824
inside you, are the many parts of humanity,
which are when integerated get fulfilled by

00:15:50.857 --> 00:15:58.190
the Kundalini from within, that is why
they Makes everyone whole, integrates.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.027
by Kundalini, passes through all
this, moving on all these elements, it

00:16:04.027 --> 00:16:09.560
reaches through your soul elements,
and then the light of the soul that passes

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:17.607
through these chakras and man understands,
which thing is right and which is wrong.

00:16:17.607 --> 00:16:23.647
Because if you want to do something wrong,
that you cannot do, difficulty may arise.

00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:29.680
The reason for it is that a new
consciousness comes inside you that is

00:16:29.713 --> 00:16:33.205
called vibratory awareness. Which is called
consciousness (vague), may call awaeness.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:38.272
now we can say that which you
call it enlightened consciousness,

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:44.293
in the light of that consciousness you can
understand wheather it is good or bad. If

00:16:44.326 --> 00:16:49.593
you did something bad, your vibrations will
stop immediately, if you ask the vibrations

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:55.993
whether so and so man is a gentleman
or a scoundrel, if your vibrations stop,

00:16:56.026 --> 00:17:00.559
understand that he is a very evil man.

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:03.942
Because of these vibrations you will be
able to understand if God exists or not.

00:17:03.978 --> 00:17:10.161
And for your basic questions, your absolute
queries, you will get the answer to them

00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:18.142
from these waves of consciousness. It is
found whether something is true or false,

00:17:18.167 --> 00:17:24.842
It is very difficult to know this in
this 'Kalyug'. The reason is that

00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:29.862
because of this confusion,
for these disturbances we have

00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:35.773
become
absolutely ignorant of any sensitivity.

00:17:35.823 --> 00:17:40.987
And if at this moment this sesitivity,
thats subtle, and is super subtle

00:17:40.987 --> 00:17:46.520
sensitivity when gets developed inside
us, then you must test it. If somebody

00:17:46.586 --> 00:17:51.320
wishes that Mata ji," Why it doesn't
happen with in us by just little effort."

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.646
So, to say, yes! we do
will connect you, but your

00:17:56.679 --> 00:18:02.845
connection is loose there, set it up
properly, we will put it subtlety. If you

00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:07.762
have respect for yourself, if
you take this as a special thing,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:15.595
then you must try, if you are
not aware of self, and you do not

00:18:15.633 --> 00:18:19.928
understand any meaning of your life,
and you have wasted your life till now and

00:18:19.953 --> 00:18:25.978
you want to waste it in future too, then
Sahaja Yoga is absolutely useless for you.

00:18:26.003 --> 00:18:30.993
You will come here and will tanscend
but you can not reach its depth,

00:18:31.048 --> 00:18:35.093
you need to sit in its meetings.

00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:40.881
If you intend to see the real meaning
of your life in it, then you should

00:18:40.947 --> 00:18:44.083
hold on all your 'Sutras'
properly, individually,

00:18:44.147 --> 00:18:48.523
and in that it should be selfless,
else your coming and going is a waste.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:53.923
As if someone held a sitar
in his hand and If you strum it,

00:18:53.923 --> 00:18:57.596
then isn't it the sitar
becomes selfless? (indistinct)?

00:18:57.629 --> 00:19:04.394
But man is not conscious about his life
in Kaliyuga. he has no respect for himself,

00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:09.603
he has no self respect.
He can't do it, he has no love for himself

00:19:09.636 --> 00:19:11.345
He doesn't have self-respect,

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:16.383
that's why he is going on
wasting every moment of his life.

00:19:16.383 --> 00:19:21.545
If he becomes aware within himself
and thinks where am I wasting my life,

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:26.153
where am I spoiling my
life, then he will understand

00:19:26.178 --> 00:19:30.977
that this moment has also been wasted,
that too. That moment too got wasted,

00:19:31.028 --> 00:19:36.886
may there be a moment where
there is a display of some living power,

00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:44.905
or the power that is alive
is revealed from within us,

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:48.304
Its to find the meaning of the self,

00:19:48.338 --> 00:19:52.955
that's selfishness, everything else is a
play of Maya. Man thinks that there will be

00:19:53.005 --> 00:19:59.627
selfishness in it, there is selfishness
in this, there is selfishness in that, but

00:19:59.652 --> 00:20:03.735
if he had got it, it would have stuck
somewhere. Selfishness cannot be found

00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:10.913
anywhere, selfishness can be achieved only
by understanding the meaning of 'self'.

00:20:10.913 --> 00:20:18.625
And so, its not only the meaning of
'self', unity in it need happen; This only

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.173
in medical terminology, we would call
control on parasympathetic nervous system.

00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:24.239
Now the Doctors will say,
how can this be possible?

00:20:24.273 --> 00:20:26.289
Yes, It can't be done by
these people, by doctorin.

00:20:26.323 --> 00:20:30.113
Can't be done by any scholar It can't
be done by any reading or writing;

00:20:30.113 --> 00:20:34.213
neither by yoga, nor by Sankhya, nor
by anything, it can't be done, it can't.

00:20:34.213 --> 00:20:41.390
Its already said, since how many
years its said, thousands of years before

00:20:41.424 --> 00:20:47.757
it was said that it can't be done by any
one. It needs blessings of Mother. Alright!

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:57.488
All of you who come
here, people will get it.

00:20:57.538 --> 00:21:03.773
But I would say that everyone
will not get it; A sir came yesterday,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.690
He did not get it, he was much furious on
me. They went outside and created a scene,

00:21:08.723 --> 00:21:11.523
started shouting that all this a
false propaganda is going on

00:21:11.556 --> 00:21:14.006
and it is like this and like
that. He created a geat havock.

00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:15.505
He created a great havock.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.950
When he came, I called him to me first.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.180
I said son! you come here. One thing
is that he has some dirty disease inside,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.750
and there was also possession of
ghost inside him,

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.430
So, first I called him and asked,"
you should sit cool, else

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.670
you will get
troubled.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.700
But he got distracted, and he started
shouting and screaming a lot. Kundilini

00:21:34.766 --> 00:21:39.590
many people say that When she becomes
awakened, then jumping and dancing happens.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.650
and
so-and-so, and so-and-so happens.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:48.825
The things that you can do, it
cannot be Kundilini, it is straight to say.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:50.903
You can dance, if you wish to

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:53.284
there is a man,
he is dancing, take it;

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.201
that he is dancing on his
own, for whatever reason may be dancing!

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.384
then how will
you know that this is Kundilini?

00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:06.145
Because any man can
dance; its simple calculation.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:10.570
Some man is shouting, any man,
another man may also shout, wheather

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.585
his Kundalini is
awakened or not;

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.232
All this even you can do .

00:22:15.257 --> 00:22:18.298
You cannot show the
vibration of Kundilini. You will

00:22:18.323 --> 00:22:23.530
see with your own eyes that Kundilini,
she will pulsate in the triangular bone or

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.185
elsewhere on the side.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.850
You can see with your
eyes, you cannot do that

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.670
the pulsation sets in some portion
only 'dhud dhud dhud dhud dhud dhud.'

00:22:32.704 --> 00:22:37.587
you can't do this, let
anyone do it and show it;

00:22:37.612 --> 00:22:44.495
Anyone may dance,
anyone may jump, scream

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:48.270
then you will say that what if
suddenly someone starts screaming

00:22:48.311 --> 00:22:54.011
and shouting and starts
jumping, then what will happen.

00:22:54.045 --> 00:22:58.578
Then its simply means that
they are possessed by ghost.

00:22:58.613 --> 00:23:03.101
If ever someone gets possessed by a ghost,
he behaves this way someone else comes

00:23:03.168 --> 00:23:09.946
But for his coming he starts
shouting, screaming, does anything.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.323
Yesterday a gentleman came to us, I told
you that he was doing the entire Hatha Yoga

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:19.123
exercise in front of me; so much so that I
had to stop him from coming here. As I felt

00:23:19.167 --> 00:23:24.170
that his intestines may not completely
come out, he may not spare them even and

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:29.810
and he used to do it continuously without
any effort. He never learned Hatha Yoga.

00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:34.014
Some corrupt fanatic entered into Him.
He used to show all kinds of postures in

00:23:34.125 --> 00:23:40.990
front of me. There are people even with
such ghostly possessions that they,

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.993
You will be astonished,
compose many poems on me.

00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:50.382
In the begining when Sahaja Yoga started,
in Bombay, there was a maid who used

00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:56.225
to wash utensils, the one who is
called Ghatin, no sooner she came, started

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:01.450
singing the verses loudly and sang fifteen
verses of 'Devi Mahatmya' in front of me.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.538
And standing exactly like a man, recited in
Sanskrit in such a way that people were

00:24:05.605 --> 00:24:12.996
stunned. How come she became so
knowledgeable in Sanskrit

00:24:13.046 --> 00:24:20.511
How come she is reciting such long
verses of Goddess. It was very surprising.

00:24:20.544 --> 00:24:24.110
Reason for this was that
inside him a Pandit had come

00:24:24.177 --> 00:24:27.487
and she was reciting shlokas. I told that
Pandit Sahib, after taking the 'bandhan',

00:24:27.511 --> 00:24:33.340
you go away from here,
why are you using this lady

00:24:33.364 --> 00:24:39.330
and toubling me. He said Mother when will
I come, when will I be born again, then I

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:45.307
when will I sing your praises; that's why
I came here." And there were many our

00:24:45.352 --> 00:24:48.734
Sahaj Yogi's who
said this. Starting from

00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:52.882
Markande and beyond
that, from time immemorial,

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:56.060
people have said that ghosts, vampires,
etc. stuck,

00:24:56.084 --> 00:25:00.950
whatever mental diseases
are there; there is ESP

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:06.550
News of someone in advance. There
is a lot about evil spirits, vampires, etc.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.590
written in our scriptures
But we don't even read Hindi,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.150
this Sanskrit is very far away.That
is the language of English people

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:23.970
now; we study english. We have
everything written in our scriptures

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:31.084
that such things happen,
and for that man gets sad.

00:25:31.109 --> 00:25:38.650
There are some people who shackle
themselves

00:25:38.717 --> 00:25:41.072
and show hanging on trees.

00:25:41.138 --> 00:25:44.965
Especially among the tribals,
many such practices are prevalent;

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:52.550
Strange, strange things; walking in burning
fire. Ghost knowledge of many types is

00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:56.905
in Africa too. In every country strange
strange types of ghost knowledge exist;

00:25:56.949 --> 00:26:00.704
Then man will think that there was
something special in this. They too walked

00:26:00.793 --> 00:26:07.800
into the fire. Thus many kinds of things
have been happening in this country earlier

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.420
and now these are taking place in countries
where Rajogun is reaching extreame;

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:18.460
Rajogun reaching peak alongside,
from your country many many demonology

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:26.348
experts are reaching there to mesmerize
everyone. They have imprinted on all,

00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:34.380
made lakhs of rupees, crores of rupees.
Built, big places, now the same ghosts

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.958
shall eat them, they do eat
and it has started. Now

00:26:37.982 --> 00:26:41.560
they are worried, now
this money cannot save

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:48.960
them and I told you yesterday also that
ghosts eat those people. I want to tell you

00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:54.800
to tell you clearly, I have no fear of
anyone, these transcendental meditation

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.960
people doing it, today 132 People
came to me in London and everyone says

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.982
that we have a blockage in our
heads, Mother. Take us out of this.

00:27:03.027 --> 00:27:06.315
Yesterday I told you, today again

00:27:06.382 --> 00:27:12.450
I am telling you that you should ask for
it, Self-power; Soul power is not Rajoguni.

00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:19.186
Self-power is not of Tamo Guni also,
Self-power is not Satva Guni either;

00:27:19.253 --> 00:27:23.763
That's 'Gunatit', even virtuous, it
is like flowing beyond all qualities,

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:27.920
power from within. The form keeps flowing
from within it, it doesn't wrap itself

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:34.740
around any quality. Its 'Nirvajya'.
Its doesn't stick. This is the power

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.460
of the Soul, that flows 'Dhar
Dhar Dhar Dhar' from with in like Ganges.

00:27:44.072 --> 00:27:52.034
There is no display of
His power, that power,

00:27:52.068 --> 00:27:58.830
If you want that by rotating the aleady
the power in motion here, you take out four

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:04.503
rings and this and that, in such
useless things this power doesn't have

00:28:04.547 --> 00:28:08.336
any interest in the ring. What a
thing a ring is, it is not even worth the

00:28:08.361 --> 00:28:11.427
dust of the feet,

00:28:11.514 --> 00:28:19.356
all this is to spoil your
attention. Being medium only by remaining

00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:24.570
in Sattva Guna, medium being. By remaining
in medium state man can be Gunatit.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:31.496
because its movement is in
middle, the line that you are seeing

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:39.521
is called Sushmana Nadi. Its movement is
due to it and due to that the man rises up,

00:28:39.546 --> 00:28:47.541
Kundilini is so arranged. There must
be some authoity to raise it up. Kundilini

00:28:47.591 --> 00:28:55.557
rising on its way up pierces Brahmarandar,
someone knowledgeable must be there.

00:28:55.607 --> 00:29:03.230
Any one sitting for the Kundilini, doesn't
become its authoity that if some minister

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:08.380
gets attached then so far so good. Just
by becoming a minister,

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:14.280
he cannot become big authoity of Kundilini.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:21.068
Kabir Das was the minister where from, how
much education did Kabir Das ji have, from

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:28.773
which university or school did he study;
Tukaram attended which University school?

00:29:28.806 --> 00:29:33.756
He was a minister of which place, where
was he a king? They; all this knowledge got

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:40.050
where from ? Where did Gyaneshwar studied
from? Where from he got all this knowledge?

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:47.721
which school did he go to;

00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:51.088
About the kingdom of God; when
man enters the Kingdom of God

00:29:51.138 --> 00:29:55.640
then he looks at
its rules and regulations.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:01.436
Then its a matter of laugh as to what to
do to these rules and regulations. Now some

00:30:01.469 --> 00:30:06.136
gentleman told me that Mother there is
no one left now as a leader in the country

00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:11.670
you contest elections. hey I said you
talk of where, who live in the king's house

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:16.890
do not go and live in beggar's house.
This politics is of beggars, whom to beg.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:22.410
Whose money to save, all this filth. All
this is not for us, we are royal people.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:29.264
Where are you trapping us. We said
the way they are making the creation today

00:30:29.331 --> 00:30:35.014
You want to make it out of proportion
in Rajo Guna। Meaning if you go to

00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:42.895
London then to drink alcohol only if
you want to buy glass, you will have to

00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:49.229
You will have to spend at least one
thousand, fifteen thousand rupees. First

00:30:49.262 --> 00:30:55.440
 make liquor, which is absolutely wrong,
then To drink it you must make cups of it;

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:01.006
if in England Scotch whiskey stops, the
country will sink because they have only

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:09.039
two things, one is Scotch whiskey.
And second is their crystal;

00:31:09.073 --> 00:31:15.573
When a man starts growing outside, he
gets dependent on the other's weaknesses.

00:31:15.598 --> 00:31:21.887
if there is no weakness then why would
man need things. He is made weak. just like

00:31:21.987 --> 00:31:29.687
women are told that your body should be
like this, your face should be like this,

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:36.454
You should be like this, you should have
these things in you; Women stated spending.

00:31:36.504 --> 00:31:42.200
They instilled weakness in them. If living
in London, you must play horse racing

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.424
else you are not a civilized person, not an
elite one. You must know all

00:31:46.457 --> 00:31:52.860
about horse racing. If you live in
Paris you should know all about alcohol.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:57.818
what is alcohol, how much should it
be mixed, how much to be dissolved.

00:31:57.843 --> 00:32:02.609
I was surprised that the
government college here,

00:32:02.709 --> 00:32:07.414
where children are taught hotel
management, there are two papers in it,

00:32:07.464 --> 00:32:11.064
where in its tought about wine, which
wine be given, which not. Because your

00:32:11.114 --> 00:32:16.859
hotels will not run; In the hotel if they
cann't drink alcohol, they won't stay,

00:32:16.884 --> 00:32:21.702
So how will you get money from?

00:32:21.752 --> 00:32:27.864
The more weakness you have,
more stonger the Rajo guna can be.

00:32:27.864 --> 00:32:31.704
if you can live in only two or four
clothes happily, how their cloth

00:32:31.704 --> 00:32:35.366
mills will run?

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:41.583
If you live in simplicity then how
will the trade of these people run? If you

00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:45.983
go to America, there will be fifty types
of handles, even the tiles over the head;

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:49.516
it will be of thousands of types. If you
happen to use someone's bath room, do ask

00:32:49.566 --> 00:32:54.931
first which knob to press otherwise
once you get in, may get locked instantly.

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:57.124
What is the need to
create so much drama?

00:32:57.124 --> 00:33:02.404
So much comfort addiction, why does a
man need so much comfort that all the time

00:33:02.404 --> 00:33:05.434
he keeps rolling ?

00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:10.784
Because it is necessary to
roll back after drinking alcohol,

00:33:10.808 --> 00:33:14.240
comfort is necessary to roll back, And for
comfort every kind of thing is important;

00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:18.000
This cushion should be made, such and such
should be made. It must have that thing;

00:33:18.024 --> 00:33:24.286
so much deformity is there, I am telling
you, so much ugliness has resulted in man

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.354
and there is no shame in
him. He has made big signs. Have also made

00:33:30.454 --> 00:33:37.767
signs for serving alcohol, then how should
women stay beautiful? They should tan,

00:33:37.834 --> 00:33:43.767
even if they are ashamed of it, there is
no harm in it. Their body must be tanned.

00:33:43.817 --> 00:33:50.267
they took a detour Of lamp and tanning, hey
brother, if you want to take sunlight, then

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.533
if you have clothes on your being, it
doesn't matter, The sunlight still goes

00:33:54.566 --> 00:33:59.441
 inside you. But there must be tanning,
for that such sort of views,

00:33:59.508 --> 00:34:02.937
that you can not walk on any sea shore.
noise will subside and all these women will

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.720
One day these all sea shores will
shrink and pull these women inside,

00:34:05.754 --> 00:34:08.254
then their wisdom will be set.

00:34:08.291 --> 00:34:16.255
Shamelessness be spread in the world, as if
they are not shameless then how will their

00:34:16.306 --> 00:34:21.855
cosmetics be sold? The things they have
made to befool women how will they take it?

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.080
Now some wisdom has
pevailed in our country,

00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:30.005
earlier I used to see women putting a
dalda pin here and then women move out.

00:34:30.038 --> 00:34:34.764
Then I gave lecture that Baba,
reduce the pin of Dalda at least.

00:34:34.922 --> 00:34:42.855
If you wear heels then so high as if you
want to be camel. You are a human being,

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:50.089
 God has ceated you of
a definite shape, why are you so disturbed.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:57.084
See, you are holding beauty contest?
How strange, and quite distorted and

00:34:57.084 --> 00:35:01.450
ugly it is because  completely satisfied

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:07.200
when there is a 'Satvik' form then man
becomes no sooner he sees the form;

00:35:07.234 --> 00:35:11.664
This is the
goal of beauty that now that's end of it,

00:35:11.689 --> 00:35:17.120
beyond this there is no
figure, that is the real thing. But

00:35:17.154 --> 00:35:19.762
This is that figure that now
on way will see another one,

00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:22.435
after that saw a second monkey,
then the third monkey was seen;

00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:25.519
Only female monkeys
are seen lying far and wide.

00:35:25.564 --> 00:35:30.651
I said, there is not even a single Sati
Sadhvi here.All are female monkeys, who

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.195
jumping on neck of this,
jumping on the neck of that and

00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:39.262
are very over and above they are
proud that we are very much, Wah wah

00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:42.495
Such type of foolish act women of this
country may not do, it will be

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:47.696
kind of them. This country has so
many women, who are respectable ones,

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.795
that inspite of numerous mistakes
of men, the counrty is still surviving.

00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:56.195
All men have become 'Sahibs'.
no one can say anything to them.

00:35:56.229 --> 00:36:01.773
It has become very difficult to
say to them, all are 'Sahib' now.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.124
Now the second thing is that
they are absolutely monkey.

00:36:04.124 --> 00:36:11.890
If you are in Delhi, I heard
That, if you go somewhere and if you don't

00:36:11.935 --> 00:36:17.990
drink alcohol, people laugh, that Sir, you
have not yet become a complete monkey

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:25.224
and until the monkeys' tails are cut, they
will not be happy until you have and they

00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:30.246
don't get joy until two or four girls you
haven't brought from here and there and

00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:36.504
make them dance, then you are of no use.
These days, the old people here are fond of

00:36:36.554 --> 00:36:43.335
fond of not geting be
fooled. Nagpur is our place,

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:47.991
where we lived, the people over there are
some definitely cruel, sometimes they say

00:36:48.035 --> 00:36:55.264
factuals. They said that the old people
wished that if they did not get be fooled,

00:36:55.264 --> 00:37:00.824
instead of keeping wisdom, some peace,
some dignity of theirs, well, these days

00:37:00.824 --> 00:37:08.790
the elders are fond of looking younger.
the way they go and dance in embrace.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:15.521
A gentleman started saying to me,
Sir, what is the objection to you in this?

00:37:15.588 --> 00:37:20.463
What harm to you if we roam around like a
poor person; Sir! I said I have no poblem,

00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:26.004
but let me tell you this much that at
this time you looking like a vampire.

00:37:26.071 --> 00:37:32.346
And if you are already roaming around as
a vampire, then on the way if any vampire

00:37:32.371 --> 00:37:35.952
sits on you on, whose fault will it be? It
will not be the vampire's fault but yours

00:37:36.002 --> 00:37:41.569
because he will see that he is getting this
good agent, like him, in which he will be

00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:45.850
well settled. Your face is such that
only ghosts can be attracted. All these are

00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:52.233
the wonders of Rajo Guna, that if you
want to roam around like vampires then

00:37:52.266 --> 00:37:56.066
you should be Rajo Guni. If
you want to do develoment, do it.

00:37:56.116 --> 00:37:57.970
The pant thats not washed for ten-ten days

00:37:57.994 --> 00:38:02.174
It is heared that there is lady who didn't
wash for days togethe since she wore.

00:38:02.174 --> 00:38:07.681
She takes bath with it and dries; You
listen to each and every clumsy acts.

00:38:07.764 --> 00:38:11.047
Telling you their hight of development.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.662
Now there is a the tight crock is
new, maybe it has not reached yet.

00:38:14.712 --> 00:38:21.287
maybe only it may reach. Few big
pins are stitched on both sides in it.

00:38:21.312 --> 00:38:27.112
Big pins, red in the nose, shocking pink
here, green here, all these are leaves.

00:38:27.145 --> 00:38:31.328
They are taken out and joined and
then they roam aound and who else

00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:35.544
roam there, dignified professors;
We have some professors sitting here,

00:38:35.627 --> 00:38:42.851
Be careful, (laughing) and you
will be surprised that great scholar,

00:38:42.885 --> 00:38:46.218
I used to consider him, when he came to a
party, doing all this; "What is all this,"

00:38:46.243 --> 00:38:50.464
I said? He said, these days I
joined punk-rock. I said….what

00:38:50.464 --> 00:38:54.730
What's this you have done; You seem
intelligent and now you move to Punk rock.

00:38:54.747 --> 00:38:59.413
He said that you too will have a lot
of fun, peace from it, which means that

00:38:59.464 --> 00:39:02.564
It is said that one should look at
himself even after getting befooled of the

00:39:02.597 --> 00:39:08.110
highest order. It is better to be a joker!
else no one watches now.

00:39:08.155 --> 00:39:12.726
Because when everyone
becomes a hippie, they all look alike,

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.214
should be some specialty, then by putting
pins in their mouth here, from here to

00:39:16.264 --> 00:39:21.974
here, such big ones all the big
common sites are there. You are surprised,

00:39:22.007 --> 00:39:25.344
I am just not saying you for entertainment.
I am not saying this, this is a reality.

00:39:25.344 --> 00:39:28.855
And on the sight of it in astonishment,
you are surprised. That sir, either we are

00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:36.872
mad or they are mad. And they think of
us that we are very inhibited people, that

00:39:36.905 --> 00:39:41.364
we don't have the intelligence to behave
like this. No one can do any good work.

00:39:41.364 --> 00:39:45.112
In which we let luce ourselves.
We are so inhibited that we cannot

00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:53.120
even imagine any freedom; Freedom It means
that it is foolish, it is not stupidity,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:58.550
it is not stupidity at all; Freedom is
such a big thing. Following on one's own is

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:05.900
freedom. And this is the system
of self which is in your hands. The man

00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:10.484
who wants to consider himself independent
must get self realized first, else he is

00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:17.654
not independent. One must understand one's
own system and this is his own system.

00:40:17.654 --> 00:40:22.754
Neither is the negativity of the Tantriks
which itself gets eliminated in it.

00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:28.320
When one who becomes completely
independent, then only wisdom

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:34.687
gets fully balanced in him. Whatever
he does, he does with full independence.

00:40:34.712 --> 00:40:37.228
On his every signal,

00:40:37.278 --> 00:40:44.762
In his each and every signal many
kinds of independence are visible.

00:40:46.728 --> 00:40:52.435
He is not afraid of anyone
and always remain humble and

00:40:52.469 --> 00:40:55.668
he is free in love.

00:40:55.702 --> 00:41:03.702
He is full of love and kindness;
We salute such an independent man.

00:41:03.717 --> 00:41:06.383
Instead of those who
convert themselves in the name of freedom,

00:41:06.408 --> 00:41:10.382
from donkeys to fools, I know
not, what else would they be?

00:41:10.406 --> 00:41:13.797
I don't even have such animals
whose system I can tell you

00:41:13.797 --> 00:41:16.544
I didn't even find words
to describe these people.

00:41:16.577 --> 00:41:19.453
Because such things had never
happened before in Kaliyuga.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.137
Therefore there is
need to find new words ;

00:41:22.137 --> 00:41:24.844
And those who were words creators,
that too have become the same,

00:41:24.861 --> 00:41:29.194
then now who will make words
for these. This situation has come;

00:41:29.227 --> 00:41:32.260
If you find some Sanskrit
language, do tell me.

00:41:32.294 --> 00:41:34.036
Because it is very difficult;

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:38.991
When Sanskrit language was prevalent,
it was not thought for these donkeys.

00:41:39.024 --> 00:41:41.574
It is described in the Quran
also that Kaliyuga will come, but

00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:47.391
so much great fools would wander in
the world was not mentioned in the Quran.

00:41:47.441 --> 00:41:49.790
This can be visualized.

00:41:49.824 --> 00:41:57.007
Educated and highly educated people are
doing this work.

00:41:57.057 --> 00:42:00.374
What would you say to this?
This is effect of Rajo Gun.

00:42:00.424 --> 00:42:03.048
There is a strong
feeling; Now your country is developing

00:42:05.067 --> 00:42:11.410
but please look at this sample. Surely
you may develope, but look at this example

00:42:11.443 --> 00:42:18.376
the ditch they are in, don't go and
jump in that. One of the major defect in

00:42:18.443 --> 00:42:23.027
Rajogun is that it is driven by ego,
meaning Rajogun is ego oriented.

00:42:23.027 --> 00:42:30.527
When ego orientation has begun, ego is
such a thing that whatever a man does in it

00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:38.510
he cannot see his own stupidity in
that or whatever he does is right because

00:42:38.535 --> 00:42:43.487
it satisfies his ego. There is a beautiful
description in the Ramayana

00:42:43.487 --> 00:42:49.836
when Narad Muni himself got tapped
in a dilemma, it is such a dilemma,

00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:57.077
this is the dilemma of Rajo Guna. we should
look at ourselves to understand this, and

00:42:57.077 --> 00:43:01.057
say, Oh God, this ego of mine is turning
me into a donkey. And ego turns you

00:43:01.157 --> 00:43:05.373
into a donkey and
leaves you and in the end,

00:43:05.414 --> 00:43:12.857
for the nervousness
that you carry that donkey on you.

00:43:12.897 --> 00:43:16.347
Because it is ego oriented and so
dangerous. If it was not ego oriented, then

00:43:16.372 --> 00:43:24.255
it wouldn't have been so dangerous because
man wouldn't have called himself donkey.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.663
He will laugh on the whole wold but he
himself is carrying the donkey on his head,

00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:32.487
he won't see self. This is the specialty
of ego, ego; Ego sets in blindness.

00:43:32.487 --> 00:43:34.836
and so that’s a very bad thing.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:40.456
Yes, if its super ego that's on the
other side of our head, may develope.

00:43:40.481 --> 00:43:44.814
Due to Tamo Guna, a person can
suffer from it. His body may tremble,

00:43:44.866 --> 00:43:49.581
he may get problems, he may get
diseased; His physical problems may arise,

00:43:49.636 --> 00:43:55.052
But an ego oriented man never faces these
problem, unless he gets heart trouble.

00:43:55.093 --> 00:44:00.253
Its same if the heart also stops;
ego Oriented man can never

00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:04.603
find anything like this, as in Tamo
Guni obstructions are there all the time,

00:44:04.647 --> 00:44:12.547
every where. Tamo Guni in a way, the
poor man, is better off because at least

00:44:12.547 --> 00:44:18.587
he keeps avoiding its stumbles. Understand
that right now a lady is sitting here,

00:44:18.587 --> 00:44:22.407
she has a possession; She went to
some man to talk to him to do something,

00:44:22.407 --> 00:44:27.767
she has possession; and when
possessed by the ghost her body convulse.

00:44:27.767 --> 00:44:34.847
Ok brother, leave it! But if one
goes in front of an egoistical man,

00:44:34.847 --> 00:44:38.887
his ego will penetrate inside you too, so
I am elder than his father. If he said one

00:44:38.987 --> 00:44:44.167
well I said ten, who are they, I I am
his maternal grandfather, he started as

00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:50.147
are donkeys, you are his double grandfather
donkey. And along with it there is

00:44:50.147 --> 00:44:56.311
another problem which is very subtle, which
should be understood. Yes Sir - better.

00:44:56.336 --> 00:45:04.327
one more problem gets added to it, Yes
Sir - Success; If you have Success with it,

00:45:04.327 --> 00:45:10.930
then it becomes a big problem. Then it
is impossible to take him off the donkey.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:17.067
If success gets tagged, then they hear big
success; Then 30-40 years after their death

00:45:17.067 --> 00:45:23.227
it comes out that he did this donkey act,
he ate cow dung, he spoiled his condition,

00:45:23.227 --> 00:45:29.202
he was like this and he was like
that, so People say he won't be like this

00:45:32.027 --> 00:45:39.663
because man, in ego, can do
anything, can do any sort of work.

00:45:39.697 --> 00:45:43.487
There are many people who apply ego to
do things secretly, while some

00:45:43.487 --> 00:45:49.967
people do it openly if it gets
exposed but in every one

00:45:49.992 --> 00:45:56.747
A sort of great demonic
power is acting and there is such

00:45:56.747 --> 00:46:01.147
great foolishness is there in that demonic
power, as I just told you only yesterday

00:46:01.147 --> 00:46:08.980
in London a seventy-seven year old
grandmother marries her grand child

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:15.167
It is not strange to them, and Nana
ji is wedding with his granddaughter.

00:46:15.167 --> 00:46:19.587
and there are people there to get passed
a law for it. There is a lot of movement

00:46:19.633 --> 00:46:26.816
going on there that this way you
are attacking our independence.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.500
There is
no need to learn anything from such idiots.

00:46:30.553 --> 00:46:36.050
they don't have anything of their own
to offer. Please don't accept any thing

00:46:36.117 --> 00:46:41.517
from them. And we don't need such kind of
money, this will make us more foolish.

00:46:41.554 --> 00:46:49.554
Ok! If you want development, then Gandhian
ways are the best, follow his ways.

00:46:49.587 --> 00:46:52.387
Walk on your stability,

00:46:52.427 --> 00:46:59.627
Whatever assets you have, whatever
power you have, go with that.

00:46:59.627 --> 00:47:05.907
Do you understand how stupid we are
being, understand this too. We have, if we

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:11.267
eat in brass, it is a matter of great
pride that we have so much brass and

00:47:11.267 --> 00:47:15.967
and these people eat in plastic
and we wish plastic to come here,

00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:23.193
otherwise stainless steel should
come; Stainless steel, is it a food item,

00:47:23.237 --> 00:47:29.973
which is called iron; people will eat in
iron it was said earlier in the Puranas.

00:47:30.007 --> 00:47:31.723
When we were young,

00:47:31.756 --> 00:47:34.917
someone used to say, that such a time
will come when people will eat in iron,

00:47:34.917 --> 00:47:39.857
then our mother and others, used to say,"
Oh God, what kind of time will this come,

00:47:39.857 --> 00:47:45.757
such misery, such poverty will it
come that people will eat in iron. Oh God!

00:47:45.797 --> 00:47:52.572
eat in copper, eat in punch metal,
eat in something nice, what is this?

00:47:52.597 --> 00:47:57.477
So now people eat in stainless
steel; I come there from London

00:47:57.477 --> 00:48:00.977
people write to me that there nice nylon
sarees are available, American Georgette,

00:48:00.977 --> 00:48:05.737
bring it. English people
there laugh, hey, what?

00:48:05.769 --> 00:48:10.497
your cotton is so good and
where from you are taking

00:48:10.497 --> 00:48:13.913
this garbage for there? If
someone wears cotton on his own,

00:48:13.972 --> 00:48:17.863
people will laugh that what kind of
cotton is she wearing? That day is not far,

00:48:17.896 --> 00:48:21.857
Khadi will dominate all over the
world, the day is far off. Believe me

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.083
because in these there are vibrations
of weaving hands and those people

00:48:25.117 --> 00:48:28.383
are hand made vibrations and those people
understand the importance of this thing.

00:48:28.433 --> 00:48:34.091
understand the importance of
Khadi, but we people are idiots who think

00:48:34.149 --> 00:48:39.017
Nylon a great thing. We know
that nylon causes many diseases

00:48:39.017 --> 00:48:46.774
but why do we like
nylon, because they and we copy English.

00:48:46.808 --> 00:48:49.112
You, instead of ten wear two
sarees,

00:48:49.137 --> 00:48:54.497
Wear proper and simple one; wear instead
of ten, two clothes. Now, at our place

00:48:54.497 --> 00:48:58.797
people wonder that Terry cot is
expensive than cotton and they are very

00:48:58.797 --> 00:49:03.777
surprised, how is it, not possible? if
there Cotton you get for ten pounds there

00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:08.537
you will get a terry coat for two pounds;
If someone gets cotton somewhere

00:49:08.537 --> 00:49:13.762
people would run for it. They
say how beautiful its feel is.

00:49:13.787 --> 00:49:18.187
We still iron and iron.
they say, brother, we don't

00:49:18.187 --> 00:49:22.367
at all care so about people. We get nervous
and suffocated, why do you iron so much

00:49:22.367 --> 00:49:29.067
from morning till evening.
Oho Iron your mind as well

00:49:29.067 --> 00:49:32.907
also this external hesitation that we think
is a big thing and people laugh at it.

00:49:32.907 --> 00:49:39.207
English people laugh a lot, some of our
English disciples came here. They said that

00:49:39.207 --> 00:49:43.647
they liked Bombay more than Delhi. Of; They
were in the cold, so I asked why, they said

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:48.187
everyone from here is so westernized,
I said westernized how do you say, they

00:49:48.187 --> 00:49:54.212
say that all people roam around wearing
suits; don't they have understanding?

00:49:54.247 --> 00:49:56.580
They couldn't understand

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.327
what it is, so I asked them," If
you also want to show off on them,

00:49:59.327 --> 00:50:02.300
then come wearing a suit,
otherwise there is no effect on them."

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.333
When you have to go to
university, go wearing a best suit;

00:50:05.383 --> 00:50:08.467
If the Englishman came in a suit,
then only our Hindustani falls at his feet.

00:50:08.517 --> 00:50:11.097
and he is not going to fall otherwise;
he is going to get missed,

00:50:11.147 --> 00:50:14.573
if you come wearing casual
clothes. Don't you understand,

00:50:14.607 --> 00:50:20.509
the same Slavic mentality is still
inside us for the last thousands of years.

00:50:23.576 --> 00:50:27.687
Those, our fathers and Grand
fathers never wore these things.

00:50:27.687 --> 00:50:33.467
But they were full of humanity.
Each and every person

00:50:33.467 --> 00:50:37.927
would have given a word once

00:50:37.927 --> 00:50:44.387
was a legend, about whom People all
over the world used to sing praises that

00:50:44.387 --> 00:50:49.547
Had the people of India been united, would
have been better than thousands useless

00:50:49.547 --> 00:50:53.647
people of here. The same
Hindustani people have been spoiled.

00:50:53.664 --> 00:50:57.530
This is the grace of Rajo guna.

00:50:57.583 --> 00:51:02.456
We were very good before independence, when
we were slaves, when we fought shoulder to

00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:05.914
shoulder and after going
there with everyone, and

00:51:05.947 --> 00:51:08.497
we reached everyone Nation to
raise demand for our independence.

00:51:08.547 --> 00:51:11.981
Those, we were different people.
And today in the slavery of Rajo Guna

00:51:12.014 --> 00:51:19.980
we are getting trapped, getting so much
spoiled by materialism, to understand it.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:27.546
While rising in Rajoguna, on its way,
there is Satv Guna; stop here,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:34.726
Stop, looking at its
extreme come in between.

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:40.210
Satva Guna comes only when Dharma
is followed; and Dharm in our stomach is

00:51:40.243 --> 00:51:47.035
established around Nabhi Chakra.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.318
It is the place of Lakshmi,

00:51:49.343 --> 00:51:54.517
Lakshmi is the virtuous arrangement
of Rajo Guna. I have told you about

00:51:54.517 --> 00:51:59.097
Lakshmi earlier, told yesterday
also that a person who is an

00:51:59.097 --> 00:52:02.663
embodiment of Lakshmi gives charity
with one hand and accommodates with

00:52:02.714 --> 00:52:04.853
the other hand. He should
be an embodiment of Mother.

00:52:04.877 --> 00:52:11.477
She has lotus flowers in her two hands.
Like there should be an aura of respect and

00:52:11.477 --> 00:52:17.949
love inside him all the time. When you
go to his house or door, says come, son!

00:52:17.974 --> 00:52:22.265
Where did you come from? How come you came
here with so much trouble, sit, stay here.

00:52:22.299 --> 00:52:26.665
I just did a (unclear); today I told a
rich man, brother, this is Lakshmipati,

00:52:26.715 --> 00:52:32.737
He said, sister, if any thief comes; I
Said, if even a thief comes, there is

00:52:32.737 --> 00:52:37.877
no problem, make him sit with love,
his theft will change. A thief would never

00:52:37.877 --> 00:52:43.977
steal from a noble person. If he is
absolutely worthless, let it go for

00:52:43.977 --> 00:52:48.817
his deeds. If a thief comes to your house,
keep him, accept him with compassion,

00:52:48.817 --> 00:52:56.781
he thinks ten times whether to
steal or not, this man is like my father.

00:52:56.806 --> 00:53:01.117
Such man must be called
rich, rather than that man who

00:53:01.117 --> 00:53:08.337
insults everyone else all around.
The man who is like a lotus at heart,

00:53:08.337 --> 00:53:15.497
very beautiful and pink like a lotus,
extremely loving feelings and in which

00:53:15.497 --> 00:53:23.474
complete affection flows, within
which even a dark full of thorns

00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:31.339
creature can go and sleep comfortably; such
a man is called Lakshmi Pati in our place.

00:53:31.405 --> 00:53:37.071
Without becoming Lakshmi form this
Rajo Guna won't benefit you; He just lives

00:53:37.121 --> 00:53:41.642
like a trustee. Whatever money he
has, that does not make him addicted.

00:53:41.739 --> 00:53:44.472
He does not leave any
money for his children. He does not

00:53:44.561 --> 00:53:50.627
spend it in addictions; He uses
that money in the welfare of the world.

00:53:50.661 --> 00:53:54.102
He is a trustee in nature.

00:53:54.127 --> 00:53:59.005
I had read a very beautiful
story of Sharadchandra, that some

00:53:59.047 --> 00:54:04.827
He wrote that we, boys from
some group approached a rich man.

00:54:04.983 --> 00:54:08.007
When we reached he asked
what you want to do; Then they said

00:54:08.007 --> 00:54:12.147
we want to do a drama and
we want to do this and in that

00:54:12.147 --> 00:54:16.807
we want to show a very modern life and
you give us some money; Then he said

00:54:16.807 --> 00:54:21.427
Okay, sit, sit, made us sit a lot, after
that they were given 'Chavanni'. these boys

00:54:21.427 --> 00:54:27.377
got annoyed with him that he is such a
miser, gave us 'Chavanni'. After that a

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:35.400
poor lady came who was old,
said, I don't know, some fifty years ago

00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:43.007
my husband had kept some money with
you. After that we went abroad and where

00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:48.187
my husband died;
I found a letter in which it was written

00:54:48.187 --> 00:54:53.467
that I had left a lot of money with him.
So if you can, he has a religious person.

00:54:53.467 --> 00:54:59.683
Go to him. He said, please show me the
letter. Looked at its date,

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:01.750
started saying look in
the book where it is theirs,

00:55:01.783 --> 00:55:05.283
find out such and such date. If it happened
in such and such year, 50 years earlier;

00:55:05.333 --> 00:55:09.747
get all those files out and sitting
there looking, he was also quite old,

00:55:09.747 --> 00:55:16.127
he too was 75-80 years old, but sat down
and said to her, "Sister, stop here, eat

00:55:16.127 --> 00:55:22.267
this food, stay here only." Coincidentally
they found out about it within two

00:55:22.267 --> 00:55:29.487
to three hours. Within two to three hours
they found out that this rupee was given.

00:55:29.487 --> 00:55:35.867
He returned all that money to that woman.
He returned it with interest. It is a sign

00:55:35.867 --> 00:55:41.687
of Lakshmi Pati that he stands in religion.
They use that money like a trustee.

00:55:41.687 --> 00:55:47.347
I recognise Sharad Chandra for his these
values because the element of Dharma is

00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:53.307
Sharad Chandra so beautifully expressed,
the very essence of human religion

00:55:53.307 --> 00:55:58.307
has been shown so beautifully. But we don't
read Sharad Chandra, we read Rajneesh.

00:55:58.307 --> 00:56:05.547
Rajneesh is the greatest hero of our
times, bearded Maharaj and his disciples

00:56:05.547 --> 00:56:12.797
These are the biggest heroes for us these
days.

00:56:12.847 --> 00:56:18.943
In our culture the importance of the rich
was never praised. No where.

00:56:18.994 --> 00:56:22.385
It was always sung of the
person who is a religious person.

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:26.380
and you should also know that in this
country your praise will never be sung,

00:56:26.413 --> 00:56:31.797
no matter how many temples you construct
and may do whatever useless things.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:37.373
your importance will be praised
only when you are a religious person

00:56:37.407 --> 00:56:38.798
and if you have money,

00:56:38.823 --> 00:56:43.967
put it in use for Dharma. And when you
spend then, don't say any one that I spent

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:50.922
for you. Keep watching, keep watching that
you are positioned in the middle only to

00:56:50.947 --> 00:56:56.687
see that just the money is reaching
the right place. And some people

00:56:56.687 --> 00:57:00.327
so absorbed in God that they do not see at
all, say let it go to whom where it goes.

00:57:00.327 --> 00:57:06.827
but if someone is engaged in other's
welfare, his money will never go for

00:57:06.827 --> 00:57:11.040
in misuse. The money
of the wicked is definitely

00:57:11.074 --> 00:57:18.107
spent in misuse, but that of the
religious people will never go. There is a

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.527
very strong force of attraction in
that too, that we call vibrations, waves of

00:57:21.527 --> 00:57:28.227
consciousness. In every thing there, are
wave of consciousness, its giver and doer

00:57:28.227 --> 00:57:30.905
should be there.

00:57:30.957 --> 00:57:37.061
waves of consciousness can
arise within you too if you nurture it.

00:57:37.128 --> 00:57:40.037
Many of you right now have
started feeling cold in the hands,

00:57:40.037 --> 00:57:45.591
they are saying; Keep
your hands like this. Again

00:57:45.635 --> 00:57:51.567
today I will tell you about the remaining
three Chakras, because yesterday I

00:57:51.567 --> 00:57:55.307
Told you about the
four chakras of lower side.

00:57:57.047 --> 00:58:00.807
Next year maybe I'll spend more
days I will come to Delhi for this, see but

00:58:00.807 --> 00:58:08.655
Delhiites, Bombayites and Calcutta people;
these people are a little more elite.

00:58:08.721 --> 00:58:13.477
So now for them sixteen
Demons were born, six demons were born.

00:58:13.566 --> 00:58:19.047
They come as they get a chance, wherever
there are sitting, Lala Amke, Dhamke, Rai

00:58:19.047 --> 00:58:24.567
So, if you have more money, then put it in Jamunaji,
 otherwise they will stick to you also. Avoid that.
Bahadur, Tamke Thamke, So-and-so Minister,
So-and-So; they are all created for them,

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:25.667
are all settled.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:34.680
I am a poor Sahaja Yogini; for me many
people can be found in the rural area,

00:58:34.724 --> 00:58:41.627
See how far people in Delhi have progress,
how far do they grow; To what extent they

00:58:41.627 --> 00:58:49.554
attain the truth. Most of the people go
with the fashion, that's in vogue. As for

00:58:49.579 --> 00:58:54.796
darshan, they started saying that only
twenty-five thousand people had come

00:58:54.896 --> 00:58:59.829
for darshan. Then what happened to
them? Just had darshan,

00:58:59.879 --> 00:59:04.129
then what happened, which problems
were solved, nothing, just had darshan.

00:59:04.157 --> 00:59:12.088
Sir, just had the darshan; Did one get any
benefit, welfare. had the darshan, brother,

00:59:12.122 --> 00:59:18.263
some transformation happened, any change
in any one or just had gone there for

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:23.129
the Darshan only. No sir, it was like that
we could not go inside,

00:59:23.154 --> 00:59:26.818
all the other big people went inside.

00:59:26.917 --> 00:59:33.437
Baba ji gave them the rings, after that
everyone came out happy wearing the rings.

00:59:33.437 --> 00:59:40.699
After that it came to light that
everyone got heart attacks,

00:59:40.749 --> 00:59:43.208
Heart attacks are
happening from the rings only;

00:59:43.232 --> 00:59:48.738
after that came to know that the rings
were also stolen, their house had thefts.

00:59:48.782 --> 00:59:56.626
The one who has more money,
many people are ready to eat it,

00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:02.860
if you have more money, put in Jamuna ji
else they will get stuck you too.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:06.043
So beware.
