00:44.772 --> 00:54.097
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

00:54.298 --> 01:05.165
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

01:05.929 --> 01:13.807
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

01:15.951 --> 01:19.684
They can't hear you.

01:20.896 --> 01:26.825
Now can you hear Me? All right.

01:29.138 --> 01:32.277
It's all right now.

01:35.378 --> 01:39.024
I selected this place suddenly

01:39.225 --> 01:45.872
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

01:46.072 --> 01:49.974
The vibrations were just shooting out

01:50.174 --> 01:53.702
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

01:53.903 --> 01:57.140
And there was a little advertisement,

01:57.341 --> 02:02.692
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

02:02.893 --> 02:10.441
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

02:10.885 --> 02:17.237
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

02:17.437 --> 02:25.085
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

02:25.285 --> 02:32.831
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

02:33.031 --> 02:36.958
and it happened only in one day.

02:37.158 --> 02:41.844
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

02:42.948 --> 02:49.110
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

02:49.311 --> 02:54.248
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

02:55.023 --> 03:04.730
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

03:07.872 --> 03:14.803
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

03:15.003 --> 03:23.592
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

03:23.792 --> 03:33.205
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

03:34.062 --> 03:41.037
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

03:41.237 --> 03:47.320
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

03:47.520 --> 03:51.675
and considering it to be a great revelry,

03:51.876 --> 03:58.420
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

03:58.620 --> 04:05.481
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

04:05.681 --> 04:09.046
whatever we have done was wrong.

04:09.246 --> 04:12.406
But those people are no more.

04:12.606 --> 04:18.092
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

04:18.293 --> 04:23.440
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

04:23.641 --> 04:27.089
do not like all that;

04:27.289 --> 04:34.198
because you have no right

04:34.398 --> 04:42.384
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

04:43.096 --> 04:46.658
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

04:46.859 --> 04:53.306
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

04:53.506 --> 05:02.455
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

05:02.655 --> 05:09.255
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

05:09.455 --> 05:14.036
Now the time has come to finish this,

05:14.242 --> 05:19.186
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

05:19.394 --> 05:27.709
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

05:27.910 --> 05:31.480
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

05:31.681 --> 05:37.030
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

05:37.231 --> 05:46.736
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

05:47.008 --> 05:52.107
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

05:52.307 --> 06:00.569
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

06:00.770 --> 06:08.486
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

06:08.687 --> 06:14.958
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

06:15.482 --> 06:22.104
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

06:22.305 --> 06:28.824
One has to accept because still, I think,

06:29.025 --> 06:33.025
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

06:33.225 --> 06:42.961
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

06:43.161 --> 06:47.125
We have another kind where we find

06:47.325 --> 06:55.527
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

06:56.186 --> 07:02.713
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

07:02.913 --> 07:08.092
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

07:08.292 --> 07:11.750
To have money itself is not a blessing.

07:11.950 --> 07:17.570
They all came here and looted rich people

07:17.846 --> 07:22.342
and have made so much money for themself.

07:24.647 --> 07:28.720
This kind of exploitation

07:28.921 --> 07:34.677
is very much dangerous, much more,

07:34.878 --> 07:40.419
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

07:40.620 --> 07:46.569
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

07:48.265 --> 07:54.606
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

07:54.806 --> 07:57.861
The seeking is there, no doubt,

07:58.061 --> 08:04.551
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

08:04.752 --> 08:15.132
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

08:15.332 --> 08:21.572
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

08:21.773 --> 08:27.621
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

08:27.822 --> 08:34.706
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

08:35.734 --> 08:41.477
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

08:41.677 --> 08:48.589
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

08:48.790 --> 08:52.983
to this new level, where I am sure

08:53.183 --> 08:58.745
you will be able to salvage many more.

08:58.946 --> 09:05.443
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

09:05.644 --> 09:12.385
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

09:12.585 --> 09:21.431
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

09:21.632 --> 09:31.180
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

09:31.381 --> 09:37.277
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

09:37.478 --> 09:45.495
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

09:45.696 --> 09:50.072
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

09:50.272 --> 09:58.149
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

09:58.350 --> 10:04.004
on various places like prisons, armies.

10:04.205 --> 10:08.859
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

10:09.059 --> 10:20.510
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

10:20.711 --> 10:27.018
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

10:27.218 --> 10:30.647
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

10:30.848 --> 10:38.622
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

10:38.822 --> 10:48.561
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

10:48.762 --> 10:52.004
and what will happen to them?

10:52.195 --> 10:58.850
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

10:59.050 --> 11:05.113
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

11:05.313 --> 11:08.226
how we can work it out.

11:08.427 --> 11:13.894
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

11:14.094 --> 11:19.228
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

11:19.428 --> 11:26.499
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

11:26.699 --> 11:31.439
but now what is to be done?

11:31.640 --> 11:38.986
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

11:39.186 --> 11:45.645
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

11:45.845 --> 11:49.681
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

11:49.858 --> 11:54.856
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

11:55.057 --> 11:59.847
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

12:00.047 --> 12:05.245
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

12:05.446 --> 12:11.662
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

12:11.863 --> 12:19.091
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

12:19.291 --> 12:25.154
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

12:25.354 --> 12:30.916
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

12:31.117 --> 12:34.078
We have to understand fundamentally

12:34.278 --> 12:38.387
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

12:38.587 --> 12:44.111
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

12:44.311 --> 12:49.899
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

12:50.100 --> 12:55.646
and tell them what is divine love.

12:55.846 --> 13:00.167
Love is the only way now we can work out.

13:00.368 --> 13:08.991
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

13:09.192 --> 13:16.930
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

13:17.130 --> 13:28.029
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

13:28.229 --> 13:34.013
This divine love is so great

13:34.213 --> 13:42.404
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

13:42.604 --> 13:48.107
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

13:48.307 --> 13:57.545
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

13:57.745 --> 14:00.967
We have to learn so much from the nature,

14:01.168 --> 14:07.056
because nature is bound with that love.

14:07.469 --> 14:12.908
Nature has no aggressiveness.

14:13.108 --> 14:20.460
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

14:20.661 --> 14:26.264
With this understanding you should also
know

14:26.465 --> 14:32.535
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

14:32.735 --> 14:38.399
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

14:38.600 --> 14:44.013
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

14:44.213 --> 14:47.593
how you should express your love.

14:47.793 --> 14:55.570
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

14:55.771 --> 15:00.558
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

15:00.758 --> 15:09.449
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

15:09.650 --> 15:15.585
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

15:16.176 --> 15:24.446
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

15:24.647 --> 15:28.324
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

15:28.525 --> 15:32.650
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

15:32.851 --> 15:37.317
All other incarnations were there,

15:37.517 --> 15:41.956
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

15:42.156 --> 15:45.900
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

15:46.100 --> 15:50.498
with other people, with the people around.

15:50.698 --> 15:53.867
They did try and they worked it out,

15:54.067 --> 16:00.021
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

16:00.222 --> 16:07.807
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

16:08.007 --> 16:14.883
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

16:15.083 --> 16:23.903
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

16:24.103 --> 16:33.116
these holy vibrations are with you

16:33.316 --> 16:37.960
for every kind of good work you want to do,

16:38.161 --> 16:42.167
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

16:42.368 --> 16:48.329
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

16:48.530 --> 16:56.542
to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

16:56.742 --> 17:01.140
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

17:01.341 --> 17:06.207
how they are blessed from every angle.

17:08.141 --> 17:15.122
So, one has to decide in their own minds

17:15.323 --> 17:23.026
that all your dreams have to come true.

17:23.226 --> 17:29.834
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

17:30.035 --> 17:38.336
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

17:39.272 --> 17:42.659
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

17:42.860 --> 17:45.307
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

17:45.507 --> 17:52.084
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

17:52.284 --> 17:56.301
Practically this is over now.

17:56.776 --> 18:03.691
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

18:03.891 --> 18:09.390
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

18:09.591 --> 18:19.195
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

18:21.847 --> 18:30.445
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

18:30.646 --> 18:34.741
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

18:34.942 --> 18:39.162
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

18:39.362 --> 18:46.577
It is to be just understood and felt

18:47.173 --> 18:56.642
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

18:56.842 --> 19:04.262
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

19:04.462 --> 19:11.785
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

19:11.986 --> 19:21.482
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

19:21.682 --> 19:30.298
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

19:30.499 --> 19:35.841
and all the waves try to save you,

19:36.041 --> 19:45.551
to make you float in the realm of joy.

19:46.329 --> 19:53.731
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

19:53.932 --> 19:58.844
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

19:59.045 --> 20:05.376
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

20:07.341 --> 20:11.134
That is true. The cause may be that,

20:11.335 --> 20:18.584
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

20:18.784 --> 20:21.390
and this is what you have to do.

20:21.590 --> 20:27.719
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

20:28.638 --> 20:34.752
From this wilderness only, you will rise

20:34.953 --> 20:39.390
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

20:39.590 --> 20:43.748
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

20:43.948 --> 20:56.293
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

20:56.722 --> 21:04.760
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

21:05.306 --> 21:10.555
Things will improve

21:11.444 --> 21:20.226
if you get the, we can say the blessings

21:20.427 --> 21:25.884
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

21:26.084 --> 21:31.881
But what about you doing something,

21:32.794 --> 21:40.742
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

21:40.943 --> 21:46.361
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

21:46.740 --> 21:56.759
is to find out about your own activities,

21:57.004 --> 22:00.861
what activities you have been doing.

22:01.034 --> 22:08.388
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

22:08.588 --> 22:16.552
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

22:16.753 --> 22:22.594
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

22:22.794 --> 22:27.919
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

22:28.119 --> 22:33.435
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

22:33.635 --> 22:39.738
who are realized souls, who are very good,

22:39.938 --> 22:43.026
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

22:43.227 --> 22:52.719
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

22:52.920 --> 23:00.288
All this is only possible if you yourself

23:00.489 --> 23:08.536
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

23:09.742 --> 23:14.492
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

23:14.693 --> 23:20.994
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

23:22.630 --> 23:27.410
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

23:27.611 --> 23:33.371
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

23:33.571 --> 23:36.743
I came here, I stayed here,

23:36.943 --> 23:44.442
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

23:44.642 --> 23:52.139
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

23:52.340 --> 23:59.379
which is this, which is America.

23:59.622 --> 24:13.238
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

24:13.439 --> 24:17.342
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

24:17.543 --> 24:23.160
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.294
But you also know that you have powers.

24:27.494 --> 24:33.220
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

24:33.420 --> 24:39.657
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

24:39.857 --> 24:46.010
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

24:46.295 --> 24:50.045
I am sure it will work out.

24:51.565 --> 24:59.026
It is a country which can definitely help

25:00.406 --> 25:04.799
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

25:04.999 --> 25:10.830
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

25:11.528 --> 25:14.752
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

25:14.953 --> 25:23.143
what is American culture is. Is something -

25:23.921 --> 25:28.243
they say something, do something else.

25:28.878 --> 25:38.237
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

25:38.437 --> 25:43.441
which is built traditionally from days
together.

25:43.697 --> 25:51.078
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

25:51.279 --> 25:57.490
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

25:57.691 --> 26:01.906
can disentangle these people.

26:02.859 --> 26:09.635
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

26:09.836 --> 26:16.129
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

26:16.329 --> 26:25.620
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

26:26.168 --> 26:32.221
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

26:32.422 --> 26:38.804
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

26:39.005 --> 26:46.274
because they are accepted and regarded

26:47.656 --> 27:03.945
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

27:04.146 --> 27:11.376
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

27:11.577 --> 27:15.907
you can do so much, and let us see.

27:16.107 --> 27:21.017
Like we have the power and the machinery,

27:21.218 --> 27:28.835
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

27:29.036 --> 27:36.334
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

27:36.535 --> 27:40.280
but we have to double our efforts.

27:40.480 --> 27:45.392
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

27:45.593 --> 27:51.770
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

27:53.183 --> 27:57.836
On a subtler level we have worked,

28:20.799 --> 28:27.281
but now we have to work it on the surface.

28:27.481 --> 28:36.647
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

28:36.848 --> 28:44.580
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

28:44.781 --> 28:52.943
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

28:53.955 --> 29:03.444
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

29:03.645 --> 29:12.193
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

29:12.393 --> 29:16.607
so that that also becomes subtler.

29:16.807 --> 29:23.318
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

29:23.519 --> 29:27.181
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

29:27.382 --> 29:32.871
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

29:34.455 --> 29:40.007
You have to just assert those powers.

29:40.311 --> 29:46.203
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

29:46.403 --> 29:49.837
and there's a right type of a movement.

29:50.037 --> 29:54.624
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

29:54.824 --> 30:00.358
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

30:00.559 --> 30:04.296
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

30:04.496 --> 30:08.212
that we should have some place here,
because

30:08.413 --> 30:15.116
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

30:15.317 --> 30:18.285
And see how I got it!

30:18.485 --> 30:24.239
But the desire to do all this

30:24.439 --> 30:30.866
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

30:31.067 --> 30:34.647
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

30:34.847 --> 30:40.843
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

30:41.044 --> 30:48.913
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

30:49.113 --> 30:55.425
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

30:55.626 --> 31:01.662
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

31:01.862 --> 31:06.895
The way we got this was so simple,

31:07.095 --> 31:12.603
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

31:12.804 --> 31:20.140
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

31:20.688 --> 31:26.232
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

31:26.432 --> 31:33.696
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

31:33.897 --> 31:39.482
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

31:39.682 --> 31:45.950
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

31:46.150 --> 31:57.251
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

31:57.482 --> 32:06.541
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

32:06.741 --> 32:12.396
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

32:12.596 --> 32:19.171
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

32:19.371 --> 32:25.149
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

32:25.350 --> 32:30.375
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

32:30.575 --> 32:35.638
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

32:35.838 --> 32:44.357
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

32:45.695 --> 32:48.684
what we are capable of achieving.

32:48.885 --> 32:58.037
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

32:58.237 --> 33:03.036
we should really feel from inside that
concern

33:03.237 --> 33:13.437
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

33:13.762 --> 33:18.003
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

33:18.204 --> 33:22.496
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

33:22.696 --> 33:31.342
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

33:31.542 --> 33:35.837
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

33:36.037 --> 33:41.709
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

33:41.909 --> 33:45.002
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

33:45.202 --> 33:49.548
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

33:49.748 --> 33:53.860
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

33:54.060 --> 34:02.187
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

34:02.388 --> 34:09.974
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

34:10.175 --> 34:15.542
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

34:15.742 --> 34:24.195
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.753
So may God bless you.
