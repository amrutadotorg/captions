00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.166
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:41:48.959 --> 00:41:51.917
But the truth has two sides:

00:41:54.917 --> 00:41:59.417
the illusion that we see can look like truth,

00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:08.250
and the essence of the illusion also may appear to be truth.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.333
But the other side is absolute

00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:25.625
and has to be felt,

00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:29.041
has to be experienced

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:34.041
on your central nervous system.

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:41.542
It's not a mental projection that we can think of,

00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:48.000
nor emotional imagination,

00:42:51.625 --> 00:42:55.792
but truth is what it is, it cannot be changed.

00:43:00.917 --> 00:43:02.999
It cannot compromise.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:09.917
We have to humble down ourselves to know the truth.

00:43:15.166 --> 00:43:19.250
Now we have discovered so many things in the science,

00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:28.709
by humility that we have not known so far.

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:38.291
But whatever is known outside, like the tree must have roots,

00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:47.834
and these roots are not known

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:52.458
if you are just looking at the tree.

00:43:57.125 --> 00:43:59.709
And when somebody talks about the roots,

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:00.999
we get shaken up

00:44:01.291 --> 00:44:04.583
because we have had no knowledge of it before.

00:44:11.542 --> 00:44:14.792
Thus we are conditioned to only see the tree,

00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:19.125
and we cannot make our mind understand

00:44:19.458 --> 00:44:22.291
that there must be some roots to it.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.291
So we can say

00:44:31.542 --> 00:44:34.291
that people have advanced in science quite a lot,

00:44:34.583 --> 00:44:38.250
and have progressed and have become developed countries.

00:44:38.583 --> 00:44:41.709
But they do not know, if they do not seek their roots

00:44:41.999 --> 00:44:45.041
they will be completely destroyed.

00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:58.667
Now when I'm before you,

00:44:58.999 --> 00:45:04.500
one should not in any way feel that I'm here to offend you,

00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:16.500
but I've come here to tell you about the roots,

00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:19.750
the great properties you have within yourself.

00:45:27.834 --> 00:45:32.125
We know about so many energies around us like electricity,

00:45:32.417 --> 00:45:36.500
gravity, in the scientific field of knowledge.

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:45.834
But there are subtler energies within us

00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:47.750
which we should try to understand

00:45:48.041 --> 00:45:50.375
with the same humility of a scientist,

00:45:50.709 --> 00:45:52.709
and the open-mindedness.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.500
Now what problems are facing us here in the West,

00:46:06.834 --> 00:46:08.083
we should try to understand.

00:46:08.375 --> 00:46:11.750
As somebody in America asked Me, "What's wrong with the West?"

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.041
We have to see what has happened to us in our evolution.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.999
When we evolved through the industrial development,

00:46:35.291 --> 00:46:38.709
we developed certain temperaments and certain value system.

00:46:48.834 --> 00:46:51.250
Industrialization was a good idea,

00:46:51.583 --> 00:46:53.917
but there is no discretion where to stop it.

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:03.375
And that's how when we go to very industrialized countries

00:47:03.667 --> 00:47:06.834
we think we are just eating chemicals and not food.

00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:17.583
Now the balance has to be maintained,

00:47:20.959 --> 00:47:22.375
but how?

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.375
By knowing about the roots.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.041
Now the first problem I feel about the Western mind

00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:36.917
is that it is a mental being;

00:47:43.458 --> 00:47:48.750
it has developed this mental capacity beyond balance.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.709
Like in the industries we have to have new things

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:57.959
made all the time;

00:47:58.291 --> 00:48:00.875
every time we have to sell some goods

00:48:01.208 --> 00:48:02.542
we must have new fashions,

00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:05.333
otherwise the machines will be starving.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.083
In the same way our brain starts producing new things,

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.583
that's how these things are man-made.

00:48:43.999 --> 00:48:47.291
With mental projection we start thinking

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:49.291
of all the time new things

00:48:49.625 --> 00:48:52.250
and we appreciate whatever comes new to us.

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.625
We have to take to new things,

00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:06.709
but not to something that is absolutely devoid

00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:09.375
of any traditional value.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:20.959
Like the other day I said that

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.625
"What's so special about Freud,

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:26.000
why did you accept him and why not Jung?"

00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:40.250
The reason was given that he gave us very new ideas.

00:49:44.917 --> 00:49:47.709
Anything new is not always good;

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.667
for example plastic was new once upon a time,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
you know what are the results of plastic development.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:05.250
If that is true about matter, what about the spirit?

00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:12.333
So when we seek also the truth,

00:50:12.625 --> 00:50:16.375
we try to get to a new method all the time.

00:50:23.375 --> 00:50:25.291
And I think the evil

00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:30.333
that came in forms of wrong type of gurus

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.709
are the product of this kind of demand.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.667
Only seventy to hundred years back, I should say, in India,

00:50:55.959 --> 00:50:59.583
suddenly a new wave of some new ideas

00:50:59.917 --> 00:51:02.917
about the knowledge of the roots started.

00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:14.709
Some things that they talk of are not written in the Vedas

00:51:15.041 --> 00:51:21.375
nor in the Puranas, nor in any books of oriental knowledge;

00:51:31.417 --> 00:51:35.875
nor in any books that are written after Christ

00:51:36.125 --> 00:51:41.125
like the Bible, or Koran after Mohammed Sahib,

00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:45.125
and also the writings of Zoroaster.

00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:57.458
It has no relationship whatsoever

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.959
to the ancient findings about the roots.

00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:14.125
So we had a problem about the religion in the same manner.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.709
For example, let us take Christianity:

00:52:26.458 --> 00:52:30.625
Christ came on this Earth, as you will know later on,

00:52:30.959 --> 00:52:34.834
to create a special awareness within us of the spirit.

00:52:44.208 --> 00:52:47.542
He resides inside within us

00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:54.417
in a special center, what we call the Agnya Chakra,

00:52:59.208 --> 00:53:04.291
and described in the Indian scriptures as Mahavishnu.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:10.917
And in the purest form

00:53:11.208 --> 00:53:14.959
He exists as the Omkara, as the Logos.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:23.291
So much is described about Him in the West,

00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:27.250
in the Western knowledge

00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:28.959
in the mental way,

00:53:29.208 --> 00:53:31.583
but actually it is very much discovered

00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:34.458
in the Indian philosophy.

00:53:50.667 --> 00:53:55.250
You cannot understand Christ by mental projection,

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.834
because He is beyond mind.

00:54:04.667 --> 00:54:08.000
He has Himself said, "You are to be born again."

00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:17.458
When Nicodemus said, "What do you mean â€˜to be born again'?

00:54:17.792 --> 00:54:20.291
Am I to enter into the womb of my mother?"

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:32.667
"No," He said, "whatever is born of flesh is flesh,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.542
and you are to be born of the Holy Ghost."

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.750
And what is the Holy Ghost?

00:54:47.709 --> 00:54:50.125
The bishop of Canterbury was asked this question,

00:54:50.458 --> 00:54:53.917
I saw it on the television, and he says, "I am agnostic."

00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:06.333
So the interviewer asked him,

00:55:06.667 --> 00:55:08.875
"What are you doing here, then?"

00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:14.792
He said, "I am doing my job."

00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:20.959
So the interviewer said, "All right, I am also doing my job"

00:55:23.875 --> 00:55:27.000
- mutual understanding between two mental projections.

00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:37.583
The Holy Ghost is the reflection within you,

00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:39.959
is this Kundalini.

00:55:48.834 --> 00:55:51.083
No, the Kundalini you just show them.

00:55:51.417 --> 00:55:55.917
The lower - no, no, kundalini you show, in the sacrum, now.

00:56:00.999 --> 00:56:03.625
Now this kundalini has been described

00:56:03.959 --> 00:56:08.375
very clearly in so many scriptures in India.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.375
It is said in the Bible that

00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:20.999
"I will appear before you like the tongues of flames."

00:56:27.375 --> 00:56:28.834
These are the centers,

00:56:29.166 --> 00:56:32.583
and this is the Tree of Life which is described.

00:56:37.625 --> 00:56:41.458
Now in the Koran it is described as Assas.

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:50.583
Nowhere in any one of these ancient scriptures,

00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.959
or up to the time of Kabira

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:56.625
which was hardly four, five hundred years back,

00:56:56.999 --> 00:57:01.166
nobody said that this kundalini gives you any trouble.

00:57:20.625 --> 00:57:23.625
But I have seen many people writing books

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.709
about kundalini later on,

00:57:26.125 --> 00:57:28.041
and there is a very thick book like that,

00:57:28.375 --> 00:57:29.917
I was amazed to see the description

00:57:30.208 --> 00:57:32.999
they have given by a German writer about the kundalini,

00:57:33.333 --> 00:57:37.333
that it can give you heat, it can give you diseases,

00:57:37.792 --> 00:57:40.792
it can make you dance, it can make you jump.

00:58:01.834 --> 00:58:06.250
So this is how they have tried to condition you

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:09.166
against your evolutionary process.

00:58:16.208 --> 00:58:20.166
And the religions which came after the great incarnations

00:58:20.542 --> 00:58:23.125
also tried the same trick.

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.834
Paul is the person who started

00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:36.709
this kind of conditioning in the Bible.

00:58:43.208 --> 00:58:45.917
Actually Paul had nothing to do with Christ.

00:58:49.333 --> 00:58:50.959
How is he in the Bible,

00:58:51.291 --> 00:58:53.999
I could not understand from My very childhood.

00:59:00.208 --> 00:59:02.166
And then he was born as Augustine

00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:03.959
who again made the religion,

00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:06.834
organized it, and conditioned it.

00:59:13.208 --> 00:59:15.250
And today, surprisingly,

00:59:15.625 --> 00:59:18.999
people are challenging Christ's birth,

00:59:25.792 --> 00:59:29.500
His divine powers of creating miracles.

00:59:33.667 --> 00:59:35.291
Now with their mental projection

00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:39.583
they are trying to prove that He was just like us.

00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:47.917
And also dirty filthy things

00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:50.542
are said about Him and His Mother.

00:59:57.709 --> 00:59:59.959
This is hell that we have created

01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:02.000
with our mental projections.

01:00:06.125 --> 01:00:08.208
How dare we say these things

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.375
about such a great personality like Christ!

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:20.500
It is our ego which has made us so bold and so arrogant,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.208
that we are preparing our own destruction

01:00:32.792 --> 01:00:34.750
by challenging such personalities,

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:38.959
which can really protect us and guide us to our ascent.

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:50.000
This is again the result of this newness,

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:52.875
because the mind wants to find something new all the time,

01:00:53.166 --> 01:00:55.000
develops this ego.

01:01:03.458 --> 01:01:05.291
Like in America if you go,

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:09.166
you better ask them how to open the bathroom taps,

01:01:09.458 --> 01:01:11.250
because every tap is different.

01:01:11.583 --> 01:01:14.375
You may just press onto something and you may get drenched,

01:01:14.667 --> 01:01:16.999
because they want to have every place new.

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:29.625
And they take hours together to decide

01:01:29.999 --> 01:01:32.375
what kind of taps they are going to have.

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.834
Getting into the car, American car,

01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.000
better ask them what, how to open the door,

01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:43.166
because if there is an accident you may not know,

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:45.041
it may be something new.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:02.542
This power to decide has gone so far

01:02:02.834 --> 01:02:08.000
that people really appear to be just like stupid children.

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:19.083
Ego stops the maturity of a person.

01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:24.625
The conditioning of the ego is the worst of all,

01:02:24.959 --> 01:02:27.000
which cannot be removed.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:36.041
If you are conditioned by your superego

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:38.500
you get your pains, you get your troubles,

01:02:38.834 --> 01:02:41.041
but when you have got your ego

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:44.667
you trouble others, you aggress others.

01:03:00.792 --> 01:03:02.792
Then to overcome the ego

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:06.000
they try again some mental processes,

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:17.208
that they try to dress up like primitive people.

01:03:21.959 --> 01:03:24.125
By dressing up like primitive people

01:03:24.458 --> 01:03:27.917
this brain is not going to become primitive.

01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:39.625
I mean, you know that it has reached its maximum now;

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:43.625
it should stop behaving in that stupid manner.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:57.625
Like in England if you go you'll find people are using

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.750
funny colors, to dress funny colors on their hair,

01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.834
and they call themselves punks.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:22.792
So I asked some of them who came to our program,

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:27.709
"Why do you do these kinds of things to yourself?"

01:04:37.542 --> 01:04:41.375
So they said that this makes people very attractive.

01:04:46.834 --> 01:04:48.208
To Me they look like clowns,

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.834
but to them they thought

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:52.667
that everybody feels attracted by that.

01:05:01.417 --> 01:05:02.999
So the second curse I find

01:05:03.291 --> 01:05:08.333
is that we want everybody should feel attracted towards us.

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:24.083
But what's the use?

01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:28.875
It's a joyless pursuit.

01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:36.375
If everyone is attracted towards us,

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.458
what does he get or what do you get out of that person?

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:42.125
- I fail to understand.

01:05:49.709 --> 01:05:52.875
But on the contrary, you get into trouble.

01:05:55.417 --> 01:05:58.000
I mean, of course, if you become like punks

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.250
you can develop horrible blindness.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:11.750
Or maybe you might develop

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:14.542
some problems of your skin in the head.

01:06:19.792 --> 01:06:22.709
But the way you move your eyes all the time

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.542
to see how many are attracted by you,

01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:27.125
you know what you can get?

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:28.500
This Altmiser's [Shri Mataji may mean "Alzheimer's"]

01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:35.583
disease that is coming up now is the early lunatic behavior.

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.041
Now in America they have discovered

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.417
that before the age of thirty-five,

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:58.041
one out of the five becomes insane

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:02.000
- out of five, can you imagine?

01:07:02.417 --> 01:07:03.834
Out of five;

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:06.834
that's what I today I read it in Reader's Digest.

01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:16.625
Can become, can become.

01:07:20.999 --> 01:07:22.625
Altmiser's [Alzheimer's?] disease they call it.

01:07:22.959 --> 01:07:24.291
Altmiser's [Alzheimer's?] disease;

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:27.041
a new disease they said.

01:07:27.917 --> 01:07:30.625
It's a name of the scientist, Altmiser [Alzheimer?] or something.

01:07:35.125 --> 01:07:38.750
And they blame that if you lived after thirty-five

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:41.999
these things start propagating.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.875
But in a simple country like India

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:57.917
or other countries where they are not so developed

01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:02.166
to flirt around, they don't have this disease.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:14.625
That's why Christ has said,

01:08:14.959 --> 01:08:17.542
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:26.500
And it is so difficult to understand

01:08:26.834 --> 01:08:30.458
that the people who go to church just want this.

01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:41.458
I'm sorry I have to talk about this,

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:44.834
because I notice it everywhere I go in the West.

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:48.250
This is a terrible disease that is crawling up now.

01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:01.834
It is to look at very frivolous,

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:07.875
but it is not, it has very deep implications.

01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:21.166
The eyes have to be so innocent

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.834
that there should be no greed and lust

01:09:24.166 --> 01:09:26.208
expressed through them.

01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:38.291
The only solution I find is the kundalini awakening

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:42.542
and realization, through which Christ is awakened within you

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:45.625
in your central nervous system.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:06.083
In the Agnya Chakra He resides,

01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:08.834
which is on the optic chiasma

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.792
- which is in the optic chiasma.

01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:23.333
If there is no innocence in a person,

01:10:26.834 --> 01:10:29.083
then this Agnya Chakra catches.

01:10:33.917 --> 01:10:38.125
And this is the greatest purification that we need today.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:48.500
Imagine, the people who say they are Christians,

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.583
these are Christian nations,

01:10:50.959 --> 01:10:54.542
are the people going just against Christ

01:11:04.875 --> 01:11:07.000
- it is very surprising.

01:11:08.583 --> 01:11:11.333
Whatever is preached by someone - like in India

01:11:11.625 --> 01:11:15.125
it is said that in everyone resides the spirit;

01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:23.000
but the stupid intellectuals of India

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:26.291
are very busy with the caste system.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.458
Such intellectuals must understand

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:40.875
that they cannot intellectualize God.

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:48.500
People don't like it when I tell them

01:11:48.834 --> 01:11:51.125
that you have to purify yourself

01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:54.959
to become the innocent personality.

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:09.959
The problem of the West today is, it has lost its value

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:13.000
as far as the purification is concerned.

01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:23.500
The purification is not of the body,

01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:26.333
is not how you live clean outside,

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:31.166
it is not how you represent yourself, but it is within.

01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:47.959
The destruction is not going to work out from without,

01:12:48.208 --> 01:12:49.583
it is within ourselves

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:52.750
we are building up our destruction every moment.

01:13:05.166 --> 01:13:08.333
In 1972 when I first went to America,

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:11.917
I told them that "You do not take to Freudian theories,

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:15.083
and don't indulge into nonsensical perversions.

01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:17.792
If you do that, you may develop a disease

01:13:18.041 --> 01:13:20.999
which will kill the whole nation, and nations."

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:39.917
And you know the epidemic of AIDS has started.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:49.625
You'll be happy to know that

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:51.709
through your kundalini awakening

01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:54.166
you can cure all these diseases;

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:04.417
because when the kundalini is awakened,

01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:06.375
the greatest thing that happens is

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:12.250
that whatever you have done so far is completely finished.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:27.959
It happens in every chakra, but specially at the Agnya.

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:37.959
At Agnya Chakra, when she opens out the Agnya Chakra,

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.875
the deity of Christ is awakened.

01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:53.291
And the ego and superego

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:59.083
which have made us into a egg-like structure

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:14.083
are just sucked in

01:15:16.166 --> 01:15:18.041
spontaneously,

01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:22.542
because kundalini is a living force

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.917
and that cleanses you completely.

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.792
Then you believe that Christ died

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:35.917
for our cleansing and purification.

01:15:41.917 --> 01:15:44.625
He suffered and He was crucified for that,

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.625
so that He could come into that little space

01:15:47.999 --> 01:15:50.834
between the ego and superego.

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:06.875
Now the time has come to prove

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:13.208
all these great incarnations and all the great scriptures.

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:25.333
Now, when we talk of deities, people get quite stunned

01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.834
because they have never heard about it.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.542
Deities are the milestones,

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:46.125
like the people who came to save us, the leaders.

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:57.999
They had divine force within them,

01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:02.750
and every time they came on this earth

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:06.000
they tried to give us a new awareness.

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:16.750
Like we can start from the first chakra,

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:19.917
is nothing but where the carbon was formed

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:23.583
in the chemical periodical law.

01:17:36.458 --> 01:17:38.375
By the formation of carbon only

01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:40.250
we could have organic chemistry

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:44.417
and by that later on we had amino acids,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.500
and then amino acids formed the life.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:09.291
Then from the life came, as you know, amoeba,

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:13.000
and from amoeba today we are human beings.

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:27.959
But why don't we think about the reason,

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.542
the cause, why we have become human beings?

01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:41.000
Have we got something special about it,

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:45.999
that only we people should become human beings?

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:56.875
And what is the purpose of our lives?

01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:01.917
Is it only to look at your watches

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.834
and waste your time in gambling?

01:19:12.792 --> 01:19:14.792
Is it for that we are born

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.625
- not to have any respect for ourself?

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:28.542
To be frivolous is a crime in the eyes of the Divine.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:39.333
You must know that you are very deep personalities.

01:19:42.834 --> 01:19:46.375
See the seven storeys you are built into.

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.041
You are the epitome of all the instruments

01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:57.625
that you could think of.

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:08.375
Now only, what has to happen to you is the last triggering.

01:20:14.917 --> 01:20:18.792
And once that happens you just get completely purified,

01:20:23.583 --> 01:20:26.625
you become then the real instrument.

01:20:29.667 --> 01:20:33.125
As every instrument has to be connected to the mains,

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:40.083
in the same way you are to be connected.

01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:45.959
And then you realize how fantastic you are,

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:51.542
how dynamic you are,

01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:55.333
what great powers you have.

01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:01.000
But it is not meant for the frivolous

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:09.667
or for the people who have no respect for their own beings.

01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:18.709
It only happens to people who are true and honestly seeking,

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.125
truly and honestly seeking.

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:32.083
So it is important for us to know

01:21:32.458 --> 01:21:36.709
that if we are going

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:41.917
to be the citizens of God's domain,

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:46.458
we have to get our realization, our Self.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.750
Buddha went to this limit that He said,

01:22:04.041 --> 01:22:07.417
"Don't talk of God, just talk of Self."

01:22:15.166 --> 01:22:18.000
Even Mahavira said the same thing.

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.500
The Zen went even further,

01:22:23.834 --> 01:22:28.166
that it said only talk of thoughtless awareness.

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.999
That is the first awareness

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:41.000
one achieves as a kundalini awakening,

01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:46.083
that you become completely aware without any thoughts.

01:22:58.041 --> 01:23:02.417
Like when you see a beautiful lake

01:23:02.834 --> 01:23:04.500
which has no ripples on it,

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:09.291
you see the complete creation around it reflected into it,

01:23:09.625 --> 01:23:12.041
giving complete joy.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:29.333
So far we have not known the joy, which has no duality.

01:23:35.999 --> 01:23:38.834
We know happiness which is nothing but ego pampering,

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:44.000
and when ego collapses a little, then we become unhappy -

01:24:04.083 --> 01:24:07.208
that is the illusion we have.

01:24:13.041 --> 01:24:16.750
To get to reality we have to be the Self,

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:25.000
and Self is beyond ego and superego.

01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:35.166
Then you no more live on relative terminology,

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:44.333
but you live with absolute.

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:50.125
Like you just feel the cool breeze in the hand

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:53.208
as if it is the computer that has started,

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:56.875
and you are having a rapport with the Divine.

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:10.875
Even when you place your hand towards any question,

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:13.667
you can get the answer as cool breeze,

01:25:13.999 --> 01:25:16.583
meaning "yes, very good" and as hot breeze,

01:25:16.959 --> 01:25:19.500
meaning "bad"; but you might even get blisters

01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:22.500
if you try to go near somebody

01:25:22.834 --> 01:25:25.792
who is a possessed personality.

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:49.625
All the information comes to you from the unconscious,

01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:55.250
which has now become conscious on the central nervous system.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.417
This is what one has to understand,

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:09.291
that your unconscious has become, has to become the conscious.

01:26:16.166 --> 01:26:19.875
So whatever information you have been getting so far

01:26:20.166 --> 01:26:21.208
from the unconscious

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:24.792
is completely clearly understood by logic.

01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:37.208
So the first thing that happens

01:26:37.458 --> 01:26:39.709
to your central nervous system, that you become

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.750
- again I say you become, collectively conscious.

01:26:43.041 --> 01:26:45.917
It is not a mental projection, but you just become.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.917
Also you know about yourself

01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:03.834
because you know about your own centers,

01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:06.458
and if you know how to cure these centers

01:27:06.917 --> 01:27:11.917
then you are perfect, in perfect health, in perfect joy.

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:30.792
This was for the introduction of Sahaja Yoga:

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:38.999
saha means "with", ja means "born" - it's spontaneous.

01:27:46.959 --> 01:27:52.250
And "union" means, "union" is the meaning of the word "yoga."

01:27:56.917 --> 01:28:00.792
Also it has another meaning, which means yukti,

01:28:01.083 --> 01:28:04.000
means "the trick."

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:12.542
Yukti.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:16.709
And also the, it means the deftness,

01:28:17.041 --> 01:28:20.041
how to handle this power when it starts flowing through you,

01:28:20.417 --> 01:28:23.917
to know everything about it; so it is to be decoded.

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:34.999
All this is your own.

01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:40.375
One enlightened light enlightens another light.

01:28:45.834 --> 01:28:48.709
There is no obligation.

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:52.542
It's all your own,

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:56.250
which you have to get it

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.083
and then establish it.

01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:03.166
All this has to be free

01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:11.875
because it is nature's gift, it is living process,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.625
you cannot pay for it.

01:29:20.083 --> 01:29:24.750
You cannot pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed,

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.542
do you pay anything?

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:37.417
How much do we pay to the flowers for becoming fruits?

01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:44.375
Nature doesn't understand money;

01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:47.500
in the same way God doesn't understand money.

01:29:53.667 --> 01:29:55.667
But the way we have lived so far,

01:29:55.959 --> 01:29:59.750
we have paid always money for God's work.

01:30:08.041 --> 01:30:10.542
Specially in Switzerland people believe

01:30:10.999 --> 01:30:13.792
that if you give money to some countries,

01:30:14.125 --> 01:30:16.083
then you are doing God's work.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.959
Poverty is created by human beings, not by God.

01:30:31.625 --> 01:30:34.792
A country like India, ruled for three hundred years,

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:38.125
if it becomes poor what's so surprising?

01:30:46.208 --> 01:30:48.792
So that shows that by giving money

01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:51.083
you are not doing God's work.

01:30:57.542 --> 01:30:59.999
That's a human problem, created by human beings,

01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:02.667
solved by human beings.

01:31:08.917 --> 01:31:12.166
God's work is pure compassion:

01:31:15.333 --> 01:31:18.000
compassion which doesn't speak,

01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:23.542
which cannot be valued in money.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.999
It just flows, emits and acts.

01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:37.083
It doesn't expect anything,

01:31:38.291 --> 01:31:41.834
it cannot be controlled,

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.667
it cannot be killed,

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:49.834
it does not need any protection

01:31:51.333 --> 01:31:54.333
- this is what it is, God's work.

01:31:55.834 --> 01:31:58.999
Because who is the other, for God?

01:32:00.375 --> 01:32:04.208
We are all part and parcel of His being.

01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:09.709
If this hand is helping another hand,

01:32:10.041 --> 01:32:12.875
what obligation there is?

01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:20.667
So one must understand the difference

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.834
between the reality of doing a God's work,

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:27.709
and the illusion.

01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:40.458
It's the quality of Divine is such

01:32:44.375 --> 01:32:48.417
that it quenches your thirst as the water does.

01:32:53.333 --> 01:32:58.041
It gives you the light that guides you,

01:32:59.917 --> 01:33:05.875
it gives you the strength that makes you stand up on the right,

01:33:13.208 --> 01:33:15.500
it gives you the compassion

01:33:15.792 --> 01:33:20.500
that makes you enjoy your virtues,

01:33:27.375 --> 01:33:30.999
it gives you that attraction

01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:36.000
which takes you to higher planes of the spirit.

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:52.458
It discovers all the pearls in the ocean of illusion.

01:33:56.458 --> 01:33:59.999
It gives you that peace within and without,

01:34:03.542 --> 01:34:05.917
and you are always drenched in the showers

01:34:06.166 --> 01:34:08.709
of the bliss of the joy.

01:34:12.834 --> 01:34:15.333
It is your right to have it,

01:34:16.959 --> 01:34:19.500
you have to have it.

01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:24.375
This is what you are meant to be here

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:28.583
- but with humility.

01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:32.208
That is important,

01:34:33.875 --> 01:34:37.542
as a gesture of grace.

01:34:39.625 --> 01:34:41.834
When somebody gives you a medal,

01:34:42.166 --> 01:34:43.792
how you bend your head.

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:47.166
In the same way when you are adorned with this,

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:50.750
you have to bend your head before the Divine.

01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:12.625
When the audience claps for you, gives you a ovation,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.875
standing ovation, the actor bends before it,

01:35:27.625 --> 01:35:30.999
he salutes to the audience.

01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:37.333
He salutes to the audience - all right?

01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:42.792
Now, in the same way we have to salute to the Divine.

01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:51.208
What we surrender is automatically

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:54.291
our ego and our conditioning.

01:36:01.542 --> 01:36:06.375
I hope today you all will receive your realization.

01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:17.083
And day after tomorrow when I speak on the spirit itself,

01:36:17.417 --> 01:36:20.709
I hope you'll make it convenient to come down.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.458
You have to later on establish it completely.

01:36:40.208 --> 01:36:43.083
Otherwise it will be like the parable of Christ,

01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:48.750
that the seeds which sprouted also

01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:52.125
did not take to roots.

01:37:12.166 --> 01:37:15.208
May God bless you all.

01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:28.709
You want Me, to ask some questions?

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.792
Good. Let's have now the experience.

01:37:57.166 --> 01:38:00.250
How to protect oneself from somebody

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:03.959
from whom you feel on the chakras something not nice?

01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:06.834
Ego problem.

01:38:11.417 --> 01:38:14.583
Ah, all right.

01:38:16.792 --> 01:38:18.792
That is what you have to learn.

01:38:21.542 --> 01:38:24.083
Before realization also you catch from others,

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.291
but you don't feel it.

01:38:32.166 --> 01:38:34.834
But after realization you feel, but temporarily,

01:38:35.166 --> 01:38:37.500
just like an indicator.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.999
So you have to learn how to protect,

01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:49.250
and when you come to our center

01:38:52.959 --> 01:38:55.208
they will tell you everything elaborately.

01:39:04.166 --> 01:39:07.083
Whenever I have come to Switzerland

01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:10.583
or any other place I've seen the houses are always full,

01:39:10.999 --> 01:39:12.625
people like to listen to Me;

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.709
but they don't listen to one thing,

01:39:15.083 --> 01:39:18.375
that they have to make it a practice,

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:24.208
a complete understanding, a complete happening.

01:39:48.834 --> 01:39:53.125
There is no course, there's no course for it,

01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:58.250
but you have to yourself understand

01:39:58.583 --> 01:40:00.208
from others who have achieved,

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:13.834
and you can be masters yourself.

01:40:21.166 --> 01:40:24.500
Only thing, you have to give some time.

01:40:30.417 --> 01:40:33.792
Swiss are very good at making good watches,

01:40:38.208 --> 01:40:41.458
and they want people to save their time;

01:40:44.583 --> 01:40:47.250
but they have no time for God.

01:40:49.333 --> 01:40:51.834
Same with Japanese who are very good at watches,

01:40:52.125 --> 01:40:54.500
they have no time for God.

01:41:00.667 --> 01:41:03.959
They make watches for others, not for themselves.

01:41:06.999 --> 01:41:09.542
They are busy making watches.

01:41:11.834 --> 01:41:16.166
Now you have to be selfish also, you must look at yourself.

01:41:19.542 --> 01:41:22.542
Better save some time for God

01:41:25.625 --> 01:41:27.709
and for yourself.

01:41:31.458 --> 01:41:35.333
So now we'll have the - if you have any questions,

01:41:35.667 --> 01:41:37.792
you can always know that

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:43.625
we have a regular center in Switzerland,

01:41:43.999 --> 01:41:46.667
and you can always go and meet those people,

01:41:46.959 --> 01:41:50.291
get all the answers from them.

01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:13.125
Now, first of all I have to request you all

01:42:13.542 --> 01:42:15.750
to forgive yourself

01:42:22.375 --> 01:42:25.166
and to forget whatever I've said,

01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:31.875
because I do not want that

01:42:32.125 --> 01:42:34.834
you should feel guilty about anything.

01:42:39.667 --> 01:42:41.542
This is the biggest hurdle in the West,

01:42:41.875 --> 01:42:44.875
that people feel guilty for everything.

01:42:51.333 --> 01:42:55.917
I mean even if you wear a something which is not matching,

01:42:56.208 --> 01:42:58.834
people start feeling guilty.

01:43:02.333 --> 01:43:05.667
It is too much, the way we feel guilty,

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.125
so I have to make very humble request

01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.375
that you don't feel guilty at all.

01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:22.625
With whatever you have been doing,

01:43:22.917 --> 01:43:24.458
whatever has been there,

01:43:24.834 --> 01:43:26.166
one must know that

01:43:26.542 --> 01:43:29.999
you are the temple of God Almighty,

01:43:39.291 --> 01:43:42.375
and your kundalini is quite capable

01:43:42.792 --> 01:43:46.083
of giving you realization, purifying you completely;

01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:49.166
but don't feel guilty about anything.

01:44:00.125 --> 01:44:03.208
That is a first condition:

01:44:06.458 --> 01:44:09.125
we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.999
because we are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:44:23.834 --> 01:44:25.792
Second thing I have to request is that

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.375
we have to take the advantage of the Mother Earth,

01:44:28.792 --> 01:44:31.500
though I know it is a little cool, but doesn't matter,

01:44:31.792 --> 01:44:36.041
you can take out your shoes and put your feet on the ground;

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:40.875
because the shoes also sometimes are a little bit tight,

01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:43.917
and keep you out of touch with the Mother Earth.

01:45:00.917 --> 01:45:03.959
It's a very, very simple method,

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:08.333
extremely simple, because we are just ready.

01:45:08.625 --> 01:45:12.041
It's extremely simple because you are just ready.

01:45:18.375 --> 01:45:21.792
Now first of all we'll have to see that

01:45:22.166 --> 01:45:27.999
we try to feel our own chakras

01:45:28.417 --> 01:45:31.542
and clear them out ourselves,

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:45.375
because if there are any complications, they can be removed.

01:45:52.333 --> 01:45:56.750
For that I will tell you how to place your right hand,

01:45:57.166 --> 01:46:00.166
but the left hand should be towards Me like this,

01:46:00.667 --> 01:46:04.417
symbolizing your desire to get your realization.

01:46:24.959 --> 01:46:27.375
Now the right hand should be used

01:46:27.667 --> 01:46:32.542
for touching centers on the left-hand side.

01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:40.000
And it's very simple:

01:46:40.208 --> 01:46:45.500
first we'll put our hand on the heart, when I tell you.

01:46:54.542 --> 01:46:57.834
Then we have to put it in the upper part of the abdomen,

01:47:02.417 --> 01:47:04.792
then in the lower part of the abdomen,

01:47:08.333 --> 01:47:11.667
then again on the upper part of the abdomen,

01:47:16.083 --> 01:47:18.250
then on the heart again.

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:24.542
Now one has to place the hand here,

01:47:27.999 --> 01:47:32.250
in the corner of the neck and the shoulder

01:47:36.041 --> 01:47:41.083
- from the front, like this, not from back.

01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:48.500
This is the center which is the worst always,

01:47:48.959 --> 01:47:52.208
which catches when you feel guilty.

01:47:59.959 --> 01:48:03.250
Look at it as if you are looking at something jocular.

01:48:03.583 --> 01:48:06.083
What is there to feel guilty?

01:48:14.583 --> 01:48:16.083
Another mental projection;

01:48:18.667 --> 01:48:20.667
it's an illusion.

01:48:21.208 --> 01:48:23.834
All right. Now, then you have to place your hand

01:48:24.041 --> 01:48:28.041
on top of your forehead across like this,

01:48:32.250 --> 01:48:34.709
and then on the back.

01:48:37.625 --> 01:48:40.250
Then you have to stretch your palm

01:48:40.709 --> 01:48:45.250
and put this part on the fontanel bone area.

01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:55.999
Press it hard, and you have to move it seven times clockwise

01:48:56.291 --> 01:48:58.667
when I tell you.

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:11.417
Now, do not try to stop your thoughts or anything,

01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:14.208
it will all work out spontaneously.

01:49:20.458 --> 01:49:22.166
If there are too much thoughts,

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:25.875
then you can put your attention here on the fontanel bone.

01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:34.375
So let us start now.

01:49:37.208 --> 01:49:39.291
All of you must do it.

01:49:39.583 --> 01:49:42.041
If those who do not want to do it should go out,

01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:45.959
don't trouble others, because others become self-conscious.

01:50:02.166 --> 01:50:04.458
It is not civil.

01:50:07.417 --> 01:50:12.333
Now, everyone has to close the eyes.

01:50:16.417 --> 01:50:18.917
Take out your spectacles

01:50:23.917 --> 01:50:25.417
because you don't have to see anything,

01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:28.250
you have to keep your eyes shut.

01:50:47.375 --> 01:50:49.750
Now.

01:50:52.625 --> 01:50:55.750
Now, put your left hand towards Me just like this,

01:51:01.959 --> 01:51:04.625
and have faith in yourself.

01:51:09.250 --> 01:51:12.000
Now, forgive yourself and close your eyes,

01:51:12.375 --> 01:51:14.542
keep your eyes shut.

01:51:20.959 --> 01:51:23.917
Close your eyes, put your right hand on your heart

01:51:24.166 --> 01:51:26.625
and left hand towards Me.

01:51:33.667 --> 01:51:36.000
On your heart.

01:51:36.458 --> 01:51:39.709
Left hand towards Me and right hand to be used

01:51:40.041 --> 01:51:43.709
for the action. Tell them.

01:51:51.333 --> 01:51:54.166
Now, please put your right hand on the heart,

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.500
right hand on the heart.

01:52:02.542 --> 01:52:07.500
So the left hand has to be kept on your lap, upward.

01:52:17.667 --> 01:52:20.333
Be comfortable,

01:52:21.542 --> 01:52:24.041
you have to be comfortable.

01:52:31.375 --> 01:52:36.333
Now, you have to ask Me

01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:39.999
a very fundamental question.

01:52:44.417 --> 01:52:46.999
In the heart resides the spirit,

01:52:47.291 --> 01:52:50.834
so please ask Me a question three times,

01:52:51.125 --> 01:52:53.333
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

01:52:53.625 --> 01:52:56.375
If you can call Me "Shri Mataji" it's all right, or "Mother"

01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:58.709
- whichever suits you.

01:53:31.125 --> 01:53:34.208
You must really have faith in yourself.

01:53:57.709 --> 01:54:01.875
Now, take down this right hand on your stomach,

01:54:02.125 --> 01:54:05.291
on the upper part on the left-hand side,

01:54:14.125 --> 01:54:16.000
and press it.

01:54:20.166 --> 01:54:24.250
This is the center of the mastery,

01:54:29.375 --> 01:54:33.417
which is created by prophets who came on this earth.

01:54:38.667 --> 01:54:43.000
So here, you have to ask Me another question.

01:54:43.375 --> 01:54:48.709
If you are your spirit, then you have to be your own guide.

01:54:49.083 --> 01:54:52.542
So you have to say, "Mother, am I my own guide?

01:55:12.834 --> 01:55:14.792
Am I the prophet?

01:55:19.542 --> 01:55:22.208
Am I my own guru,

01:55:27.417 --> 01:55:29.999
am I my own master?"

01:56:01.291 --> 01:56:04.999
Three times.

01:56:10.208 --> 01:56:13.458
Now, please take down your hand

01:56:13.792 --> 01:56:16.583
in the lower part of the abdomen and press it.

01:56:26.375 --> 01:56:28.999
This is the center

01:56:33.458 --> 01:56:38.041
of the knowledge about the Divine.

01:56:44.959 --> 01:56:47.208
This knowledge is not mental,

01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:49.250
but the technique

01:56:49.625 --> 01:56:54.166
that builds into your central nervous system.

01:57:04.291 --> 01:57:09.000
So here you have to say something,

01:57:09.625 --> 01:57:12.500
because I cannot force you

01:57:13.166 --> 01:57:19.458
to accept the procedure of kundalini awakening.

01:57:32.999 --> 01:57:37.166
Now, you have to yourself ask

01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:41.041
that you want to know about the true knowledge,

01:57:41.375 --> 01:57:43.125
about the pure knowledge.

01:57:43.500 --> 01:57:44.834
So please say six times,

01:57:45.166 --> 01:57:48.000
"Mother, may I have the true knowledge?

01:57:48.291 --> 01:57:50.625
May I have the pure knowledge?"

01:57:50.959 --> 01:57:54.542
With this saying the kundalini will start moving.

01:58:24.625 --> 01:58:27.458
Six times, please ask the question,

01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:31.375
"Mother, please may I have the true knowledge,

01:58:31.875 --> 01:58:34.291
the pure knowledge?"

01:59:10.291 --> 01:59:14.458
Now we have to make way for the kundalini, which is awakened.

01:59:14.792 --> 01:59:16.250
Please keep your eyes shut.

01:59:22.834 --> 01:59:24.000
Raise your right hand

01:59:24.333 --> 01:59:27.417
and put it in the upper part of the abdomen.

01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:41.041
Now, please keep your eyes shut, don't open in between,

01:59:41.375 --> 01:59:43.500
because attention has to go inside.

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:55.834
At this point, as I told you, is the center of your mastery.

02:00:07.166 --> 02:00:13.583
Now here you have to say with full faith in yourself,

02:00:13.999 --> 02:00:15.917
asserting,

02:00:18.291 --> 02:00:21.792
"Mother, I am my own master.

02:00:30.625 --> 02:00:34.667
I am my own guide, I am my own prophet."

02:00:43.125 --> 02:00:45.500
Please say it ten times.

02:01:17.917 --> 02:01:20.166
Please do not feel guilty when you say that,

02:01:20.458 --> 02:01:21.959
please do not feel guilty.

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:33.291
You are the prophet.

02:01:35.834 --> 02:01:40.333
William Blake has said that "Men of God," meaning seekers,

02:01:40.999 --> 02:01:42.041
"will become prophets,

02:01:42.333 --> 02:01:44.917
and they'll have powers to make others prophets."

02:01:56.834 --> 02:01:58.959
You are the men of God,

02:02:02.999 --> 02:02:05.500
and you will become prophets.

02:02:06.792 --> 02:02:09.500
Ah - now, better.

02:02:12.083 --> 02:02:14.834
William Blake helped!

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.875
Now, please raise your hand to your heart.

02:02:42.792 --> 02:02:45.375
You should not say things speedily,

02:02:45.709 --> 02:02:48.542
but with understanding and with depth.

02:03:01.333 --> 02:03:05.375
Now at this point you have to again assert

02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:07.917
with full confidence in yourself and say,

02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:12.500
"Mother, I am the spirit." Say it twelve times, please

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.999
... Now, now better. Working out.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:55.917
Now, raise your hand onto the corner

02:04:56.625 --> 02:05:01.166
between your neck and the shoulder.

02:05:09.417 --> 02:05:15.041
Take it quite back so that you can press on the bone.

02:05:26.458 --> 02:05:29.709
Here you have to say,

02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:34.792
with full faith in yourself,

02:05:35.083 --> 02:05:38.917
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all."

02:05:48.834 --> 02:05:54.500
You have to know that apart from God

02:05:54.917 --> 02:05:59.667
who is the ocean of love and compassion,

02:06:00.041 --> 02:06:05.667
above all He is the ocean of forgiveness.

02:06:16.917 --> 02:06:20.000
Whatever your guilt may be,

02:06:20.542 --> 02:06:24.667
compared to the power of the Divine to forgive,

02:06:24.959 --> 02:06:27.500
you cannot have any guilt.

02:06:38.417 --> 02:06:43.542
So please say sixteen times, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all."

02:07:24.083 --> 02:07:27.834
Even some people feel that they cannot believe

02:07:28.125 --> 02:07:29.792
that they are not guilty,

02:07:30.125 --> 02:07:33.542
so to punish themselves they can say it 108 times!

02:07:47.458 --> 02:07:49.750
That's better.

02:07:50.083 --> 02:07:53.625
Nobody wants to have the punishment, is a good idea.

02:08:02.667 --> 02:08:05.083
Better?

02:08:08.583 --> 02:08:13.583
Now, raise your hand to your forehead, please

02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:24.208
and - with the palm towards your forehead,

02:08:24.542 --> 02:08:27.250
and press it on both the sides.

02:08:31.333 --> 02:08:34.542
Put it across, across.

02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:44.500
I mean, place it horizontally.

02:08:48.583 --> 02:08:51.417
And now press it hard.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.750
Here you have to say, not how many times

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.667
but from your heart,

02:09:02.959 --> 02:09:05.667
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

02:09:15.166 --> 02:09:17.625
Some people think that it's difficult,

02:09:17.959 --> 02:09:19.667
but it is a myth when you believe

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.792
that you forgive or you don't forgive.

02:09:33.208 --> 02:09:37.542
But if you forgive everyone,

02:09:38.041 --> 02:09:42.291
then you do not play into the hands of wrong people

02:09:42.625 --> 02:09:45.041
- in a mythical way, of course.

02:09:58.917 --> 02:10:04.583
Now, raise your hand and take it backwards

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:09.709
to your back side of your head, and hold it tight.

02:10:17.999 --> 02:10:21.542
Press your hand little backward and hold it tight.

02:10:25.959 --> 02:10:29.417
Now here you have to say,

02:10:30.500 --> 02:10:33.583
for your own satisfaction maybe,

02:10:34.834 --> 02:10:37.291
that "Oh Divine, please forgive me

02:10:37.625 --> 02:10:41.999
if I have done anything wrong against You."

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:15.999
Now stretch your hand,

02:11:16.208 --> 02:11:18.625
and put your palm on top of your head

02:11:18.999 --> 02:11:23.166
on the fontanel bone area and press it hard, very hard,

02:11:23.417 --> 02:11:24.999
in a clockwise manner,

02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:30.333
saying one thing, that you want your realization;

02:11:30.625 --> 02:11:33.667
because I cannot cross your freedom here again.

02:11:33.999 --> 02:11:36.959
So please say, "Mother, I want my realization.

02:11:37.208 --> 02:11:40.417
Please give me my realization," seven times.

02:11:49.208 --> 02:11:52.417
Press it with the palm only, not with the fingers.

02:13:52.999 --> 02:13:56.667
Now take down your hand slowly,

02:14:01.959 --> 02:14:05.208
open your eyes slowly.

02:14:10.208 --> 02:14:14.125
Place your right hand towards Me,

02:14:17.625 --> 02:14:22.125
and with the left hand you place it on your top of your head.

02:14:26.291 --> 02:14:28.041
Don't think, don't think,

02:14:28.333 --> 02:14:31.166
see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

02:14:46.542 --> 02:14:48.834
Change your hand, please.

02:14:50.458 --> 02:14:52.834
Put your right hand

02:14:54.792 --> 02:14:58.583
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out.

02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:09.208
Don't be nervous;

02:15:10.166 --> 02:15:13.375
it is subtle, it is very subtle.

02:15:15.999 --> 02:15:18.750
Now, change over again.

02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:34.000
Now, put your hands up like this and push back your head,

02:15:34.375 --> 02:15:36.999
and ask a question.

02:15:41.417 --> 02:15:46.999
On the mike - come nearer to the mike.

02:15:47.583 --> 02:15:48.750
Now ask a question,

02:15:48.999 --> 02:15:51.750
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

02:15:52.041 --> 02:15:53.750
Is this the Brahma Shakti?

02:15:54.041 --> 02:15:59.500
Is this the all-pervading God's love?"

02:16:17.125 --> 02:16:20.500
Now, bring down your hands, please.

02:16:22.583 --> 02:16:25.417
See for yourself.

02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:31.959
Don't think. Are you feeling it on your hand?

02:16:42.083 --> 02:16:45.291
Those who are feeling cool breeze on their hand

02:16:45.667 --> 02:16:48.166
- it's very subtle - or out of their head,

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:51.458
please raise your both the hands.

02:17:07.417 --> 02:17:09.875
Most of you have felt it.

02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:13.000
But I will now tell you how to protect yourself,

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:15.041
all of you should know how to protect;

02:17:15.458 --> 02:17:18.999
because some have not felt because they have a problem here,

02:17:19.375 --> 02:17:20.583
in the Vishuddhi Chakra.

02:17:20.875 --> 02:17:23.834
Or maybe they have not forgiven others.

02:17:41.834 --> 02:17:43.959
Try this. Put your right hand towards Me

02:17:44.208 --> 02:17:47.166
and your left hand like this, for balancing

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.625
- to the sky.

02:18:01.417 --> 02:18:04.875
This is now we use the ether.

02:18:22.083 --> 02:18:25.041
If you are feeling the cool or something down below,

02:18:25.333 --> 02:18:27.917
put it back like that,

02:18:28.166 --> 02:18:30.959
if you are feeling down below.

02:18:38.792 --> 02:18:43.041
These people are very speedy and they are very right-sided,

02:18:43.417 --> 02:18:45.000
so this is the problem they have.

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.792
Doesn't matter, it will work out.

02:18:55.583 --> 02:18:58.083
Think too much!

02:19:02.250 --> 02:19:04.709
Futuristic, they are futuristic.

02:19:10.959 --> 02:19:16.291
Facing your problems only, you solve them.

02:19:21.041 --> 02:19:23.125
Not mental projection

02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:25.709
but facing, just seeing them as they are.

02:19:31.500 --> 02:19:33.458
You are the spirit, you are not the problem;

02:19:33.834 --> 02:19:35.792
you are beyond all this.

02:19:40.125 --> 02:19:41.834
After realization the word "problem"

02:19:42.083 --> 02:19:44.999
goes out of your dictionary!

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.500
Now, put the left hand like this

02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:57.625
and the right hand towards the Mother Earth ....

02:20:08.291 --> 02:20:11.792
Better, much better.

02:20:33.458 --> 02:20:36.000
Don't think.

02:20:37.041 --> 02:20:39.999
You can do it now.

02:20:47.959 --> 02:20:52.417
Now, I will tell you how to protect. It's very simple.

02:20:59.041 --> 02:21:03.583
You have to give protection to your auras.

02:21:03.917 --> 02:21:06.625
You can wear your glasses if you want to.

02:21:13.959 --> 02:21:15.125
That you must all do,

02:21:15.417 --> 02:21:18.208
whether you have felt the cool breeze or not.

02:21:23.458 --> 02:21:26.083
You give protection to your auras in this manner,

02:21:26.417 --> 02:21:27.875
that you put left hand like this

02:21:28.166 --> 02:21:30.125
and right hand around the auras,

02:21:30.458 --> 02:21:33.959
you take over your head and bring it down like that.

02:21:37.208 --> 02:21:39.458
Left hand towards Me.

02:21:49.792 --> 02:21:53.041
All right, let's do it seven times, for seven auras.

02:21:56.125 --> 02:21:59.375
One - don't think.

02:22:00.542 --> 02:22:03.375
Don't think!

02:22:05.041 --> 02:22:07.000
Three,

02:22:08.917 --> 02:22:11.583
four,

02:22:12.542 --> 02:22:15.041
five,

02:22:16.250 --> 02:22:18.291
six

02:22:18.792 --> 02:22:21.875
and seven.

02:22:22.291 --> 02:22:23.500
It's important.

02:22:23.792 --> 02:22:26.417
Now, how to raise your own kundalini,

02:22:26.709 --> 02:22:28.333
that's very simple again.

02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:37.375
Now put your left hand in front of your kundalini

02:22:37.709 --> 02:22:40.625
- you yourself can do it.

02:22:47.208 --> 02:22:50.750
And it should be moved from up, forward, down,

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.667
like that clockwise, right hand.

02:22:53.959 --> 02:22:58.000
Left hand should be steady, left hand should be straight.

02:23:07.583 --> 02:23:09.375
And then down.

02:23:09.875 --> 02:23:13.583
And this hand should move straight.

02:23:16.999 --> 02:23:19.959
Attention should be on the left hand.

02:23:22.083 --> 02:23:25.000
Now, try to move the hand properly.

02:23:25.375 --> 02:23:27.041
On top of your head you have to take it,

02:23:27.333 --> 02:23:28.750
take it on top of your head.

02:23:28.959 --> 02:23:33.083
Bend back your head, and give it a twist,

02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:36.125
and give it a twist, big twist,

02:23:36.542 --> 02:23:39.709
and tie it up like a knot.

02:23:40.417 --> 02:23:45.542
Again let's do, to fix it up properly. Again do it, please.

02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:49.041
Second time, let's just do it.

02:23:49.417 --> 02:23:52.959
Now push back your head, and give it a big twist,

02:23:55.250 --> 02:23:57.291
and give it a knot.

02:23:57.667 --> 02:24:01.083
Now, third time same way, but three knots.

02:24:04.250 --> 02:24:05.709
Again.

02:24:06.041 --> 02:24:08.542
Now it's moving fast.

02:24:09.083 --> 02:24:11.417
Put it - now one,

02:24:12.999 --> 02:24:15.083
again give a twist;

02:24:15.458 --> 02:24:17.000
two,

02:24:17.333 --> 02:24:20.208
again a twist; and a three.

02:24:20.542 --> 02:24:23.542
Now see your hands.

02:24:26.999 --> 02:24:29.792
You feel much lighter.

02:24:35.625 --> 02:24:39.417
Feel it on your head also, cool breeze coming out.

02:24:43.625 --> 02:24:46.458
You'll be absolutely relaxed.

02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:49.125
You cannot think now;

02:24:49.542 --> 02:24:51.166
but if you want, you can.

02:24:51.500 --> 02:24:55.250
But don't think about it, you can't think about it.

02:24:59.999 --> 02:25:03.500
Just feel it - all of you have got it.

02:25:10.834 --> 02:25:12.875
Good!

02:25:13.291 --> 02:25:16.583
You'll see, your eyes will be sparkling.

02:25:16.625 --> 02:25:19.458
There will be light in your eye.

02:25:23.375 --> 02:25:25.291
Now, you don't think.

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:27.542
Otherwise next time when I come, you'll say,

02:25:27.834 --> 02:25:30.125
"Mother, I have lost my vibrations."

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:36.083
If you think about it you cannot reach there.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.959
All right. Now if you want to shake hands with Me,

02:25:46.166 --> 02:25:47.667
I will sit here for you for a while.

02:25:47.999 --> 02:25:49.375
You can come round to shake hands.

02:25:49.667 --> 02:25:51.000
But Sahaja yogis, you need not

02:25:52.333 --> 02:25:55.083
- otherwise there's just no end to it!

02:26:14.375 --> 02:26:17.208
Ah, ah. You can come here and see.

02:26:17.542 --> 02:26:21.291
Did you feel the cool breeze? Did you? Now that I can see.

02:26:21.583 --> 02:26:23.250
Philip, just help him, just see

02:26:23.542 --> 02:26:25.417
- the gentleman didn't feel the cool breeze.

02:26:25.875 --> 02:26:27.166
He's on the, more on the right.

02:26:27.542 --> 02:26:30.500
Give him a right to the ....

02:26:37.125 --> 02:26:40.792
All right. Just a minute, please, just a minute.

02:26:41.166 --> 02:26:44.667
Hallo, how are you? Felt it? You've enjoyed it?

02:26:51.709 --> 02:26:53.500
Hallo, how are you?

02:26:53.792 --> 02:26:55.999
May God bless you.

02:28:02.709 --> 02:28:05.375
Yes, I'll be there.

02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:13.709
No, I'll be - when will he be back? ....

02:28:17.375 --> 02:28:20.834
Oh, I see, and then London, he won't be there? ....

02:28:22.500 --> 02:28:25.166
He got his realization? ....

02:28:44.792 --> 02:28:46.250
Oh, I know, yes, I know.

02:28:46.542 --> 02:28:48.458
All right, so he can come to London?

02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:50.333
I'll be in London.

02:28:53.333 --> 02:28:57.625
All right .... All right, all right.

02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:07.291
Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you.

02:29:07.583 --> 02:29:11.166
You got your realization. Good ....

02:29:15.208 --> 02:29:20.000
Yes. May God bless you. I'm so very happy.

02:29:20.417 --> 02:29:21.583
Now you're all right.

02:29:21.917 --> 02:29:26.208
Now you must, you must completely become Sahaja yogis

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:27.917
so that you have full confidence.

02:29:28.375 --> 02:29:30.417
You must have full confidence, all right? ....

02:29:30.792 --> 02:29:35.458
I'm very happy it should happen. May God bless you.

02:29:43.667 --> 02:29:46.125
.... What happened to you?

02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:49.125
All right.

02:29:49.375 --> 02:29:52.375
So it has happened to you? Good.

02:29:54.375 --> 02:29:58.125
She is a born-realized, a great person.

02:29:58.458 --> 02:30:01.834
Now look at your eyes. Can you see the eyes of each other?

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.999
Who talked?...

02:30:52.125 --> 02:30:56.417
No, no. She cannot do it. There is a science about it.

02:30:57.041 --> 02:30:58.500
This is a born-realized child.

02:30:58.834 --> 02:31:00.792
He's wrong.

02:31:05.333 --> 02:31:06.959
He's wrong. That will not.

02:31:07.208 --> 02:31:10.208
You must have the full knowledge, all right?

02:31:11.542 --> 02:31:13.542
You call the lady who's got asthma,

02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:15.625
he'll cure her, but just tell him

02:31:15.917 --> 02:31:18.250
to get the lady with the asthma.

02:31:18.875 --> 02:31:23.166
[Hindi]

02:31:37.041 --> 02:31:40.208
How are you? Glad you got it.

02:31:40.875 --> 02:31:44.333
[Hindi] ....

02:32:16.041 --> 02:32:18.291
You have to establish yourself, that's important,

02:32:18.542 --> 02:32:21.041
then you have to give it to everybody ....

02:32:28.500 --> 02:32:31.291
I will tell that. But you see once we ....

02:32:36.125 --> 02:32:38.709
Yes, the thing is, you see,

02:32:38.999 --> 02:32:41.875
that in one lecture that you can't speak about everyone.

02:32:42.083 --> 02:32:44.625
But I've spoken about all of them

02:32:44.875 --> 02:32:47.166
- Jesus, because the more here they worship Jesus.

02:32:47.583 --> 02:32:50.166
But all of them are spiritual, they're all our own,

02:32:50.458 --> 02:32:52.333
there's no difference ....

02:33:04.458 --> 02:33:06.041
That's it.

02:33:06.458 --> 02:33:07.959
Yes, that's it, that's it.

02:33:08.208 --> 02:33:10.792
So now you learn it, and you will listen to My other lectures

02:33:11.041 --> 02:33:13.250
where I've talked about everyone, all right?

02:33:13.583 --> 02:33:15.792
May God bless you.

02:33:20.291 --> 02:33:22.917
.... He's the brother of ...

02:33:25.709 --> 02:33:28.417
You are getting a nice sister-in-law!

02:33:35.792 --> 02:33:37.917
... That's your brother?

02:33:38.208 --> 02:33:39.542
They'll be all right, you see,

02:33:39.875 --> 02:33:42.542
because people are so recently here, and when I came,

02:33:42.834 --> 02:33:44.208
I had a diplomatic passport,

02:33:44.542 --> 02:33:48.083
but only they examined Me on the sense of the passport

02:33:48.417 --> 02:33:51.000
and then they saw My ticket, and all that - nobody else.

02:33:51.375 --> 02:33:53.709
They are like that, very ... people, what to do?

02:33:53.999 --> 02:33:57.583
You don't know, you must get some more Indians to ....

02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:06.792
He'll be all right, no doubt about that.

02:34:07.083 --> 02:34:08.792
And you also get them in Mumbai!

02:34:12.542 --> 02:34:16.083
Hallo, how are you? ....

02:34:26.667 --> 02:34:28.250
Confidence.

02:34:28.542 --> 02:34:29.959
All right, that's what I feel,

02:34:30.208 --> 02:34:31.792
that you people lack in confidence.

02:34:32.125 --> 02:34:33.417
Now what you think is shaken

02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:36.875
by all kinds of nonsensical doubts people have sown in you.

02:34:37.208 --> 02:34:40.333
You are the spirit, and you have to become that.

02:34:40.667 --> 02:34:43.834
I'm guiding you to become completely confident, all right?

02:34:44.083 --> 02:34:46.125
So you have to come and see these people also,

02:34:46.458 --> 02:34:48.709
these are ... but I'm coming after ...

02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:51.500
I'll come day after tomorrow, all right?

02:34:51.834 --> 02:34:53.291
Call your friends already.

02:34:53.583 --> 02:34:56.792
I must make you all very, very confident.

02:34:57.583 --> 02:35:00.792
But definitely come, because ....

02:35:18.999 --> 02:35:22.417
Cambodia? Ah!

02:35:38.208 --> 02:35:41.166
How are you?

02:35:43.041 --> 02:35:45.166
Just enjoy, enjoy yourself!

02:35:45.542 --> 02:35:47.959
But you have to be confident, and let it work out.

02:35:48.333 --> 02:35:50.000
Again and again ....

02:35:50.333 --> 02:35:52.375
You have to follow up, then you should see ....

02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:55.875
Absolutely confident about it, all right?

02:35:56.125 --> 02:35:58.208
May God bless you.

02:35:58.542 --> 02:36:01.792
So how are you?

02:36:05.291 --> 02:36:07.667
May God bless you.

02:36:08.125 --> 02:36:12.959
Now come along, you have become very brave, all right?

02:36:13.667 --> 02:36:17.000
Tell her that I said that you should come,

02:36:17.375 --> 02:36:19.750
and come very soon. Thank you very much.

02:36:20.917 --> 02:36:23.458
Are you all right? ....

02:36:40.333 --> 02:36:43.375
That's not going to help

02:36:48.083 --> 02:36:51.208
That's all right, but you must know everything about it also,

02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:52.458
and this is fine.

02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:54.917
You see, you should not do it indiscriminately ....

02:37:02.625 --> 02:37:04.959
I'll leave that to them, they're all here.

02:37:05.208 --> 02:37:08.333
You stay here? Yes?

02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:10.291
The day after tomorrow I am coming,

02:37:10.542 --> 02:37:11.917
and they'll give you addresses.

02:37:12.166 --> 02:37:13.458
Yes, and day after tomorrow

02:37:13.792 --> 02:37:15.208
you have to bring your friends also.

02:37:15.458 --> 02:37:18.667
You are from what country?

02:37:20.792 --> 02:37:22.333
Peru?

02:37:26.875 --> 02:37:30.959
All right, bring all of them. All right? I must see them.

02:37:51.542 --> 02:37:54.000
How are you? How did you feel?

02:37:56.458 --> 02:37:59.250
What country you come from?

02:38:01.417 --> 02:38:03.750
Puerto Rico! Oh, nice country.

02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:06.291
I have to go to all these places sometime.

02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.333
I must go. I haven't been there yet, but I will go.

02:38:08.667 --> 02:38:10.542
Let's see ...

02:38:10.959 --> 02:38:15.458
Are you here? Oh, great! How are you? ...

02:38:26.291 --> 02:38:29.083
Come along! And get your friends! Just tell them,

02:38:29.375 --> 02:38:34.000
they must come! All right? May God bless you.

02:38:38.083 --> 02:38:42.917
Now, how are you? ... No, haven't you met?

02:38:48.166 --> 02:38:50.417
... You are not Bolivian? ....

02:39:03.625 --> 02:39:06.458
So, how are you? ....

02:39:19.458 --> 02:39:21.291
Now, but you have to forgive.

02:39:21.583 --> 02:39:23.667
You must say it. You have to forgive.

02:39:23.959 --> 02:39:27.875
You must forgive everyone ....You have to forgive.

02:39:28.125 --> 02:39:29.750
Just say it, "I forgive."

02:39:30.041 --> 02:39:32.375
Just say that, "Mother, I forgive."

02:39:32.667 --> 02:39:36.375
Just say it, from your heart.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:50.875
Ah, now, see?

02:39:57.166 --> 02:39:59.999
Now, establish yourself. That's very important.

02:40:00.083 --> 02:40:02.959
Otherwise you will not have confidence. Must establish.

02:40:03.208 --> 02:40:05.834
The aspect more I'm telling, watch your ... also ....

02:40:06.166 --> 02:40:07.999
And then you have to see these people.

02:40:20.333 --> 02:40:23.083
Ah, so nice!

02:40:23.667 --> 02:40:26.709
Ah, great!

02:40:26.999 --> 02:40:27.999
I've been to that side.

02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:30.709
And I've given realization to people in Russia.

02:40:30.999 --> 02:40:33.417
I'm going to .... They're the first who will get it.

02:40:33.667 --> 02:40:36.250
They're very good. They're very good people.

02:40:36.709 --> 02:40:41.667
People are very good in Russia, very good. Great souls!

02:40:53.667 --> 02:40:57.000
In fourteen weeks we'll teach them from India.

02:41:00.625 --> 02:41:02.875
But they're very friendly, nice people.

02:41:03.083 --> 02:41:05.583
We can have a rapport with them very easily.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.583
We'll manage that.

02:41:07.917 --> 02:41:10.375
I'll try on the government level.

02:41:13.333 --> 02:41:15.834
We can do it.

02:41:16.750 --> 02:41:19.250
May God bless you.

02:41:24.542 --> 02:41:27.291
Come now.

02:42:09.375 --> 02:42:11.667
Establish yourself.

02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:26.083
Just say, "Mother, come in my head. That's all."
