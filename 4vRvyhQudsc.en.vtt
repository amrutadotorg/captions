ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

04:22.045 --> 04:31.445
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

04:33.125 --> 04:40.445
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

04:40.605 --> 04:45.784
His power comes from his innocence.

04:45.944 --> 04:50.586
When we see small children we are automatically

04:50.746 --> 04:54.205
compelled towards them

04:54.365 --> 05:01.725
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

05:01.885 --> 05:06.645
And very innocent they are,

05:07.925 --> 05:10.245
extremely innocent,

05:10.405 --> 05:16.765
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

05:16.925 --> 05:23.725
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

05:23.925 --> 05:30.605
These days people have become extremely cunning,

05:30.765 --> 05:34.405
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

05:34.565 --> 05:37.965
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

05:38.125 --> 05:42.005
who are innocent and simple.

05:42.165 --> 05:45.405
They can justify themselves always

05:45.565 --> 05:50.485
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

05:50.645 --> 05:53.765
when everybody is so cunning.

05:53.925 --> 06:04.005
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

06:04.205 --> 06:07.325
which is very much punishable,

06:07.605 --> 06:13.165
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

06:13.325 --> 06:17.165
which are physical, you can say.

06:17.525 --> 06:25.485
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

06:26.445 --> 06:29.685
Also, they can have other troubles

06:29.845 --> 06:33.365
with their liver treatments and all that.

06:33.525 --> 06:39.405
All this comes up. Then to punish them

06:39.565 --> 06:45.085
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

06:45.325 --> 06:48.485
At this time, when you have these problems,

06:48.645 --> 06:51.885
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

06:52.045 --> 06:54.925
should worship Shri Ganesha.

06:55.165 --> 07:02.485
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

07:02.645 --> 07:07.965
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

07:08.125 --> 07:12.165
extra work, I should say, than normal.

07:12.365 --> 07:16.885
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

07:17.045 --> 07:21.325
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

07:21.485 --> 07:28.805
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.605
One of the two things come up

07:31.765 --> 07:35.925
and he does not know where he is going.

07:36.085 --> 07:42.125
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

07:42.285 --> 07:46.765
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

07:46.925 --> 07:54.125
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

07:54.285 --> 07:57.482
All these diseases of the right side

07:57.642 --> 08:02.045
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

08:02.205 --> 08:08.005
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

08:09.005 --> 08:15.445
but there is a simple way to remember him

08:15.605 --> 08:21.005
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

08:21.165 --> 08:24.925
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

08:25.085 --> 08:29.845
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

08:30.005 --> 08:33.685
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

08:33.885 --> 08:38.565
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

08:38.725 --> 08:43.405
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

08:43.565 --> 08:48.365
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

08:48.525 --> 08:51.045
and all the worries from you.

08:51.205 --> 08:55.125
So this is the most important deity we have.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.485
Though its a very simple deity.

08:58.645 --> 09:02.165
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

09:02.325 --> 09:05.525
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

09:05.685 --> 09:14.205
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

09:14.365 --> 09:21.205
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

09:21.365 --> 09:24.085
So to steady down these

09:24.245 --> 09:31.285
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

09:31.525 --> 09:38.485
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

09:38.685 --> 09:43.445
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

09:43.605 --> 09:47.605
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

09:47.765 --> 09:51.925
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

09:52.085 --> 09:57.325
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

09:57.485 --> 09:59.445
he never said who it was.

09:59.605 --> 10:04.405
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

10:04.565 --> 10:11.005
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

10:11.165 --> 10:13.885
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

10:14.045 --> 10:16.725
he used to go all out to fight it.

10:16.885 --> 10:18.845
Same is Shri Ganesha.

10:19.005 --> 10:23.925
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

10:24.085 --> 10:28.965
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

10:29.125 --> 10:32.285
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

10:32.445 --> 10:37.125
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

10:37.285 --> 10:41.565
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

10:41.725 --> 10:46.325
in different troubles and hurdles and also

10:46.485 --> 10:49.965
different type of very very difficult times.

10:50.125 --> 10:54.565
It is his style that he manages things so well

10:54.725 --> 10:57.405
because he is a Ganapati.

10:57.565 --> 11:03.525
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

11:03.685 --> 11:08.285
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

11:08.445 --> 11:16.445
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

11:16.605 --> 11:20.525
who report if there is any problem.

11:20.685 --> 11:24.805
They report to the brain that there is a problem

11:24.965 --> 11:31.605
and on the sternum bone is the residence

11:31.765 --> 11:37.405
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

11:37.565 --> 11:46.405
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

11:46.565 --> 11:50.125
sternum bone starts vibrating

11:50.285 --> 11:56.765
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.925
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

12:01.085 --> 12:06.045
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

12:06.205 --> 12:10.165
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

12:10.325 --> 12:14.285
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

12:14.445 --> 12:17.085
are helped by Ganas is not true.

12:17.245 --> 12:20.565
Also the people who are mentally upset,

12:20.725 --> 12:25.445
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

12:25.605 --> 12:30.725
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

12:30.885 --> 12:35.805
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

12:35.965 --> 12:42.445
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

12:42.605 --> 12:47.245
Now his parents start crying for Mother

12:47.405 --> 12:51.365
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

12:51.525 --> 12:55.125
that they immediately rush to that place

12:55.285 --> 12:59.765
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

12:59.925 --> 13:03.525
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

13:03.685 --> 13:10.325
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

13:10.485 --> 13:14.085
They are also small like him

13:14.245 --> 13:17.845
and they are very active and very alert.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.965
They never sleep.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.165
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

13:24.325 --> 13:29.165
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

13:29.325 --> 13:35.485
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

13:36.245 --> 13:39.885
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

13:40.045 --> 13:44.205
For example there was a boy who got drowned

13:44.365 --> 13:50.605
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

13:50.765 --> 13:52.685
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

13:52.845 --> 13:55.405
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

13:55.565 --> 13:57.725
because there were children.

13:57.885 --> 14:00.445
So one boy fell down into that

14:00.605 --> 14:03.805
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

14:03.965 --> 14:05.925
Nobody knew he was there.

14:06.085 --> 14:11.605
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

14:11.765 --> 14:15.325
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

14:15.485 --> 14:20.285
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

14:20.445 --> 14:23.965
After that they got so frightened

14:24.125 --> 14:27.725
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

14:27.885 --> 14:30.405
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

14:30.565 --> 14:32.835
I didn’t know even the address.

14:32.995 --> 14:37.405
But I asked to telephone to this number,

14:37.565 --> 14:40.485
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

14:40.645 --> 14:46.245
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

14:46.405 --> 14:49.485
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

14:49.645 --> 14:51.205
and he will be saved.

14:51.365 --> 14:53.365
Nobody had told me anything.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.125
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

14:56.285 --> 15:00.965
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

15:01.125 --> 15:05.005
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

15:05.165 --> 15:07.685
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

15:07.845 --> 15:10.725
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

15:10.885 --> 15:13.325
If there is one chance of his surviving,

15:13.485 --> 15:18.405
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

15:18.565 --> 15:21.525
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

15:21.685 --> 15:23.605
So, like this, so many things happen

15:23.765 --> 15:29.725
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

15:29.885 --> 15:33.325
your blessings that this has happened.

15:33.485 --> 15:36.325
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

15:36.485 --> 15:38.925
but because of Shri Ganesha.

15:39.085 --> 15:41.565
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

15:41.725 --> 15:45.085
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

15:45.245 --> 15:51.085
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

15:51.245 --> 15:54.685
To him his Mother is everything.

15:54.845 --> 15:57.845
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

15:58.005 --> 16:03.525
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

16:03.685 --> 16:11.045
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

16:11.205 --> 16:15.805
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

16:15.965 --> 16:21.365
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

16:21.525 --> 16:24.685
but His work is tremendous.

16:24.845 --> 16:29.565
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

16:29.725 --> 16:35.485
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

16:35.645 --> 16:39.325
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

16:39.485 --> 16:45.605
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

16:45.765 --> 16:50.285
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

16:50.445 --> 16:52.885
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.045
Its not only in women but also in men,

16:56.205 --> 16:59.365
he expects chastity to be present.

16:59.525 --> 17:04.725
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

17:04.885 --> 17:08.125
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

17:08.285 --> 17:14.205
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

17:14.365 --> 17:18.525
of communicating with young women and young men

17:18.685 --> 17:21.445
and spoiling your chastity.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.445
Even your eyes should be clean,

17:24.605 --> 17:27.125
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

17:27.285 --> 17:31.205
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

17:31.365 --> 17:33.805
what mistakes you have committed

17:33.965 --> 17:40.805
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

17:40.965 --> 17:46.245
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

17:46.405 --> 17:49.765
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

17:49.925 --> 17:54.165
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

17:54.325 --> 17:56.965
but that is a very important thing.

17:57.125 --> 18:02.285
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

18:02.445 --> 18:04.005
We should be very chaste.

18:04.165 --> 18:08.205
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

18:08.365 --> 18:12.005
But religions have become so useless now,

18:12.165 --> 18:15.445
have become without any basis,

18:15.605 --> 18:26.125
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

18:26.285 --> 18:29.685
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

18:29.845 --> 18:34.045
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

18:34.205 --> 18:37.245
Actually the religions have failed completely

18:37.405 --> 18:42.245
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

18:42.405 --> 18:44.525
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

18:44.685 --> 18:47.885
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

18:48.045 --> 18:51.565
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

18:51.725 --> 18:58.405
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

18:58.565 --> 19:03.365
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

19:03.525 --> 19:10.125
and where people are also having very bad morals.

19:10.285 --> 19:14.925
He creates problems for them. What happens that

19:15.085 --> 19:21.965
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.509
Earthquake takes place in places where

19:24.669 --> 19:28.325
there is no respect of chastity,

19:28.485 --> 19:32.325
also where there are fundamentalist

19:32.485 --> 19:39.325
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

19:39.485 --> 19:44.245
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

19:44.405 --> 19:46.685
So the Mother earth also understands.

19:46.845 --> 19:50.285
Now we have so many earthquakes,

19:50.445 --> 19:52.725
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

19:52.885 --> 19:55.885
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

19:56.045 --> 19:57.805
So he protects them.

19:57.965 --> 20:02.685
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

20:02.845 --> 20:04.885
he tries to destroy them,

20:05.045 --> 20:09.005
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

20:09.165 --> 20:19.925
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

20:20.085 --> 20:22.805
he attracts people towards himself,

20:22.965 --> 20:27.805
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

20:27.965 --> 20:32.605
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

20:32.765 --> 20:38.285
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

20:38.445 --> 20:41.485
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

20:41.645 --> 20:45.205
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

20:45.365 --> 20:49.965
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.685
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

20:53.845 --> 21:00.365
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

21:00.525 --> 21:05.285
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

21:05.445 --> 21:09.845
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

21:10.005 --> 21:12.165
they go back to their own place.

21:12.325 --> 21:15.525
So going back to the same place is only possible

21:15.685 --> 21:18.525
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

21:18.685 --> 21:22.965
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

21:23.125 --> 21:27.085
also they are bound by their own qualities.

21:27.245 --> 21:32.125
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

21:32.285 --> 21:34.525
and a lion will be a lion.

21:34.685 --> 21:38.285
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

21:38.445 --> 21:40.565
So they could be anything, you can’t say

21:40.725 --> 21:44.605
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

21:44.765 --> 21:47.365
And once they become anything like that

21:47.525 --> 21:52.125
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

21:52.285 --> 21:54.685
when they are human beings.

21:54.845 --> 21:59.445
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

21:59.605 --> 22:04.525
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

22:04.685 --> 22:09.005
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

22:09.165 --> 22:14.005
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

22:14.165 --> 22:17.085
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

22:17.245 --> 22:21.685
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

22:21.845 --> 22:29.525
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

22:29.685 --> 22:31.725
Before the statue they dance

22:31.885 --> 22:38.285
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

22:38.445 --> 22:43.965
music from some very funny films or something.

22:44.125 --> 22:47.085
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

22:47.245 --> 22:51.365
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

22:51.525 --> 22:55.725
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

22:55.885 --> 22:58.165
and they were dancing before it.

22:58.325 --> 23:03.925
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

23:04.085 --> 23:08.365
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

23:08.525 --> 23:12.885
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

23:13.045 --> 23:16.525
At that time the earth moved

23:16.685 --> 23:26.285
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

23:26.445 --> 23:28.765
They all disappeared into earth.

23:28.925 --> 23:32.085
Apart from that there were many others also

23:32.245 --> 23:36.485
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

23:36.645 --> 23:40.325
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

23:40.485 --> 23:48.085
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

23:48.245 --> 23:54.165
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

23:54.325 --> 23:59.445
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

23:59.605 --> 24:08.725
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

24:08.885 --> 24:13.845
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

24:14.165 --> 24:16.325
They were all right.

24:16.485 --> 24:21.445
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

24:21.605 --> 24:24.121
and this is how they saved the Ashram

24:24.281 --> 24:27.085
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

24:27.245 --> 24:31.485
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

24:31.645 --> 24:35.405
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

24:35.565 --> 24:38.045
So we must respect his Ganas,

24:38.205 --> 24:42.805
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

24:42.965 --> 24:45.005
they are acting within us.

24:45.165 --> 24:48.325
They see us what sort of person you are,

24:48.485 --> 24:53.245
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

24:53.405 --> 24:55.408
by your misbehavior

24:55.568 --> 24:59.845
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

25:00.005 --> 25:02.005
They give you a chance many a times.

25:02.165 --> 25:09.645
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

25:09.805 --> 25:16.365
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

25:16.525 --> 25:20.445
I should say, calamity for you people.

25:20.605 --> 25:23.205
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

25:23.365 --> 25:26.605
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

25:26.765 --> 25:32.165
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

25:32.325 --> 25:35.365
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

25:35.525 --> 25:38.045
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

25:38.205 --> 25:44.605
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

25:44.765 --> 25:49.565
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

25:49.725 --> 25:52.445
so we are not at all helped by this.

25:52.605 --> 25:55.325
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

25:55.485 --> 25:59.245
don’t do any worship of any idol

25:59.405 --> 26:03.125
because these idols have been created by human beings

26:03.285 --> 26:07.925
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

26:08.085 --> 26:10.405
They are not created by the mother earth

26:10.565 --> 26:13.324
but are copied by people

26:13.484 --> 26:16.965
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

26:17.125 --> 26:20.765
So that’s, how any idol you get,

26:20.925 --> 26:27.045
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

26:27.205 --> 26:30.405
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

26:30.565 --> 26:33.245
So whatever is not there,

26:33.405 --> 26:37.445
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

26:37.605 --> 26:41.045
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

26:41.205 --> 26:45.165
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

26:45.325 --> 26:48.565
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

26:48.725 --> 26:51.605
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

26:51.765 --> 26:56.405
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

26:56.565 --> 27:00.445
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

27:00.605 --> 27:06.925
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

27:07.085 --> 27:12.325
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

27:12.485 --> 27:16.605
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

27:16.765 --> 27:21.285
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

27:21.445 --> 27:26.205
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

27:26.365 --> 27:29.405
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

27:29.565 --> 27:32.605
and how he is doing this to us.”

27:32.765 --> 27:39.125
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

27:39.285 --> 27:45.365
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

27:45.525 --> 27:46.885
And then he realized it.

27:47.045 --> 27:49.725
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

27:49.885 --> 27:55.165
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

27:55.325 --> 27:59.605
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

27:59.765 --> 28:02.285
and being very cunning and clever.

28:02.445 --> 28:07.005
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

28:07.165 --> 28:14.445
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

28:14.605 --> 28:19.965
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

28:20.125 --> 28:25.205
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

28:25.365 --> 28:28.485
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

28:28.645 --> 28:31.405
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

28:31.565 --> 28:37.805
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

28:37.965 --> 28:41.045
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

28:41.205 --> 28:46.725
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

28:46.885 --> 28:53.765
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

28:53.925 --> 29:02.165
that he can move mountains after mountains.

29:02.325 --> 29:08.725
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

29:08.885 --> 29:16.045
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

29:16.205 --> 29:19.325
can be changed.

29:20.245 --> 29:25.045
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

29:25.205 --> 29:27.285
of the right direction.

29:27.445 --> 29:33.325
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

29:33.485 --> 29:37.885
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

29:38.045 --> 29:41.405
it was the right type and he was successful.

29:41.565 --> 29:44.565
But then what happened, they had stencils

29:44.725 --> 29:47.325
and they started using it from the other side.

29:47.485 --> 29:50.605
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

29:50.765 --> 29:53.885
and then they were all destroyed.

29:54.045 --> 29:58.005
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

29:58.165 --> 30:00.253
Also we have proved now

30:00.413 --> 30:04.365
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

30:04.525 --> 30:08.085
is actually from the Carbon atom.

30:08.245 --> 30:10.805
The carbon atom has got Swastika

30:10.965 --> 30:17.765
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

30:17.925 --> 30:19.805
all put in series.

30:19.965 --> 30:25.125
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

30:25.285 --> 30:27.845
look at it from the left side to right side,

30:28.005 --> 30:31.845
what you see is Omkar.

30:32.005 --> 30:34.645
If you see it from right side to left side,

30:34.805 --> 30:36.405
you see the Swastika,

30:36.565 --> 30:43.285
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

30:43.445 --> 30:48.645
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

30:48.805 --> 30:53.485
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

30:53.645 --> 30:57.085
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

30:57.245 --> 31:01.165
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

31:01.325 --> 31:04.485
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

31:04.645 --> 31:09.245
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

31:09.405 --> 31:13.445
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

31:13.605 --> 31:15.205
because we are confused.

31:15.365 --> 31:17.485
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

31:17.645 --> 31:19.525
that this is already written there.

31:19.685 --> 31:25.125
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

31:25.285 --> 31:32.525
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

31:32.685 --> 31:38.805
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.805
All the things I have told you about Christ,

31:41.965 --> 31:48.285
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

31:48.445 --> 31:51.445
Like Christ had these two fingers,

31:51.605 --> 31:55.925
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

31:56.085 --> 32:00.565
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

32:00.725 --> 32:04.445
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

32:04.605 --> 32:08.125
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

32:08.285 --> 32:10.885
only these two fingers why did he use.

32:11.045 --> 32:13.710
Pointing out towards his father

32:13.870 --> 32:17.785
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

32:18.125 --> 32:21.365
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

32:21.525 --> 32:24.845
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

32:25.005 --> 32:31.685
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

32:31.845 --> 32:37.245
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

32:37.405 --> 32:41.405
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

32:41.565 --> 32:43.341
So it all opens out

32:43.501 --> 32:48.917
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

32:49.085 --> 32:53.045
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

32:53.205 --> 32:58.325
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

32:58.485 --> 33:02.485
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

33:02.645 --> 33:04.445
You are no more cunning.

33:04.605 --> 33:11.165
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

33:11.325 --> 33:16.405
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

33:16.565 --> 33:21.565
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

33:21.725 --> 33:28.525
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

33:28.685 --> 33:33.405
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

33:33.565 --> 33:37.765
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

33:37.925 --> 33:40.965
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

33:41.125 --> 33:47.176
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

33:47.336 --> 33:51.096
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

33:51.256 --> 33:54.685
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

33:54.845 --> 33:56.845
We don’t look after the mother earth.

33:57.005 --> 34:00.325
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

34:00.485 --> 34:04.445
Actually in Indian culture it is that

34:04.605 --> 34:07.605
when you are getting up in the morning,

34:07.765 --> 34:12.685
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

34:12.845 --> 34:17.125
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

34:17.285 --> 34:20.365
because I am touching you with my feet.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.845
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

34:23.005 --> 34:24.725
then you won’t exploit it,

34:24.885 --> 34:28.485
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

34:28.645 --> 34:31.485
It all comes out of our ignorance

34:31.645 --> 34:36.045
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

34:36.205 --> 34:39.885
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

34:40.045 --> 34:44.525
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

34:44.685 --> 34:47.605
what is to be done.

34:47.765 --> 34:50.685
The mother earth itself we should look after,

34:50.845 --> 34:54.445
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

34:54.605 --> 34:56.845
we can do all kinds of things

34:57.005 --> 35:02.525
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

35:02.685 --> 35:07.365
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

35:07.525 --> 35:10.605
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

35:10.765 --> 35:15.325
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

35:15.485 --> 35:17.365
is a very wrong thing.

35:17.525 --> 35:21.125
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

35:21.285 --> 35:23.285
you should put another one there.

35:23.445 --> 35:26.805
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

35:26.965 --> 35:31.405
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

35:31.565 --> 35:39.005
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

35:39.165 --> 35:42.365
I don’t know how they live but they do

35:42.525 --> 35:48.525
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

35:48.685 --> 35:52.565
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

35:52.725 --> 35:58.605
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

35:58.765 --> 36:01.765
that it should get the sunrays.

36:01.925 --> 36:03.485
There is no quarrel about it.

36:03.645 --> 36:07.285
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

36:07.445 --> 36:12.565
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

36:12.725 --> 36:14.925
The animals also don’t destroy,

36:15.085 --> 36:18.125
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

36:18.285 --> 36:21.965
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

36:22.125 --> 36:24.605
do not destroy anything

36:24.765 --> 36:30.645
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

36:30.805 --> 36:33.925
Whatever may be the cry for this,

36:34.085 --> 36:37.845
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

36:38.005 --> 36:40.845
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

36:41.005 --> 36:44.965
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

36:45.125 --> 36:49.965
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.525
He is the greatest yogi we have

36:52.685 --> 36:56.125
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

36:56.285 --> 37:02.405
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

37:02.565 --> 37:10.925
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

37:11.085 --> 37:13.805
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

37:13.965 --> 37:15.925
and we should really worship him.

37:16.085 --> 37:18.735
Through him all deities are worshiped

37:18.895 --> 37:26.125
and are made happy and blissful.

37:26.285 --> 37:31.765
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

37:31.925 --> 37:37.045
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

37:37.205 --> 37:48.325
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

37:48.485 --> 37:52.965
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

37:53.125 --> 37:56.125
but you are dishonoring yourself

37:56.285 --> 37:59.725
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

37:59.885 --> 38:05.565
by becoming so sinful.

38:05.725 --> 38:09.205
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

38:09.365 --> 38:15.605
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

38:15.765 --> 38:19.245
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

38:19.405 --> 38:22.925
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

38:23.085 --> 38:27.005
Decency is very important in understanding,

38:27.165 --> 38:33.165
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

38:33.325 --> 38:39.685
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

38:39.845 --> 38:43.925
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

38:44.085 --> 38:47.845
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

38:48.005 --> 38:52.243
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

38:52.403 --> 38:56.078
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

38:56.238 --> 39:02.014
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

39:02.174 --> 39:06.565
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

39:06.725 --> 39:11.468
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

39:11.628 --> 39:13.856
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

39:14.016 --> 39:16.478
because men can develop so many diseases

39:16.638 --> 39:20.286
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

39:21.127 --> 39:28.182
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

39:28.342 --> 39:31.541
because he is all the time repairing our body.

39:31.701 --> 39:35.386
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

39:35.546 --> 39:41.397
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

39:41.557 --> 39:44.310
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

39:44.470 --> 39:46.845
he is protecting our Kundalini.

39:47.005 --> 39:53.584
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

39:53.744 --> 39:59.342
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

39:59.502 --> 40:03.786
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

40:03.946 --> 40:07.965
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

40:08.125 --> 40:14.986
which is also a basis of your self realization.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.584
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

40:18.744 --> 40:21.521
and you should find out about yourself,

40:21.681 --> 40:26.300
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

40:26.460 --> 40:28.845
If we are; what are we doing about it?

40:29.005 --> 40:35.186
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

40:35.346 --> 40:38.108
You will not like them, will not like such people.

40:38.268 --> 40:41.390
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

40:41.550 --> 40:44.464
The children are the best as we know.

40:44.624 --> 40:52.051
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

40:52.211 --> 40:56.426
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

40:56.586 --> 40:59.921
He is the one who is really innocent

41:00.081 --> 41:04.329
but extremely, protective of you,

41:04.489 --> 41:07.963
very much protective, with his innocence.

41:08.123 --> 41:10.699
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

41:10.859 --> 41:14.605
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

41:14.765 --> 41:17.449
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

41:17.609 --> 41:20.899
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

41:21.059 --> 41:26.120
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

41:26.280 --> 41:28.445
people are talking about it that

41:28.605 --> 41:32.669
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

41:32.829 --> 41:36.024
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

41:36.184 --> 41:42.965
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

41:43.125 --> 41:47.683
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

41:47.843 --> 41:51.493
In America, I was surprised to see that

41:51.653 --> 41:54.405
there were so many Red Indians,

41:54.565 --> 41:58.405
who are called as Indian Americans.

41:58.565 --> 42:03.692
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

42:03.852 --> 42:08.003
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

42:08.163 --> 42:10.805
I found the vibrations were so good.

42:10.965 --> 42:13.605
That means they were very innocent, simple people

42:13.765 --> 42:16.784
and Americans that time, who went there,

42:16.944 --> 42:19.805
tried to completely finish them.

42:19.965 --> 42:23.294
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

42:23.454 --> 42:27.045
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

42:27.205 --> 42:30.055
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

42:30.215 --> 42:33.925
still the people who live there or worked about

42:34.085 --> 42:39.226
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

42:39.386 --> 42:43.959
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

42:44.119 --> 42:46.294
But they are so simple and innocent

42:46.454 --> 42:49.405
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

42:49.565 --> 42:52.205
because they used to worship the Mother.

42:52.365 --> 42:55.005
All the time they worship the Mother.

42:55.165 --> 42:58.765
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

42:58.925 --> 43:04.025
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

43:04.185 --> 43:06.985
They have many Maoris and all those people

43:07.145 --> 43:08.865
and they encourage all of them

43:09.025 --> 43:12.865
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

43:13.025 --> 43:20.108
and they are bringing them to this state to show

43:20.274 --> 43:24.981
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

43:25.141 --> 43:27.345
Its a very good venture.

43:27.505 --> 43:34.225
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

43:34.385 --> 43:39.044
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

43:39.204 --> 43:44.123
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

43:44.283 --> 43:48.385
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

43:48.545 --> 43:49.785
from the mother earth.

43:49.945 --> 43:53.705
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

43:53.865 --> 44:01.025
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

44:01.185 --> 44:02.821
That’s what it is.

44:02.981 --> 44:07.661
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

44:07.821 --> 44:11.385
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

44:11.545 --> 44:13.886
and Government also has never troubled us

44:14.046 --> 44:16.501
or there has been no problem with them.

44:16.661 --> 44:19.206
I don’t know what’s this helping them

44:19.366 --> 44:23.726
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

44:23.886 --> 44:28.175
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

44:28.335 --> 44:32.226
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

44:32.386 --> 44:34.476
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

44:34.636 --> 44:38.880
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.164
You will be helped, miraculously

44:41.324 --> 44:46.535
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

44:46.733 --> 44:48.558
May God Bless You.
