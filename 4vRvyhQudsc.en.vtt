ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:31.445
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:40.445
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:45.784
His power comes from his innocence.

00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:50.586
When we see small children we are automatically

00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:54.205
compelled towards them

00:04:54.365 --> 00:05:01.725
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:06.645
And very innocent they are,

00:05:07.925 --> 00:05:10.245
extremely innocent,

00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:16.765
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:23.725
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:30.605
These days people have become extremely cunning,

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:34.405
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

00:05:34.565 --> 00:05:37.965
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:42.005
who are innocent and simple.

00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:45.405
They can justify themselves always

00:05:45.565 --> 00:05:50.485
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

00:05:50.645 --> 00:05:53.765
when everybody is so cunning.

00:05:53.925 --> 00:06:04.005
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:07.325
which is very much punishable,

00:06:07.605 --> 00:06:13.165
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:17.165
which are physical, you can say.

00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:25.485
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:29.685
Also, they can have other troubles

00:06:29.845 --> 00:06:33.365
with their liver treatments and all that.

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:39.405
All this comes up. Then to punish them

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:45.085
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:48.485
At this time, when you have these problems,

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:51.885
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:54.925
should worship Shri Ganesha.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:07:02.485
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:07.965
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:12.165
extra work, I should say, than normal.

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:16.885
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

00:07:17.045 --> 00:07:21.325
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:28.805
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:31.605
One of the two things come up

00:07:31.765 --> 00:07:35.925
and he does not know where he is going.

00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:42.125
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:46.765
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:54.125
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:57.482
All these diseases of the right side

00:07:57.642 --> 00:08:02.045
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

00:08:02.205 --> 00:08:08.005
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:15.445
but there is a simple way to remember him

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:21.005
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

00:08:21.165 --> 00:08:24.925
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

00:08:25.085 --> 00:08:29.845
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:33.685
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

00:08:33.885 --> 00:08:38.565
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:43.405
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:48.365
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:51.045
and all the worries from you.

00:08:51.205 --> 00:08:55.125
So this is the most important deity we have.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:58.485
Though its a very simple deity.

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:02.165
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:05.525
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

00:09:05.685 --> 00:09:14.205
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

00:09:14.365 --> 00:09:21.205
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:24.085
So to steady down these

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:31.285
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:38.485
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:43.445
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:47.605
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:51.925
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

00:09:52.085 --> 00:09:57.325
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

00:09:57.485 --> 00:09:59.445
he never said who it was.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:04.405
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

00:10:04.565 --> 00:10:11.005
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:13.885
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

00:10:14.045 --> 00:10:16.725
he used to go all out to fight it.

00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:18.845
Same is Shri Ganesha.

00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:23.925
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:28.965
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:32.285
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

00:10:32.445 --> 00:10:37.125
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:41.565
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:46.325
in different troubles and hurdles and also

00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:49.965
different type of very very difficult times.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:54.565
It is his style that he manages things so well

00:10:54.725 --> 00:10:57.405
because he is a Ganapati.

00:10:57.565 --> 00:11:03.525
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

00:11:03.685 --> 00:11:08.285
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:16.445
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

00:11:16.605 --> 00:11:20.525
who report if there is any problem.

00:11:20.685 --> 00:11:24.805
They report to the brain that there is a problem

00:11:24.965 --> 00:11:31.605
and on the sternum bone is the residence

00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:37.405
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:46.405
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:50.125
sternum bone starts vibrating

00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:56.765
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:12:00.925
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:06.045
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:10.165
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

00:12:10.325 --> 00:12:14.285
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

00:12:14.445 --> 00:12:17.085
are helped by Ganas is not true.

00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:20.565
Also the people who are mentally upset,

00:12:20.725 --> 00:12:25.445
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

00:12:25.605 --> 00:12:30.725
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

00:12:30.885 --> 00:12:35.805
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

00:12:35.965 --> 00:12:42.445
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

00:12:42.605 --> 00:12:47.245
Now his parents start crying for Mother

00:12:47.405 --> 00:12:51.365
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:55.125
that they immediately rush to that place

00:12:55.285 --> 00:12:59.765
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

00:12:59.925 --> 00:13:03.525
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:10.325
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:14.085
They are also small like him

00:13:14.245 --> 00:13:17.845
and they are very active and very alert.

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:19.965
They never sleep.

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:24.165
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

00:13:24.325 --> 00:13:29.165
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:35.485
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

00:13:36.245 --> 00:13:39.885
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:44.205
For example there was a boy who got drowned

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:50.605
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.685
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

00:13:52.845 --> 00:13:55.405
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:57.725
because there were children.

00:13:57.885 --> 00:14:00.445
So one boy fell down into that

00:14:00.605 --> 00:14:03.805
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:05.925
Nobody knew he was there.

00:14:06.085 --> 00:14:11.605
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:15.325
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:20.285
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:23.965
After that they got so frightened

00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:27.725
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:30.405
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:32.835
I didn’t know even the address.

00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:37.405
But I asked to telephone to this number,

00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:40.485
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:46.245
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:49.485
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:51.205
and he will be saved.

00:14:51.365 --> 00:14:53.365
Nobody had told me anything.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.125
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

00:14:56.285 --> 00:15:00.965
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:05.005
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.685
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

00:15:07.845 --> 00:15:10.725
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

00:15:10.885 --> 00:15:13.325
If there is one chance of his surviving,

00:15:13.485 --> 00:15:18.405
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:21.525
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

00:15:21.685 --> 00:15:23.605
So, like this, so many things happen

00:15:23.765 --> 00:15:29.725
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:33.325
your blessings that this has happened.

00:15:33.485 --> 00:15:36.325
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:38.925
but because of Shri Ganesha.

00:15:39.085 --> 00:15:41.565
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

00:15:41.725 --> 00:15:45.085
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:51.085
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:54.685
To him his Mother is everything.

00:15:54.845 --> 00:15:57.845
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

00:15:58.005 --> 00:16:03.525
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:11.045
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:15.805
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

00:16:15.965 --> 00:16:21.365
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

00:16:21.525 --> 00:16:24.685
but His work is tremendous.

00:16:24.845 --> 00:16:29.565
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

00:16:29.725 --> 00:16:35.485
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

00:16:35.645 --> 00:16:39.325
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

00:16:39.485 --> 00:16:45.605
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:50.285
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:52.885
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:56.045
Its not only in women but also in men,

00:16:56.205 --> 00:16:59.365
he expects chastity to be present.

00:16:59.525 --> 00:17:04.725
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:08.125
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

00:17:08.285 --> 00:17:14.205
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:18.525
of communicating with young women and young men

00:17:18.685 --> 00:17:21.445
and spoiling your chastity.

00:17:21.605 --> 00:17:24.445
Even your eyes should be clean,

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:27.125
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:31.205
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:33.805
what mistakes you have committed

00:17:33.965 --> 00:17:40.805
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

00:17:40.965 --> 00:17:46.245
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:49.765
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:54.165
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

00:17:54.325 --> 00:17:56.965
but that is a very important thing.

00:17:57.125 --> 00:18:02.285
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:04.005
We should be very chaste.

00:18:04.165 --> 00:18:08.205
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

00:18:08.365 --> 00:18:12.005
But religions have become so useless now,

00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:15.445
have become without any basis,

00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:26.125
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

00:18:26.285 --> 00:18:29.685
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

00:18:29.845 --> 00:18:34.045
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

00:18:34.205 --> 00:18:37.245
Actually the religions have failed completely

00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:42.245
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

00:18:42.405 --> 00:18:44.525
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

00:18:44.685 --> 00:18:47.885
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

00:18:48.045 --> 00:18:51.565
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

00:18:51.725 --> 00:18:58.405
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

00:18:58.565 --> 00:19:03.365
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:10.125
and where people are also having very bad morals.

00:19:10.285 --> 00:19:14.925
He creates problems for them. What happens that

00:19:15.085 --> 00:19:21.965
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:24.509
Earthquake takes place in places where

00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:28.325
there is no respect of chastity,

00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:32.325
also where there are fundamentalist

00:19:32.485 --> 00:19:39.325
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:44.245
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

00:19:44.405 --> 00:19:46.685
So the Mother earth also understands.

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:50.285
Now we have so many earthquakes,

00:19:50.445 --> 00:19:52.725
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

00:19:52.885 --> 00:19:55.885
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

00:19:56.045 --> 00:19:57.805
So he protects them.

00:19:57.965 --> 00:20:02.685
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

00:20:02.845 --> 00:20:04.885
he tries to destroy them,

00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:09.005
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

00:20:09.165 --> 00:20:19.925
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:22.805
he attracts people towards himself,

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:27.805
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

00:20:27.965 --> 00:20:32.605
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

00:20:32.765 --> 00:20:38.285
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:41.485
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:45.205
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

00:20:45.365 --> 00:20:49.965
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:53.685
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

00:20:53.845 --> 00:21:00.365
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:05.285
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:09.845
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:12.165
they go back to their own place.

00:21:12.325 --> 00:21:15.525
So going back to the same place is only possible

00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:18.525
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

00:21:18.685 --> 00:21:22.965
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

00:21:23.125 --> 00:21:27.085
also they are bound by their own qualities.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:32.125
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

00:21:32.285 --> 00:21:34.525
and a lion will be a lion.

00:21:34.685 --> 00:21:38.285
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

00:21:38.445 --> 00:21:40.565
So they could be anything, you can’t say

00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:44.605
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

00:21:44.765 --> 00:21:47.365
And once they become anything like that

00:21:47.525 --> 00:21:52.125
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

00:21:52.285 --> 00:21:54.685
when they are human beings.

00:21:54.845 --> 00:21:59.445
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:04.525
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:09.005
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

00:22:09.165 --> 00:22:14.005
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:17.085
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

00:22:17.245 --> 00:22:21.685
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

00:22:21.845 --> 00:22:29.525
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:31.725
Before the statue they dance

00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:38.285
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:43.965
music from some very funny films or something.

00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:47.085
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

00:22:47.245 --> 00:22:51.365
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

00:22:51.525 --> 00:22:55.725
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

00:22:55.885 --> 00:22:58.165
and they were dancing before it.

00:22:58.325 --> 00:23:03.925
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

00:23:04.085 --> 00:23:08.365
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

00:23:08.525 --> 00:23:12.885
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

00:23:13.045 --> 00:23:16.525
At that time the earth moved

00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:26.285
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:28.765
They all disappeared into earth.

00:23:28.925 --> 00:23:32.085
Apart from that there were many others also

00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:36.485
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

00:23:36.645 --> 00:23:40.325
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:48.085
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

00:23:48.245 --> 00:23:54.165
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

00:23:54.325 --> 00:23:59.445
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

00:23:59.605 --> 00:24:08.725
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:13.845
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

00:24:14.165 --> 00:24:16.325
They were all right.

00:24:16.485 --> 00:24:21.445
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:24.121
and this is how they saved the Ashram

00:24:24.281 --> 00:24:27.085
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

00:24:27.245 --> 00:24:31.485
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

00:24:31.645 --> 00:24:35.405
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

00:24:35.565 --> 00:24:38.045
So we must respect his Ganas,

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:42.805
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

00:24:42.965 --> 00:24:45.005
they are acting within us.

00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:48.325
They see us what sort of person you are,

00:24:48.485 --> 00:24:53.245
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:55.408
by your misbehavior

00:24:55.568 --> 00:24:59.845
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

00:25:00.005 --> 00:25:02.005
They give you a chance many a times.

00:25:02.165 --> 00:25:09.645
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:16.365
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

00:25:16.525 --> 00:25:20.445
I should say, calamity for you people.

00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:23.205
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

00:25:23.365 --> 00:25:26.605
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

00:25:26.765 --> 00:25:32.165
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:35.365
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:38.045
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:44.605
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

00:25:44.765 --> 00:25:49.565
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

00:25:49.725 --> 00:25:52.445
so we are not at all helped by this.

00:25:52.605 --> 00:25:55.325
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

00:25:55.485 --> 00:25:59.245
don’t do any worship of any idol

00:25:59.405 --> 00:26:03.125
because these idols have been created by human beings

00:26:03.285 --> 00:26:07.925
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

00:26:08.085 --> 00:26:10.405
They are not created by the mother earth

00:26:10.565 --> 00:26:13.324
but are copied by people

00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:16.965
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:20.765
So that’s, how any idol you get,

00:26:20.925 --> 00:26:27.045
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

00:26:27.205 --> 00:26:30.405
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

00:26:30.565 --> 00:26:33.245
So whatever is not there,

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:37.445
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

00:26:37.605 --> 00:26:41.045
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

00:26:41.205 --> 00:26:45.165
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

00:26:45.325 --> 00:26:48.565
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:51.605
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

00:26:51.765 --> 00:26:56.405
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

00:26:56.565 --> 00:27:00.445
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:06.925
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

00:27:07.085 --> 00:27:12.325
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

00:27:12.485 --> 00:27:16.605
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:21.285
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

00:27:21.445 --> 00:27:26.205
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

00:27:26.365 --> 00:27:29.405
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:32.605
and how he is doing this to us.”

00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:39.125
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

00:27:39.285 --> 00:27:45.365
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:46.885
And then he realized it.

00:27:47.045 --> 00:27:49.725
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:55.165
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:59.605
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

00:27:59.765 --> 00:28:02.285
and being very cunning and clever.

00:28:02.445 --> 00:28:07.005
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:14.445
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:19.965
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

00:28:20.125 --> 00:28:25.205
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:28.485
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:31.405
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:37.805
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

00:28:37.965 --> 00:28:41.045
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

00:28:41.205 --> 00:28:46.725
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

00:28:46.885 --> 00:28:53.765
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

00:28:53.925 --> 00:29:02.165
that he can move mountains after mountains.

00:29:02.325 --> 00:29:08.725
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

00:29:08.885 --> 00:29:16.045
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:19.325
can be changed.

00:29:20.245 --> 00:29:25.045
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

00:29:25.205 --> 00:29:27.285
of the right direction.

00:29:27.445 --> 00:29:33.325
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:37.885
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

00:29:38.045 --> 00:29:41.405
it was the right type and he was successful.

00:29:41.565 --> 00:29:44.565
But then what happened, they had stencils

00:29:44.725 --> 00:29:47.325
and they started using it from the other side.

00:29:47.485 --> 00:29:50.605
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:53.885
and then they were all destroyed.

00:29:54.045 --> 00:29:58.005
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

00:29:58.165 --> 00:30:00.253
Also we have proved now

00:30:00.413 --> 00:30:04.365
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:08.085
is actually from the Carbon atom.

00:30:08.245 --> 00:30:10.805
The carbon atom has got Swastika

00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:17.765
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

00:30:17.925 --> 00:30:19.805
all put in series.

00:30:19.965 --> 00:30:25.125
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:27.845
look at it from the left side to right side,

00:30:28.005 --> 00:30:31.845
what you see is Omkar.

00:30:32.005 --> 00:30:34.645
If you see it from right side to left side,

00:30:34.805 --> 00:30:36.405
you see the Swastika,

00:30:36.565 --> 00:30:43.285
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:48.645
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

00:30:48.805 --> 00:30:53.485
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:57.085
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

00:30:57.245 --> 00:31:01.165
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:04.485
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:09.245
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

00:31:09.405 --> 00:31:13.445
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:15.205
because we are confused.

00:31:15.365 --> 00:31:17.485
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:19.525
that this is already written there.

00:31:19.685 --> 00:31:25.125
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

00:31:25.285 --> 00:31:32.525
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

00:31:32.685 --> 00:31:38.805
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

00:31:38.965 --> 00:31:41.805
All the things I have told you about Christ,

00:31:41.965 --> 00:31:48.285
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

00:31:48.445 --> 00:31:51.445
Like Christ had these two fingers,

00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:55.925
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

00:31:56.085 --> 00:32:00.565
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

00:32:00.725 --> 00:32:04.445
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

00:32:04.605 --> 00:32:08.125
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

00:32:08.285 --> 00:32:10.885
only these two fingers why did he use.

00:32:11.045 --> 00:32:13.710
Pointing out towards his father

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.785
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:21.365
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:24.845
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

00:32:25.005 --> 00:32:31.685
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:37.245
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

00:32:37.405 --> 00:32:41.405
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

00:32:41.565 --> 00:32:43.341
So it all opens out

00:32:43.501 --> 00:32:48.917
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

00:32:49.085 --> 00:32:53.045
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:58.325
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

00:32:58.485 --> 00:33:02.485
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:04.445
You are no more cunning.

00:33:04.605 --> 00:33:11.165
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

00:33:11.325 --> 00:33:16.405
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

00:33:16.565 --> 00:33:21.565
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

00:33:21.725 --> 00:33:28.525
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

00:33:28.685 --> 00:33:33.405
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

00:33:33.565 --> 00:33:37.765
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

00:33:37.925 --> 00:33:40.965
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

00:33:41.125 --> 00:33:47.176
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:33:47.336 --> 00:33:51.096
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

00:33:51.256 --> 00:33:54.685
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

00:33:54.845 --> 00:33:56.845
We don’t look after the mother earth.

00:33:57.005 --> 00:34:00.325
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

00:34:00.485 --> 00:34:04.445
Actually in Indian culture it is that

00:34:04.605 --> 00:34:07.605
when you are getting up in the morning,

00:34:07.765 --> 00:34:12.685
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

00:34:12.845 --> 00:34:17.125
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:20.365
because I am touching you with my feet.

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.845
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

00:34:23.005 --> 00:34:24.725
then you won’t exploit it,

00:34:24.885 --> 00:34:28.485
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

00:34:28.645 --> 00:34:31.485
It all comes out of our ignorance

00:34:31.645 --> 00:34:36.045
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:34:36.205 --> 00:34:39.885
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

00:34:40.045 --> 00:34:44.525
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

00:34:44.685 --> 00:34:47.605
what is to be done.

00:34:47.765 --> 00:34:50.685
The mother earth itself we should look after,

00:34:50.845 --> 00:34:54.445
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

00:34:54.605 --> 00:34:56.845
we can do all kinds of things

00:34:57.005 --> 00:35:02.525
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:07.365
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

00:35:07.525 --> 00:35:10.605
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

00:35:10.765 --> 00:35:15.325
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

00:35:15.485 --> 00:35:17.365
is a very wrong thing.

00:35:17.525 --> 00:35:21.125
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:23.285
you should put another one there.

00:35:23.445 --> 00:35:26.805
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

00:35:26.965 --> 00:35:31.405
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:39.005
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

00:35:39.165 --> 00:35:42.365
I don’t know how they live but they do

00:35:42.525 --> 00:35:48.525
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

00:35:48.685 --> 00:35:52.565
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

00:35:52.725 --> 00:35:58.605
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:01.765
that it should get the sunrays.

00:36:01.925 --> 00:36:03.485
There is no quarrel about it.

00:36:03.645 --> 00:36:07.285
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

00:36:07.445 --> 00:36:12.565
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

00:36:12.725 --> 00:36:14.925
The animals also don’t destroy,

00:36:15.085 --> 00:36:18.125
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

00:36:18.285 --> 00:36:21.965
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

00:36:22.125 --> 00:36:24.605
do not destroy anything

00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:30.645
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

00:36:30.805 --> 00:36:33.925
Whatever may be the cry for this,

00:36:34.085 --> 00:36:37.845
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

00:36:38.005 --> 00:36:40.845
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

00:36:41.005 --> 00:36:44.965
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:49.965
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.525
He is the greatest yogi we have

00:36:52.685 --> 00:36:56.125
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

00:36:56.285 --> 00:37:02.405
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

00:37:02.565 --> 00:37:10.925
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

00:37:11.085 --> 00:37:13.805
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.925
and we should really worship him.

00:37:16.085 --> 00:37:18.735
Through him all deities are worshiped

00:37:18.895 --> 00:37:26.125
and are made happy and blissful.

00:37:26.285 --> 00:37:31.765
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

00:37:31.925 --> 00:37:37.045
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

00:37:37.205 --> 00:37:48.325
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

00:37:48.485 --> 00:37:52.965
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:56.125
but you are dishonoring yourself

00:37:56.285 --> 00:37:59.725
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:05.565
by becoming so sinful.

00:38:05.725 --> 00:38:09.205
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:15.605
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

00:38:15.765 --> 00:38:19.245
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:22.925
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

00:38:23.085 --> 00:38:27.005
Decency is very important in understanding,

00:38:27.165 --> 00:38:33.165
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

00:38:33.325 --> 00:38:39.685
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

00:38:39.845 --> 00:38:43.925
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

00:38:44.085 --> 00:38:47.845
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

00:38:48.005 --> 00:38:52.243
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

00:38:52.403 --> 00:38:56.078
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

00:38:56.238 --> 00:39:02.014
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:06.565
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

00:39:06.725 --> 00:39:11.468
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:13.856
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

00:39:14.016 --> 00:39:16.478
because men can develop so many diseases

00:39:16.638 --> 00:39:20.286
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

00:39:21.127 --> 00:39:28.182
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

00:39:28.342 --> 00:39:31.541
because he is all the time repairing our body.

00:39:31.701 --> 00:39:35.386
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

00:39:35.546 --> 00:39:41.397
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

00:39:41.557 --> 00:39:44.310
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.845
he is protecting our Kundalini.

00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:53.584
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

00:39:53.744 --> 00:39:59.342
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

00:39:59.502 --> 00:40:03.786
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

00:40:03.946 --> 00:40:07.965
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:14.986
which is also a basis of your self realization.

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:18.584
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

00:40:18.744 --> 00:40:21.521
and you should find out about yourself,

00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:26.300
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.845
If we are; what are we doing about it?

00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:35.186
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

00:40:35.346 --> 00:40:38.108
You will not like them, will not like such people.

00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:41.390
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.464
The children are the best as we know.

00:40:44.624 --> 00:40:52.051
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:56.426
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

00:40:56.586 --> 00:40:59.921
He is the one who is really innocent

00:41:00.081 --> 00:41:04.329
but extremely, protective of you,

00:41:04.489 --> 00:41:07.963
very much protective, with his innocence.

00:41:08.123 --> 00:41:10.699
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:14.605
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

00:41:14.765 --> 00:41:17.449
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:20.899
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

00:41:21.059 --> 00:41:26.120
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.445
people are talking about it that

00:41:28.605 --> 00:41:32.669
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:36.024
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

00:41:36.184 --> 00:41:42.965
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:47.683
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

00:41:47.843 --> 00:41:51.493
In America, I was surprised to see that

00:41:51.653 --> 00:41:54.405
there were so many Red Indians,

00:41:54.565 --> 00:41:58.405
who are called as Indian Americans.

00:41:58.565 --> 00:42:03.692
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

00:42:03.852 --> 00:42:08.003
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

00:42:08.163 --> 00:42:10.805
I found the vibrations were so good.

00:42:10.965 --> 00:42:13.605
That means they were very innocent, simple people

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:16.784
and Americans that time, who went there,

00:42:16.944 --> 00:42:19.805
tried to completely finish them.

00:42:19.965 --> 00:42:23.294
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

00:42:23.454 --> 00:42:27.045
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

00:42:27.205 --> 00:42:30.055
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

00:42:30.215 --> 00:42:33.925
still the people who live there or worked about

00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:39.226
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

00:42:39.386 --> 00:42:43.959
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

00:42:44.119 --> 00:42:46.294
But they are so simple and innocent

00:42:46.454 --> 00:42:49.405
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

00:42:49.565 --> 00:42:52.205
because they used to worship the Mother.

00:42:52.365 --> 00:42:55.005
All the time they worship the Mother.

00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:58.765
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

00:42:58.925 --> 00:43:04.025
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:06.985
They have many Maoris and all those people

00:43:07.145 --> 00:43:08.865
and they encourage all of them

00:43:09.025 --> 00:43:12.865
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

00:43:13.025 --> 00:43:20.108
and they are bringing them to this state to show

00:43:20.274 --> 00:43:24.981
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

00:43:25.141 --> 00:43:27.345
Its a very good venture.

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:34.225
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

00:43:34.385 --> 00:43:39.044
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

00:43:39.204 --> 00:43:44.123
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

00:43:44.283 --> 00:43:48.385
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

00:43:48.545 --> 00:43:49.785
from the mother earth.

00:43:49.945 --> 00:43:53.705
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

00:43:53.865 --> 00:44:01.025
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

00:44:01.185 --> 00:44:02.821
That’s what it is.

00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:07.661
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:11.385
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

00:44:11.545 --> 00:44:13.886
and Government also has never troubled us

00:44:14.046 --> 00:44:16.501
or there has been no problem with them.

00:44:16.661 --> 00:44:19.206
I don’t know what’s this helping them

00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:23.726
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

00:44:23.886 --> 00:44:28.175
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:32.226
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

00:44:32.386 --> 00:44:34.476
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

00:44:34.636 --> 00:44:38.880
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.164
You will be helped, miraculously

00:44:41.324 --> 00:44:46.535
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

00:44:46.733 --> 00:44:48.558
May God Bless You.
