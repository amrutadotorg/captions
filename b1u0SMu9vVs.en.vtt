WEBVTT

00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:47.691
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:15:00.748 --> 00:15:09.491
Actually we are all seeking the truth.
So many of us,

00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:18.919
but so far, so many couldn't find and they
are lost.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:25.510
But what is the truth? What is the truth
about yourself?

00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:35.931
The truth is that you are not this body,
you are not these emotions

00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:43.516
but what are you? You are the spirit.

00:15:43.717 --> 00:15:53.081
All the great saints and incarnations have
said that you are the spirit

00:15:53.282 --> 00:16:00.842
and what we are trying to find out is our
selfhood.

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:07.694
We are after that research about ourselves.

00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:14.631
We've done lots of mistakes also
by misguided people

00:16:14.832 --> 00:16:25.990
but I must say that there is a built-in
arrangement within us, every one of you,

00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:36.847
which will take you to that selfhood,
which will give you that self-realization.

00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:46.086
It's very surprising that they have not
talked about Kundalini so far.

00:16:46.302 --> 00:16:56.411
There is a power within all of you which
is the Kundalini,

00:16:56.612 --> 00:17:02.507
which is three and a half coiled energy

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:17.290
in your, I should say, behind your
triangular bone, or it is inside it

00:17:17.491 --> 00:17:23.933
and is waiting for that moment when it can
be awakened

00:17:24.134 --> 00:17:29.460
and it can pass through the different
centers

00:17:29.638 --> 00:17:35.879
piercing through your fontanel bone area.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.933
And that's how you get your
self-realization,

00:17:42.134 --> 00:17:48.871
that you feel cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:54.186
It's an actualization. It is not My lecture

00:17:54.387 --> 00:18:00.563
or reading or anything. It's actualization
which has to take place.

00:18:00.764 --> 00:18:07.301
If you don't get it, doesn't matter. Next
time you can get it,

00:18:07.502 --> 00:18:13.405
but most of them do get it in a collective
way. It's very surprising

00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:20.094
that it took so much, so many years
for people

00:18:20.518 --> 00:18:27.786
to come to this state where they are asking
for the real thing.

00:18:27.987 --> 00:18:33.533
This is your own. This power is your own.

00:18:33.734 --> 00:18:38.205
And it is just waiting there to be
awakened.

00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:47.960
Any amount of lecturing, any amount
of reading, nothing can help you.

00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:57.735
What is needed is just a quiet mind and
it works.

00:18:57.936 --> 00:19:03.441
It works under every circumstances.
It's very surprising,

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:11.798
this was the time perhaps, was meant to be
this way.

00:19:12.643 --> 00:19:17.897
I've been to this country many a times
before also.

00:19:18.098 --> 00:19:22.050
First time when I came, I was so surprised

00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:28.729
how people were running after falsehood.
So I gave it up.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:35.533
After nine years I came, thinking that
what's the matter with these people?

00:19:35.734 --> 00:19:40.122
Why can't they understand what they have
to achieve? What they have to get?

00:19:40.323 --> 00:19:48.514
Whatever is written and said by all
the saints, by all the incarnations.

00:19:48.715 --> 00:19:58.330
I couldn't understand why they were
satisfied with all kinds of nonsense.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:06.841
And somehow they came to America and
prospered here with all their untruth.

00:20:07.042 --> 00:20:15.007
It's very sad that we have lost so many
beautiful seekers in their pursuit.

00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:21.506
Now I have to tell you one thing, simple
thing, that you must know

00:20:21.707 --> 00:20:27.135
that you have every right to know yourself,

00:20:27.336 --> 00:20:31.905
to become self-realized, every one of you.

00:20:32.106 --> 00:20:40.023
Nobody can force it and nobody can deny it.

00:20:40.224 --> 00:20:48.041
It is your fundamental right by which you
can get your self-realization.

00:20:48.242 --> 00:20:51.913
If you are a human being that's sufficient,

00:20:52.114 --> 00:20:58.257
whether you belong to America, or to India
or to any other place,

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:04.798
everyone has this right, to get your
self-realization.

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:12.345
As a result of self-realization what
happens, that's the point.

00:21:12.546 --> 00:21:20.695
Firstly, you start feeling the Divine
vibrations on your fingertips.

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:29.062
Divine vibrations like cool breeze and it
starts flowing through your hands.

00:21:29.263 --> 00:21:35.491
You'll be amazed when it first happens, you
start doubting.

00:21:35.692 --> 00:21:40.453
I know people who went and closed their
doors and windows,

00:21:40.654 --> 00:21:46.081
wanted to test and find out if they had
those cool breeze.

00:21:46.282 --> 00:21:59.197
You have it. It's a sign of yourself
emitting these pure vibrations.

00:21:59.398 --> 00:22:04.032
As a result of that so many other things
can happen.

00:22:04.233 --> 00:22:12.227
But the most important thing is that you
become a very peaceful person.

00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:17.350
You become a very balanced person

00:22:17.551 --> 00:22:24.970
and you become that witness about which
all the religions have talked.

00:22:25.171 --> 00:22:33.033
You get to the state of that witness. And
once you become the witness,

00:22:33.541 --> 00:22:43.351
you see the whole picture, the whole world
in a very different manner.

00:22:43.552 --> 00:22:51.687
You become the witness. It's a state
in which, watch everything.

00:22:51.887 --> 00:23:01.593
You do not react but you watch and your
presence itself will help people.

00:23:01.794 --> 00:23:08.396
I know America nowadays is in a very

00:23:10.358 --> 00:23:16.531
difficult state and people are quite
frightened type.

00:23:16.732 --> 00:23:21.208
If they were realized souls they would
never have been.

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:27.237
The power of realization is so great, not
that it enlightens you

00:23:27.438 --> 00:23:33.361
but it enlightens others, it enlightens
the atmosphere.

00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:40.418
So it’s very important that you get your
last breakthrough of your evolution

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:46.966
and get to that state which we call as
self-realization.

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:54.501
It is a entry into the Divine powers

00:23:54.702 --> 00:24:02.198
and this spiritual realm of life which is
very, very surprisingly,

00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:09.936
very much surprisingly is very difficult
to understand otherwise.

00:24:10.137 --> 00:24:16.649
But once you become a realized soul
automatically you know what it is.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:24.061
You become so sensitive, at the same time
you are so well protected.

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:28.223
You can solve many problems.

00:24:28.424 --> 00:24:34.919
You can do so many things which you could
never have been able to do.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:41.204
The reason is, now you have become
empowered by the Divine force.

00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:46.399
This is what you all are seeking, nothing
else.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.943
This is what you want, nothing else. And
this is what you should get it.

00:24:53.144 --> 00:25:02.206
No use going into blind place and trying

00:25:02.407 --> 00:25:08.494
to find out something which you do not
know.

00:25:08.718 --> 00:25:14.437
With this, your health will improve,

00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:23.186
your wealth will improve, your temperament
will improve

00:25:23.387 --> 00:25:29.939
and you'll become such a compassionate,
such a beautiful person

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:37.255
that people will be amazed how you have
achieved this state.

00:25:37.456 --> 00:25:43.112
You become so collective. So very
collective.

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:50.012
I am surprised how this collective
temperament has come into

00:25:50.213 --> 00:25:55.550
all the Sahaja yogis, how they work it out.

00:25:55.751 --> 00:26:03.401
It's very beautiful and surprisingly you
may belong to any, any country,

00:26:03.602 --> 00:26:11.008
far away from each other, where the people
don't know each other

00:26:11.209 --> 00:26:15.071
and such love and such understanding.

00:26:15.272 --> 00:26:21.398
This is beyond Me sometimes, you see, how
beautifully

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:27.684
they blend together, mix together and learn
from each other.

00:26:27.885 --> 00:26:37.097
Such love, such compassion and such power
is then your own, your own.

00:26:37.298 --> 00:26:44.373
You don't have to pay for it. You don't
have to do anything of the kind;

00:26:44.574 --> 00:26:49.520
just you have to get your Kundalini
awakened.

00:26:49.721 --> 00:26:55.631
which is very, very easy to do and it works
out.

00:26:55.832 --> 00:27:02.205
The time has come, I think, for en-mass
awakening, the time has come

00:27:02.406 --> 00:27:06.412
and that's why, well we have to work it
out.

00:27:06.613 --> 00:27:11.792
It's not something miraculous, I think.

00:27:11.993 --> 00:27:18.665
If you see our evolution: from what stage
to what stage to what stage.

00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:24.835
Now at a human stage what do we have
to achieve?

00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:32.293
Why are we human beings? What is the part
we have to play?

00:27:32.494 --> 00:27:36.204
Because you are a spiritual personality.

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:40.210
You have to become that spiritual
personality.

00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:48.110
It's not by reading books or doing all
kinds of rituals that you will achieve it.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:54.489
It’s just within yourself where
the Kundalini rises,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.596
passes through these various centers and
gets you connected

00:27:59.797 --> 00:28:05.854
to the Divine power which is all pervading,
which is everywhere.

00:28:06.055 --> 00:28:12.867
Then you can learn what is this, how it
works, how it helps you,

00:28:13.088 --> 00:28:17.972
how it educates you, and how it gives you
knowledge.

00:28:18.173 --> 00:28:23.785
It's really remarkable and it works
in every country.

00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:30.338
It's very surprising that people told me
that in America it will never work.

00:28:30.539 --> 00:28:38.353
I said, "Why?" "Because they are only after
gurus

00:28:38.569 --> 00:28:44.259
and would take money and make big things".
I said, "All right.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.857
After all they are human beings. And as
human beings

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:58.830
all their ideas will change. And they will
seek their peace and joy".

00:28:59.201 --> 00:29:04.446
I must say that today in America it has
worked out wonders.

00:29:04.653 --> 00:29:10.808
In all the cities here, we have people who
are following Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:19.782
Everyone who has come to Me is just
the same

00:29:19.983 --> 00:29:28.772
as any other Sahaja yogi who is from any
other country. Can you believe it?

00:29:29.002 --> 00:29:31.399
There's no difference at all

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.163
in their expression, in their love,
in their compassion.

00:29:37.387 --> 00:29:43.788
All of them are so good and so beautiful.

00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:50.136
It is hard to believe that they've
forgotten all the differences.

00:29:50.337 --> 00:29:53.350
And how have they mixed up together

00:29:53.535 --> 00:30:00.010
and are in such a loving state and
enjoyable state.

00:30:00.211 --> 00:30:08.131
It's a very different area into which you
have to enter and you enter into it,

00:30:08.332 --> 00:30:14.306
without doing anything whatsoever, only
your Kundalini rises

00:30:14.507 --> 00:30:19.616
and gives your self-realization. It is
effortless.

00:30:19.817 --> 00:30:25.804
Don't have to make any efforts, not
standing on your head or anything.

00:30:26.005 --> 00:30:30.522
Just wherever you are sitting, you get your
self-realization.

00:30:30.723 --> 00:30:36.705
And once you get it, you grow into it.
You grow into it so well.

00:30:36.906 --> 00:30:44.521
You become so empowered. You are amazed
sometimes.

00:30:44.722 --> 00:30:51.245
You see people who were never poets;
they've suddenly become poets.

00:30:51.481 --> 00:30:58.124
There are people who never could do
anything on the stage, were so frightened,

00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:00.986
have become great speakers.

00:31:01.187 --> 00:31:07.155
There are musicians who said, "Mother,
we didn't know how to sing".

00:31:07.356 --> 00:31:12.159
So all kinds of creativity comes into it.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.233
How it comes and how suddenly it has
started they don't know.

00:31:17.434 --> 00:31:22.738
You become extremely creative and you start
appreciating

00:31:22.939 --> 00:31:29.266
in a very subtle way the creativity
of others.

00:31:30.425 --> 00:31:36.186
Then, this stupid thing called greed,

00:31:36.387 --> 00:31:42.865
which has captured your country now, also,
is like this:

00:31:43.036 --> 00:31:50.406
that when people get some money, the taste
of that money makes them greedy.

00:31:50.579 --> 00:31:57.060
As simple as that. Now what happens with
Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:57.261 --> 00:32:05.312
you don't have any greed. The greed
finishes. You are a satisfied soul.

00:32:05.513 --> 00:32:15.527
Why will you ask for so many cars, so many
aeroplanes? Not needed.

00:32:15.728 --> 00:32:21.004
Because you become a wise person, become,
becoming is the point.

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:29.165
You become so wise that you don't hanker
after things.

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:35.004
You are extremely satisfied. But as
a result of that

00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:42.508
you are completely, fully blessed

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:50.472
with a very beautiful life and everything
that you want is there.

00:32:50.673 --> 00:32:54.747
This is the blessings of the Divine

00:32:54.948 --> 00:33:00.602
and so many miracles. So many miracles
that you are amazed

00:33:00.803 --> 00:33:05.664
how are you blessed. What have you done
to deserve this?

00:33:05.865 --> 00:33:13.004
You are now the spirit. These are
the blessings of the spirit.

00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:17.412
People get completely cured, no doubt,

00:33:17.613 --> 00:33:24.440
but also they become very compassionate,
extremely compassionate.

00:33:24.641 --> 00:33:28.462
And they don't understand from where did
they get this compassion,

00:33:28.663 --> 00:33:33.022
very compassionate people.

00:33:33.371 --> 00:33:40.923
Thirdly, they become thoughtlessly aware.

00:33:41.124 --> 00:33:45.489
That means complete silence within.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:54.506
You see something and you become silent.
You don't react, just you see.

00:33:54.707 --> 00:33:58.844
So enjoyable to see something clearly.

00:33:59.045 --> 00:34:06.569
But when you see something, your vibrations
act.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:12.781
It's a very powerful personality that when
you see something

00:34:12.982 --> 00:34:17.546
your vibrations act and they work it out.

00:34:17.747 --> 00:34:22.354
They can solve all kinds of problems.

00:34:22.555 --> 00:34:29.043
These vibrations can tell you what's wrong
with the other person,

00:34:29.244 --> 00:34:36.560
what's wrong with certain countries. And
also you should know how to correct it.

00:34:36.761 --> 00:34:46.676
If you can find out how you can correct
this, problem is solved.

00:34:46.877 --> 00:34:50.749
And it's so gentle and so sweet

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:56.517
that you don't have to fight with this,
it just works.

00:34:56.718 --> 00:35:02.446
You're all capable of becoming that
powerful person,

00:35:02.647 --> 00:35:07.502
of that compassion, of that love and
understanding

00:35:07.703 --> 00:35:15.691
and you just develop this thoughtless
awareness, which is a very important state,

00:35:15.892 --> 00:35:22.079
which you don't feel bored, you don't get
upset,

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:26.775
you're absolutely silently watching
everything

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:30.931
and you become such a congenial personality

00:35:31.132 --> 00:35:38.259
that those who come in contact with you
also become very, very congenial.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:44.492
You can give realizations to others. You
yourself can do it.

00:35:44.693 --> 00:35:51.794
It's not only that you get your realization
but you can give realization.

00:35:51.995 --> 00:36:00.340
It's very surprising that you become so
powerful. You can change the atmosphere.

00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:06.560
You can work out so many things just with
turning of your mind

00:36:06.761 --> 00:36:17.198
and all the bad things like, we should say,
all the things that are very destructive,

00:36:17.399 --> 00:36:22.256
you just don't like it, just give up like
that.

00:36:22.457 --> 00:36:28.425
And also you protect yourself. You are
completely protected

00:36:28.626 --> 00:36:31.116
from all the evil doers.

00:36:31.317 --> 00:36:37.131
So is important that you become that
powerful personality

00:36:37.332 --> 00:36:42.444
which I call as the spiritual person.
People have been talking about it,

00:36:42.645 --> 00:36:47.270
saying all kinds of things. They read all
kinds of stories.

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:51.592
Now the time has come for
the actualization.

00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:59.446
And this is so important, so very important
for you, that you get it.

00:36:59.647 --> 00:37:04.163
The time has come. It's your right, it's
your fundamental right, I say,

00:37:04.364 --> 00:37:08.608
to get to that state where you become

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:14.231
absolutely a personality which is
spiritual,

00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:24.821
which is empowered and which knows how to,
how to use this power, how to work it out.

00:37:25.022 --> 00:37:35.113
It's very surprising how the more advanced
we are, the less chances there are,

00:37:35.314 --> 00:37:39.679
because we are lost, lost in the forest
of advancement.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:46.633
But despite all that, people find it so
difficult

00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:52.127
to exist in such busy atmosphere,

00:37:52.328 --> 00:37:57.498
they come to Sahaj and they get completely
peaceful.

00:37:57.699 --> 00:38:04.164
Whatever it is, whatever kind of life it
is, they are absolutely peaceful.

00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:11.262
And you give peace to others. I have spoken
for thousands of times

00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:18.552
all over the world and I think it works.
It does work.

00:38:18.753 --> 00:38:22.740
They wanted Me to allow you to ask some
questions.

00:38:22.941 --> 00:38:26.712
I don't mind you asking Me questions

00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:36.513
but the problem is, this questioning also
can be quite stupid sometimes.

00:38:38.793 --> 00:38:44.544
If you want to waste sometime on certain
amount of stupidity, you can ask Me,

00:38:44.745 --> 00:38:48.351
I don't mind.

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:56.519
So, if somebody wants to ask Me questions?

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:18.607
So have you got some people who want to ask
questions? No. All right.

00:39:18.808 --> 00:39:25.409
So now, we'll have the session for
self-realization.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.134
It's very simple.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:41.229
What you have to do is to put both your
hands like this towards Me.

00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:09.923
All right.

00:40:14.063 --> 00:40:16.621
Now,

00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:24.658
please close your eyes. Please all of you
close your eyes.

00:40:24.859 --> 00:40:30.677
There's no mesmerism. So please close your
eyes.

00:41:05.928 --> 00:41:11.559
First put your left hand towards Me

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:18.684
and right hand on top of your head
on the fontanel bone area,

00:41:18.885 --> 00:41:22.118
left hand towards Me.

00:41:24.493 --> 00:41:27.226
Now,

00:41:28.483 --> 00:41:31.977
put the right hand towards Me

00:41:34.224 --> 00:41:44.334
and put the left hand on top of your head
not touching the head, above.

00:41:50.946 --> 00:41:57.545
Not both the hands, one on top of your
head, only one.

00:41:59.358 --> 00:42:02.928
Keep your eyes shut.

00:42:10.752 --> 00:42:13.140
Now,

00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:19.797
all those who are feeling cool breeze
in your hand

00:42:19.998 --> 00:42:25.281
try to see that it comes on top of your
hand, not below.

00:42:25.482 --> 00:42:28.396
If it is coming below just push it up.

00:42:28.597 --> 00:42:32.960
You can open your eyes and see.

00:42:42.502 --> 00:42:48.127
First, put both your hands towards Me
again,

00:42:49.522 --> 00:42:54.403
see, if you are feeling a cool breeze
in your hands

00:42:54.604 --> 00:43:00.272
or you are feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

00:43:00.473 --> 00:43:08.141
Could be hot, could be hot. If it is hot,
try to forgive people.

00:43:08.457 --> 00:43:12.610
Could be hot but doesn't matter.

00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:43.273
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
coming into their hands

00:43:43.474 --> 00:43:47.457
or out of their fontanel bone area,

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:52.632
please raise your hands, both your hands.

00:43:53.763 --> 00:43:56.787
Don't be afraid.

00:44:13.745 --> 00:44:20.008
Most of you, most of you have felt it.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.395
May God bless you.

00:44:27.627 --> 00:44:34.382
How many of you have not felt, please
raise your hands.

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:45.431
Hardly any.

00:44:53.594 --> 00:45:02.153
Very surprising. Very happy to see that
most of you have felt the cool breeze.

00:45:02.354 --> 00:45:06.022
May God bless you.

00:45:06.834 --> 00:45:09.856
Thank you very much.
