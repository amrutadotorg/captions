1
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:13,032
As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well equipped.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,806
but we all the time forget that we have got our vibrations,

3
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:24,145
that we have got a new awareness of vibrations.

4
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:30,303
We have got vibratory awareness and this vibratory awareness

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:40,019
are a kind of a messenger which is absolute,

6
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,975
which communicates and which tells us

7
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,049
what’s wrong with others, what’s wrong with us.

8
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:59,687
But if you start taking your decision 
through your mental, emotional enterprises,

9
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:10,057
then be sure that you’ll be misguided, 
because all these endeavours are one-sided.

10
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:15,776
Like a mental projection goes like this
 in a linear way, falls upon you;

11
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:24,088
and also an emotional one does the same. 
Even the physical is just the same.

12
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:27,929
But when you start seeing through the vibrations,

13
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,969
what do you do is to ask your Spirit to communicate to you,

14
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,649
and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge.

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,182
So you do not succumb to your conditioning or to your ego

16
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:51,030
or to any other training or any other guru but yourself.

17
00:01:51,231 --> 00:01:55,615
So it is very important for all of you

18
00:01:56,361 --> 00:02:01,126
to understand that we are not going to take any decision

19
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:08,008
on our mental level but on our vibrations.

20
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:13,385
Many people think that if I say something about someone,

21
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:18,440
[it] may be because they have reported it to Me.

22
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:24,796
But supposing if I am the source of all the vibrations,

23
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:29,316
what is there for Me to get reported?

24
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:34,074
Why should anybody report to Me? 
If they want to report they may,

25
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,991
but I know what exactly is the situation.

26
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:46,293
Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the Guest House

27
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:51,686
and about five, six professors came on their bikes.

28
00:02:51,887 --> 00:02:55,218
[They] came and told Me, “Mother, we have come to warn You

29
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,421
about a particular gentleman.” 
I said, “Who is this gentleman?”

30
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:02,605
They gave the name of this gentleman

31
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:07,022
and said, “You have to be very careful, he is a politician.”

32
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:11,749
I said, “Alright, that’s all you know about him?” 
They said, “Yes.

33
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,802
So you have to be very careful.” I said, 
“Now I’ll tell you about him,

34
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:21,396
that this man has not married his ‘wife’.

35
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:26,358
She is the wife of somebody else 
and he has eloped with this woman.

36
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,474
And the child is his,

37
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:33,537
but this lady was raped by him, 
that’s how he’s got the child.”

38
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:36,556
When I started telling, you know, they all started

39
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:40,115
raising their eyebrows and opening their eyes.

40
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:44,136
They said,: “Mother, how do you know?” I said,
“You go and find out

41
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:52,930
whatever I am saying, is it true or not.” 
They were completely stunned.

42
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,735
They went back and then reported to Me

43
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:01,039
that, “Mother, it’s surprising, 
what You said was the truth.”

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,897
So on vibrations you can know everything,

45
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:12,557
but those who try to decide things without vibrations,

46
00:04:12,758 --> 00:04:16,499
can make mistakes, till you reach a certain stage

47
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,553
where you don’t have to spread your hands to ask, 
just you will know.

48
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:25,266
But to go to that stage you have to, first of all, surrender

49
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:30,467
your discretion to vibrations.

50
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,672
Now some people don’t have proper vibrations.

51
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:40,538
Maybe their Vishuddhis are bad. 
They should take proper care of their Vishuddhis.

52
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,135
Even then, if they don’t have some physical problem 
on the Vishuddhi,

53
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:48,584
they can feel it within themselves 
what chakras are catching,

54
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,664
what is happening to this gentleman.
