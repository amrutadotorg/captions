AI GENERATED. The things

1
00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:09.199
that were going to happen because the spirits,

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.970
and he knew that what was going to happen

3
00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.850
by those things happening,

4
00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.930
he would then be able to

5
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.659
manipulate you see this is the power of the spirits

6
00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.979
coming on but he doesn't know bone by bone.

7
00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:30.139
He doesn't know.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.969
What he's done

9
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.590
is not going to be perfect.

10
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.099
It's not going to be perfect.

11
00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.919
All of them in how they do that.

12
00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.259
It was mm mm.

13
00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:44.330
Because I don't think he realised,

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.790
I mean,

15
00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:53.430
he's lost that realisation to realise the possibilities

16
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.990
something like that's the that's the advantage.

17
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.189
That's a very big advantage that any anything has been try

18
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.619
goes you get.

19
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.130
Just what you know

20
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.959
and then you just do not get any report with yourself.

21
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.370
You just don't understand.

22
00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.959
That's where you have

23
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.449
According to Parliament.

24
00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.160
No guru,

25
00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.389
no teacher can be either

26
00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:18.000
involved in

27
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.919
pain.

28
00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:22.489
Women

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.309
and money

30
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.650
not be involved.

31
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.669
Yes,

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.690
sex wise I'm talking about cannot be involved.

33
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.540
Of course not.

34
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.050
And they all are involved in those things,

35
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.580
you see,

36
00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:40.620
actually,

37
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.389
I mean,

38
00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:42.110
if you want,

39
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.910
I was reading that.

40
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.419
You see

41
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.410
You get detached in the sense you become the personality.

42
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.330
You're a detached personality.

43
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.089
You don't know what strength is.

44
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.889
You don't know what is.

45
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.019
It comes to you,

46
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.330
you may become famous,

47
00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:03.190
it's a different one,

48
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.790
but you don't know what his feeling.

49
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.029
Just don't care,

50
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.419
you know,

51
00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.569
you just don't care.

52
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.360
The person who is truthful

53
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.460
also understands,

54
00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.300
but the one who is realised,

55
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.139
the one who is going to be the world is the who

56
00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.419
is the one who just doesn't care for it.

57
00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.570
He doesn't come into.

58
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.220
I'll give you an example.

59
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.169
I don't talk about that.

60
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.809
There was one

61
00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:27.600
very rich man and his sister was um with cancer and they said,

62
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.619
OK,

I got you.

65
00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.309
I had a very interest.

66
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.210
Yeah,

67
00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.259

68
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.940

69
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:40.240
uh more,

70
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.690
but how you

71
00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.110

72
00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.729
Mhm

73
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.440
We talked to this,

74
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.910
uh,

75
00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.179
my first he said

76
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.110
doctor I don't understand much about it.

77
00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:52.440
He said,

78
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.600
no,

79
00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:52.720
no,

80
00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.389
I will do this,

81
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.669
and we went to talk to this,

82
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.050
uh,

83
00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.080
the guy,

84
00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.179
and he said that he his work and that,

85
00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:00.960
but I have 11.

86
00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:02.100
So

87
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.570
How she accepts the what is the problems.

88
00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.089
He said that my wife is a person,

89
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.970
uh,

90
00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:13.899
she's possessed,

91
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.929
she's got cancer

92
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.770
and

93
00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.929
she's such as such,

94
00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.369
and,

95
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.770
uh,

96
00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:18.309
I work done.

97
00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.720
And if she says that it is,

98
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.009
yes,

99
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.009
it is like that to my wife,

100
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.539
then I can have a divorce and I get divorce,

101
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.199
uh,

102
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.570
I get a lot of money

103
00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:30.300
myself,

104
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.220
but just now we are there all these problems are.

105
00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.380
You see someone tried to make this.

106
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:38.899
So very serious it's a right.

107
00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:42.570
about what is right.

108
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.699
I said I don't want see his wife,

109
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.830
but the rest of the time I see what it is like.

110
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.320
So that she,

111
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.699
she,

112
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.059
her name was Patricia.

113
00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.309
I must say Patria see is space.

114
00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.559
It's

115
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.619
Great

116
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.059
And she was herself a bit.

117
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.020
She came on a plane to down there was such a.

118
00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:10.699
Not that Mark was bad.

119
00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.889
No,

120
00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:12.139
he was also a good person,

121
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.679
but some dirty woman must have come in between.

122
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.330
He and

123
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.850
you all have such funny ideas.

124
00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:18.200
You must change your wives,

125
00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:18.220
like,

126
00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:21.950
like American people are,

127
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.130
you must change your fridge and you must change your room.

128
00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:25.640
We must change your wives.

129
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.089
The change is the sign according to them of progress.

130
00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.679
So what do we do?

131
00:04:30.579 --> 00:04:31.890
So I think something like that maybe,

132
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.359
but it was very serious allegation about racing.

133
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.730
She was such a fine person.

134
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.679
So and then she,

135
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.089
yeah she went off to the back and he came to see me

136
00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:42.660
and he said,

137
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.850
Mother,

138
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.809
what do you think about her?

139
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:44.200
I said,

140
00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:46.529
she's one of the finest American woman and.

141
00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:50.750
She's a very devoted wife and don't go near them.

142
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.350
They have a power of their own,

143
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.299
and I will not touch her by anything.

144
00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:56.019
And also she said,

145
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.190
Mother,

146
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.029
do you think she's,

147
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.450
uh,

148
00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.820
she's,

149
00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:58.260
uh,

150
00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.950
not cous?

151
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.369
I said,

152
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.329
not a do you maybe,

153
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.140
but she's not.

154
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.709
What about,

155
00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.959
uh,

156
00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.679
what about cancer?

157
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.709
I said she told her,

158
00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:07.450
and there's no possibility of her getting injured.

159
00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:09.559
She's a very devoted wife.

160
00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:10.790
She's a very nice person,

161
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.100
and she loves you.

162
00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:13.589
And if you try,

163
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.230
uh,

164
00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:15.399
to have a divorce with her,

165
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.160
you'll be a very miserable person.

166
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.149
Just don't,

167
00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:20.600
it's not at all good for you as a mother,

168
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.709
I'm telling you that if she's my daughter and I'm proud of.

169
00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:25.070
Oh,

170
00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.950
his face fell down,

171
00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.450
so I'm really.

172
00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.959
So I said,

173
00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.529
see,

174
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.269
really angry.

175
00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.329
I have to tell it.

176
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.600
And I was Chand why he said,

177
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.959
Mother,

178
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.959
you have no,

179
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.869
uh,

180
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.239
pragmatic approach.

181
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.760
What pragmatic.

182
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.549
I don't understand the word.

183
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.619
He said it should be practical.

184
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.029
I said,

185
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.790
what practical?

186
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.950
They said that you see he's willing.

187
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.890
Why don't you say that,

188
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.390
but I said,

189
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.420
how come it's a look,

190
00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.899
right?

191
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.589
I says.

192
00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:55.899
I said tell them why do you know if there's an innocent person

193
00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.089
and if you ban an innocent person like this.

194
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.290
You live on me.

195
00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:02.170
I would never do that.

196
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.720
But even if you do that,

197
00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:07.450
it's a very great sal which you cannot fill up by

198
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.839
giving realisation to 100 million to set the value up to?

199
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.239
I said,

200
00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:14.519
yes,

201
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.410
now will you do it.

202
00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:17.230
I'm also,

203
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.619
you see,

204
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.049
after all,

205
00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:19.839
an Indian man,

206
00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:20.290
you see,

207
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.649
no,

208
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.739
no,

209
00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:20.859
no,

210
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.970
no,

211
00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.609
I'm not.

212
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.420
We are going out.

213
00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:23.299
It's a mark.

214
00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:24.109
Don't talk to me.

215
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.230
I'm going back if she is a woman like that.

216
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.579
What you say I'm I like that the whole down.

217
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.200
Don't.

218
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.140
What are we going to do with these buildings.

219
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.820
I have to ask you why the human one.

220
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:45.149
The temples are to be built of human beings and not of

221
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.950
houses which are going to come to the house.

222
00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:49.910
We have to keep

223
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:51.459
living.

224
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.459
Uh,

225
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.459
images,

226
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.429
not these things by which people are impressed for the time being,

227
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.399
and then when you die,

228
00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:03.040
they say that I never take them.

229
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.350
Such a person cannot,

230
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.649
you see,

231
00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:09.049
it just does not work.

232
00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.179
Same about fame,

233
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.290
you see what is fame?

234
00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:12.529
It's nonsense.

235
00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:13.420
What is a fame?

236
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.429
What is the pain?

237
00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:16.119
Just tell me.

238
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.429
I don't never understand.

239
00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:18.119
Do you understand?

240
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.869
What is fame is what is it?

241
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.239
Fame,

242
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.750
if it means somebody says,

243
00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:25.070
oh,

244
00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.779
you're great,

245
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.369
you're great,

246
00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.829
run away from that.

247
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.859
Because you think they may be wanting something out of you.

248
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.220
They want to use you.

249
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.989
Normally none of the incarnations got pay they.

250
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.700
They got only stones and prescriptions.

251
00:07:39.829 --> 00:07:40.589
None of them got.

252
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.829
Yeah,

253
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:43.350
but

254
00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:47.089
there's only one way soba is going to do that

255
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.519
because

256
00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:50.549
you're going to get actualization.

257
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.679
You're going to get the experience of it.

258
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.679
That's why in your heart.

259
00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:57.359
God is going to decide anyway.

260
00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.399
This is the way.

261
00:07:58.529 --> 00:07:59.589
If you call it the same,

262
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.779
I accept that it should be so if that sort of fame is

263
00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.170
that you feel that now you see that.

264
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.190
Yearning for the person

265
00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.269
is the fame which comes out of auspiciousness.

266
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:10.640
You know,

267
00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:12.779
auspiciousness is a thing that

268
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.709
is a quality

269
00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.910
in personality by which

270
00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:18.510
you improve

271
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.239
in your,

272
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.570
in your,

273
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:20.589
uh,

274
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:20.609
everything

275
00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:23.989
in the success,

276
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.660
not this worldly success,

277
00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:28.119
but success that is satisfying.

278
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:31.640
3 means the grace that is beautifying.

279
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.409
Such a person is auspicious and such a person

280
00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.739
would have a kind of a thing which

281
00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.979
which is very different from EDM styles.

282
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.210
And the world is going to change,

283
00:08:46.219 --> 00:08:46.510
you see.

284
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.000
They are not going to have Lord Byron for a statue.

285
00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:49.440
No,

286
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.119
they're not,

287
00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.940
or Wellington is not going to be,

288
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:52.960
uh,

289
00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:52.979
then

290
00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:56.690
we are going to have something else.

291
00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:00.119
People are going to change this awareness is going to change completely.

292
00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:01.979
They are going to care for people

293
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.289
who have that eternal.

294
00:09:05.169 --> 00:09:05.780
They're not going.

295
00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:07.070
Yeah

296
00:09:16.479 --> 00:09:16.789
Hi,

297
00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:17.159
good,

298
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.900
good,

299
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:18.400
but,

300
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.030
I think,

301
00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:19.349
uh,

302
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.429
when we were all

303
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.599
talking about this for rules,

304
00:09:22.919 --> 00:09:23.710
you don't understand,

305
00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:25.070
I think one thing that's.

306
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.619
The sin against the Holy Spirit is the

307
00:09:28.909 --> 00:09:31.859
worse than all the worst of the sin.

308
00:09:33.969 --> 00:09:35.539
She's very simple to understand

309
00:09:36.479 --> 00:09:37.549
supposing somebody

310
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.479
beats you,

311
00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:40.320
won't mind if somebody beats me,

312
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.559
will you be able to do it in your heart?

313
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.390
The same way Christ has said,

314
00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:48.320
it's all right if you insult me,

315
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.750
but if you insult my mother,

316
00:09:50.429 --> 00:09:52.429
I'm going to be right on your throes.

317
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.969
There are 11 powers in this spot by which he's going to

318
00:09:58.619 --> 00:09:59.330
control such people.

319
00:10:04.109 --> 00:10:05.460
It's very simple to understand.

320
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.320
OK

321
00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:13.479
That's what

322
00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:17.130
You have to insult the mother of Christ.

323
00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:18.450
It's really dangerous.

324
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.289
That's why he never told anybody that she was the Holy Spirit.

325
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.130
She was the holy ghost.

326
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.440
That's why I didn't say because that was a protective thing.

327
00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:29.750
Did she what?

328
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.469
Ask a question.

329
00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:38.270
She

330
00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:43.369
Maria,

331
00:10:43.549 --> 00:10:44.820
are you busy on the cooking.

332
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.609
Well I just finished.

333
00:10:50.429 --> 00:10:51.330
Well she's so sweet.

334
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.140
She's working so hard.

335
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.260
Will you please go on.

336
00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:56.390
It's very logical,

337
00:10:56.429 --> 00:10:56.820
isn't it?

338
00:10:57.309 --> 00:10:58.179
It's very logical.

339
00:10:58.229 --> 00:10:58.429
I mean,

340
00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:00.630
if he's your son and,

341
00:11:00.909 --> 00:11:02.150
and if he's the son of God,

342
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.460
then you must be God.

343
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.859
But I wonder why people don't sort of see that,

344
00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:07.419
you know.

345
00:11:08.109 --> 00:11:08.340
See,

346
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:09.070
that's the trouble.

347
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.650
They can see something they can,

348
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.630
you cannot see.

349
00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:13.479
This is my this is.

350
00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:18.979
You see something which does not exist,

351
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.719
and you do not see that exists,

352
00:11:20.789 --> 00:11:21.690
this illusion,

353
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.059
it's the illusion.

354
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.070
If you can.

355
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.090
Get to see

356
00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:27.429
into that state.

357
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.510
From where you see the illusion you just enjoy the just now

358
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:31.679
as you are laughing at just now when it's a big joke,

359
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.710
you know.

360
00:11:31.719 --> 00:11:31.760
I was also there.

361
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:31.809
I was out there.

362
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:31.830
Yes,

363
00:11:31.849 --> 00:11:32.049
but this is how this is how this is how the whole of Maya because you got beyond

364
00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:53.250
that you agree that I,

365
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.219
I do not blame you for that at all.

366
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.270
So you are the crucified ones.

367
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.750
How to expose that,

368
00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:01.059
you see,

369
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.200
this is the trick of the fire if you understand it,

370
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.799
the plague stomach.

371
00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:05.510
See,

372
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.340
now you cannot kill them like that,

373
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.059
see,

374
00:12:08.429 --> 00:12:10.020
because they have entered into your head,

375
00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:11.219
see,

376
00:12:11.349 --> 00:12:12.390
so now how do I do it.

377
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.429
Is to put you there.

378
00:12:17.559 --> 00:12:17.700
You,

379
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.710
you go into them,

380
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.090
you see them

381
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.090
and then you get out of it

382
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.929
and it would be with a greater force and with greater immunity from these horrible.

383
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.469
You know,

384
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.830
Marty said something very funny when we were.

385
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:34.530
Uh,

386
00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:36.479
in September we were,

387
00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:36.500
uh,

388
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.020
he was talking about a story from the,

389
00:12:40.229 --> 00:12:40.750
from the Crown.

390
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.989
It's about the ramen who.

391
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.159
Who had rice.

392
00:12:45.169 --> 00:12:45.460
Uh,

393
00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:46.989
he went to this king's palace.

394
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.119
Um,

395
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:49.890
on his way out,

396
00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:51.479
he stole some jewellery,

397
00:12:51.969 --> 00:12:53.479
and they couldn't

398
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.940
understand why

399
00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:56.559
he stole the jewellery

400
00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:59.520
because there was the saint and he stole his jewellery.

401
00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:02.830
They discovered eventually the food that he had

402
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.690
eaten came from a village of thieves.

403
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.169
He returned the jewellery and then he said,

404
00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:09.590
he,

405
00:13:10.109 --> 00:13:11.869
he said the story looking at me,

406
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.619
you see,

407
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.229
and afterwards he walked out.

408
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.900
Because we'd just about 2 hours before been discussing this question of

409
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.010
the money they asked what they've done.

410
00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:24.650
And he

411
00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:25.390
said

412
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.299
to me as he walked out,

413
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.030
You see?

414
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.460
And it was only 4 months later that I actually saw what he was getting at.

415
00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.429
He was apologising for his own,

416
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:36.409
for his,

417
00:13:36.419 --> 00:13:37.460
for his own deeds,

418
00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.250
and he then said

419
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:40.440
that people,

420
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.340
people in this room who are going to bring down the movement,

421
00:13:54.849 --> 00:13:55.159
not that way,

422
00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:55.289
but he was trying to say these things and all that just

423
00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:57.369
to show you that uh I know what you're talking about.

424
00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.719
Is and.

425
00:14:02.429 --> 00:14:02.440
See,

426
00:14:03.299 --> 00:14:03.479
I mean,

427
00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:03.809
I,

428
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.119
I have to dictionary.

429
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.669
I don't understand what to say.

430
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.729
I have no words to say what sort of a man.

431
00:14:10.219 --> 00:14:12.179
You should really get somebody from Lucknow.

432
00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:14.010
These are nice abusers

433
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.539
that they use for such people.

434
00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:16.900
If you want,

435
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.669
I can write to someone write about 21 of them and you send it back.

436
00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:21.179
This is this,

437
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.390
this is this you are,

438
00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:24.750
and this is the mantra you say about yourself that I'm

439
00:14:29.609 --> 00:14:29.619
always,

440
00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:29.820
you know,

441
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.090
I will tell him you cannot imagine

442
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.020
what sort of a man he.

443
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.770
We had one like that,

444
00:14:36.789 --> 00:14:39.150
but openly he was like you see once,

445
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:39.859
uh,

446
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.849
we had a very great swindler in great swimmer.

447
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:46.349
His name was.

448
00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.340
I don't know where he learned that swindling,

449
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:48.929
but,

450
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.340
uh,

451
00:14:49.469 --> 00:14:51.510
he met Jahalaji in.

452
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.640
And in these matters our prime minister was very nice.

453
00:14:58.049 --> 00:15:01.719
He was very fond of people who were very properly dressed

454
00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:04.580
in a very busy English manner

455
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:09.010
and they spoke good English and they had all the English.

456
00:15:09.049 --> 00:15:10.289
I mean he was Cambridge

457
00:15:14.979 --> 00:15:15.020
we should say super.

458
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.590
So that kind of a thing our prime minister was very much interested.

459
00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:21.340
So this fellow

460
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.460
went and told him that I'm a doctor.

461
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:24.510
I'm this and all,

462
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:28.700
and also our prime minister,

463
00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:30.099
they say so I'm not,

464
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.750
I don't know,

465
00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:31.659
but that he had,

466
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.130
he,

467
00:15:32.349 --> 00:15:35.419
he could appreciate a good looking woman very much.

468
00:15:35.429 --> 00:15:37.429
So his wife was a very good looking woman,

469
00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:38.020
as they say.

470
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:38.859
I have seen

471
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.080
I've seen this horrible fellow.

472
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.469
And he managed it somehow and then when he went back to India.

473
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:46.679
Uh,

474
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.919
that time I'm telling you that I had gone to see my husband there.

475
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.219
And you know,

476
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.070
for us they allow us to sit inside the lounge and

477
00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:58.859
came out and I saw this man with a big hat over hat.

478
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.580
So I had to ask my husband,

479
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.250
who is this man?

480
00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:02.760
He said,

481
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.679
Why do you want to do?

482
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.150
I said,

483
00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:05.450
but you tell me who is this man.

484
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:05.989
I was,

485
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.460
he said,

486
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.809
Why are you so childish to them?

487
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.159
I said,

488
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.840
I'm not childish.

489
00:16:08.849 --> 00:16:09.830
I'm anxious to.

490
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.719
So he said,

491
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:11.780
uh,

492
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.409
all right,

493
00:16:13.489 --> 00:16:14.299
I'll tell him his name.

494
00:16:14.369 --> 00:16:15.090
His name is Ram,

495
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:15.570
and I said,

496
00:16:15.609 --> 00:16:16.260
What is he doing there?

497
00:16:17.239 --> 00:16:17.270
He says,

498
00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:18.599
why do you want to know about him?

499
00:16:18.609 --> 00:16:19.369
Of all the questions,

500
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:19.929
why he,

501
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:20.349
I said,

502
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.909
because he's going to talk.

503
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.030
Really,

504
00:16:23.039 --> 00:16:23.080
it's like

505
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:26.840
God.

506
00:16:28.369 --> 00:16:28.390
I said,

507
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.640
what is he connected with you?

508
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.789
He said you very much.

509
00:16:31.159 --> 00:16:31.330
I said,

510
00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.200
how he's coming for shipping.

511
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:34.900
So

512
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.659
then,

513
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:38.070
uh,

514
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.270
you know what happened that,

515
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:39.630
uh,

516
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.239
this fellow went to Joharali and the wife would have a breakfast today and then

517
00:16:44.239 --> 00:16:48.549
she used to order a bot this and that and you know Jaharalji was another,

518
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.130
uh,

519
00:16:49.159 --> 00:16:50.549
as I told you a very

520
00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:51.770
nice person,

521
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.679
he never understood that this was a.

522
00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:55.580
Then

523
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.369
he was given from that war.

524
00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:02.989
Can you imagine 65 rows of

525
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040
Good.

526
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:07.010
But my husband,

527
00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.489
as soon as this proposal came up,

528
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.959
he put down his book because I was after his life,

529
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:12.890
so they transferred him,

530
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.689
they transferred him and they gave him a bigger post and they

531
00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:18.410
said you become chairman of the big corporation with this transfer.

532
00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:19.979
And they,

533
00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:23.438
they gave him 65 lakhs of peace and the parliament passed it

534
00:17:23.438 --> 00:17:30.428
and our prime minister also was in a 65 rules were passed

535
00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:34.438
and then he got ships and so-called ships and.

536
00:17:34.859 --> 00:17:36.089
She did all the

537
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:36.890
uh

538
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.670
big big uh sort of uh shipyards and all that.

539
00:17:41.699 --> 00:17:43.119
Never paid them anyone.

540
00:17:43.459 --> 00:17:44.380
He ordered the ships.

541
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.859
He talked to the delivery and every time he took prime minister there,

542
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:48.890
I think another is,

543
00:17:48.979 --> 00:17:49.280
uh,

544
00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.250
another,

545
00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:50.969
uh,

546
00:17:50.979 --> 00:17:53.609
deputy prime minister who is nowadays our prime minister,

547
00:17:53.699 --> 00:17:54.410
the great fellow,

548
00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:54.969
you see,

549
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.569
the one,

550
00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:57.930
the one who drinks the English.

551
00:17:59.619 --> 00:18:00.930
This this side,

552
00:18:01.109 --> 00:18:01.790
this side,

553
00:18:02.579 --> 00:18:04.050
you see we have lots of buttons,

554
00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.939
you know.

555
00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:08.709
He took them there and this fellow,

556
00:18:08.949 --> 00:18:09.589
this side

557
00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:12.640
was the one who inaugurated and big this

558
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.790
thing and naturally you see the poor shipyard people

559
00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:18.119
the Hitachi and all these people who build

560
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:20.680
ships't say anything because the Prime Minister,

561
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.189
the deputy prime minister coming in Garland did this that,

562
00:18:24.199 --> 00:18:25.709
and he's going to launch the ship.

563
00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:28.790
They launched the ship and this fellow never gave them the money.

564
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.550
The ship was launched permanent.

565
00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:30.640
It out there

566
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.640
and they had no way of collecting it.

567
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.339
And these are the two great people of our country,

568
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.130
can you imagine the one who is today the prime minister and the one who was.

569
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.319
And they gave him 65 ks of.

570
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.060
Now,

571
00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:48.130
my,

572
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.520
uh,

573
00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.880
this happened and then

574
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:55.130
suddenly the whole thing started coming up just like this and then one man,

575
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.119
he found it out

576
00:18:56.949 --> 00:18:58.160
and he leaked it

577
00:18:58.469 --> 00:18:59.339
to the government

578
00:18:59.589 --> 00:19:04.329
and he leaked it to the police and all that and then suddenly my husband was in,

579
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:05.250
uh.

580
00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:06.310
No,

581
00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:07.589
he was in Japan.

582
00:19:08.069 --> 00:19:09.189
And he suddenly gave me.

583
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.550
I said,

584
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.060
how

585
00:19:11.079 --> 00:19:12.260
just a terrible thing that's happening here.

586
00:19:12.469 --> 00:19:12.750
I said,

587
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.219
what?

588
00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:14.459
Then,

589
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:14.810
uh,

590
00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:19.170
they told me that this man was supposed to have killed his first wife

591
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.630
and they took her money

592
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.449
and then come to India and did this and that and that and that and people are after

593
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.939
and because of this thing,

594
00:19:26.949 --> 00:19:27.760
it started off,

595
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.040
you see,

596
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.890
they found out also about shipping

597
00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:32.020
and these two great giants of our country,

598
00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:33.020
what should I call them,

599
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.530
you see,

600
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:34.140
they were saying,

601
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.479
you see,

602
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.479
don't harass them.

603
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.540
The police is very bad.

604
00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:40.729
Don't harass them,

605
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.229
and they were supporting him.

606
00:19:44.079 --> 00:19:44.979
But it was simple.

607
00:19:45.349 --> 00:19:46.630
They didn't take any money from him,

608
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.260
I said,

609
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.500
but then this man was absolutely gone,

610
00:19:49.589 --> 00:19:52.020
and then he one day just

611
00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:58.310
ran away from it again to some place in Pana from where we couldn't could not have any.

612
00:19:59.229 --> 00:20:02.339
The whole thing was hashed out and all these ships were frozen.

613
00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:03.479
All his money was frozen.

614
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.170
They still we managed to take away the a 4 colours of,

615
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.020
but

616
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.910
this,

617
00:20:08.949 --> 00:20:09.339
uh,

618
00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:10.550
the best part of it,

619
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:12.589
my husband says very seriously to me.

620
00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:17.109
And do you know that ₹250 that you have to pay for registration,

621
00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:18.339
that also this

622
00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:20.959
uh tug did not pay.

623
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.569
Even that he did not pay

624
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.939
and our great people like Jaharan and Muraji,

625
00:20:28.099 --> 00:20:29.869
the greatest supporters of him,

626
00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:32.869
so you shouldn't feel bad about what has happened.

627
00:20:36.869 --> 00:20:36.890
You see,

628
00:20:40.369 --> 00:20:40.780
it is.

629
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.760
And then he was arrested.

630
00:20:42.819 --> 00:20:43.430
He was,

631
00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:44.619
he,

632
00:20:44.819 --> 00:20:46.050
he came to London.

633
00:20:46.849 --> 00:20:48.219
London was came to London.

634
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.449
The case was filed in London.

635
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:50.750
I

636
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.939
He was telling stories after stories.

637
00:20:54.329 --> 00:20:55.380
Jalaji had died by that,

638
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:55.660
you see,

639
00:20:55.699 --> 00:20:59.020
he became absolutely dark and he died in a horrible condition in old age.

640
00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.949
He got a shock on his life,

641
00:21:00.739 --> 00:21:01.900
but he did such a foolish.

642
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:02.969
So he went out.

643
00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:05.310
If you see his old age photograph,

644
00:21:05.339 --> 00:21:05.640
he

645
00:21:05.859 --> 00:21:07.660
looks like a gas person so.

646
00:21:08.349 --> 00:21:09.310
And then this,

647
00:21:09.319 --> 00:21:10.020
uh,

648
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.630
this case started in London

649
00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:13.880
and then he,

650
00:21:14.449 --> 00:21:15.680
he said another drama he played,

651
00:21:15.719 --> 00:21:15.959
he said,

652
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.089
you see these people are all against Javalaji to take back

653
00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:21.560
to being there to all playing and this and that.

654
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.939
And the judge was listening to him.

655
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.859
I just said now I'm finished,

656
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.180
he said,

657
00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:35.869
now I see that you are a crook of the first bottles and you are a tug and

658
00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:39.359
you are this and you are that and now will you shut up.

659
00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:40.979
That's what they said and it.

660
00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:45.619
I said that's the way you said.

661
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.390
And he said you take 2 running jumps and go to him.

662
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.250
These are the words he used.

663
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.410
And then he was in jail.

664
00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:58.750
He came out of the jail,

665
00:21:58.839 --> 00:21:59.839
and then Indira Gandhi,

666
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.319
the great,

667
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:00.709
you see,

668
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.310
another great lady we had,

669
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.510
prime minister,

670
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.300
she saw to him that he goes out of.

671
00:22:08.719 --> 00:22:09.260
Now he's up.

672
00:22:13.849 --> 00:22:15.640
So are we not

673
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:26.160
sufficiently looted?

674
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:26.229
Do you want more examples.

675
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:27.589
It's a fact,

676
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.920
you see,

677
00:22:28.069 --> 00:22:28.459
so,

678
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.900
uh,

679
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.500
imagine people like that,

680
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.849
and the,

681
00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:34.619
and I would not even blame Jawar Laji for this because

682
00:22:34.949 --> 00:22:36.150
he had such a

683
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.060
big,

684
00:22:37.349 --> 00:22:37.780
uh,

685
00:22:37.949 --> 00:22:41.270
secretariat with the best the cream of our country,

686
00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:42.640
the most intelligent people,

687
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.300
all the intelligence of India

688
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.810
was behind this,

689
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.390
and they all did it

690
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:51.229
in good faith,

691
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.819
you see,

692
00:22:51.989 --> 00:22:53.260
the good faith part.

693
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.329
And none of them got a single pie.

694
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:58.400
Hello,

695
00:22:58.689 --> 00:22:59.890
how are you?

696
00:23:00.449 --> 00:23:00.459
Yes,

697
00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:00.689
yes,

698
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.839
yes,

699
00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:01.859
yeah,

700
00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:01.880
yeah,

701
00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:03.920
yeah.

702
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.010
Very nice children there.

703
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.619
Come along,

704
00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:08.020
come along,

705
00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:08.589
come along.

706
00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:11.489
I'm just waiting for you to come down here.

707
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:12.819
Come along,

708
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.420
come along,

709
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:14.699
sit down.

710
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.670
Sit down,

711
00:23:17.709 --> 00:23:18.229
sit down.

712
00:23:18.949 --> 00:23:19.589
Good.

713
00:23:21.069 --> 00:23:21.079
Uh,

714
00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:21.869
see,

715
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:23.699
the force has come.

716
00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:24.439
See,

717
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.199
vibrations.

718
00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:26.410
You just see the vibrations.

719
00:23:26.489 --> 00:23:27.380
All of them are.

720
00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:27.939
See

721
00:23:28.709 --> 00:23:30.819
how beautiful all realise.

722
00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:32.280
Just look at this chair.

723
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:33.900
Be there.

724
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.189
Can you remove this then they can sit comfortably.

725
00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:34.250
I think this may be,

726
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:34.270
yeah.

727
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.550
Look at them.

728
00:23:49.479 --> 00:23:49.839
Maria,

729
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.170
who are they expecting to come with.

730
00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:53.109
Good,

731
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.160
you said there would be only 10 people.

732
00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:58.750
Maria,

733
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.890
you said there would be only 10 people.

734
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.569
Uh,

735
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.819
good,

736
00:24:06.829 --> 00:24:08.390
and the great people have come.

737
00:24:08.469 --> 00:24:08.739
You see,

738
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.219
these are great people.

739
00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:11.579
What's your name?

740
00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:12.829
Mm

741
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.319
You must tell your name.

742
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:20.890
Mhm.

743
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.140
What's your name?

744
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.119
You see the eyes.

745
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:36.650
I'm.

746
00:24:39.089 --> 00:24:39.170
Be

747
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.479
And then,

748
00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:42.689
just put your hands like this.

749
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.170
Let's see if you feel the food,

750
00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:44.920
all right?

751
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:46.750
Mhm.

752
00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:51.619
Just like this

753
00:24:53.219 --> 00:24:53.640
it's a boundary.

754
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:00.920
This speaking.

755
00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:08.530
What language they speak with that tan.

756
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:10.290
Huh?

757
00:25:14.329 --> 00:25:14.339
Mhm.

758
00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.000
Oh.

759
00:25:19.619 --> 00:25:19.739
What

760
00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:25.750
This tremendous.

761
00:25:26.819 --> 00:25:28.089
They brought the post for me.

762
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.890
hello.

763
00:25:32.969 --> 00:25:32.979
Mm,

764
00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:36.349
see,

765
00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:38.000
I mean this is what it is.

766
00:25:39.439 --> 00:25:40.000
Can you see,

767
00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.069
can you feel them?

768
00:25:41.729 --> 00:25:42.989
Can you feel the vibrations?

769
00:25:43.439 --> 00:25:45.189
Well I just see this great.

770
00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:47.510
They'll do the job for me.

771
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.069
I don't have to say.

772
00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:50.160
It's

773
00:25:54.849 --> 00:25:56.250
Please put your hands also like,

774
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.810
all of it.

775
00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.170
Just like.

776
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:01.540
It's also.

777
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:08.130
See now,

778
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.300
you feel some cool?

779
00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:12.089
Mhm.

780
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.079
Yes,

781
00:26:14.319 --> 00:26:14.609
good.

782
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.160
Mhm.

783
00:26:25.079 --> 00:26:25.089
OK.

784
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:29.859
Are you feeling all right there?

785
00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:31.219
All of you?

786
00:26:31.829 --> 00:26:33.229
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

787
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.839
See.

788
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.530
How are you feeling?

789
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.849
You see,

790
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:42.900
you have to be great people to be the mother of the children.

791
00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:44.449
They're great children,

792
00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:46.579
and they've selected you as a mother.

793
00:26:46.619 --> 00:26:48.290
There must be some reason for it.

794
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.420
You.

795
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:57.300
Mhm.

796
00:27:01.099 --> 00:27:01.349
I'll be.

797
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:03.930
I.

798
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.400
Open that window.

799
00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:07.780
That window is better.

800
00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:09.199
You open that one.

801
00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:11.430
That one.

802
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:15.400
Oh

803
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.849
It's good.

804
00:27:21.959 --> 00:27:22.880
And where did you go?

805
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.260
One.

806
00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:32.180
Oh,

807
00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:33.810
I did see Sebastian there.

808
00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:35.939
That's another one bound last yeah.

809
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.420
Are you feeling the cold pain?

810
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.949
Is your father dealing with you?

811
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:53.689
What he?

812
00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:56.790
Have more of it and more of it.

813
00:27:57.099 --> 00:27:58.140
Let it go inside.

814
00:27:59.369 --> 00:27:59.969
Absolutely

815
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:10.069
Oh

816
00:28:33.569 --> 00:28:34.650
You've got gold.

817
00:28:36.569 --> 00:28:37.390
Gmail.com.

818
00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:41.859
I get it.

819
00:28:44.699 --> 00:28:44.709
Mm.

820
00:28:47.839 --> 00:28:48.040
See,

821
00:28:48.119 --> 00:28:49.199
you've already got the help.

822
00:28:50.869 --> 00:28:51.989
So I should do I

823
00:28:52.869 --> 00:28:54.650
So many of you are

824
00:28:54.829 --> 00:28:55.989
born in this country.

825
00:28:58.839 --> 00:28:59.810
I will find it.

826
00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:01.719
Be enough?

827
00:29:02.869 --> 00:29:03.979
Feeling better,

828
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:06.270
better now.

829
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:11.079
And the best thing is you must know the know-how.

830
00:29:12.199 --> 00:29:13.709
Otherwise you are not to believe anything.

831
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.030
Why should you not believe anyone who doesn't tell you anything?

832
00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:16.310
No.

833
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.770
They call it science.

834
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:22.339
Do you know,

835
00:29:22.469 --> 00:29:24.380
do you have anything,

836
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:24.579
I mean,

837
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.069
any knowledge of science

838
00:29:26.459 --> 00:29:27.369
about which you have,

839
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:28.780
you don't have to know how?

840
00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:36.800
In even everything.

841
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:45.680
On it.

842
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.270
Maria's house is blessed many a times.

843
00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:55.079
It's beautiful.

844
00:29:59.709 --> 00:29:59.719
Mm.

845
00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:11.130
Oh

846
00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:13.569
I have

847
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.010
That

848
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:22.650
I.

849
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:24.900
OK,

850
00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:25.369
stop it.

851
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:40.689
Why don't you sit down,

852
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.199
Bala.

853
00:30:43.079 --> 00:30:43.290
OK,

854
00:30:43.439 --> 00:30:45.709
if the chair people can go back,

855
00:30:46.599 --> 00:30:48.760
then others can sit in between all those who

856
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.729
are occupying chairs should go to the back.

857
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.349
Better idea.

858
00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.069
So that those who can sit in front,

859
00:30:56.109 --> 00:30:56.640
you see.

860
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.729
Is this sofa could be pushed a little bit this side.

861
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.739
Um.

862
00:31:14.219 --> 00:31:14.750
Thank you

863
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.530
Hello.

864
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:18.420
Come,

865
00:31:19.599 --> 00:31:22.219
we have had a very nice session of great laughter

866
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.829
something like talking about,

867
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.469
uh,

868
00:31:26.479 --> 00:31:27.439
Charlie Chaplin.

869
00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:30.609
This

870
00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:37.160
I

871
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.989
Hopefully he brought my eye.

872
00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:47.040
I have my

873
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.290
my chapels that's.

874
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.229
I think you should put this chest down at the back

875
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.810
so that they can see

876
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.689
you are all right,

877
00:32:04.699 --> 00:32:04.719
just yeah,

878
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.819
mm.

879
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.439
Did you,

880
00:32:12.589 --> 00:32:14.459
did you turn up or would you like?

881
00:32:20.869 --> 00:32:20.910
Hello hello.

882
00:32:36.489 --> 00:32:36.589
Yeah

883
00:32:38.099 --> 00:32:38.260
No.

884
00:32:41.479 --> 00:32:41.810
Just come,

885
00:32:43.349 --> 00:32:43.369
just come.

886
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.349
We have been having a big laughter.

887
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:46.540
Yes,

888
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:46.630
she's upstairs.

889
00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:54.770
We just brought his,

890
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.410
brought his wife.

891
00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.410
This is your daughter.

892
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:06.359
I don't think what's up to,

893
00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:08.369
but she's recognised roots and photographs.

894
00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:11.540
She's doing this with her glasses.

895
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.060
smaller.

896
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.219
She points out.

897
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:23.670
Go,

898
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.069
go,

899
00:33:24.209 --> 00:33:24.920
go,

900
00:33:25.079 --> 00:33:25.439
go.

901
00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:29.699
The train from Glasgow is late.

902
00:33:31.479 --> 00:33:32.119
Sorry it's too late.

903
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.380
All right,

904
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.550
you're never late with me.

905
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.439
Can you sit on the ground?

906
00:33:39.609 --> 00:33:39.900
Oh yeah,

907
00:33:40.449 --> 00:33:41.160
very much so.

908
00:34:04.589 --> 00:34:06.640
So all the quorum is complete?

909
00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:07.839
All of that.

910
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:10.580
There are people from.

911
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:12.668
They,

912
00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:12.929
they,

913
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.040
they have brought the real force,

914
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.080
see all of them,

915
00:34:16.688 --> 00:34:16.949
yeah,

916
00:34:17.168 --> 00:34:18.449
they have brought the forces.

917
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:21.080
Just sit like this,

918
00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.270
just like this.

919
00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:22.699
I'm not.

920
00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:27.938
I

921
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.438
I'm still on Monday that there's gonna be 10 people.

922
00:34:44.699 --> 00:34:44.790
One of my friends have the line the line.

923
00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:50.320
Are you feeling?

924
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:56.719
You've got it already.

925
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:57.290
See,

926
00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.070
it's awesome.

927
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.320
What about you?

928
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.280
See,

929
00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:03.909
right,

930
00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:04.010
just wash my hands you see that.

931
00:35:04.959 --> 00:35:05.110
Yes

932
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.030
What about you?

933
00:35:09.219 --> 00:35:10.050
Are you feeling this pain?

934
00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.350
Not yet?

935
00:35:16.229 --> 00:35:18.229
Just now you will know if it is there.

936
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:18.949
No,

937
00:35:19.149 --> 00:35:20.219
no sort of

938
00:35:22.459 --> 00:35:22.489
feel everything no.

939
00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:29.360
Mm.

940
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:32.629
Yeah

941
00:35:35.239 --> 00:35:37.879
We've been just laughing about all the things this year now.

942
00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:40.010
and how they

943
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.780
have cheated all of us and all that

944
00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:49.939
oh God,

945
00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:50.969
and now we know,

946
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.399
and now,

947
00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:52.139
now we,

948
00:35:52.179 --> 00:35:55.340
we have to decide and plan out how we are going to outfit all of that,

949
00:35:56.379 --> 00:35:58.020
so it's plan we have to work it out.

950
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.229
Mm

951
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.030
Yeah

952
00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:13.030
Oh

953
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.709
Mm mm.

954
00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:20.979
I think he's.

955
00:36:24.399 --> 00:36:25.610
Just to be settled down and experience

956
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.550
which is to be settled down.

957
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.520
We could only rises at the first

958
00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.360
there's no basic problem.

959
00:36:34.439 --> 00:36:35.110
I mean,

960
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.429
I would say that as I have told you before,

961
00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:37.840
but

962
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:38.310
I,

963
00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:39.409
I couldn't give the address to the person.

964
00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:39.469
So with the foreigners,

965
00:36:39.479 --> 00:36:39.489
so

966
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.639
there's something special about you that your

967
00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:47.600
own motherland is giving you that problem.

968
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:50.590
And

969
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.729
it is spontaneous,

970
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.709
it is very fruitful,

971
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.280
and it does

972
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:56.409
happen.

973
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:58.459
But then it settles back.

974
00:36:59.320 --> 00:36:59.889
In a sense,

975
00:36:59.899 --> 00:37:02.020
it has to look after all the centres.

976
00:37:02.939 --> 00:37:03.879
And all the

977
00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.360
problems that you've had.

978
00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.219
So it comes down then you start thinking about it.

979
00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.350
That's the point.

980
00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:13.149
You cannot think about it.

981
00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:17.280
You didn't get it by thinking this one thing you must know that you did not get it by.

982
00:37:18.709 --> 00:37:20.870
You got it because it was to happen.

983
00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.719
So if you think about you will reach,

984
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:25.899
you cannot think

985
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.080
it is love.

986
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:28.580
What can you think about love.

987
00:37:29.389 --> 00:37:30.669
It's not science.

988
00:37:33.899 --> 00:37:35.699
And just now if you watch your eye,

989
00:37:36.149 --> 00:37:37.120
watch yourself,

990
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.449
you are beyond us,

991
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.379
most of you,

992
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.360
the thought.

993
00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.260
Why?

994
00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:45.610
Done it.

995
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:49.120
Are you too close to that?

996
00:37:55.129 --> 00:37:55.159
You do not.

997
00:37:55.169 --> 00:37:55.219
You can put it off.

998
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:55.370
I think just,

999
00:37:55.379 --> 00:37:55.760
just a light,

1000
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.600
is it yeah.

1001
00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:01.030
Mhm.

1002
00:38:02.629 --> 00:38:04.459
Are you feeling the colds nicely.

1003
00:38:07.199 --> 00:38:07.830
The same place.

1004
00:38:08.649 --> 00:38:09.020
Good.

1005
00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.590
So let's talk of something nice now.

1006
00:38:20.729 --> 00:38:20.780
Let's talk about,

1007
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800
yes,

1008
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:21.639
let's have something about the about the light.

1009
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.350
All right,

1010
00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.439
we talked about the massage pretty much.

1011
00:38:29.169 --> 00:38:29.189
Right

1012
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.489
Oh.

1013
00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:40.280
So.

1014
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:44.760
I.

1015
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:46.679
Yes.

1016
00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:54.459
Oh

1017
00:38:58.399 --> 00:38:58.409
OK.

1018
00:39:01.189 --> 00:39:04.379
I was going to bring her because she has been initiated into but I.

1019
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.689
But perhaps you can look at that.

1020
00:39:13.179 --> 00:39:15.780
They're not very new but she's about a year older now.

1021
00:39:16.129 --> 00:39:16.570
That one's.

1022
00:39:19.409 --> 00:39:20.389
What did you say she has TM.

1023
00:39:24.209 --> 00:39:24.679
I

1024
00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:31.469
And uh.

1025
00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:35.479
She's about a year old,

1026
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.120
she's,

1027
00:39:36.129 --> 00:39:36.370
so

1028
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:37.929
that was last.

1029
00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:43.939
She got dramas.

1030
00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:44.669
Mhm

1031
00:39:48.909 --> 00:39:48.919
mhm.

1032
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:49.879
the right heart you also can feel yeah

1033
00:39:55.409 --> 00:39:56.840
that's dramas you see this is ramas

1034
00:39:58.639 --> 00:39:59.399
so I will tell you about the.

1035
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.060
Uh,

1036
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.649
so

1037
00:40:08.199 --> 00:40:09.590
I would have to.

1038
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.969
Tell you about

1039
00:40:18.159 --> 00:40:18.399
Yeah

1040
00:40:20.169 --> 00:40:21.050
Ourselves,

1041
00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:22.010
what are we?

1042
00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:25.310
Actually we know so little about ourselves.

1043
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.500
This ignorance

1044
00:40:27.189 --> 00:40:29.620
is responsible for this kind of

1045
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.510
problem that you all have faced

1046
00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:34.189
because you're so ignorant about

1047
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.139
and

1048
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.850
the reason is the knowledge about what I'm going to tell you,

1049
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:42.489
you can only have

1050
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.280
when

1051
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:44.689
you are.

1052
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.620
Without that,

1053
00:40:48.909 --> 00:40:53.270
one cannot talk about it and one cannot explain to you because it is too fantastic.

1054
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.510
It's so fantastic that you cannot believe it,

1055
00:40:57.949 --> 00:40:59.260
and you cannot accept it,

1056
00:40:59.429 --> 00:41:01.179
and that's why it is not

1057
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.979
uh

1058
00:41:02.189 --> 00:41:03.959
for the human mind to conceive,

1059
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.949
it goes beyond.

1060
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.860
If I say

1061
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.639
That

1062
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.270
There is

1063
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.370
God's divine love.

1064
00:41:17.909 --> 00:41:20.149
Which is the most dynamic power.

1065
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.760
Which is the only power.

1066
00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:25.159
That

1067
00:41:27.479 --> 00:41:29.189
Guides this situation.

1068
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:30.770
That

1069
00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:33.830
Coordinates everything

1070
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.179
that looks after us

1071
00:41:36.469 --> 00:41:38.110
and that has made us a human being.

1072
00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:39.340
You won't believe it.

1073
00:41:41.669 --> 00:41:43.770
That there is such a problem of God.

1074
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.389
All that you see other things is absolutely false.

1075
00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:52.889
It's just a reflection,

1076
00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:53.939
it's not the mirror.

1077
00:41:57.229 --> 00:41:58.679
And this power.

1078
00:42:00.409 --> 00:42:03.260
Then enter into every atom.

1079
00:42:04.419 --> 00:42:05.479
Every molecule

1080
00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:09.310
And can control all that.

1081
00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.600
We see it every day,

1082
00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:13.429
those things,

1083
00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.399
but we take it for granted,

1084
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.760
like we see the flowers suddenly becoming the fruits.

1085
00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.229
How will they become?

1086
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.989
A mango tree will give you

1087
00:42:28.199 --> 00:42:28.770
mangoes.

1088
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.330
It won't give you roses.

1089
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.229
How does it happen?

1090
00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.959
You should see even in chemistry.

1091
00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.889
That are created on this earth

1092
00:42:48.959 --> 00:42:51.270
have a regular planning about it.

1093
00:42:51.439 --> 00:42:52.969
They are divided into.

1094
00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:55.489
Exactly

1095
00:42:55.939 --> 00:42:56.649
8

1096
00:42:57.139 --> 00:42:58.169
divisions.

1097
00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:01.050
Now how all this happens?

1098
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.449
We never think about it,

1099
00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.919
we take it for granted.

1100
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.129
We try to find out what we see,

1101
00:43:06.449 --> 00:43:07.169
what it is,

1102
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.929
and then we say,

1103
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.129
oh,

1104
00:43:08.209 --> 00:43:09.580
we are the scientists.

1105
00:43:11.199 --> 00:43:13.260
But you cannot say how it works.

1106
00:43:14.479 --> 00:43:16.489
Even if you take a sulphur dioxide,

1107
00:43:16.919 --> 00:43:17.800
an ordinary.

1108
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:19.699
Atom or sulphur,

1109
00:43:20.929 --> 00:43:21.820
the sulphur atom.

1110
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.080
Is on top and there are 2 oxygen.

1111
00:43:25.979 --> 00:43:27.979
If you see it under microscope,

1112
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.379
you can find out that it pulsates.

1113
00:43:31.429 --> 00:43:32.320
And there's

1114
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.699
a kind of a vibration that's passing

1115
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.040
between these

1116
00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:37.780
atoms,

1117
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.120
and these vibrations are of three types.

1118
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.729
Unequal

1119
00:43:45.899 --> 00:43:49.060
equal dissimul.

1120
00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:51.959
And who does that

1121
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.020
and how,

1122
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.870
why

1123
00:43:54.239 --> 00:43:56.760
that certain act like this something act like that.

1124
00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:00.370
Even the matter which is a dead thing,

1125
00:44:00.449 --> 00:44:03.770
which we do not think is capable of having any energy in it,

1126
00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.449
that's what we used to think now of course you have changed your ideas about that.

1127
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.879
That too has such a

1128
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.479
beautiful arrangement.

1129
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.709
Even up to the molecular state.

1130
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:20.860
Up to the atom stage,

1131
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:21.709
you can see

1132
00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:23.219
how it is

1133
00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:25.300
mathematically arranged

1134
00:44:25.989 --> 00:44:28.389
the protons and the neutrons around.

1135
00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:31.239
It is just to see and wonder.

1136
00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.129
Yeah

1137
00:44:35.909 --> 00:44:38.060
And when you see it in the nature.

1138
00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:40.870
And these elements.

1139
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.889
There atoms,

1140
00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:44.189
then you see

1141
00:44:44.439 --> 00:44:45.370
later on

1142
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.919
where do you start watching.

1143
00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:51.179
Something much more complex,

1144
00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:52.620
that is a living

1145
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:53.939
cell.

1146
00:44:55.689 --> 00:44:57.500
With the carbon coming into it,

1147
00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.080
we just take it for granted.

1148
00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.280
We never bother

1149
00:45:00.449 --> 00:45:02.370
to know from where did this carbon come?

1150
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.209
And how with carbon combination life can

1151
00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.419
we just take ourselves also for granted as if

1152
00:45:09.669 --> 00:45:14.629
uh we are great kings and that whatever we have got our human life is our own,

1153
00:45:14.709 --> 00:45:15.010
you see,

1154
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.820
sort of thing,

1155
00:45:16.469 --> 00:45:17.659
and we think that if we,

1156
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:19.020
if we have this human body,

1157
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.790
it's our.

1158
00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:22.810
Special right to have it.

1159
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.649
Even this eye of if you see such a complex

1160
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.709
camera.

1161
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.679
How it works

1162
00:45:35.909 --> 00:45:39.439
instantaneously how it captures.

1163
00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:42.060
It's something

1164
00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:45.010
Beyond our comprehension,

1165
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.540
so we negate it.

1166
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.060
We don't see it's all right.

1167
00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:49.409
We take it for granted.

1168
00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.169
That's the way human beings live with it.

1169
00:45:52.379 --> 00:45:52.459
See,

1170
00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:54.330
if you cannot cope with the thing,

1171
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.530
then what we do is to accept it for granted and it.

1172
00:45:58.500 --> 00:45:59.580
That's a sensible thing.

1173
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.860
In the same way nature has made you especially in such a manner

1174
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.510
that

1175
00:46:07.919 --> 00:46:10.270
you cannot hear certain frequencies,

1176
00:46:10.959 --> 00:46:13.739
you can only hear certain frequencies.

1177
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.310
You are created with such

1178
00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.409
beautiful adaptations

1179
00:46:20.899 --> 00:46:23.770
to nature and surroundings.

1180
00:46:24.399 --> 00:46:27.820
This earth is moving with such a tremendous speed you do not feel.

1181
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.899
It is spinning round so fast you cannot feel.

1182
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.500
We take all this for granted.

1183
00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.040
And we think we are human beings,

1184
00:46:37.239 --> 00:46:39.399
but why are you human beings?

1185
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.360
Why have you become human beings?

1186
00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:45.409
What can you find out?

1187
00:46:47.419 --> 00:46:49.469
What did you find out so far?

1188
00:46:50.949 --> 00:46:52.340
Whatever you can see,

1189
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.419
whatever is absolutely factual that you have found out,

1190
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:58.909
you have not been able to find out

1191
00:46:59.429 --> 00:47:02.620
why these things happen and how these things.

1192
00:47:05.719 --> 00:47:05.729
How

1193
00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:10.080
are you going to find out about such a complex thing that human beings?

1194
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:17.149
You have become a human being without doing anything about it.

1195
00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:23.389
And what are you going to do?

1196
00:47:25.919 --> 00:47:27.610
For getting that awareness

1197
00:47:27.989 --> 00:47:28.629
by which

1198
00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.439
you are going to know yourself.

1199
00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:32.429
Yeah.

1200
00:47:35.879 --> 00:47:37.129
Nothing whatsoever.

1201
00:47:37.379 --> 00:47:38.139
On the contrary,

1202
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:38.840
effort.

1203
00:47:42.709 --> 00:47:44.959
Human beings food because they have

1204
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.520
a sense that they can put in effort.

1205
00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.790
But you reach a certain stage later on that you feel you are putting more effort.

1206
00:47:52.899 --> 00:47:53.729
It's just working out.

1207
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:57.169
You're just sitting down very nicely and the whole thing is working out.

1208
00:48:01.239 --> 00:48:01.949
Say for example.

1209
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:04.199
There is a relay

1210
00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:05.560
in London.

1211
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:07.899
About some programmes.

1212
00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:10.060
In the tee.

1213
00:48:11.149 --> 00:48:11.310
Now,

1214
00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:12.649
it's all in the atmosphere.

1215
00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:13.310
You don't see it.

1216
00:48:15.939 --> 00:48:17.540
And suddenly you start your tea.

1217
00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:20.330
What effort have you put in?

1218
00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.479
It was all built in there.

1219
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.389
And it was all

1220
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.689
Whatever was done on the other end

1221
00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:34.419
was also done by somebody.

1222
00:48:34.479 --> 00:48:36.129
You have just put on the switch,

1223
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.219
and you get.

1224
00:48:38.149 --> 00:48:39.250
Pictures

1225
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:43.780
which you do not see normally on the walls nowhere but some you get they are there.

1226
00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:50.129
But you believe into it because this you are seeing with your own eyes.

1227
00:48:54.489 --> 00:48:55.909
It is an actual thing.

1228
00:48:55.959 --> 00:48:57.310
That's why you believe into it,

1229
00:48:57.439 --> 00:49:01.320
and that's why you must believe into it when it's an actual.

1230
00:49:02.169 --> 00:49:04.729
So we come to that position where

1231
00:49:05.139 --> 00:49:06.159
we understand

1232
00:49:06.459 --> 00:49:09.850
that if anyone talks about higher life.

1233
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.239
About the power beyond this,

1234
00:49:13.969 --> 00:49:15.729
then we must have actualization of.

1235
00:49:16.659 --> 00:49:17.219
You must be.

1236
00:49:20.129 --> 00:49:21.070
At this point

1237
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:21.909
there's a problem.

1238
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.129
Because

1239
00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.179
it is easy to talk about this.

1240
00:49:30.139 --> 00:49:30.149
That

1241
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:31.649
there is a higher life,

1242
00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:32.879
there's God and

1243
00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:35.159
His power working and all that,

1244
00:49:35.209 --> 00:49:37.330
all this lecture you can hear from many people.

1245
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.899
Even actualization of it,

1246
00:49:41.909 --> 00:49:42.139
you see,

1247
00:49:42.199 --> 00:49:45.919
they may say that jumping like a frog is actualization.

1248
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:46.219
Yes,

1249
00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.830
we have had people like that,

1250
00:49:48.179 --> 00:49:48.649
you know,

1251
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:55.709
in one of my lectures there was a gentleman who was both his feet towards me and.

1252
00:49:56.889 --> 00:49:57.560
I said

1253
00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:59.229
Uh,

1254
00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:00.699
it's all right for me.

1255
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:02.570
But I don't know

1256
00:50:03.179 --> 00:50:04.780
what's going to happen to this gentleman,

1257
00:50:06.409 --> 00:50:06.639
and then

1258
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.169
one of the boys went and said,

1259
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:10.379
you're not supposed to sit like this to a mother.

1260
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:11.649
She said,

1261
00:50:11.679 --> 00:50:12.000
you see,

1262
00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.189
I'm sorry,

1263
00:50:13.479 --> 00:50:15.850
but if I sit in any other form,

1264
00:50:15.919 --> 00:50:16.679
I cannot sit.

1265
00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:19.040
I start jumping like a rock.

1266
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520
Mhm.

1267
00:50:24.629 --> 00:50:25.429
So I think

1268
00:50:26.209 --> 00:50:27.209
How do you

1269
00:50:27.389 --> 00:50:29.370
uh think that this is uh.

1270
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.479
This happens,

1271
00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.300
happens every time.

1272
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:35.310
And if I do it now,

1273
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:36.979
it will start like that.

1274
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.179
So I said,

1275
00:50:38.189 --> 00:50:38.979
uh,

1276
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:39.350
but,

1277
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.020
uh,

1278
00:50:40.469 --> 00:50:41.669
why did that happen?

1279
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:43.739
because my kundalini has a reason.

1280
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:45.219
I'm a self relaxed person.

1281
00:50:46.719 --> 00:50:48.060
Who has told you this?

1282
00:50:48.229 --> 00:50:51.739
He took out a big book like that won't believe such a big book,

1283
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:55.379
and he showed me written down there that when Kundalini rises,

1284
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:57.310
you start jumping like a frog.

1285
00:50:58.699 --> 00:50:59.879
Who is this gentleman?

1286
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.459
This is some Aarya Rama,

1287
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.659
some some sort of a name,

1288
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:04.419
such a big name,

1289
00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:04.969
you see,

1290
00:51:05.199 --> 00:51:05.620
and

1291
00:51:05.939 --> 00:51:06.770
horrible

1292
00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.300
person's photograph on everything,

1293
00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.239
such a big,

1294
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.300
big book,

1295
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.820
and this fellow is carrying on his head all the time,

1296
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:16.979
jumping at a frog.

1297
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:20.649
He says that yes,

1298
00:51:20.729 --> 00:51:21.840
you have to jump like a.

1299
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.909
So I asked him,

1300
00:51:26.449 --> 00:51:28.370
now when you are going to evolve,

1301
00:51:28.489 --> 00:51:30.239
are you going to become a frog?

1302
00:51:30.939 --> 00:51:32.070
Or a monkey.

1303
00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:33.679
What are you going to be?

1304
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.020
This is.

1305
00:51:38.169 --> 00:51:40.030
You can use your brains for this

1306
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:41.590
to understand

1307
00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.399
what to.

1308
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:44.120
Expect,

1309
00:51:44.379 --> 00:51:44.649
see?

1310
00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:47.899
You're not going to become like monkeys

1311
00:51:48.409 --> 00:51:49.169
or pigs.

1312
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.290
Or even lies.

1313
00:51:52.659 --> 00:51:55.659
You're already the highest and you have to be something higher.

1314
00:51:57.159 --> 00:51:58.439
So that rules it out.

1315
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.780
Then the fellow says

1316
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.679
another one

1317
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:03.820
he came to me.

1318
00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:05.989
And he says

1319
00:52:06.879 --> 00:52:08.229
the best was

1320
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.350
we had

1321
00:52:09.719 --> 00:52:10.840
one from.

1322
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:13.110
Uh,

1323
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:14.590
let me out,

1324
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.310
is that?

1325
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:17.780
This is David.

1326
00:52:18.689 --> 00:52:19.469
He's our surgeon.

1327
00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:21.610
He's very sweet and otherwise for him.

1328
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:23.530
Yeah

1329
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.770
I think

1330
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:28.290
he came yesterday.

1331
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:29.570
And uh

1332
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:31.169
I said,

1333
00:52:31.179 --> 00:52:31.649
what happened,

1334
00:52:31.659 --> 00:52:31.850
David?

1335
00:52:31.939 --> 00:52:33.780
What were you doing like this and why did

1336
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.179
you do all these things after coming to surgery?

1337
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.790
He said there must be some devil on me.

1338
00:52:40.919 --> 00:52:41.479
But he said,

1339
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:41.669
Mother,

1340
00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:42.709
he was so subtle,

1341
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.219
one of the subtlest ones you should understand

1342
00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.050
that he told me that you are

1343
00:52:48.909 --> 00:52:49.699
this and this

1344
00:52:53.889 --> 00:52:54.000
and that you will give me realisation that I should.

1345
00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:54.889
It came in my ears.

1346
00:52:56.649 --> 00:52:59.050
Can you imagine to that extent.

1347
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.830
And so he believed in that kind of a spirit,

1348
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:04.879
and he was carrying on with it.

1349
00:53:09.169 --> 00:53:10.020
But I said,

1350
00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:11.290
for telling you this,

1351
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.139
why should you use any spirit?

1352
00:53:14.699 --> 00:53:16.340
You can eat it in time out.

1353
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.620
Use your brains.

1354
00:53:23.209 --> 00:53:25.050
Then we have another one

1355
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.120
where we think we can

1356
00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:29.510
uh purchase in the market,

1357
00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.949
you see there are courses of loan 3 weeks course,

1358
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.000
33 years course

1359
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:38.479
for shaving off all your

1360
00:53:38.969 --> 00:53:39.530
property.

1361
00:53:45.919 --> 00:53:45.929
So

1362
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:48.929
We go in,

1363
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:50.020
you see for that.

1364
00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:52.070
Then

1365
00:53:53.209 --> 00:53:54.379
all such things

1366
00:53:54.729 --> 00:53:56.000
one must understand

1367
00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.050
cannot be anywhere reality.

1368
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.669
So what should we expect?

1369
00:54:06.419 --> 00:54:08.320
What should we react?

1370
00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:10.379
What we call

1371
00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:11.889
of knowledge of self.

1372
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:16.280
First,

1373
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:19.199
science has given us certain thing

1374
00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.010
which we should try to understand.

1375
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.879
And

1376
00:54:22.899 --> 00:54:25.060
if you understand food science,

1377
00:54:25.139 --> 00:54:26.139
you can understand.

1378
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540
That

1379
00:54:31.090 --> 00:54:32.760
Science has given us.

1380
00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:35.330
And understanding

1381
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:37.050
That

1382
00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.120
That is a farmer.

1383
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.929
Which we cannot comprehend through our rationality.

1384
00:54:45.629 --> 00:54:47.330
Even a person like Einstein

1385
00:54:47.929 --> 00:54:48.439
says

1386
00:54:48.929 --> 00:54:52.409
that I could not find the theory of relativity in the laboratory.

1387
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:53.300
I was tired.

1388
00:54:53.449 --> 00:54:54.370
I was lying down

1389
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:56.120
and I was playing with,

1390
00:54:56.729 --> 00:54:57.239
uh,

1391
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:57.889
soap bubbles.

1392
00:54:58.169 --> 00:55:00.050
I me playing with soaps,

1393
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.500
and suddenly the whole theory

1394
00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:03.560
of

1395
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:05.449
relativity dawned upon me.

1396
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.260
Because he was realised so.

1397
00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:13.060
So it has not come from laboratories,

1398
00:55:13.229 --> 00:55:14.709
these people themselves are saying.

1399
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.590
So whatever knowledge has come to us has not

1400
00:55:18.719 --> 00:55:19.260
come

1401
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:20.169
to

1402
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.139
so-called scientific research,

1403
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:25.260
but through the grace of some power.

1404
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.489
Science cannot explain many.

1405
00:55:31.939 --> 00:55:32.810
For example,

1406
00:55:34.399 --> 00:55:35.040
The science.

1407
00:55:36.899 --> 00:55:36.949
That I know but the

1408
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:39.050
the.

1409
00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:39.679
yeah,

1410
00:55:39.689 --> 00:55:39.770
for a day that guy is very bad.

1411
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:39.840
He's not well and

1412
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.729
that's why he's upset all the other children are all right.

1413
00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:00.489
But she was in a bar.

1414
00:56:07.989 --> 00:56:08.000
So.

1415
00:56:10.179 --> 00:56:10.310
yeah

1416
00:56:12.419 --> 00:56:13.310
For example,

1417
00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:18.510
So very sweet.

1418
00:56:21.239 --> 00:56:21.250
They.

1419
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:22.439
Uh,

1420
00:56:22.659 --> 00:56:23.560
cannot say.

1421
00:56:25.689 --> 00:56:26.310
Why?

1422
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.620
So many things happen in the human body.

1423
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:32.050
For example,

1424
00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:35.169
It is said that

1425
00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:38.760
Any foreign body that enters

1426
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:40.199
in the

1427
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:41.239
system

1428
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.760
creates a situation by which

1429
00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:45.929
the body tries to throw it up.

1430
00:56:47.399 --> 00:56:48.939
But it's only the foetus.

1431
00:56:51.429 --> 00:56:52.270
Which is

1432
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.939
Retained in the womb,

1433
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:58.989
nurtured and looked after and thrown away at

1434
00:56:58.989 --> 00:57:01.590
a time when the thing is absolutely magic.

1435
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:04.879
So there is somebody who thinks about it.

1436
00:57:06.459 --> 00:57:07.449
Then there are 2

1437
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.399
Chemicals,

1438
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.620
chemicals there,

1439
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.229
adrenaline and acetically

1440
00:57:14.639 --> 00:57:18.399
which are secreted in our being at different points.

1441
00:57:19.649 --> 00:57:21.199
And they cannot explain

1442
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:22.310
how

1443
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.080
these ordinary chemicals

1444
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.350
sometimes augment it constraint and sometimes

1445
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.229
at different ones.

1446
00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.340
They cannot explain it,

1447
00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:36.280
so they will say they are honest,

1448
00:57:36.449 --> 00:57:38.649
so they say the mode of action of these

1449
00:57:38.649 --> 00:57:41.649
chemicals in the human body cannot be explained.

1450
00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.689
They behave differently

1451
00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:46.419
from their own nature.

1452
00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:49.020
Sobala from their old age.

1453
00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:55.500
There are many such things which I can quote to you and show you

1454
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.790
that man reaches a point where he thinks that

1455
00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:01.110
there is something else that takes the decision.

1456
00:58:06.689 --> 00:58:07.580
Now when

1457
00:58:07.889 --> 00:58:09.129
you reach that stage.

1458
00:58:10.969 --> 00:58:12.360
Then you start thinking.

1459
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.879
That through science,

1460
00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.219
we

1461
00:58:16.909 --> 00:58:17.500
feel

1462
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:20.500
that there is something that we cannot explain

1463
00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:24.620
and that rationality could cannot take it out there.

1464
00:58:25.229 --> 00:58:26.419
So there must be

1465
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:27.899
some

1466
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:28.949
answer to it.

1467
00:58:30.179 --> 00:58:32.080
The answer comes from psychology.

1468
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.580
I would say you was one of the greatest psychologists ever.

1469
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:40.000
Yeah,

1470
00:58:40.159 --> 00:58:40.899
was Freud,

1471
00:58:41.479 --> 00:58:41.979
because Freud,

1472
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:42.360
you know,

1473
00:58:42.439 --> 00:58:44.159
was a horrible psychologist.

1474
00:58:45.649 --> 00:58:46.790
He was a fellow

1475
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:49.800
who was treating all kinds of abnormality.

1476
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:50.969
He never treated normally.

1477
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.290
So he got possessed by that,

1478
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:54.320
you see,

1479
00:58:55.399 --> 00:58:57.449
and he started behaving abnormally.

1480
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.050
He Himself was a very abnormal person.

1481
00:59:01.139 --> 00:59:02.969
He had very abnormal relationships,

1482
00:59:02.979 --> 00:59:04.929
and he was really absurd.

1483
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.340
His own lifetime,

1484
00:59:06.699 --> 00:59:07.860
and he had a very bad death.

1485
00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:08.729
He had cancer.

1486
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.260
He died,

1487
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.449
but still all of

1488
00:59:11.699 --> 00:59:13.659
the Western world worships.

1489
00:59:14.649 --> 00:59:17.560
They never see what he achieved in his own lifetime,

1490
00:59:17.899 --> 00:59:19.570
what sort of a person he was,

1491
00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.340
what was his relationship with other people,

1492
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.000
and

1493
00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:24.090
how he did.

1494
00:59:24.159 --> 00:59:25.629
He was very anxious,

1495
00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.080
always taking pills,

1496
00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.879
and he died of a terrible cancer and in a very wretched condition,

1497
00:59:31.919 --> 00:59:32.320
he died.

1498
00:59:33.659 --> 00:59:34.449
While you

1499
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.030
In his old age,

1500
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.489
he got his realisation,

1501
00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.649
and he was of a very different nature and when he died,

1502
00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:42.899
he used to look,

1503
00:59:43.139 --> 00:59:44.689
he was looking like a flower.

1504
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.419
But people do not see all that.

1505
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.350
They just see what he writes,

1506
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.300
and because

1507
00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:53.909
it suits them

1508
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:55.189
to listen to Freud,

1509
00:59:55.229 --> 00:59:58.060
I don't know why it suits them actually it should not normally.

1510
00:59:58.350 --> 00:59:59.060
So Mr.

1511
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:00.340
Freud has come,

1512
01:00:00.739 --> 01:00:01.550
and I would say you,

1513
01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.080
if you want,

1514
01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:03.939
you'll find out

1515
01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:05.870
that this great man.

1516
01:00:06.929 --> 01:00:08.110
Has done

1517
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:11.239
so many experiments with thousands of people.

1518
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.919
And has established.

1519
01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:17.929
And has established

1520
01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:19.649
that there are.

1521
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:24.350
Forces

1522
01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:26.870
beyond that.

1523
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:31.629
Forces beyond us which control.

1524
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.199
And the forces beyond us to control us.

1525
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.540
He called them

1526
01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:37.469
as

1527
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.520
universal unconscious.

1528
01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.629
Unconscious because they are not in the unconscious.

1529
01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.939
And he called them

1530
01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:47.149
as also.

1531
01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:48.939
As

1532
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.139
uh.

1533
01:00:53.409 --> 01:00:53.530
See,

1534
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:53.620
he,

1535
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.199
he actually,

1536
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:55.800
uh,

1537
01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:58.270
did not know how to name it,

1538
01:00:59.290 --> 01:00:59.800
so

1539
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.909
he said that he has said.

1540
01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:04.399
It is the mother's course.

1541
01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.570
It's a motherly very clearly I said,

1542
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.340
and he studied Indian also Indian

1543
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:12.919
literature and all that,

1544
01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:14.000
and he has.

1545
01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:15.219
Uh,

1546
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:18.479
developed some thought on hati also,

1547
01:01:18.689 --> 01:01:20.149
so he has used the word ha

1548
01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.489
for the universal unconscious,

1549
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:27.429
but still he was just to realise so there was

1550
01:01:27.429 --> 01:01:29.080
no mother to tell him all about what it was,

1551
01:01:30.310 --> 01:01:30.739
so

1552
01:01:30.989 --> 01:01:33.260
he could only indicate and tell you

1553
01:01:33.469 --> 01:01:36.110
that there is a universal unconscious.

1554
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:39.020
Which is guiding them.

1555
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.659
He experimented with people with their dreams.

1556
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:46.500
There's a very famous dream which he interpreted

1557
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:47.659
about a man

1558
01:01:48.149 --> 01:01:51.489
who would always dream that he has to bow to his own son.

1559
01:01:51.669 --> 01:01:53.860
His son is sitting on a pedestal

1560
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.189
and he has to bow.

1561
01:01:56.389 --> 01:01:57.620
The sun might be a real realise.

1562
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.620
So he came to him

1563
01:02:00.969 --> 01:02:01.290
and he said,

1564
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:02.909
I don't know why I get such a dream.

1565
01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:04.409
So you asked,

1566
01:02:04.449 --> 01:02:07.159
what is your relationship with your son?

1567
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:08.040
He's very,

1568
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:08.770
very bad.

1569
01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.500
I said why?

1570
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.780
He said,

1571
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:11.169
I'm,

1572
01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:11.510
see,

1573
01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:12.389
his mother is dead.

1574
01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:13.219
I'm married again,

1575
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.449
and my wife is very happy with it,

1576
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.020
and I really don't know what to how to manage it.

1577
01:02:18.189 --> 01:02:20.290
The relationship has gone very bad.

1578
01:02:20.909 --> 01:02:24.360
So he said the unconscious is telling you that you must bo.

1579
01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:27.419
Pleases of higher awareness,

1580
01:02:27.629 --> 01:02:28.229
so you must.

1581
01:02:29.199 --> 01:02:30.250
It is giving you a bag.

1582
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.469
There was another girl who came to him with a drink,

1583
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.709
I mean,

1584
01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:36.770
to just to put two drinks together after him.

1585
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:38.820
He said that

1586
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:40.739
I see my mother as a witch.

1587
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.770
So he asked,

1588
01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.840
what is your relationship with your mother?

1589
01:02:45.479 --> 01:02:46.750
She said it's very fast,

1590
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.790
very good.

1591
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.159
She actually pampers me.

1592
01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:51.620
She has pampered me so much that I'm just

1593
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.100
good for nothing.

1594
01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:56.320
He said that is the thing that is coming to you from your

1595
01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.439
unconscious to suggest that your mother is a witch who is spoiling you.

1596
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.550
And there are 100 1 like that,

1597
01:03:03.629 --> 01:03:03.850
you see,

1598
01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:05.270
there are so many volumes of.

1599
01:03:06.169 --> 01:03:07.610
Which you can read for yourself.

1600
01:03:08.699 --> 01:03:10.870
So the psychologists have told us

1601
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.620
that the state

1602
01:03:12.909 --> 01:03:14.469
of human awareness

1603
01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:19.040
would reach at a point when he will be thoughtlessly aware.

1604
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.070
He will be aware,

1605
01:03:21.239 --> 01:03:22.399
but there won't be any thought.

1606
01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:25.510
This is said by you who was a psychologist,

1607
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.239
so we should know what we have to expect.

1608
01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.080
Now there's another source

1609
01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:33.489
which is very clear,

1610
01:03:33.929 --> 01:03:34.159
and really,

1611
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:35.290
really good.

1612
01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.449
Which we can understand

1613
01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.719
are the scriptures.

1614
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.199
If you read John's revelation,

1615
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.489
you can read about all this.

1616
01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.239
We know that the.

1617
01:03:49.219 --> 01:03:50.879
Who wins this to go.

1618
01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:52.929
If you read Shankaracharya,

1619
01:03:52.969 --> 01:03:55.810
of course I will not say much more because he's the one

1620
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:59.879
who has completely exposed the whole thing in the 6th century.

1621
01:04:00.129 --> 01:04:03.320
This knowledge was a secret knowledge before that

1622
01:04:03.899 --> 01:04:07.639
because the evolutionary forces had not taken its proper course.

1623
01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:09.489
It was kept a secret knowledge,

1624
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:11.479
a guarded knowledge for very few.

1625
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:16.360
Only in the 6th century he started exposing it in Kavida in Nanaka.

1626
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:20.600
All these people came out with full exposition of.

1627
01:04:21.229 --> 01:04:23.500
The greatest work done on Kundalini

1628
01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:24.159
was

1629
01:04:24.449 --> 01:04:25.429
in Maharashtra.

1630
01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:29.689
Where the nine natas,

1631
01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:33.100
the primordial masters they call themselves,

1632
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.100
worked on it.

1633
01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:35.500
And

1634
01:04:35.669 --> 01:04:38.270
also in other places they also came from Punjab.

1635
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.250
There was a big rapport between Punjab and Maharashtra

1636
01:04:41.669 --> 01:04:42.290
and

1637
01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:43.179
they

1638
01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:45.820
went into the forest,

1639
01:04:46.219 --> 01:04:47.179
meditated,

1640
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.550
and religiously

1641
01:04:48.909 --> 01:04:50.830
tried to find out what was,

1642
01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.870
what was the force?

1643
01:04:53.179 --> 01:04:55.350
What was the seed with us?

1644
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:59.590
What was the germinating force that is going to give us this?

1645
01:05:00.919 --> 01:05:04.800
Because one or two were realised whenever they talked about realisation,

1646
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:08.979
nobody could believe them and could understand that there is a force like that,

1647
01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:09.810
and they said,

1648
01:05:09.969 --> 01:05:10.270
Oh,

1649
01:05:10.399 --> 01:05:11.000
peacekeepers,

1650
01:05:11.090 --> 01:05:12.719
we are happy with ourselves.

1651
01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:13.479
Moreover,

1652
01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.159
the people who were realised

1653
01:05:15.330 --> 01:05:19.560
had such bad experiences of all these people

1654
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.280
like

1655
01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.419
they were beaten up.

1656
01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:23.649
You see 5.

1657
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:25.800
The poisoned

1658
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.639
I mean imagine

1659
01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:31.820
What was there to crucify Christ?

1660
01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.550
I still can't understand.

1661
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.209
So the

1662
01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.370
very

1663
01:05:38.899 --> 01:05:40.639
sensible people of this world.

1664
01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:42.229
Looked at

1665
01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:46.370
all the explanations about God and divinity

1666
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.340
with that kind of a hostile.

1667
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.080
Uh,

1668
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:51.830
I.

1669
01:05:53.439 --> 01:05:56.570
And there was no way of changing this attitude of this.

1670
01:05:57.850 --> 01:06:00.070
And this hostility was expressed

1671
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.010
even by religious organisation.

1672
01:06:04.149 --> 01:06:04.810
You see,

1673
01:06:05.219 --> 01:06:07.899
anybody who has a realised so was thrown away from churches,

1674
01:06:07.979 --> 01:06:08.909
from temples.

1675
01:06:09.179 --> 01:06:10.260
These Brahmins killed,

1676
01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:11.510
they tortured them.

1677
01:06:11.659 --> 01:06:14.090
The last one that we had was the shiva,

1678
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.570
and if you see how the Brahmins from,

1679
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:18.250
uh,

1680
01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:18.709
Nagar,

1681
01:06:19.459 --> 01:06:19.689
uh,

1682
01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:20.060
area,

1683
01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:21.260
from Mummed,

1684
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.389
how they tortured him,

1685
01:06:22.459 --> 01:06:23.659
you'll be surprised.

1686
01:06:24.139 --> 01:06:24.729
Not only that,

1687
01:06:24.739 --> 01:06:28.570
but they brought a snake charmer with a snake to kill,

1688
01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.070
but he got hold of the snake and he talked to the snake.

1689
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:32.350
The snake went away and.

1690
01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.080
With the

1691
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:34.010
job.

1692
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:38.500
Then he was the one who got up and saved the child.

1693
01:06:39.199 --> 01:06:39.909
And he told him,

1694
01:06:39.989 --> 01:06:40.669
don't do all this.

1695
01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:41.260
He said,

1696
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:41.899
I would not,

1697
01:06:41.909 --> 01:06:42.600
but people who have.

1698
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.179
So the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion themselves.

1699
01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.659
Crucify those same problem of reality

1700
01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:55.699
and that's how

1701
01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:56.979
reality

1702
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.739
was completely blinded.

1703
01:07:00.030 --> 01:07:02.520
Nobody could see it and people will get.

1704
01:07:06.479 --> 01:07:06.489
This

1705
01:07:06.959 --> 01:07:07.860
was the problem.

1706
01:07:09.669 --> 01:07:10.780
And that's why

1707
01:07:11.379 --> 01:07:13.810
somebody had to come and do this.

1708
01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:15.469
To give

1709
01:07:15.639 --> 01:07:18.060
a mass realisation to

1710
01:07:18.679 --> 01:07:19.310
people

1711
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.270
so that it becomes a common knowledge.

1712
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:22.310
Everything

1713
01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.419
that is discovered by one person

1714
01:07:26.679 --> 01:07:28.469
has to become the common knowledge,

1715
01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:30.340
otherwise it has to mean,

1716
01:07:30.399 --> 01:07:31.239
even in the science,

1717
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:31.790
you see,

1718
01:07:31.919 --> 01:07:33.360
you find out about electricity.

1719
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.790
It has a big history behind it,

1720
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.709
whatever it is,

1721
01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.929
but at a point it has to become a common knowledge.

1722
01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.629
If it is not a common knowledge,

1723
01:07:40.639 --> 01:07:42.120
it will never be accepted,

1724
01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.439
and it has no value at all.

1725
01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:45.370
It has to become

1726
01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:47.080
a knowledge of

1727
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:48.959
every human being,

1728
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:50.969
otherwise it has no meaning,

1729
01:07:51.810 --> 01:07:55.330
and the time has come for you to have the actualization.

1730
01:07:56.449 --> 01:07:58.899
And to have the complete knowledge

1731
01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:00.399
of your being,

1732
01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:02.219
what you are,

1733
01:08:02.459 --> 01:08:03.929
what you are going to be,

1734
01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:04.780
what

1735
01:08:04.949 --> 01:08:06.179
you could have been,

1736
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:07.969
what are the problems around.

1737
01:08:09.739 --> 01:08:13.169
So in us is placed the germinating force.

1738
01:08:13.379 --> 01:08:14.590
We are all built it.

1739
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.569
It's like a competent,

1740
01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:20.830
absolutely living competence within us is placed through our evolution

1741
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:21.910
one by one,

1742
01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:23.140
step by step

1743
01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.240
all these points have been

1744
01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:27.419
properly put down in our backbone,

1745
01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:28.270
in our brain,

1746
01:08:28.419 --> 01:08:29.970
and in the limbic area here,

1747
01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.549
absolutely in a perfect man.

1748
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:34.599
And the only thing that one has to do

1749
01:08:34.738 --> 01:08:35.479
is to

1750
01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:39.140
Surrender

1751
01:08:40.959 --> 01:08:41.819
To accept,

1752
01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:45.020
but we surrender to all kinds of nonsensical things,

1753
01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.379
but to the right person,

1754
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:48.140
who will immediately stand up.

1755
01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:50.359
If somebody has two horns,

1756
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.060
it is very easy to say.

1757
01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.100
Or if somebody is very cunning,

1758
01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:55.979
very easy to say.

1759
01:08:57.249 --> 01:08:58.908
But where do you surrender

1760
01:08:59.508 --> 01:09:00.788
is to the divine force,

1761
01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:01.578
to yourself,

1762
01:09:01.667 --> 01:09:02.429
to your wisdom.

1763
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:08.729
What do you surrender is your nonsensical idiotic ego.

1764
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:13.358
What do you have to surrender to God?

1765
01:09:14.648 --> 01:09:15.679
What do you have?

1766
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:17.680
Only

1767
01:09:19.290 --> 01:09:19.810
this

1768
01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:21.629
non-knowledge

1769
01:09:22.089 --> 01:09:23.140
which has come to be

1770
01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.620
ego or sometimes

1771
01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:27.740
through these positions which is.

1772
01:09:31.259 --> 01:09:31.379
No,

1773
01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:32.189
for salary.

1774
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.109
People think,

1775
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:36.390
how can I say?

1776
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.830
No,

1777
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:40.379
you cannot think about it.

1778
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:41.990
How should I surrender?

1779
01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:50.620
Can you work it out on a paper?

1780
01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:53.290
I will do this X + X is equal

1781
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:54.540
so much.

1782
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.600
It's very simple.

1783
01:09:59.129 --> 01:10:00.160
How do you laugh?

1784
01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:03.160
Do you sit down and make a picture now?

1785
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.479
I'm going to love my child,

1786
01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:08.330
so I will make a lap with this much angle and

1787
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.359
this much angle and the baby there at this angle.

1788
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:13.080
Look at her with this angle.

1789
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.169
Then I'll turn left right,

1790
01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:18.160
and then I then I put the child this side.

1791
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:19.169
Do you do like that?

1792
01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.459
You know how to laugh,

1793
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.669
don't you?

1794
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:26.770
This building

1795
01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:30.729
Seedary is nothing but is

1796
01:10:31.609 --> 01:10:32.109
now.

1797
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:34.819
Of God

1798
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:35.830
that is within.

1799
01:10:40.979 --> 01:10:43.129
He is within you in your heart.

1800
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.080
He's there.

1801
01:10:45.939 --> 01:10:47.689
All the scriptures have said that,

1802
01:10:47.819 --> 01:10:50.470
and none of them are wrong or false.

1803
01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.660
They might have misinterpreted somewhere else.

1804
01:10:52.779 --> 01:10:53.859
Everybody has great tricks,

1805
01:10:53.899 --> 01:10:54.370
you see.

1806
01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:55.819
Our Tanrikas in India,

1807
01:10:55.899 --> 01:11:00.649
all these who are nowadays gurus of Tanrikas once upon a time in the 6th century,

1808
01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:03.370
they entered into all kinds of things,

1809
01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:06.240
and the worst thing they entered into are the Vedass themselves,

1810
01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:06.609
you see,

1811
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.049
where

1812
01:11:07.259 --> 01:11:08.060
they declared

1813
01:11:08.299 --> 01:11:10.540
that even a thing like Ahomi there,

1814
01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.180
which is a very pure thing.

1815
01:11:13.799 --> 01:11:15.870
He's also oriented from sex.

1816
01:11:17.459 --> 01:11:17.790
Mhm

1817
01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.109
Even they said that

1818
01:11:20.279 --> 01:11:22.399
the god and the goddess,

1819
01:11:22.629 --> 01:11:23.990
God and His power

1820
01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.919
are sex relationships.

1821
01:11:27.399 --> 01:11:27.660
I

1822
01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:31.310
They think human beings are nothing but sex parts.

1823
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:33.509
They have nothing else in there?

1824
01:11:34.439 --> 01:11:36.839
Even an amoeba has something more than that.

1825
01:11:41.419 --> 01:11:42.770
But we accept them.

1826
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:44.310
Why?

1827
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:47.149
Because we are seekers.

1828
01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:49.830
We are

1829
01:11:51.129 --> 01:11:51.990
And we are sick.

1830
01:11:52.279 --> 01:11:54.560
We are born in this world to see.

1831
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.509
We have taken our blood,

1832
01:11:56.759 --> 01:11:58.470
especially at this time to see.

1833
01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.479
We have been seekers all our lives,

1834
01:12:00.759 --> 01:12:02.520
and today we want to seek it.

1835
01:12:03.879 --> 01:12:05.509
And how are we going to see?

1836
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:07.919
Where will we get a chance to.

1837
01:12:10.279 --> 01:12:10.850
I know.

1838
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.790
It is hard to understand that you don't have to do anything,

1839
01:12:14.819 --> 01:12:15.500
just sit right.

1840
01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:18.310
The boat is moving

1841
01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.160
And it will take you to dollars and

1842
01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.120
don't have to do anything.

1843
01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.529
It was going to work out.

1844
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:30.479
It it has to match.

1845
01:12:31.919 --> 01:12:32.629
Now,

1846
01:12:32.839 --> 01:12:33.990
the flowers are there,

1847
01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.750
they tried the bees.

1848
01:12:35.879 --> 01:12:37.459
The bees come at the right time.

1849
01:12:37.919 --> 01:12:38.680
They blossom.

1850
01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:39.870
Uh,

1851
01:12:39.879 --> 01:12:41.009
at the right time,

1852
01:12:41.529 --> 01:12:42.200
uh.

1853
01:12:43.129 --> 01:12:43.819
And

1854
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:47.310
Also the fruits appear at the plant.

1855
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.870
It has to match.

1856
01:12:49.589 --> 01:12:51.979
It has to take its own course and time.

1857
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.919
The way you are building,

1858
01:12:54.029 --> 01:12:55.240
the way you are made,

1859
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:56.520
it has to complete,

1860
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.209
so that another round starts,

1861
01:12:59.299 --> 01:13:00.180
and that's why

1862
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:02.180
this hurry up has

1863
01:13:03.069 --> 01:13:03.109
That's all.

1864
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:07.100
Nothing we done that.

1865
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:09.970
And it is very easy to correct.

1866
01:13:10.979 --> 01:13:12.299
There's no problem about it.

1867
01:13:13.529 --> 01:13:14.830
It's very easy,

1868
01:13:15.279 --> 01:13:16.399
but once you have light,

1869
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.830
we start seeing everything very,

1870
01:13:18.919 --> 01:13:19.600
very clear.

1871
01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:21.629
Because there is no light,

1872
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:23.529
it becomes so difficult.

1873
01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:28.169
Have you tried climbing up steps without lights in a new house which you never?

1874
01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.189
3 times you fall down before you get over one light.

1875
01:13:34.279 --> 01:13:35.439
But if there is light,

1876
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.799
whatever type of the

1877
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:38.359
house ready whenever you are,

1878
01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.600
you can just go like this.

1879
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.160
In the same way,

1880
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.279
unless and until you are enlightened,

1881
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:47.500
unless and until you are realised,

1882
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:51.100
unless and until you have that power flowing through you,

1883
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.810
you cannot understand and you cannot

1884
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:57.100
see that how.

1885
01:13:59.279 --> 01:14:02.470
And you're so beautifully built in your previous.

1886
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:06.560
That once you get this awakening within you,

1887
01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.729
you start awakening this immediately and you can start it on somebody else,

1888
01:14:11.109 --> 01:14:11.709
but you see,

1889
01:14:11.839 --> 01:14:14.520
just now it's such a powerful thing that most of them have got it,

1890
01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.399
so I don't know where I'm going to try.

1891
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.899
That's the problem.

1892
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.180
Most of them have got,

1893
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:21.879
so sometimes it happens like that.

1894
01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:24.850
So who are we going to raise now everybody's realising.

1895
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.490
You can do something to me.

1896
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:28.560
You can do that to anybody.

1897
01:14:28.569 --> 01:14:28.629
She's got it too,

1898
01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:35.390
you see,

1899
01:14:35.399 --> 01:14:36.310
that's the problem

1900
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:37.640
that it is so powerful,

1901
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.709
but you'll find that she's setting down.

1902
01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:43.720
It has to go back because we have got

1903
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.390
chakras within as the centres which are being exhausted.

1904
01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.580
Like I would say

1905
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.589
now this side is the left side and this is the right side,

1906
01:14:51.799 --> 01:14:54.250
and both sides are the sympathetic nervous system.

1907
01:14:54.479 --> 01:14:57.560
The right side sympathetic nervous system works

1908
01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.649
for your mental being and for emotional

1909
01:14:59.649 --> 01:15:05.000
mental being and for your physical being and the left side for your emotional.

1910
01:15:05.439 --> 01:15:08.589
In between is the central part is the past.

1911
01:15:09.919 --> 01:15:10.350
Now

1912
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.850
the underlying subtle

1913
01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.790
energies that control

1914
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.629
these two left and right.

1915
01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:21.430
The left one is controlled by the power which we call as Mahakalism.

1916
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.370
Which is

1917
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.910
I

1918
01:15:28.089 --> 01:15:30.299
When the rim and the cleans

1919
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:35.069
the ring in the central power ra ra is energy.

1920
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.330
Ram is the one which

1921
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.640
Gives you

1922
01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:42.600
evolutionary powers

1923
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:44.169
and also sustain us

1924
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:48.370
like carbon has its own suspicion sustain us and

1925
01:15:48.529 --> 01:15:52.720
like gold has its own sustainance as you have your own sustainance.

1926
01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.009
Everybody has to sustain us through this central power of green.

1927
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.310
Is the power of.

1928
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.279
And the

1929
01:16:03.979 --> 01:16:07.509
right hand side power is the power of masses.

1930
01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:10.149
Now you shouldn't get upset with the SAS.

1931
01:16:10.859 --> 01:16:15.140
It has nothing to do with any particular community or anything because these were

1932
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:20.330
found out by saints who were meditating in India and in the Sanskrit language.

1933
01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:22.899
That's why there are sa.

1934
01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:23.540
Moreover,

1935
01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:24.819
these names of.

1936
01:16:26.819 --> 01:16:27.540
Science,

1937
01:16:27.819 --> 01:16:28.209
you see,

1938
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.100
has developed here,

1939
01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.799
but also in India a kind of a science

1940
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.930
and the science that was developed

1941
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.609
in India was the science of Unal is the

1942
01:16:39.899 --> 01:16:41.089
force of

1943
01:16:41.419 --> 01:16:41.890
the

1944
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.560
germinating power,

1945
01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:44.799
the residual power within us,

1946
01:16:45.859 --> 01:16:47.410
and this science has

1947
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:48.810
seen

1948
01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:50.189
or has

1949
01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:51.819
actually experimented.

1950
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.720
With the movement of the kundalini where it moves,

1951
01:16:54.729 --> 01:16:55.479
the sound,

1952
01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:00.049
and these sounds are different on different centres within us

1953
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:01.049
which are.

1954
01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:02.959
7

1955
01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:03.720
ACs,

1956
01:17:03.729 --> 01:17:04.129
but

1957
01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:06.120
there are 11 otherwise

1958
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.160
and there are

1959
01:17:07.410 --> 01:17:08.040
3,

1960
01:17:10.379 --> 01:17:10.399
how much.

1961
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.629
3

1962
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.500
350.

1963
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:18.600
All right,

1964
01:17:20.129 --> 01:17:20.879
so this is the,

1965
01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:22.000
this is the thing,

1966
01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:23.799
350 million,

1967
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.770
but we deal only with 7 at the most,

1968
01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:29.720
not more than that because it's too much offending.

1969
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.830
Why should do what?

1970
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:35.560
You need not worry.

1971
01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.919
now you are sitting in this room.

1972
01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:37.430
It's all right,

1973
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:38.120
perfectly well.

1974
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.270
Why should you worry from where this electricity has come?

1975
01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.950
And for how many drops it must have taken to create this much of electricity?

1976
01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:46.430
Is it,

1977
01:17:46.439 --> 01:17:46.910
uh,

1978
01:17:46.919 --> 01:17:48.729
from the water or from the core,

1979
01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:51.680
or what is the history worst who's bothered?

1980
01:17:51.759 --> 01:17:53.240
You just put on the like and enjoy.

1981
01:17:54.549 --> 01:17:54.600
That any

1982
01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.049
It's all done.

1983
01:17:58.419 --> 01:17:59.279
In this also,

1984
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:00.879
you must take it for granted

1985
01:18:01.169 --> 01:18:04.569
that it's all done for you and you have every right to have it.

1986
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.020
So this kundalini,

1987
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:11.009
when it passes through all these various char,

1988
01:18:11.419 --> 01:18:12.649
it makes a sound,

1989
01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.330
and that sound

1990
01:18:14.859 --> 01:18:15.509
has

1991
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:16.729
been taken

1992
01:18:17.419 --> 01:18:17.990
by

1993
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:21.279
Those people in the ancient days

1994
01:18:21.810 --> 01:18:23.339
as the phonetics,

1995
01:18:23.850 --> 01:18:27.049
phonetic sounds for forming the facts of that.

1996
01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:30.439
That's why Sanskrit is used

1997
01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:31.359
for.

1998
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:34.330
Controlling the,

1999
01:18:34.529 --> 01:18:35.500
the movement of the kar

2000
01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:37.439
and the

2001
01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:39.919
centres that are within you

2002
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:41.009
have got.

2003
01:18:44.089 --> 01:18:44.910
A mark,

2004
01:18:45.009 --> 01:18:45.970
a landmark.

2005
01:18:47.029 --> 01:18:48.430
Of your evolution.

2006
01:18:49.359 --> 01:18:50.189
For example,

2007
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:54.770
The leaders who came at different stages of your revolution.

2008
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:59.819
We actually the incarnations of divine power.

2009
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:02.600
And they have left a mark within you,

2010
01:19:02.609 --> 01:19:06.399
and they exist within you at that particular set.

2011
01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.009
So when you say a particular mantra.

2012
01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:13.250
That d opens up.

2013
01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.560
And starts emitting.

2014
01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:17.790
E

2015
01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.160
But still,

2016
01:19:20.529 --> 01:19:23.770
human beings without realisation is a limited.

2017
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.520
His deities have limited in it.

2018
01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.140
But

2019
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:31.830
if he is put

2020
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.819
In connection

2021
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:35.020
with the

2022
01:19:35.569 --> 01:19:38.379
all pervailing power through realisation

2023
01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:40.549
in stating.

2024
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:42.919
Like if you have a car

2025
01:19:43.129 --> 01:19:44.049
and you have a limited.

2026
01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.040
Petrol,

2027
01:19:46.089 --> 01:19:46.830
all right,

2028
01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:49.350
and the petrol shortage is there too,

2029
01:19:50.169 --> 01:19:52.029
then you are put intention

2030
01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:54.089
and you do not know what to do.

2031
01:19:54.819 --> 01:19:56.959
But supposing there is a.

2032
01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.609
Permanent

2033
01:19:58.970 --> 01:19:59.169
fight

2034
01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:00.459
on you.

2035
01:20:01.319 --> 01:20:01.879
Uh,

2036
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:04.169
gap of the petrol tract,

2037
01:20:04.319 --> 01:20:04.629
see,

2038
01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:06.470
which is filling it permanently,

2039
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.160
then you don't have any tension.

2040
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:10.120
You are not bothered.

2041
01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:11.359
What is exhausting?

2042
01:20:11.839 --> 01:20:14.319
Now this exhaustion on all the centres,

2043
01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:15.319
because these are

2044
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.399
the underlying forces of all the flexuses that we have outside.

2045
01:20:20.689 --> 01:20:21.930
When they get exhausted,

2046
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:24.240
the plexuses that are acting our

2047
01:20:24.850 --> 01:20:25.520
body,

2048
01:20:26.009 --> 01:20:26.810
our mind.

2049
01:20:27.569 --> 01:20:28.330
Our

2050
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:29.580
thinking,

2051
01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:30.779
our.

2052
01:20:31.990 --> 01:20:33.569
Emotional activities,

2053
01:20:33.899 --> 01:20:39.560
all of them get exhausted and then we develop diseases of various types

2054
01:20:39.899 --> 01:20:40.410
physical,

2055
01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:41.339
mental.

2056
01:20:45.089 --> 01:20:45.799
So

2057
01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:46.899
to

2058
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:48.459
make these

2059
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:50.000
centres awake.

2060
01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:52.930
It's a very important thing

2061
01:20:53.299 --> 01:20:53.990
even

2062
01:20:54.379 --> 01:20:54.720
from

2063
01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:58.129
a day to day lifestyle like you must fill them up.

2064
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:59.839
You must awaken them so that

2065
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.569
at least your health is all right,

2066
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:03.379
your wealth is all right.

2067
01:21:04.450 --> 01:21:05.270
Your

2068
01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:07.600
mind is all right

2069
01:21:08.009 --> 01:21:09.330
and also

2070
01:21:09.589 --> 01:21:10.120
your.

2071
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:12.020
Emotions

2072
01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:13.620
This is the beast.

2073
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.669
But ultimately what do you get?

2074
01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.020
Ultimately you get that connection

2075
01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.439
which is all the time.

2076
01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.189
Not only that much.

2077
01:21:26.979 --> 01:21:27.410
Like

2078
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.979
unless and until you get disconnected to the means,

2079
01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:30.910
you cannot work it up.

2080
01:21:31.129 --> 01:21:33.060
It may be very nicely late what to do.

2081
01:21:33.979 --> 01:21:36.390
So the first thing is put it to the mix.

2082
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:39.970
When you put into the maze,

2083
01:21:40.049 --> 01:21:42.290
then only you will realise also where is the problem.

2084
01:21:44.009 --> 01:21:44.459
Otherwise,

2085
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:45.250
you will not know.

2086
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:50.410
But when you get self realisation.

2087
01:21:51.529 --> 01:21:54.049
You know your problems.

2088
01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.080
This is possible.

2089
01:21:56.589 --> 01:21:59.330
That is selfish and you know your senses,

2090
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:00.640
how they are affected,

2091
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:02.160
where they are affected,

2092
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:03.750
what is the problem there,

2093
01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:05.890
and you get the power to cure.

2094
01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.200
Of course thoughtless awareness is there,

2095
01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:11.649
no doubt,

2096
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.189
but plus that

2097
01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:14.220
immediately.

2098
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:21.680
A person who's has crossedagia only may not even get ridization can cure us.

2099
01:22:22.529 --> 01:22:24.720
That's how we have half half-baked

2100
01:22:25.089 --> 01:22:25.819
curing people.

2101
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.410
So mostly then they get possessed and they get spirits.

2102
01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.879
The kundalini only rises up to

2103
01:22:32.049 --> 01:22:32.609
a gap

2104
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.830
and some

2105
01:22:34.089 --> 01:22:36.540
spirit comes into that they becomes spiritual.

2106
01:22:39.029 --> 01:22:39.950
But you people,

2107
01:22:40.049 --> 01:22:42.569
even if it crosses immediately you can start you.

2108
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.890
When it processes so.

2109
01:22:47.359 --> 01:22:48.240
This point,

2110
01:22:48.479 --> 01:22:49.359
the last point.

2111
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:50.839
Then

2112
01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:52.700
you enter into that

2113
01:22:53.129 --> 01:22:53.720
area.

2114
01:22:54.819 --> 01:22:57.240
Or into that subtle awareness.

2115
01:22:59.109 --> 01:23:00.640
Which is all for me.

2116
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.339
Just now

2117
01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:04.410
we think

2118
01:23:04.819 --> 01:23:05.939
that you are different,

2119
01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:06.859
she's different,

2120
01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:07.580
she's different.

2121
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:10.000
There's a thread passing through.

2122
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:13.450
If your attention becomes that thread,

2123
01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.000
then you can pass into anyone.

2124
01:23:15.379 --> 01:23:17.129
That's how though you know yourself,

2125
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:18.649
you know your problems,

2126
01:23:18.779 --> 01:23:18.899
everything,

2127
01:23:19.049 --> 01:23:21.180
you also know others immediately.

2128
01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:28.240
That is what is the collective consciousness about which you also have indicated.

2129
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:33.459
So you have to expect collective consciousness that is is an actualization

2130
01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.700
that is that your consciousness,

2131
01:23:35.839 --> 01:23:37.549
your awareness gets

2132
01:23:37.799 --> 01:23:39.109
that dimension

2133
01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:40.950
in actual form

2134
01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:42.430
that you become

2135
01:23:42.919 --> 01:23:43.549
to explain it.

2136
01:23:45.799 --> 01:23:46.910
Like animals

2137
01:23:47.279 --> 01:23:50.640
walking through dirt and they never feel any dirt or faith.

2138
01:23:50.799 --> 01:23:52.109
They cannot see beauty,

2139
01:23:52.439 --> 01:23:53.080
but who's that?

2140
01:23:55.569 --> 01:23:57.220
We cannot walk through dirt.

2141
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:59.890
Our awareness is very different from that

2142
01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:01.799
in the same way,

2143
01:24:02.089 --> 01:24:03.479
when you become this,

2144
01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:05.600
then your awareness becomes.

2145
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:06.500
So

2146
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.680
beautiful that you start.

2147
01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:11.209
Feeling of the sick.

2148
01:24:14.779 --> 01:24:16.810
You start feeling the wrong.

2149
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:19.279
I don't have to tell you.

2150
01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:20.200
We will not just do it.

2151
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:22.939
I don't have to take automatically.

2152
01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.509
You started feeling what is good for you and what is bad.

2153
01:24:32.129 --> 01:24:33.709
Say our son has not come.

2154
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:34.660
Uh,

2155
01:24:34.779 --> 01:24:34.910
I,

2156
01:24:34.979 --> 01:24:35.569
I never tell,

2157
01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:36.939
don't drink like I'm.

2158
01:24:37.319 --> 01:24:37.500
No,

2159
01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.209
I don't.

2160
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:38.790
OK,

2161
01:24:38.819 --> 01:24:39.640
you want it,

2162
01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:40.540
have cancer.

2163
01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.560
Have everything nicely then come to me.

2164
01:24:43.169 --> 01:24:44.919
Have your liver absolutely shattered.

2165
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:46.100
Be a drunken fellow,

2166
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.060
then you come to me.

2167
01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:48.700
All right,

2168
01:24:48.819 --> 01:24:49.339
doesn't matter.

2169
01:24:50.359 --> 01:24:50.410
Then

2170
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:51.189
I

2171
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:52.770
realise it takes place.

2172
01:24:52.919 --> 01:24:54.779
Immediately the priorities change.

2173
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:55.589
Absolutely.

2174
01:24:56.970 --> 01:24:57.759
You'll be amazed.

2175
01:24:57.799 --> 01:25:00.200
I've seen people who have been terrible drunkard,

2176
01:25:00.319 --> 01:25:00.819
you see.

2177
01:25:01.399 --> 01:25:01.600
They said,

2178
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:01.839
Mother,

2179
01:25:01.879 --> 01:25:02.649
we can't clean.

2180
01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:02.919
I said,

2181
01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:03.660
what happens?

2182
01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:04.359
We want it.

2183
01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.459
Same thing happened with Trista,

2184
01:25:08.850 --> 01:25:09.810
he started vomiting.

2185
01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:13.930
And he couldn't take,

2186
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:14.479
you see,

2187
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.450
I never told him.

2188
01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:17.129
Then

2189
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:18.799
You just

2190
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:22.879
enjoy something else because if you get the nectar of life,

2191
01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:25.200
then you don't run out of fruity.

2192
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:30.660
Useless things,

2193
01:25:30.779 --> 01:25:32.229
your dignity becomes different.

2194
01:25:32.279 --> 01:25:33.310
You become different.

2195
01:25:33.439 --> 01:25:34.720
It's entirely different.

2196
01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.970
Your sense of enjoyment is so different.

2197
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:44.020
become really beautiful flowers and the fragrance people can see

2198
01:25:44.330 --> 01:25:44.970
from a distance,

2199
01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.259
even from a telephone.

2200
01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:51.979
It's so dynamic.

2201
01:25:53.939 --> 01:25:56.009
And that is what it should happen.

2202
01:25:56.959 --> 01:25:57.359
For that,

2203
01:25:57.399 --> 01:25:58.200
what should you do?

2204
01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:00.859
Because say mother what should we do nothing,

2205
01:26:01.049 --> 01:26:01.540
just ask.

2206
01:26:02.839 --> 01:26:03.459
to ask,

2207
01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.600
you have to know.

2208
01:26:05.729 --> 01:26:06.160
That's all.

2209
01:26:07.009 --> 01:26:08.459
Even if you do not knock,

2210
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:10.410
your mother is going to knock at your door.

2211
01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.509
She's very persuasive.

2212
01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:16.609
See

2213
01:26:18.419 --> 01:26:19.810
Come to your house.

2214
01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.569
Make you comfortable,

2215
01:26:23.089 --> 01:26:24.209
massage your body,

2216
01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.779
massage your head,

2217
01:26:26.069 --> 01:26:28.479
massage your back and work on you.

2218
01:26:29.009 --> 01:26:30.430
I see to it

2219
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:32.439
that she takes you out.

2220
01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.020
She's too much patience.

2221
01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.839
And you'll be amazed

2222
01:26:40.399 --> 01:26:40.669
that

2223
01:26:40.879 --> 01:26:41.720
if I'm tired,

2224
01:26:41.799 --> 01:26:42.680
I feel better.

2225
01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:49.740
Like because

2226
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:52.220
she came and she said,

2227
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.470
Mother,

2228
01:26:52.509 --> 01:26:53.540
you do so much for us.

2229
01:26:53.609 --> 01:26:54.379
We've done so well,

2230
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:55.839
and that we,

2231
01:26:56.029 --> 01:26:56.970
I must do something for her.

2232
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.229
She said,

2233
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.950
What can you do?

2234
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.310
She said,

2235
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:59.299
I'm very good at,

2236
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.819
uh,

2237
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.459
uh,

2238
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:01.359
massaging the feet.

2239
01:27:01.399 --> 01:27:02.310
I said I I do it.

2240
01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:05.479
So I was massaging my feet and her feet were massaged.

2241
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:09.620
And she couldn't understand this,

2242
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:11.229
and she was feeling relaxed,

2243
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:12.350
she was massaging my face.

2244
01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:13.529
I said,

2245
01:27:13.569 --> 01:27:14.169
what's happening?

2246
01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:14.450
She said,

2247
01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.680
it's not surprising.

2248
01:27:16.049 --> 01:27:18.479
I'm getting relaxed while I'm massaging your.

2249
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:21.839
So that's what

2250
01:27:22.439 --> 01:27:23.200
that you must know

2251
01:27:23.649 --> 01:27:25.479
that it cannot be.

2252
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:30.049
I'm here to take you are there to take.

2253
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.169
That's your right.

2254
01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:35.089
It's your own.

2255
01:27:36.509 --> 01:27:37.729
It's like a mother

2256
01:27:38.379 --> 01:27:41.850
who loves such a lot and she has such a lot of properties.

2257
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:43.649
Everything is

2258
01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:45.859
Just take

2259
01:27:46.649 --> 01:27:47.240
Just

2260
01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:49.200
See,

2261
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.200
the greatest

2262
01:27:50.759 --> 01:27:52.560
pride for any mother should be.

2263
01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:55.700
But she sees her children cry on her phone.

2264
01:27:57.370 --> 01:27:59.160
Then they achieve their own power.

2265
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.580
Render water source.

2266
01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:06.319
And there we come,

2267
01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.459
the joyous,

2268
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.700
happy,

2269
01:28:08.779 --> 01:28:09.419
blissful.

2270
01:28:11.479 --> 01:28:11.720
She

2271
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:16.990
That's the way I see my dreams.

2272
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:20.959
And I'm sure

2273
01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:22.330
the time has come.

2274
01:28:23.939 --> 01:28:24.609
I'm sure.

2275
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:27.089
I had to come to London.

2276
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:28.959
And uh

2277
01:28:29.759 --> 01:28:31.600
They'll have lots of surgeries in there.

2278
01:28:32.589 --> 01:28:36.049
And then India is a place it's full of good vibrations,

2279
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:39.890
no doubt because we have had great things and Chris was there.

2280
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:42.509
But

2281
01:28:42.979 --> 01:28:43.879
it's like

2282
01:28:44.169 --> 01:28:45.750
where you have the teeth.

2283
01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:47.089
Uh,

2284
01:28:47.169 --> 01:28:48.560
you don't have food to eat.

2285
01:28:48.850 --> 01:28:49.770
When you have food to eat,

2286
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:50.919
you don't have teeth.

2287
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.910
Like that is the

2288
01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:55.080
situation.

2289
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.319
While here you are the saints

2290
01:28:58.770 --> 01:28:59.930
are born in this country.

2291
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:02.870
And you are misguided.

2292
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:05.770
And there we have people.

2293
01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.299
Who are

2294
01:29:08.439 --> 01:29:09.120
not see.

2295
01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:11.879
And they have the vibrations.

2296
01:29:13.939 --> 01:29:15.859
This is the dilemma of such.

2297
01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:19.529
They think,

2298
01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.069
you know,

2299
01:29:20.279 --> 01:29:21.359
so many of them think

2300
01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.319
you people are seeking.

2301
01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:25.240
Because

2302
01:29:25.810 --> 01:29:26.689
uh.

2303
01:29:28.359 --> 01:29:30.160
You are upset with that.

2304
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:32.160
Too much of uh

2305
01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:34.029
uh machine oriented that's all

2306
01:29:35.689 --> 01:29:38.479
the thing it's uh more you're seeking is more like a

2307
01:29:38.729 --> 01:29:39.450
remedy

2308
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:41.259
for ills that you have got.

2309
01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:45.950
They do not think that you are seeking something so deep.

2310
01:29:49.399 --> 01:29:51.040
And that there is

2311
01:29:52.279 --> 01:29:53.020
The seeking

2312
01:29:53.450 --> 01:29:54.220
of love.

2313
01:29:55.419 --> 01:29:55.839
They do want.

2314
01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.149
But I must say but as quick.

2315
01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:05.310
And once the fire has started.

2316
01:30:07.899 --> 01:30:07.910
We.

2317
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.359
And how

2318
01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:11.560
sometimes.

2319
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.919
It was,

2320
01:30:12.939 --> 01:30:14.350
it's so interesting.

2321
01:30:14.459 --> 01:30:16.229
It's so interesting that you think has to you know,

2322
01:30:18.419 --> 01:30:18.759
like,

2323
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:19.290
uh,

2324
01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:19.959
in Delhi,

2325
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:23.660
we had a programme of opening this book.

2326
01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:24.490
Uh,

2327
01:30:24.509 --> 01:30:26.390
releasing this book for the first time,

2328
01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:26.979
and they said,

2329
01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:27.450
you know,

2330
01:30:27.529 --> 01:30:28.609
this is too much for me.

2331
01:30:28.649 --> 01:30:29.669
How will I manage?

2332
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:29.689
See,

2333
01:30:30.089 --> 01:30:31.569
I've never done that sort of thing.

2334
01:30:31.649 --> 01:30:31.850
They said,

2335
01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:32.009
no,

2336
01:30:32.049 --> 01:30:32.279
no,

2337
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.689
for me,

2338
01:30:32.770 --> 01:30:34.009
you have to just give a lecture.

2339
01:30:34.049 --> 01:30:34.560
That's all.

2340
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.549
You think it's a yoga programme that we look after the rest of it.

2341
01:30:38.359 --> 01:30:38.959
So the,

2342
01:30:39.209 --> 01:30:39.640
uh,

2343
01:30:39.689 --> 01:30:40.709
president of India,

2344
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:42.959
he was among your by me.

2345
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:46.229
And all that and so they wrote to this gave us.

2346
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:49.870
Luckily he never turned up.

2347
01:30:51.419 --> 01:30:52.200
So they said,

2348
01:30:52.209 --> 01:30:52.359
Mother,

2349
01:30:52.439 --> 01:30:53.160
we can't get him,

2350
01:30:53.399 --> 01:30:55.689
so why not you become the president then?

2351
01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:55.959
I said,

2352
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.549
if you think I'm all right,

2353
01:30:57.879 --> 01:30:58.549
I don't mind.

2354
01:31:01.339 --> 01:31:01.350
And

2355
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:05.339
The whole

2356
01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.549
press was there,

2357
01:31:06.839 --> 01:31:08.220
all the members of parliament,

2358
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:08.609
very

2359
01:31:08.959 --> 01:31:10.339
very critical and all very much.

2360
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:13.270
We had taken them.

2361
01:31:13.459 --> 01:31:14.500
They were taking uh

2362
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:15.779
all for 200 people.

2363
01:31:15.859 --> 01:31:16.109
I said,

2364
01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:18.189
you have to stay for 800.

2365
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.040
So will it fill up?

2366
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:19.410
I said,

2367
01:31:19.419 --> 01:31:20.779
you just stay for 800.

2368
01:31:21.979 --> 01:31:23.740
And they all these people came.

2369
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:25.770
I don't know with what ideas they gave them,

2370
01:31:26.359 --> 01:31:29.629
but there was no place even on the in the

2371
01:31:29.629 --> 01:31:32.069
passages to move people are sitting in the passages.

2372
01:31:33.419 --> 01:31:34.620
I said look at this

2373
01:31:35.410 --> 01:31:36.919
new face coming up.

2374
01:31:39.779 --> 01:31:42.660
And I said something to never said.

2375
01:31:45.069 --> 01:31:45.890
I

2376
01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:48.649
have used a lot of depth in this life.

2377
01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:51.870
Because people don't want to hear anything.

2378
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.910
Like Christ,

2379
01:31:54.029 --> 01:31:55.819
what did he say that I'm the light,

2380
01:31:56.029 --> 01:31:57.629
I'm I'm the chiefs.

2381
01:31:59.379 --> 01:32:00.069
This is not a waste,

2382
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.640
is it?

2383
01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:02.689
You think so?

2384
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:02.930
I mean,

2385
01:32:02.970 --> 01:32:04.120
if you are something now,

2386
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:05.120
if I am

2387
01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:06.410
a Nirmana,

2388
01:32:06.609 --> 01:32:07.240
I should say I'm.

2389
01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:08.609
Is it?

2390
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:11.520
Like Krishna,

2391
01:32:11.529 --> 01:32:11.919
I said,

2392
01:32:12.029 --> 01:32:14.350
some of them are but did your mommy comes out.

2393
01:32:15.589 --> 01:32:16.419
You are all

2394
01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.939
Dharmas is all these

2395
01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.870
like uh religions.

2396
01:32:20.919 --> 01:32:22.830
It doesn't mean the religion event,

2397
01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.029
but what he's saying that all sorts of

2398
01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:30.950
uh sustainers that you are observing just come to the ser so that you go beyond.

2399
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:33.709
Was he was

2400
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:37.209
But he was very tactful.

2401
01:32:37.259 --> 01:32:38.930
He didn't have the masks.

2402
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.479
He told only to

2403
01:32:41.799 --> 01:32:42.779
nobody else.

2404
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:48.569
But somebody who had an eye and ear to hear that heard it and wrote it down,

2405
01:32:48.779 --> 01:32:51.529
but I wish I never told it to the masks,

2406
01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:52.049
no.

2407
01:32:54.209 --> 01:32:57.259
Christ did that and what did you do to him?

2408
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:59.450
He didn't do any harm,

2409
01:32:59.609 --> 01:32:59.930
did he?

2410
01:33:02.419 --> 01:33:03.899
Just what this sentence.

2411
01:33:05.859 --> 01:33:05.899
So I'm

2412
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.569
extremely tired.

2413
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:12.990
are very elusive by nature.

2414
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:17.970
So don't be taken up by my words,

2415
01:33:18.089 --> 01:33:18.569
asked one.

2416
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:21.229
I mean you see,

2417
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:23.279
that's the only way I can approach.

2418
01:33:23.810 --> 01:33:26.509
People have tried all sorts of things like

2419
01:33:26.919 --> 01:33:27.529
Krishnas,

2420
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:28.810
you can say diplomacy.

2421
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:31.089
Then Christ

2422
01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:32.779
sacrifices

2423
01:33:33.439 --> 01:33:36.379
our mind is the style of you yes.

2424
01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:39.189
Because I,

2425
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:40.259
if I were not,

2426
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:41.049
would not come.

2427
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.819
Past 4,

2428
01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:45.770
I must appear just like.

2429
01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.490
I do not

2430
01:33:48.839 --> 01:33:50.330
so much sometimes,

2431
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:52.379
but most of the time I do.

2432
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:54.299
And I should

2433
01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:55.049
be

2434
01:33:55.419 --> 01:33:56.589
thinking just like you.

2435
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:59.299
Absolutely,

2436
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:01.500
and you will never

2437
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.109
know.

2438
01:34:03.799 --> 01:34:04.790
Your hearts of hearts,

2439
01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:05.279
you know.

2440
01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:06.100
But

2441
01:34:06.959 --> 01:34:11.049
the illusion will be all the time maintaining so that you receive it

2442
01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:12.000
fully,

2443
01:34:12.459 --> 01:34:15.470
completely and you master it without feeling any abound.

2444
01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.709
You have to be absolutely free,

2445
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.399
absolutely free.

2446
01:34:21.939 --> 01:34:24.379
And I assure you all the protection.

2447
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:27.569
Yeah

2448
01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.589
I'm quite surprised

2449
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:35.879
the way you can manifest your power.

2450
01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:39.830
I know

2451
01:34:41.649 --> 01:34:41.890
Great.

2452
01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:43.660
And then

2453
01:34:45.799 --> 01:34:47.589
Which I have said again and again

2454
01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:49.799
is the heart of the.

2455
01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.660
must understand hot.

2456
01:34:56.169 --> 01:34:56.870
Has to

2457
01:34:58.930 --> 01:34:59.000
stand up for the.

2458
01:35:00.419 --> 01:35:01.729
And has to fight

2459
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:03.149
The stand

2460
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:05.069
so that you prepare.

2461
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.629
For the advent

2462
01:35:07.779 --> 01:35:08.620
of the last.

2463
01:35:10.029 --> 01:35:10.689
Do what you want?

2464
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:14.899
Who's going to come with his 11 hours.

2465
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:16.299
I'm just going to sort it out.

2466
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:17.390
There is no.

2467
01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:19.899
Persuasion,

2468
01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.399
no realisation,

2469
01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.200
no knowledge,

2470
01:35:22.319 --> 01:35:23.439
nothing to sort it out.

2471
01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:25.509
Before that?

2472
01:35:26.299 --> 01:35:28.129
You have to save all your friends,

2473
01:35:28.419 --> 01:35:29.609
save all the people.

2474
01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:34.830
And salvage them and you are the workers,

2475
01:35:35.479 --> 01:35:37.160
you are the people who are going to do it.

2476
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.589
I'm just in the background.

2477
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.560
I don't know.

2478
01:35:40.379 --> 01:35:41.089
I don't.

2479
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:41.459
That's all

2480
01:35:42.439 --> 01:35:44.009
regarding the different deities,

2481
01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:47.209
have you got one of these things?

2482
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:55.680
And the centres and all those things I've got some literature this one

2483
01:35:56.529 --> 01:35:56.740
the little

2484
01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:57.720
ones.

2485
01:35:58.930 --> 01:35:58.939
So

2486
01:35:59.759 --> 01:36:00.830
just show them what you have

2487
01:36:02.439 --> 01:36:05.080
now you can uh get those cycles ty and all

2488
01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.750
that and you can see for yourself what are the centres

2489
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.540
and uh how they are represented on your feet.

2490
01:36:10.839 --> 01:36:11.600
When you are realised,

2491
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.569
you can start feeling.

2492
01:36:13.359 --> 01:36:13.830
For example,

2493
01:36:13.919 --> 01:36:15.000
these children had cold,

2494
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.299
you see,

2495
01:36:15.399 --> 01:36:17.839
so I started feeling burden on the right hand feet,

2496
01:36:17.919 --> 01:36:19.089
not that I feel,

2497
01:36:19.279 --> 01:36:20.049
but you would start.

2498
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:20.120
You've been feeling all

2499
01:36:22.279 --> 01:36:24.029
with the cold the children had,

2500
01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.479
and it's working now.

2501
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:26.620
This is the centre

2502
01:36:27.509 --> 01:36:27.520
of.

2503
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:32.000
And when there is school you feel on the right hand is the physical address.

2504
01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:33.850
On the left hand,

2505
01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:35.740
it is then the person feels guilty,

2506
01:36:36.209 --> 01:36:37.649
mostly he may be a cat.

2507
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.439
Yeah.

2508
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:44.899
It's very interesting,

2509
01:36:44.939 --> 01:36:45.370
you know,

2510
01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:47.250
to find out about people,

2511
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:50.229
and you're amazed when you discover it like going,

2512
01:36:50.339 --> 01:36:50.500
you know,

2513
01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.180
one day

2514
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:51.669
he,

2515
01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.290
he was,

2516
01:36:52.299 --> 01:36:52.490
uh,

2517
01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.790
worried about his father that he's not.

2518
01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.700
Why do you want to just see the vibration?

2519
01:36:58.419 --> 01:36:59.569
This is telecommunication,

2520
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.410
absolutely.

2521
01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:01.149
So I said,

2522
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:01.359
Mother,

2523
01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.109
I'm getting.

2524
01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.370
He's here.

2525
01:37:03.660 --> 01:37:03.930
I said,

2526
01:37:03.939 --> 01:37:04.859
that's your father's.

2527
01:37:04.899 --> 01:37:05.180
He said,

2528
01:37:05.259 --> 01:37:06.100
This is our father.

2529
01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:07.129
This is your mother.

2530
01:37:07.299 --> 01:37:07.580
I said,

2531
01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:08.169
all right,

2532
01:37:08.339 --> 01:37:08.810
so

2533
01:37:09.259 --> 01:37:09.740
he's got

2534
01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:10.899
something wrong with.

2535
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:14.370
He's bronchus must be bronchitis or something,

2536
01:37:14.859 --> 01:37:17.310
so he rings up home and the mother says that

2537
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:20.270
you see your father has had very bad bronchitis.

2538
01:37:22.549 --> 01:37:24.259
You saw even Nixon going into.

2539
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:26.240
Problems,

2540
01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:26.600
see,

2541
01:37:27.089 --> 01:37:29.290
we could see him long time back before it happens.

2542
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:32.359
A person may appear to be very great,

2543
01:37:32.609 --> 01:37:33.580
a very big sick.

2544
01:37:33.810 --> 01:37:35.009
Just put your hands last.

2545
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:36.439
You don't know

2546
01:37:37.939 --> 01:37:37.979
sort of a feeling.

2547
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:40.620
Your vibrations will immediately stop or you get tingling,

2548
01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:41.500
sometimes burning,

2549
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:42.810
sometimes you have blisters.

2550
01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.180
It's that bad.

2551
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:51.330
Yourself,

2552
01:37:51.509 --> 01:37:52.700
you are the instrument.

2553
01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:54.339
You are the one who diagnosed it.

2554
01:37:54.549 --> 01:37:55.870
You are the one who cures it.

2555
01:37:58.330 --> 01:38:00.399
This is the set for that.

2556
01:38:02.939 --> 01:38:04.189
Is there any question?

2557
01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:05.770
Um,

2558
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:06.209
yes,

2559
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:06.850
what.

2560
01:38:07.529 --> 01:38:10.250
I got thousands of customers so I,

2561
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:11.330
I got thousands,

2562
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.589
but.

2563
01:38:12.839 --> 01:38:14.620
What you're talking about now,

2564
01:38:14.899 --> 01:38:15.439
um,

2565
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:16.560
Peter and,

2566
01:38:16.649 --> 01:38:17.129
and,

2567
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.859
and,

2568
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:19.520
and tell me this is about you.

2569
01:38:21.129 --> 01:38:24.680
What is the relationship between the self-realization that you are

2570
01:38:25.339 --> 01:38:26.959
able to give almost immediately

2571
01:38:27.609 --> 01:38:31.600
and enlightenment in the sense of being free from the wheel of car?

2572
01:38:31.689 --> 01:38:32.479
Do you see what I mean?

2573
01:38:32.529 --> 01:38:32.560
That,

2574
01:38:32.569 --> 01:38:33.089
that.

2575
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:34.830
Enlightenment.

2576
01:38:35.339 --> 01:38:35.729
Well,

2577
01:38:35.859 --> 01:38:38.490
in the sense of being free from the wheel of karma,

2578
01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:38.790
do,

2579
01:38:38.939 --> 01:38:39.810
do you see what I mean?

2580
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.020
Oh,

2581
01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:40.720
immediate,

2582
01:38:41.379 --> 01:38:41.979
immediate release.

2583
01:38:42.089 --> 01:38:43.209
What is karma?

2584
01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.200
See theory you must understand what is the karma karma,

2585
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:50.100
who does the karma is your ego.

2586
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:54.160
What commas do you?

2587
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:59.359
Is your ego that gives you the sense that you are.

2588
01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:01.140
You don't do anything whatsoever,

2589
01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:01.979
I think you know.

2590
01:39:03.359 --> 01:39:06.290
It's the ego within you which doesn't not the ego.

2591
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.200
Is here like this you see rises from the right goes like

2592
01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.419
that and super he goes like this when the kundalini rises,

2593
01:39:13.439 --> 01:39:13.890
both are sat down

2594
01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:19.040
and your attention is above the when you laugh at it Oh,

2595
01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:19.589
Mr.

2596
01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:20.330
Napoleon,

2597
01:39:20.359 --> 01:39:21.450
how do you do sir?

2598
01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:24.299
The karmas

2599
01:39:24.459 --> 01:39:26.779
are dissolved because you have no keto.

2600
01:39:26.819 --> 01:39:28.330
It's like this very simple

2601
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.799
is say

2602
01:39:30.259 --> 01:39:31.930
when the sun is on the side,

2603
01:39:32.089 --> 01:39:33.569
you can see your

2604
01:39:33.899 --> 01:39:34.709
uh shadow,

2605
01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:35.459
all right,

2606
01:39:35.819 --> 01:39:37.250
but when it comes on your head,

2607
01:39:37.459 --> 01:39:38.669
the shadow disappears in.

2608
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:44.359
But one is sort of when you read.

2609
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:47.270
Um,

2610
01:39:47.359 --> 01:39:47.680
well,

2611
01:39:47.959 --> 01:39:49.359
in Eastern scriptures,

2612
01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:49.879
um,

2613
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:50.189
because,

2614
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:50.350
you know,

2615
01:39:50.399 --> 01:39:53.080
the Western scriptures going to have any reincarnation too much anymore.

2616
01:39:53.839 --> 01:39:54.390
Um,

2617
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:58.490
one is sort of led to believe that this is something that's how they must do it,

2618
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.209
you see,

2619
01:39:59.310 --> 01:40:01.060
all of them are like that thugs.

2620
01:40:01.399 --> 01:40:04.299
So what they have to they have to make you believe into something,

2621
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:05.379
you see,

2622
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:06.200
otherwise,

2623
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:08.600
how are they going to say why you don't get it?

2624
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.080
Is that your?

2625
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:11.370
Then why are you there?

2626
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:15.419
You see what I would say that what are you doing there collecting our money?

2627
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:16.959
Simple question.

2628
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:18.069
You see,

2629
01:40:18.109 --> 01:40:20.549
if it is our kar mass by which we are suffering,

2630
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:21.689
you are the one

2631
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:22.589
who are cleansing.

2632
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:24.379
There's one very wonderful one in,

2633
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.979
yeah,

2634
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:27.479
he said I take only 1

2635
01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:30.209
upon 100 and something

2636
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:31.750
of your karma.

2637
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.459
I said,

2638
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:33.589
why this mathematics.

2639
01:40:34.879 --> 01:40:35.740
Why not the whole of it?

2640
01:40:38.319 --> 01:40:39.209
And then he says,

2641
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.549
you see,

2642
01:40:39.609 --> 01:40:41.359
for the rest of it you have to work hard,

2643
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:43.779
and what is working hard is service.

2644
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:44.870
What is service,

2645
01:40:45.149 --> 01:40:45.370
big,

2646
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:46.339
big trucks,

2647
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.700
see,

2648
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:48.339
and there's a big,

2649
01:40:48.459 --> 01:40:48.700
uh,

2650
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:49.299
what do you call,

2651
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.859
uh,

2652
01:40:50.029 --> 01:40:51.109
piggy banks,

2653
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:53.080
things like that

2654
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:55.109
and the piggy banks is the size.

2655
01:40:56.529 --> 01:41:00.720
And people from all over the world come there for that service and that cleansing.

2656
01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:03.209
You see they'll be fooling up.

2657
01:41:04.339 --> 01:41:04.479
I,

2658
01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:08.379
I wanna also put it another way around that you said earlier something about.

2659
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.419
We come to you,

2660
01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:10.939
as it were for,

2661
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:11.720
for some reason.

2662
01:41:11.759 --> 01:41:13.950
Is it that in the past we have

2663
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.520
done something to show a merit coming to you?

2664
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:16.830
Is it,

2665
01:41:16.839 --> 01:41:18.500
is it like that because it seems

2666
01:41:18.959 --> 01:41:19.910
it's almost too easy,

2667
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:20.439
you know.

2668
01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:22.240
Do you see what I mean?

2669
01:41:22.279 --> 01:41:22.700
I mean it must be difficult.

2670
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.720
Well,

2671
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.790
now you want to very simply.

2672
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:27.080
See,

2673
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.359
your breathing is so easy,

2674
01:41:28.479 --> 01:41:29.200
isn't it?

2675
01:41:29.399 --> 01:41:32.259
Did you consult any book or did you find out about karma?

2676
01:41:33.029 --> 01:41:33.040
Well,

2677
01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:35.089
because it is so important for you

2678
01:41:35.919 --> 01:41:38.549
in the same way your evolution is very important.

2679
01:41:39.439 --> 01:41:40.720
If you are not evolved,

2680
01:41:40.959 --> 01:41:42.569
the patient will have no meaning.

2681
01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.220
It has to be the simplest of

2682
01:41:46.279 --> 01:41:47.270
spontaneous.

2683
01:41:48.399 --> 01:41:50.279
How can it be difficult just think of it.

2684
01:41:50.919 --> 01:41:52.799
It has to be the easiest.

2685
01:41:55.069 --> 01:41:55.549
But,

2686
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:56.049
um,

2687
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.470
I'm,

2688
01:41:56.549 --> 01:41:57.020
I'm not,

2689
01:41:57.549 --> 01:41:58.629
don't let people off lightly.

2690
01:41:58.649 --> 01:41:59.140
I'm sorry.

2691
01:41:59.490 --> 01:42:00.350
The thing is,

2692
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.669
I've always felt that if my life is difficult,

2693
01:42:02.759 --> 01:42:06.470
it's because I've done things wrong in the past which have made it like that.

2694
01:42:07.319 --> 01:42:09.600
Now it seems unlikely that my life is suddenly going to change.

2695
01:42:09.799 --> 01:42:09.930
This is like your priest telling you,

2696
01:42:09.939 --> 01:42:15.549
come and confess something.

2697
01:42:15.850 --> 01:42:17.080
Now those who have not done

2698
01:42:17.879 --> 01:42:18.000
anything,

2699
01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.709
what are they going to confess?

2700
01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.700
So they find out something.

2701
01:42:20.720 --> 01:42:24.359
I must have done something I have to face the priest

2702
01:42:24.359 --> 01:42:27.270
then ultimately the priest lands up in the lunatic asylum.

2703
01:42:28.649 --> 01:42:29.930
I'm gonna tell him I confess,

2704
01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:32.020
I can't face all non nonsense.

2705
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:33.459
It's like in India,

2706
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:33.750
you see,

2707
01:42:33.779 --> 01:42:34.290
we had.

2708
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:36.500
The priest coming into a village,

2709
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.180
you see,

2710
01:42:37.379 --> 01:42:41.290
and he started teaching them about Christianity when he was going,

2711
01:42:41.500 --> 01:42:42.410
the head of the village,

2712
01:42:42.549 --> 01:42:43.479
he didn't know how to.

2713
01:42:43.959 --> 01:42:44.609
I said,

2714
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:45.430
Sir,

2715
01:42:45.819 --> 01:42:48.689
we are thankful to you for visiting our village.

2716
01:42:48.799 --> 01:42:50.290
You have really enlightened us

2717
01:42:50.569 --> 01:42:52.200
because we did not know what was saying.

2718
01:42:52.339 --> 01:42:53.759
Now we know what to say.

2719
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:59.250
It's like that,

2720
01:42:59.339 --> 01:42:59.930
you see,

2721
01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.259
but this enlightenment,

2722
01:43:01.419 --> 01:43:03.439
only in modern times you have to pay.

2723
01:43:05.859 --> 01:43:07.100
It's so simple.

2724
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:09.120
Thank

2725
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.439
Mhm

2726
01:43:12.740 --> 01:43:14.310
They have done the difficult work.

2727
01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.640
Christ has done it for you.

2728
01:43:17.209 --> 01:43:17.229
All right.

2729
01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:19.700
What can you commitment?

2730
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:23.040
It is greater than the love of God.

2731
01:43:23.169 --> 01:43:23.850
Tell me why.

2732
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:30.069
Um,

2733
01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:30.979
the thing is that

2734
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.640
if,

2735
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:32.589
if things

2736
01:43:33.069 --> 01:43:34.589
do go a bit wrong for one,

2737
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:37.020
if things do tend to go a bit wrong,

2738
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:38.669
if one can somehow.

2739
01:43:39.399 --> 01:43:39.729
Say,

2740
01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:39.950
well,

2741
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:41.689
it must be my fault in the past,

2742
01:43:41.979 --> 01:43:44.250
then you don't feel bad towards anyone else,

2743
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:45.439
whereas

2744
01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.160
if you feel that you're blameless

2745
01:43:47.379 --> 01:43:48.379
and things still go wrong,

2746
01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.740
you tend to blame other people,

2747
01:43:49.779 --> 01:43:51.450
at least you see what I mean?

2748
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:51.819
You see,

2749
01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:54.500
it's better to get yourself into a situation where you're in the wrong,

2750
01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:55.779
where you're blaming other people,

2751
01:43:55.859 --> 01:43:56.129
you see,

2752
01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:56.379
we,

2753
01:43:56.459 --> 01:43:57.439
we are like this.

2754
01:43:57.450 --> 01:43:58.959
Either we destroy others or destroy ourselves.

2755
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:00.540
Must we do that?

2756
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:04.919
We need not destroy others and destroy ourselves also.

2757
01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:06.529
We are neither guilty

2758
01:44:06.819 --> 01:44:08.609
nor we are putting guilt on others.

2759
01:44:09.100 --> 01:44:10.250
Can't we be in between?

2760
01:44:10.419 --> 01:44:10.620
I mean,

2761
01:44:10.779 --> 01:44:11.819
can't we be sensitive.

2762
01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:14.419
just an agent.

2763
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.470
It's just we are destroying ourselves by feeling guilty.

2764
01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:20.589
We're destroying ourselves by that,

2765
01:44:20.839 --> 01:44:21.310
you see.

2766
01:44:23.799 --> 01:44:24.990
It's a self destruction,

2767
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:25.310
you see,

2768
01:44:25.319 --> 01:44:26.259
actually,

2769
01:44:26.979 --> 01:44:28.459
you see-oriented society.

2770
01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:31.470
Came up to a point

2771
01:44:31.839 --> 01:44:33.990
that when ego became too much,

2772
01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.520
so just to counteract it,

2773
01:44:35.919 --> 01:44:39.120
we started with a super ego and super ego is that as,

2774
01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:39.430
oh,

2775
01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:43.250
you are ego and you are no good and you are

2776
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.049
so horrid you will be responsible for Vietnam for EDME,

2777
01:44:47.759 --> 01:44:49.509
for all the that Bokasa,

2778
01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:52.410
everybody will identify with and you will feel it

2779
01:44:54.879 --> 01:44:54.939
while you are a beautiful because.

2780
01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.990
Either you will feel proud of it

2781
01:44:58.479 --> 01:45:00.640
and you go or you'll feel guilty about it.

2782
01:45:00.759 --> 01:45:01.520
Now what am I?

2783
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:02.729
You just think of me.

2784
01:45:04.009 --> 01:45:05.540
It's a funny situation,

2785
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.959
but it is not.

2786
01:45:08.490 --> 01:45:09.270
It's not

2787
01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.990
You are neither guilty of anything,

2788
01:45:14.549 --> 01:45:16.620
nor you are to wrong because whatever is.

2789
01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:18.680
It's not

2790
01:45:21.149 --> 01:45:24.709
And there is no guilt which God cannot take one.

2791
01:45:27.209 --> 01:45:28.509
Because they're really sweet people.

2792
01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:30.220
That's why.

2793
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:36.540
But then one comes back to the old question of um.

2794
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.759
You know,

2795
01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:38.359
why,

2796
01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.629
why did God create a world which

2797
01:45:40.959 --> 01:45:41.680
has suffering?

2798
01:45:43.209 --> 01:45:45.279
I mean this is a sort of classic question,

2799
01:45:45.759 --> 01:45:45.890
all right,

2800
01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:47.140
I'm gonna answer this one,

2801
01:45:47.209 --> 01:45:48.009
the classical one.

2802
01:45:51.379 --> 01:45:51.580
Uh,

2803
01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:52.859
why did you have a child?

2804
01:45:55.029 --> 01:45:56.979
In the same way what happens in the child.

2805
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:59.250
It's green,

2806
01:45:59.379 --> 01:45:59.700
yeah.

2807
01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:03.879
This feeling to have a child has come to us from God.

2808
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:06.669
As we want to have a child,

2809
01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:08.149
he wanted to have a child.

2810
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:10.649
He wanted to grow much more

2811
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.810
fully,

2812
01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:14.959
and then he wanted to grow with all his powers

2813
01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.009
to that child to enjoy

2814
01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:18.490
and see for himself.

2815
01:46:18.779 --> 01:46:19.770
This was just a

2816
01:46:20.049 --> 01:46:21.069
play of God,

2817
01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:22.060
his will,

2818
01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:22.729
his,

2819
01:46:23.020 --> 01:46:23.109
uh,

2820
01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:24.140
we can say

2821
01:46:24.379 --> 01:46:29.729
his paternal feeling that he wanted to express that he created you so beautifully

2822
01:46:29.939 --> 01:46:31.669
and then he created the whole universe.

2823
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:37.339
Everything is so beautiful for you to know the beauty of him.

2824
01:46:40.129 --> 01:46:42.839
So now has come the moment of maturity is

2825
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.500
is that why it is so easy.

2826
01:46:49.509 --> 01:46:49.520
Yes,

2827
01:46:49.529 --> 01:46:49.709
yes,

2828
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.799
this is the time of,

2829
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:49.859
yes,

2830
01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:50.459
of course,

2831
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:51.189
like you see,

2832
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.430
you,

2833
01:46:51.509 --> 01:46:54.020
you can have only one or two slots,

2834
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:55.149
all right.

2835
01:46:56.020 --> 01:46:57.410
The beginning of the tree,

2836
01:46:58.169 --> 01:47:01.410
it's very difficult to protect the tree and all that was done.

2837
01:47:02.509 --> 01:47:02.750
No,

2838
01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:04.020
it's all come up.

2839
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:05.589
The blossom time has come,

2840
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:07.419
and at the blossom time

2841
01:47:07.629 --> 01:47:08.229
you do not

2842
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:09.660
have to bother.

2843
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:10.950
You have to be awful.

2844
01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:11.669
So

2845
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:15.089
You have to become that.

2846
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:20.379
How do you know that this is the time because it's happening.

2847
01:47:21.609 --> 01:47:24.370
How do you know it's the full time because there are fruits,

2848
01:47:24.410 --> 01:47:25.560
you can see the fruits.

2849
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:27.589
You should also see

2850
01:47:27.799 --> 01:47:29.270
those who have become fruits,

2851
01:47:29.479 --> 01:47:30.620
how they are fruits,

2852
01:47:30.919 --> 01:47:34.359
and you become the fruit and see for yourself how you become the fruit or not.

2853
01:47:43.279 --> 01:47:44.939
You can see thousands of them.

2854
01:47:45.479 --> 01:47:45.740
Uh,

2855
01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:47.660
you can come between sometimes to them

2856
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.720
see in the villages,

2857
01:47:49.759 --> 01:47:53.200
thousands of them doing the movies.

2858
01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:55.580
But feeling the cool breeze

2859
01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:00.259
gradually has to be understood and practised and see for yourself

2860
01:48:00.609 --> 01:48:03.500
and mentally to be accepted for Western mind,

2861
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:07.689
not for an eastern mind because we know cool breeze means that.

2862
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:10.589
They are not to be told,

2863
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:11.709
but for a Western Maya,

2864
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:14.109
you have to see for yourself what it does,

2865
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.790
how it works,

2866
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:15.549
how it is,

2867
01:48:15.629 --> 01:48:16.020
how,

2868
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.790
how it,

2869
01:48:16.799 --> 01:48:17.259
uh,

2870
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:18.229
what it is,

2871
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:19.259
how it is.

2872
01:48:20.509 --> 01:48:20.520
So,

2873
01:48:22.359 --> 01:48:23.459
I would say

2874
01:48:23.959 --> 01:48:27.229
that you get your realisation very fast because of your past.

2875
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.160
But you settle back again

2876
01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.759
and start it

2877
01:48:32.479 --> 01:48:33.439
because of your breath.

2878
01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:40.049
In India we cannot get to realisation very fast

2879
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:43.209
because I think they must have been the ones who must have

2880
01:48:43.209 --> 01:48:45.689
been in England not and back the ones who came to us,

2881
01:48:47.649 --> 01:48:49.009
those who are born in India

2882
01:48:50.339 --> 01:48:54.299
who are trying to rule and develop our country to a new.

2883
01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.029
Western one,

2884
01:48:56.259 --> 01:48:56.580
see.

2885
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:58.040
So

2886
01:48:58.870 --> 01:49:00.839
And you have the real idea about it,

2887
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:02.950
but the present has been right.

2888
01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:04.500
Uh,

2889
01:49:04.569 --> 01:49:05.430
dangerous,

2890
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.959
that's why probably there.

2891
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:10.200
So it settles back,

2892
01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:11.839
but doesn't matter.

2893
01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:15.000
It really does not also.

2894
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:16.959
I'm just telling you for precaution

2895
01:49:17.419 --> 01:49:19.399
because what happens among 10 people.

2896
01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.729
The one who is supposed to be the most

2897
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:24.680
dominant,

2898
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:26.680
he settles down first.

2899
01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:30.060
Being dominant dominates others,

2900
01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.040
and they also say.

2901
01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:33.740
See,

2902
01:49:33.899 --> 01:49:36.770
because the people who are very dominant by natures

2903
01:49:37.379 --> 01:49:39.600
always have certain views on others.

2904
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:43.810
So the one whose ality goes down is the one who's really dominating.

2905
01:49:43.979 --> 01:49:44.950
It might be possessed or

2906
01:49:45.859 --> 01:49:47.410
might be something down there,

2907
01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.799
maybe any sort of person,

2908
01:49:48.939 --> 01:49:50.779
but that person will dominate others.

2909
01:49:52.089 --> 01:49:53.470
And the others will take

2910
01:49:53.759 --> 01:49:54.750
lessons from that.

2911
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:55.799
It's human nature,

2912
01:49:55.879 --> 01:49:56.080
you know,

2913
01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.750
it's very funny how they go to lunatics for training,

2914
01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.830
same people going to lunatics.

2915
01:50:01.839 --> 01:50:02.950
What do you say to that?

2916
01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.149
I would like to ask certain questions.

2917
01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:05.200
Do you want me?

2918
01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:10.040
How do you do certain things?

2919
01:50:10.209 --> 01:50:11.200
I can't understand,

2920
01:50:11.319 --> 01:50:11.669
no,

2921
01:50:11.799 --> 01:50:13.250
I just can't understand

2922
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.390
to see a man going to the park,

2923
01:50:15.439 --> 01:50:15.990
coming out,

2924
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:16.879
falling down,

2925
01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:17.830
getting hurt.

2926
01:50:17.959 --> 01:50:19.399
You go into the same ditch.

2927
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.990
How do you do it?

2928
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:29.779
So many things,

2929
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:30.029
you know,

2930
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:31.700
I would like to ask some time

2931
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:33.109
to human beings,

2932
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:35.979
but by the time I ask you become realised,

2933
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:37.950
so I cannot ask you because you're.

2934
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:44.040
It works so fast because it works fast.

2935
01:50:44.169 --> 01:50:45.410
Are you going to deny it?

2936
01:50:46.549 --> 01:50:47.609
It's all promised.

2937
01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.939
All promised in all the scriptures promised.

2938
01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.000
If I say now,

2939
01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.669
I have a diamond with me here.

2940
01:50:57.479 --> 01:50:58.600
Especially doing this.

2941
01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:00.259
Will you,

2942
01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:02.609
will you say that how can it be that simple?

2943
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.089
that it

2944
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.180
isn't it?

2945
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.220
India.

2946
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.250
You know,

2947
01:51:10.299 --> 01:51:11.709
the techniques that we've been doing,

2948
01:51:11.859 --> 01:51:15.169
we've been told that it's so difficult to get there that there's so many ways,

2949
01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:15.209
the trouble is

2950
01:51:19.919 --> 01:51:22.169
I will tell you the techniques they will tell you

2951
01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:25.339
are otherwise that's the way they exist.

2952
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.890
But in fact we were told the techniques were easy,

2953
01:51:28.979 --> 01:51:30.649
but in fact all we found was problems.

2954
01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:42.270
That's even more contorted.

2955
01:51:42.279 --> 01:51:42.430
This is what led us to fool you.

2956
01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:43.450
It is.

2957
01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.649
Thank God you have come to this point to listen to me at least,

2958
01:51:47.899 --> 01:51:50.299
otherwise you would have beat me for saying this.

2959
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:53.470
It seems the techniques that are telling you

2960
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:55.149
has no meaning to nothing.

2961
01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:58.250
You read ordinary anywhere it is said.

2962
01:51:58.470 --> 01:52:03.080
Now Shankara himself said no yoga or something by any method you cannot

2963
01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.470
get it only through the mother's grace you are going to get it.

2964
01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.419
And in his last book

2965
01:52:10.029 --> 01:52:14.500
he wrote all these vibekuram and this that and all these duties he gave and then in

2966
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.680
the end he just praised that's somebody gonna learn

2967
01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:19.229
is nothing but the praise of the mother,

2968
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:20.660
of course he was very clever.

2969
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:22.160
Every stanza has a month.

2970
01:52:23.339 --> 01:52:24.600
But he just praised the mother,

2971
01:52:24.609 --> 01:52:25.279
and people asked him,

2972
01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:26.009
what's this?

2973
01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:27.970
Such an intelligent man like this,

2974
01:52:28.089 --> 01:52:29.009
he's just praising the mother,

2975
01:52:29.049 --> 01:52:30.040
is that sufficient?

2976
01:52:30.209 --> 01:52:30.879
That's the thing.

2977
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:37.109
But anyone who would think that if you're saying that TM,

2978
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.770
for instance,

2979
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:39.140
is the wrong road,

2980
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.740
then

2981
01:52:40.029 --> 01:52:42.750
somebody in TM would be fairly justified or feel

2982
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:44.990
fairly justified and say you're also the wrong road.

2983
01:52:45.029 --> 01:52:46.089
So how does one know?

2984
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.589
Yes,

2985
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:47.069
that's it.

2986
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.330
You see,

2987
01:52:47.399 --> 01:52:49.180
now you should judge it by certain things,

2988
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:51.790
you see what is the wrong road and what is the right road.

2989
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:53.589
I told you the whole lecture was about.

2990
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:56.270
Isn't it?

2991
01:52:56.589 --> 01:52:57.790
I told you how to find it.

2992
01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.580
Did he give you your own first question?

2993
01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:05.310
Did you get your own power?

2994
01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.379
means did you have you any powers going through?

2995
01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.910
No idea at all.

2996
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:13.500
Then,

2997
01:53:14.029 --> 01:53:16.259
can you make out what's wrong with him

2998
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:18.140
in collective consciousness?

2999
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:21.020
I know that I had more power before I did to him as a child.

3000
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.580
I had I have now.

3001
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:23.299
That's it.

3002
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.979
That's it.

3003
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:25.459
But apart from that,

3004
01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:27.500
today when you get your realisation,

3005
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:29.229
you will know what's wrong with him,

3006
01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:30.120
what's wrong with him,

3007
01:53:30.209 --> 01:53:30.990
what's wrong with her.

3008
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:33.240
You can cure it,

3009
01:53:33.250 --> 01:53:34.000
improve it.

3010
01:53:34.689 --> 01:53:37.200
You can see with your naked eyes the bundalini

3011
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:40.129
about which people have dropped pulsating in your presence,

3012
01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:40.680
yes so

3013
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.680
you can see it.

3014
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:42.359
I can show you now

3015
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.919
now.

3016
01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:44.839
With your own eyes.

3017
01:53:45.379 --> 01:53:46.100
Did you do that?

3018
01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:47.029
Uh,

3019
01:53:49.169 --> 01:53:51.439
only thing he did was counting your money.

3020
01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:55.689
Yeah.

3021
01:53:56.939 --> 01:53:58.700
But his uh nephew was married polish off more.

3022
01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:01.069
OK

3023
01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:05.589
One has to understand.

3024
01:54:06.490 --> 01:54:07.040
That

3025
01:54:07.879 --> 01:54:08.770
this bar.

3026
01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:11.640
Has to manifest through you.

3027
01:54:11.770 --> 01:54:13.089
You must have your own powers.

3028
01:54:13.209 --> 01:54:14.020
Why do you worry?

3029
01:54:14.250 --> 01:54:15.759
He might be a very powerful person.

3030
01:54:15.850 --> 01:54:16.209
All right,

3031
01:54:16.410 --> 01:54:17.120
so what?

3032
01:54:17.330 --> 01:54:18.000
Who are you?

3033
01:54:19.009 --> 01:54:20.209
You do not even

3034
01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.529
get the know-how of the whole thing,

3035
01:54:22.740 --> 01:54:23.180
imagine.

3036
01:54:23.799 --> 01:54:25.430
You don't know what he's talking about.

3037
01:54:25.529 --> 01:54:26.750
What are these mantas?

3038
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:29.930
Just go and ask anyone,

3039
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.250
any one of these services to call us if you want,

3040
01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:33.160
I can supply.

3041
01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.720
And these mantras are even sized.

3042
01:54:37.290 --> 01:54:39.109
I'll give you an example of this.

3043
01:54:39.399 --> 01:54:39.560
You know,

3044
01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.750
there's a very tremendous difference between the Indian and Sanskrit.

3045
01:54:44.770 --> 01:54:46.149
And a person is not.

3046
01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:49.100
We have here one scholar who was not so.

3047
01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:53.640
But he,

3048
01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:56.160
he knows about me and he knows that naturally,

3049
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.310
if he knows about

3050
01:54:57.839 --> 01:54:59.060
me and if he starts to colour,

3051
01:54:59.120 --> 01:54:59.879
he knows about.

3052
01:55:00.970 --> 01:55:02.430
What I say is sitting there,

3053
01:55:02.439 --> 01:55:03.549
and that's what I do.

3054
01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.799
And these people wanted to call him for a wedding.

3055
01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:07.720
They want to have.

3056
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:10.169
So

3057
01:55:10.859 --> 01:55:12.430
they told her that uh Matai is going to this age and it's a he said,

3058
01:55:12.439 --> 01:55:12.529
not an occasion

3059
01:55:16.899 --> 01:55:18.660
for me to see her in first.

3060
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:22.660
He did not even tell you the meaning of all histras.

3061
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:24.339
He did not tell you the know-how of it.

3062
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.140
He did not tell you how to move them,

3063
01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.189
nothing of the kind,

3064
01:55:27.379 --> 01:55:29.129
and you think he's better than what?

3065
01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:32.529
You do not know anything about yourself.

3066
01:55:32.569 --> 01:55:34.370
You do not know anything about anybody else.

3067
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:38.319
What have you got out of here

3068
01:55:38.689 --> 01:55:39.609
all these years?

3069
01:55:41.540 --> 01:55:41.560
That

3070
01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:44.370
You are

3071
01:55:49.549 --> 01:55:49.620
what's dirty,

3072
01:55:49.629 --> 01:55:49.649
you see,

3073
01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.830
he says he's got you out of this.

3074
01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:52.490
I feel we have,

3075
01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.040
is it,

3076
01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.410
is it not true that one has to just keep searching and keep searching?

3077
01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:57.500
That's booty shopping.

3078
01:55:57.939 --> 01:55:57.950
So

3079
01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:00.560
just keep keep looking.

3080
01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.109
You didn't just give up.

3081
01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:02.390
You see,

3082
01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:02.740
it is,

3083
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:04.589
this is another problem with the Western.

3084
01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:05.850
It's very much,

3085
01:56:06.049 --> 01:56:11.100
you see the Charlie Chaplin I see able to fix those uh nuts on the modern times.

3086
01:56:11.169 --> 01:56:12.080
Did you see that?

3087
01:56:12.569 --> 01:56:14.720
And he was on and around with nuts like that.

3088
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:16.930
And when he was even released from the work,

3089
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:18.080
he would be going on.

3090
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.930
You know forget that now the release has it's something like that.

3091
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:22.660
The

3092
01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.890
shop is still on

3093
01:56:24.609 --> 01:56:26.240
till they finished the last

3094
01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:27.520
5 of them

3095
01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.930
till they've exhausted them completely

3096
01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:33.189
till they receive all the

3097
01:56:33.859 --> 01:56:34.649
curses of these

3098
01:56:34.770 --> 01:56:35.319
groups

3099
01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:38.419
with multiple sclerosis and all they go on and on.

3100
01:56:39.609 --> 01:56:40.029
Still,

3101
01:56:40.169 --> 01:56:41.560
mother is waiting for me

3102
01:56:42.089 --> 01:56:42.689
whenever you will come

3103
01:56:45.879 --> 01:56:45.910
out and play,

3104
01:56:45.919 --> 01:56:47.049
but why waste your time?

3105
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.759
OK.

3106
01:56:49.049 --> 01:56:50.149
Have you got too much money?

3107
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:57.919
Mentally you cannot understand,

3108
01:56:57.930 --> 01:56:58.049
sir.

3109
01:56:58.439 --> 01:56:58.810
You cannot.

3110
01:56:58.970 --> 01:57:00.169
Don't try to rationalise.

3111
01:57:02.299 --> 01:57:05.209
Don't try to rationalise with that horrible fellow,

3112
01:57:05.259 --> 01:57:06.490
you did not rationalise.

3113
01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:08.229
Why didn't you ask what is he doing?

3114
01:57:10.529 --> 01:57:11.859
That's why we're all here now.

3115
01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:13.990
You couldn't ask a question to him.

3116
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:16.069
I see the difference.

3117
01:57:16.759 --> 01:57:17.149
Why?

3118
01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:19.470
I respect you for this that you're free,

3119
01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:20.509
then ask the question.

3120
01:57:21.549 --> 01:57:23.089
You have to be free

3121
01:57:23.540 --> 01:57:25.140
to be completely liberated.

3122
01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:31.129
You accepted him.

3123
01:57:31.169 --> 01:57:31.970
I don't know how.

3124
01:57:33.169 --> 01:57:35.319
He didn't even tell you why he was doing like this.

3125
01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:38.379
You,

3126
01:57:38.479 --> 01:57:39.470
the intelligent,

3127
01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:40.669
the intellectuals.

3128
01:57:41.979 --> 01:57:42.810
No question.

3129
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:45.379
Why didn't you say that?

3130
01:57:45.419 --> 01:57:47.819
How do you say you are the one who's giving us the right?

3131
01:57:47.979 --> 01:57:49.379
Did you ask him the question like this,

3132
01:57:49.419 --> 01:57:49.870
my child?

3133
01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:51.069
You should have.

3134
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:52.450
How much money did you pay him?

3135
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:57.529
The difference between that and this

3136
01:57:57.959 --> 01:58:00.209
is that with that I was learning a technique.

3137
01:58:00.459 --> 01:58:02.299
What is learning a technique,

3138
01:58:02.419 --> 01:58:04.620
a technique which I thought was to do with.

3139
01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:11.350
I wasn't looking for spiritual guidance and I also wasn't looking for any kind of

3140
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.200
Um,

3141
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.189
worship,

3142
01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:19.700
it's all right.

3143
01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:21.899
You may not look out for anyone or anything.

3144
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.379
You wanted to have relaxation.

3145
01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:25.470
You cannot have relaxation at all.

3146
01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.209
You cannot by any other method.

3147
01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:28.919
You have to accept

3148
01:58:29.419 --> 01:58:29.770
yourself.

3149
01:58:29.859 --> 01:58:30.700
You have to know yourself,

3150
01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:32.580
otherwise you can never be relaxed.

3151
01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:33.740
It's a simple thing,

3152
01:58:34.339 --> 01:58:34.879
as I said,

3153
01:58:34.979 --> 01:58:37.660
if your petrol is going to finish all the time.

3154
01:58:38.399 --> 01:58:39.459
You're going to bed.

3155
01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.339
Unless and until you are realised,

3156
01:58:45.379 --> 01:58:46.770
you cannot be relaxed.

3157
01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:48.930
That's the time when you are realised.

3158
01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:52.410
That's the time your ego merges.

3159
01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.100
but it's quite,

3160
01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:58.799
it's relative relaxation as close to absolute relaxation isn't it.

3161
01:59:00.819 --> 01:59:00.939
No,

3162
01:59:01.049 --> 01:59:01.459
but you see,

3163
01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:03.009
this is not a shop.

3164
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:04.180
In seeking,

3165
01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:05.459
there is not a shop on

3166
01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:07.310
that you give me 5%,

3167
01:59:07.379 --> 01:59:07.819
you see,

3168
01:59:07.939 --> 01:59:09.509
I want meat only half black.

3169
01:59:10.810 --> 01:59:11.799
You can't do it like that.

3170
01:59:11.839 --> 01:59:12.740
You get it in your heart,

3171
01:59:13.439 --> 01:59:14.560
but you have to ask for it.

3172
01:59:14.569 --> 01:59:16.029
If you say I was not sick.

3173
01:59:18.049 --> 01:59:18.899
Who are you?

3174
01:59:20.779 --> 01:59:21.020
See,

3175
01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:22.040
a question comes to me.

3176
01:59:22.779 --> 01:59:23.979
Ask yourself who am I?

3177
01:59:24.799 --> 01:59:26.970
Why did I say so that I was not safe?

3178
01:59:27.959 --> 01:59:28.839
Who was I

3179
01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:31.149
was I was I a

3180
01:59:31.359 --> 01:59:33.680
person who had lent money to somebody?

3181
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:36.330
That I was asking for it.

3182
01:59:36.779 --> 01:59:36.819
See,

3183
01:59:36.859 --> 01:59:39.540
the attitude of an intellectual is like that.

3184
01:59:41.709 --> 01:59:43.350
We must ask questions to ourselves.

3185
01:59:44.279 --> 01:59:44.919
Who are they?

3186
01:59:47.839 --> 01:59:48.790
We are asking.

3187
01:59:49.029 --> 01:59:51.290
I'm seeking this now on what

3188
01:59:51.549 --> 01:59:52.819
premises you are seeing.

3189
01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:55.689
I'll tell you that

3190
01:59:55.859 --> 01:59:56.660
you go to a shop,

3191
01:59:56.759 --> 01:59:57.169
all right,

3192
01:59:57.259 --> 01:59:57.729
it's that.

3193
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:00.040
But when you are seeking,

3194
02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:01.580
on what right are you seeking?

3195
02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.450
What has given you the right to seek?

3196
02:00:05.899 --> 02:00:06.799
I ask this,

3197
02:00:06.979 --> 02:00:08.209
only that you have some money,

3198
02:00:08.330 --> 02:00:08.770
is it?

3199
02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:10.109
I mean,

3200
02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:12.669
I began seeking because ever since I got 2 years old,

3201
02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:13.609
I just knew I wanted

3202
02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:16.200
are you are different,

3203
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:17.979
but I'm talking about her question.

3204
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.589
You're different.

3205
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:19.109
It's correct.

3206
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:20.459
I'm asking her

3207
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:23.189
that if you say that I was not seeking this,

3208
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:24.439
I was seeking this.

3209
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:25.979
Was there a market on?

3210
02:00:29.549 --> 02:00:32.229
It's just a question of awareness and what you see is yes,

3211
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:35.029
it's a question of,

3212
02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:38.020
but still supposing something is missing now I would say

3213
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:40.430
that you do not have a Buckingham Palace,

3214
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:42.109
say for example that's missing.

3215
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:43.549
Can you ask for it?

3216
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.140
No,

3217
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.169
how can

3218
02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:49.629
you have no right?

3219
02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:50.910
Just see my point.

3220
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.040
Did you follow the point?

3221
02:00:52.080 --> 02:00:53.319
It's a very subtle point.

3222
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.240
You see the point.

3223
02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:56.759
When you are seeking,

3224
02:00:56.959 --> 02:00:59.870
I'm seeking this much or that on what grounds.

3225
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:00.479
Let's see.

3226
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:05.520
On what grants are you seeing?

3227
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:07.379
What right have you got to see

3228
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.520
anymore?

3229
02:01:08.850 --> 02:01:10.080
What is your basis?

3230
02:01:10.779 --> 02:01:11.819
Let's see that.

3231
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.939
You see,

3232
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:13.830
we go to the bank.

3233
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:14.310
All right,

3234
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:16.020
I want 500 pounds.

3235
02:01:16.029 --> 02:01:17.270
If you do not have any account,

3236
02:01:17.279 --> 02:01:18.229
then they say get out.

3237
02:01:20.259 --> 02:01:21.240
If you have a,

3238
02:01:21.419 --> 02:01:22.859
if you have an account,

3239
02:01:22.899 --> 02:01:24.089
then you can go and ask.

3240
02:01:24.379 --> 02:01:26.129
Now do you have any account for CT?

3241
02:01:26.939 --> 02:01:28.009
What accounts do you have?

3242
02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:34.689
That's the point.

3243
02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:35.620
You reach a point where you,

3244
02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:36.520
I don't know.

3245
02:01:36.759 --> 02:01:38.270
That's the only answer you can get,

3246
02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:39.609
so I would say

3247
02:01:39.899 --> 02:01:42.430
that you have CT not

3248
02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:43.529
because.

3249
02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.830
You think you are seeking,

3250
02:01:47.259 --> 02:01:49.459
but seeking is embedded in you.

3251
02:01:51.419 --> 02:01:52.149
It is in.

3252
02:01:53.779 --> 02:01:56.379
You did not ask for human life from amoeba,

3253
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:58.540
you become a human being without asking.

3254
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:01.600
And you have been made.

3255
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:04.600
freedom.

3256
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:05.850
We

3257
02:02:07.029 --> 02:02:08.899
And when you ask for it,

3258
02:02:09.490 --> 02:02:10.479
because you are a human being,

3259
02:02:10.529 --> 02:02:13.120
you are given a freedom and you have a right to ask for it.

3260
02:02:13.129 --> 02:02:14.819
That's the only right you have got

3261
02:02:15.169 --> 02:02:16.040
to ask

3262
02:02:16.479 --> 02:02:17.000
why,

3263
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:18.970
why you have to ask it.

3264
02:02:23.410 --> 02:02:25.240
Why do you have a right to ask

3265
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:26.700
is this

3266
02:02:27.509 --> 02:02:28.120
because

3267
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:31.689
God is not going to fall at your feet and

3268
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:33.479
say that take your realisation.

3269
02:02:33.629 --> 02:02:34.049
No,

3270
02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.490
you ask for it.

3271
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:36.319
It's not fine,

3272
02:02:36.330 --> 02:02:36.370
but it's

3273
02:02:42.220 --> 02:02:42.290
this is the point that you follow.

3274
02:02:42.299 --> 02:02:46.979
He's not going to fall at your feet and say that my child asked for realisation.

3275
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.790
sure.

3276
02:02:49.450 --> 02:02:50.850
We'll put you into such a,

3277
02:02:51.609 --> 02:02:53.040
such wonderful

3278
02:02:53.209 --> 02:02:53.680
things

3279
02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:54.310
that

3280
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.649
we'll get out of it.

3281
02:02:57.319 --> 02:02:58.580
To get this gift.

3282
02:03:00.009 --> 02:03:00.709
It's

3283
02:03:00.919 --> 02:03:01.850
a privilege.

3284
02:03:05.660 --> 02:03:06.410
Do you know that?

3285
02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:09.660
It's a privilege to be self relaxed.

3286
02:03:11.399 --> 02:03:13.029
You do not adorn God.

3287
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:14.279
God adorns.

3288
02:03:15.220 --> 02:03:17.250
If you accept the reality,

3289
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:19.009
you become greater,

3290
02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:21.129
but reality doesn't become greater.

3291
02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.140
This is all ego ideas,

3292
02:03:23.299 --> 02:03:23.549
you see,

3293
02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:24.020
I,

3294
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:25.390
I see reality

3295
02:03:25.819 --> 02:03:26.930
as if you are

3296
02:03:27.259 --> 02:03:28.680
obliging the reality.

3297
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:32.109
The reality,

3298
02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:33.359
it cannot be obliged.

3299
02:03:33.399 --> 02:03:34.990
You are going to be obliged.

3300
02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:40.629
This is only possible for the gurus to take money from you,

3301
02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:46.790
and you can say that only give me 5 ₹5 worth of because I don't have money

3302
02:03:49.759 --> 02:03:50.470
you follow.

3303
02:03:51.479 --> 02:03:51.919
Good to be.

3304
02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.680
And when you come to this point of understanding

3305
02:03:56.009 --> 02:03:59.439
that how this ego plays tricks with you even in things,

3306
02:03:59.649 --> 02:04:00.729
and they have used it,

3307
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:01.680
do you know that

3308
02:04:02.450 --> 02:04:03.419
they have used your ego.

3309
02:04:04.009 --> 02:04:06.600
They have pampered it by saying that you can pay for it

3310
02:04:06.930 --> 02:04:08.359
if you know I can purchase the book.

3311
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.180
They have paid

3312
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:15.720
paid on the American ego much more than that of English,

3313
02:04:18.370 --> 02:04:20.160
and that's why they are still

3314
02:04:20.609 --> 02:04:20.859
there

3315
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:23.479
to bring them out.

3316
02:04:23.649 --> 02:04:23.950
They said,

3317
02:04:23.959 --> 02:04:24.339
no ma'am,

3318
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:25.209
we paid for it.

3319
02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:25.600
I said,

3320
02:04:25.649 --> 02:04:26.310
go,

3321
02:04:26.609 --> 02:04:27.089
go ahead,

3322
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.729
Yankees,

3323
02:04:27.810 --> 02:04:28.359
go ahead.

3324
02:04:28.770 --> 02:04:29.770
That's what you can say.

3325
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:31.649
One of the gurus has become a Yankee now,

3326
02:04:31.729 --> 02:04:31.930
you know,

3327
02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.359
he dresses up like that

3328
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.620
and.

3329
02:04:36.729 --> 02:04:39.250
Only he had 53 cants.

3330
02:04:39.370 --> 02:04:40.660
He wanted to buy one sheet,

3331
02:04:40.930 --> 02:04:43.359
which of course the English thought was too much.

3332
02:04:43.529 --> 02:04:45.060
They were sent out to America.

3333
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.819
No,

3334
02:04:45.859 --> 02:04:45.939
no,

3335
02:04:46.049 --> 02:04:46.930
he had not candles,

3336
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:48.370
but he had rose for us

3337
02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:51.259
from English people gift

3338
02:04:51.490 --> 02:04:52.169
to the guru.

3339
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:56.870
Now don't play into the tricks of your.

3340
02:04:58.009 --> 02:05:01.629
Try to understand it's a privilege if you can get some relaxed.

3341
02:05:05.379 --> 02:05:08.100
They have always denied all the incarnations,

3342
02:05:08.839 --> 02:05:10.080
all ego-oriented people.

3343
02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:11.089
That's the sign.

3344
02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:12.319
When Christ came,

3345
02:05:12.399 --> 02:05:13.000
they denied it.

3346
02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:13.799
When Trishna came,

3347
02:05:13.879 --> 02:05:14.479
they denied it.

3348
02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:15.399
When Rama came,

3349
02:05:15.439 --> 02:05:16.000
they denied it.

3350
02:05:17.029 --> 02:05:20.470
And they kept up their ego saying that some incarnation is going to come later,

3351
02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:22.529
and then he's going to hang all of them together.

3352
02:05:24.479 --> 02:05:25.509
That's what he's going to do.

3353
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:28.459
That's the one who's going to come last

3354
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:29.910
but not the least.

3355
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:34.040
Try to understand,

3356
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:35.549
it's a gift to you.

3357
02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:38.060
Take it with grant.

3358
02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:43.350
It's the beauty of God which you have.

3359
02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:48.660
Just talking about it or thinking about it or being mad about it

3360
02:05:48.859 --> 02:05:50.200
or doing any sort of a

3361
02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:51.959
funny gesture about it.

3362
02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:54.299
There's no technique,

3363
02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:55.979
nothing what is made of technique.

3364
02:05:57.490 --> 02:05:57.930
And

3365
02:05:58.640 --> 02:05:59.870
out of his day.

3366
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:05.560
All your techniques are training.

3367
02:06:10.910 --> 02:06:10.919
OK

3368
02:06:12.729 --> 02:06:15.330
It's I mean my di so I.

3369
02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:17.979
No,

3370
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000
yes,

3371
02:06:18.009 --> 02:06:18.060
they're from and

3372
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.640

3373
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.919
tomorrow.

3374
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:30.020
All right,

3375
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.319
all right,

3376
02:06:30.399 --> 02:06:31.430
I'm going to be here

3377
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:32.669
because uh she,

3378
02:06:32.879 --> 02:06:34.919
she is going to be bothered about lunch.

3379
02:06:36.029 --> 02:06:36.580
I'm not,

3380
02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:37.500
I'm not bothered.

3381
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:39.180
Maria,

3382
02:06:39.419 --> 02:06:40.140
see Maria,

3383
02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:41.700
what a sweet child she is.

3384
02:06:41.979 --> 02:06:42.060
See,

3385
02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:42.799
look at her.

3386
02:06:43.450 --> 02:06:44.220
She's so beautiful.

3387
02:06:45.970 --> 02:06:49.959
It took more time for her to be realised and to do and she's giving realisation.

3388
02:06:52.439 --> 02:06:54.270
What are satisfying loves yet?

3389
02:06:55.720 --> 02:06:56.049
So

3390
02:06:57.319 --> 02:06:57.959
So good

3391
02:07:05.169 --> 02:07:06.310
That's beautiful.

3392
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:08.759
Expose your beauty.

3393
02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:11.160
Know about it.

3394
02:07:11.729 --> 02:07:12.680
Enjoy.

3395
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:13.890
Why do you want to.

3396
02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:17.959
End of your life.

3397
02:07:22.450 --> 02:07:23.240
Because

3398
02:07:23.529 --> 02:07:25.640
maybe there's some condition in the mind.

3399
02:07:27.089 --> 02:07:28.620
Somebody has taught you like Hindus,

3400
02:07:28.700 --> 02:07:29.089
you see,

3401
02:07:29.259 --> 02:07:30.700
you get some ideas in their childhood,

3402
02:07:30.779 --> 02:07:31.529
they'll go on to.

3403
02:07:32.020 --> 02:07:34.180
So there was a lady she used to pick her hair like that.

3404
02:07:34.220 --> 02:07:34.500
I said,

3405
02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.500
what are you to do?

3406
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:36.009
She said,

3407
02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:38.850
my grandmother told me that if you pick your hair like that,

3408
02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:40.049
then you'll go to swim.

3409
02:07:40.410 --> 02:07:40.660
I said,

3410
02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.580
now when did your mother,

3411
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:42.379
grandmother die?

3412
02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:43.180
Long time back.

3413
02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:43.419
I said,

3414
02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.169
now she's dead at least finished this,

3415
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:46.649
but till the age of 70,

3416
02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:47.509
she was doing that

3417
02:07:47.859 --> 02:07:48.299
all her life.

3418
02:07:48.379 --> 02:07:49.169
She couldn't get all.

3419
02:07:54.180 --> 02:07:56.450
The conditionings are so much,

3420
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.979
you see,

3421
02:07:57.149 --> 02:07:58.029
and it's all talk,

3422
02:07:58.109 --> 02:07:58.270
talk,

3423
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.509
talk,

3424
02:07:58.589 --> 02:07:58.709
talk,

3425
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:59.020
talk.

3426
02:08:01.209 --> 02:08:01.240
Be careful.

3427
02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:03.279
Be careful.

3428
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.299
It's not real.

3429
02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:08.160
It's not real,

3430
02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:08.990
but what is it?

3431
02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:09.750
It's like.

3432
02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:13.470
Like the rooms

3433
02:08:15.729 --> 02:08:16.600
There are many

3434
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:17.450
fake things,

3435
02:08:17.529 --> 02:08:18.770
but best are these rules.

3436
02:08:18.810 --> 02:08:19.490
I don't know how.

3437
02:08:21.759 --> 02:08:22.040
Ah,

3438
02:08:22.319 --> 02:08:24.779
so you can come tomorrow and bring them along.

3439
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:25.879
We're very sweet,

3440
02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:27.250
but one child is sick.

3441
02:08:37.069 --> 02:08:38.669
It's her child and she's not coming tomorrow.

3442
02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:40.100
Can you say to the child?

3443
02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:41.120
What's the matter?

3444
02:08:43.359 --> 02:08:44.549
What is wrong with the child?

3445
02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:49.950
In the day after the guru.

3446
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:52.080
Uh,

3447
02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:52.629
I'm not going to do anymore.

3448
02:08:54.910 --> 02:08:55.560
Anywhere we move down to.

3449
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:00.750
Yeah you too it's called.

3450
02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:03.089

3454
02:09:11.529 --> 02:09:11.540

No.

3457
02:09:25.359 --> 02:09:26.000
Not a problem.

3458
02:09:27.319 --> 02:09:28.339
It's not that.

3459
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.839
It's.

3460
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.259
See,

3461
02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:49.299
there's a fellow who is supposed to be the guru and he is an astrologer,

3462
02:09:49.399 --> 02:09:50.399
and the child is caught up.

3463
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:51.009
I asked her,

3464
02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.350
do you go 21 years.

3465
02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:54.120
The child is caught up is now,

3466
02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:56.149
you can see yourself how the child is caught.

3467

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:01.569

There is an expert.

3512
02:13:39.609 --> 02:13:40.669
He could not sit from the very beginning.

3513
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.959
See,

3514
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:41.060
that's it you're sitting here,

3515
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.129
you're feeling it here.

3516
02:13:45.759 --> 02:13:46.330
This is the left arm.

3517
02:13:47.879 --> 02:13:48.919
Now there's a mantra for this.

3518
02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.700
Can you imagine who was born on left now will be weed by.

3519
02:13:53.729 --> 02:13:54.410

02:13:54.609 --> 02:13:56.430

That would be better.

3535
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.450
How can you think about it?

Thanks.

3538
02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:48.209
Let's come back

3539
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:50.720
Did you get any burning

3540
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.790

3541
02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:53.049
dinging.

02:14:53.069 --> 02:14:54.640
That's dinging dinging correct.

3543

That you get here

3544
02:14:57.509 --> 02:14:59.569
you see first what happens the vibrations is so much

3545
02:14:59.569 --> 02:15:01.229
that you just feel the vibrations all the time.

3546
02:15:01.390 --> 02:15:03.709
Gradually then the sensitivity that stops.

3547
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:07.029
Now you're pretty much like that.

3548
02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:11.879
Are you getting the cold breeze?

3549
02:15:11.890 --> 02:15:11.899
Good?

02:15:13.770 --> 02:15:14.189
It's very good.

It's beautiful.

3560
02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:38.509
You are all eyes if you see the eyes are so dilated you see one.

3561
02:15:45.439 --> 02:15:45.689
