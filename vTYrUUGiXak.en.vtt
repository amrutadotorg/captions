00:08.042 --> 00:11.042
Then another thing She does, which is a very beautiful thing She does,

00:11.167 --> 00:18.042
I think sometimes, that She creates an illusion

00:18.167 --> 00:23.500
to test your intelligence, to test your sensibility.

00:24.083 --> 00:28.209
She creates an illusion. Branti rupena samstita.

00:28.334 --> 00:33.209
She makes a branti in your head. Illusion.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.292
So you become illusive

00:36.417 --> 00:41.167
or others become illusive or a situation becomes illusive.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.250
And you are lost in it.

00:44.375 --> 00:51.375
Then you really understand that it’s wrong thing I have done.

00:51.459 --> 00:56.083
It’s a very nice story about Narada.

00:56.209 --> 01:02.167
Narada was under an impression about himself

01:02.292 --> 01:07.334
and ultimately he became ego-oriented and he started saying,

01:07.417 --> 01:11.292
"Oh, look at me. I am never enticed by any woman.

01:11.417 --> 01:16.042
Even Shiva was enticed by Cupid. I am never enticed.

01:16.125 --> 01:21.083
I am the highest of highest, Brahmachari."

01:21.209 --> 01:28.542
So Vishnu sent two gandharvas to entice him.

01:29.083 --> 01:32.000
So they met him in a forest and told him,

01:32.125 --> 01:35.125
"Oh, Narada, you are such a handsome man,

01:35.250 --> 01:38.542
such a beautiful man and all your beauty’s wasted.

01:39.042 --> 01:41.500
You must test your beauty. You must see how beautiful you are.

01:41.542 --> 01:44.542
You’re so handsome."

01:45.042 --> 01:48.083
He said, "Really?" "Yes. There’s a very simple way of testing you."

01:48.125 --> 01:52.542
"It’s how?" They said, "There’s a

01:53.083 --> 01:56.500
wedding coming up of a very beautiful woman.

01:57.083 --> 02:06.250
She is the princess of the beauty city, is called Roop Nagar,

02:06.375 --> 02:11.209
and you should go there and see how she will appreciate you.

02:11.334 --> 02:18.209
So he, in his ego, became so stupid that he went there.

02:18.334 --> 02:22.334
And he was sitting and lots of people were coming,

02:22.417 --> 02:25.375
big big maharajas, rajas, all of them were sitting

02:25.459 --> 02:30.292
and he was thinking, "Oh, I’m the
best among all of them. Who are these?

02:30.417 --> 02:33.500
The princess will just garland me, no doubt about it."

02:34.083 --> 02:40.000
And these two were putting that illusion in his head, branti.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.500
With the Agnya, you get branti.

02:44.083 --> 02:49.209
This princess came round. She
looked at him and she laughed aloud.

02:49.292 --> 02:53.250
She couldn’t control herself and she moved on giggling.

02:53.334 --> 02:55.542
He couldn’t understand why she laughed at him.

02:56.083 --> 03:00.292
She didn’t garland him or nothing but she just laughed.

03:00.417 --> 03:04.167
So he couldn’t understand, "I’m such a handsome man," this thing.

03:04.250 --> 03:07.417
So these two gandharvas told him, "Oh, it doesn’t matter.

03:07.542 --> 03:11.292
You see, she doesn’t understand. She’ll come back," this, that.

03:11.375 --> 03:14.542
Then they went out and near a lake and he sat down

03:15.083 --> 03:19.417
to wash his face and looked at in the water his reflection.

03:19.500 --> 03:24.209
He looked like a monkey.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.375
He looked at these two and he cursed them.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.500
He said, "I look like a monkey."

03:30.083 --> 03:33.334
Said, "To us, you look like very handsome."

03:33.459 --> 03:38.042
"But I really look like a monkey."

03:38.167 --> 03:44.542
So this branti, this illusion was created in his mind by his ego.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.167
But this power, itself, Mahakali’s power,

03:48.292 --> 03:55.417
She puts this ego right by creating illusion, branti.

03:58.167 --> 04:04.500
And this is responsible for many illusions we run after.

04:05.042 --> 04:11.083
It’s a mirage, running after it, running after it.

04:11.500 --> 04:16.334
Once we are satisfied within ourselves,

04:16.459 --> 04:21.292
then we don’t run after mirages.

04:22.292 --> 04:25.500
So today we are going to worship that Mahakali power.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.417
May God bless you.
