00:02.583 --> 00:11.285
Today, I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis who
have found the Truth.

00:15.329 --> 00:24.177
There has been, from ages, the seeking
for the Truth.

00:24.378 --> 00:33.570
And when people discovered that there’s
no other way

00:33.771 --> 00:42.836
but to surrender to the Divine that you
can find the truth,

00:43.037 --> 00:48.494
they did not know how to do it, how
to work it out.

00:49.071 --> 00:54.312
There have been seekers all over the world.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.755
I went to Turkey and I was amazed

00:56.956 --> 01:00.176
there have been lots of Sufis,

01:00.377 --> 01:04.227
but their disciples were not realised
souls.

01:04.428 --> 01:06.406
Because the Sufis also did not know

01:06.606 --> 01:09.366
how they got their Realisation.

01:09.567 --> 01:17.632
Such darkness existed around people who
were seeking.

01:17.833 --> 01:25.021
All over the world, I find, when I was
a little girl,

01:25.222 --> 01:34.604
that they are completely ignorant about
how to find the Truth.

01:34.805 --> 01:39.230
So many were lost in all kinds

01:39.431 --> 01:44.659
of so-called religions and rituals.

01:44.859 --> 01:47.859
All kinds of rituals they used to do.

01:48.061 --> 01:53.507
Morning till evening, some sort of a ritual
they would do.

01:53.708 --> 01:57.419
Whether they were Hindus, Christians,
Muslims,

01:57.620 --> 02:01.171
they all believed that by doing all these
rituals

02:01.372 --> 02:05.711
you will achieve something, that you will
know the Truth,

02:05.912 --> 02:08.989
that you will get your Self-realisation.

02:09.190 --> 02:16.803
All such seekers went to wrong people

02:17.004 --> 02:20.143
and to wrong directions

02:20.344 --> 02:24.868
because they were really seeking from
their heart.

02:25.069 --> 02:31.070
So they were very misleading, misleading

02:31.308 --> 02:41.958
and they were misled into such horrible
black areas

02:42.159 --> 02:44.250
that they did not know what they were
seeking,

02:44.451 --> 02:49.645
what they are supposed to seek, what they
have to have.

02:51.666 --> 03:00.746
It has been prophesised that when Kali
Yuga will come,

03:00.947 --> 03:04.337
people will find themselves.

03:04.538 --> 03:10.860
There is a story about Nala and Kali,

03:11.061 --> 03:23.465
who had taken away the wife, Damayanti,
of Nala.

03:23.666 --> 03:34.744
So, once Nala caught hold of him, and he
said that: “Now I’m going to kill you,

03:34.945 --> 03:42.042
because you are a very mischievous man,
and you have done such a harm to me.”

03:42.243 --> 03:49.081
So the Kali said: “You can kill me, but
before that you should know

03:49.282 --> 03:53.468
what is my importance, what is my Mahatmya.

03:53.669 --> 04:00.974
And my importance is that when my time
will come –

04:01.175 --> 04:04.041
when Kali Yuga will come –

04:04.242 --> 04:08.779
then all those people who are seeking
the Truth

04:08.980 --> 04:20.387
in the jungles, in the hills and dales,
in the Himalayas,

04:20.588 --> 04:24.364
will become ordinary householders,

04:24.565 --> 04:29.986
they’ll be householders – they won’t be
sanyasis going about –

04:30.187 --> 04:35.719
they’ll be householders, and they will
find the Truth”.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.549
This has been prophesised long time back,

04:38.750 --> 04:43.673
and also there’s a book about it, a big
book (Nala Purana)

04:43.874 --> 04:47.860
as you must have read in the book, which
says that:

04:48.061 --> 04:55.131
“The time has come for people to know
themselves.”

04:55.416 --> 04:57.997
Every religion has said one thing,

04:58.198 --> 05:01.659
that – “You must know yourself.”

05:01.891 --> 05:07.309
Islam says the same, Buddha says the same,

05:07.510 --> 05:12.757
Christians say the same, Hindus say
the same.

05:12.958 --> 05:22.785
So, till then, they go on doing all kinds
of acrobats,

05:22.986 --> 05:29.505
but [finally] they realise that – we
haven’t found the Truth.

05:31.068 --> 05:36.299
So it came to my lot,

05:36.500 --> 05:40.102
from my childhood I knew I had to do it.

05:40.303 --> 05:43.424
But when I saw the human beings,

05:43.625 --> 05:48.884
how much in darkness they were about
themselves,

05:49.085 --> 05:55.001
how aggressive and how sinful they were,

05:55.202 --> 06:04.321
all their style was so cruel that it was
unbelievable.

06:04.522 --> 06:08.786
That was the time also I saw Hitler
coming up.

06:08.987 --> 06:17.552
And our country also was in complete
bondage.

06:18.135 --> 06:25.098
So the first thing was to make our country
free,

06:25.299 --> 06:32.507
was very important, and that’s why
I took a very, very active role

06:32.708 --> 06:38.726
in the movement that was for the freedom
of our country;

06:38.927 --> 06:43.016
same with my father, mother.

06:43.258 --> 06:47.059
But when we got the freedom, somehow,

06:47.260 --> 06:52.094
after some time we got lost.

06:52.295 --> 06:58.819
People started taking to all kinds of
modern things which were wrong,

06:59.020 --> 07:03.498
which were so-called entertaining.

07:04.505 --> 07:09.748
With all that, I found (that) all over
the world

07:09.949 --> 07:15.070
there was a big seeking force,

07:15.271 --> 07:19.679
and some false people took full
advantage of it.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.255
They went out and made lots and lots
of money,

07:24.456 --> 07:27.041
and with their falsehood they cursed them,

07:27.270 --> 07:29.465
I don’t know what they did to them.

07:29.666 --> 07:33.201
So many seekers were lost like that.

07:33.402 --> 07:37.967
Despite that, I went to America and I was
shocked

07:38.168 --> 07:42.882
how the things were going on there.
But I couldn’t help it,

07:43.083 --> 07:49.904
because they were so mentally ill-equipped,

07:50.105 --> 07:54.761
they could not understand what they have
to have,

07:54.962 --> 07:58.930
and you can’t pay for the Truth.

08:00.750 --> 08:10.604
Then it happened that I had started it
after the Sahasrara was broken.

08:10.805 --> 08:17.103
And you know the story of how I broke
the Sahasrara,

08:17.304 --> 08:24.390
and how, from one person, I started
giving Realization.

08:24.591 --> 08:28.179
But from America I got very disappointed.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.439
I was thinking: “How will it grow? How will
it work out?”

08:33.640 --> 08:41.570
We had about 25 people who were realised
souls by then, in India.

08:41.771 --> 08:47.382
But they realised what they have got
by Realization,

08:47.583 --> 08:53.382
they realised that they had become
very good people.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.770
They had given up all bad habits,

08:56.971 --> 09:05.055
and they were wanting to worship me.
I said: “No, no. Don’t worship me

09:05.256 --> 09:12.424
because people will not understand”. But
one day they forced me.

09:12.625 --> 09:16.663
So on our terrace of the house they came
and worshipped me

09:16.864 --> 09:21.830
because somebody had told them, “This is
the Goddess.”

09:22.031 --> 09:28.899
So, what had happened was after
the programme

09:29.100 --> 09:32.718
one maidservant came up who was possessed.

09:32.919 --> 09:39.632
And she came and she started calling me
by the name of ‘Goddess’.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.673
So people said: “What are you saying?”

09:42.874 --> 09:46.382
She was a woman but talking like a man.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.340
So she said: “I’m telling you the truth,

09:49.541 --> 09:53.835
She is the Goddess who has come to save
us.”

09:54.036 --> 09:58.229
Her language was not that of a maidservant,

09:58.430 --> 10:04.967
but of a very well-educated Brahmin

10:05.168 --> 10:09.222
who would say all Adi Shankaracharya’s
stotras.

10:09.423 --> 10:14.191
It was very surprising! So they asked her
several questions

10:14.392 --> 10:20.291
and then she just fainted. So I told them:
“Just don’t listen to her, it’s no use.”

10:20.492 --> 10:22.417
But they would not agree, and they said:

10:22.618 --> 10:28.340
“Mother, we have to worship you.” So
somehow I agreed to that

10:28.541 --> 10:34.507
and they got hold of seven Brahmins to do
that.

10:34.708 --> 10:39.676
They were afraid because to do that Puja,

10:39.877 --> 10:46.064
it’s very dangerous and it could harm you
if it is not the Truth.

10:46.265 --> 10:50.936
But on the contrary, when they were doing
the Puja, they got their Realization,

10:51.137 --> 10:54.539
and they just said: “Now, this is
the Truth!”

10:54.740 --> 10:57.379
They felt the cool breeze in their hands.

10:57.580 --> 11:03.295
All the symptoms told about a realised
soul started.

11:04.126 --> 11:11.235
But I didn’t want to say everything at that
time, because

11:11.436 --> 11:15.374
there were many others saying: “I am this…
I am that…”

11:15.575 --> 11:19.846
So I didn’t want to expose it altogether.

11:20.047 --> 11:24.166
But gradually I had found that people got
attracted

11:24.367 --> 11:27.816
and they used to come to my programme.

11:28.017 --> 11:31.873
And then the Sahaja Yoga started spreading

11:32.074 --> 11:37.917
all over, in a very interesting manner.

11:38.118 --> 11:42.628
So this Sahasrara Day or, we can say,

11:42.829 --> 11:46.389
on the day the Sahasrara was opened out,

11:46.590 --> 11:52.076
is a very important one, it’s very subtle.

11:52.277 --> 11:57.871
We just know about the Kundalini, that
She’s coiled up in three and a half,

11:58.072 --> 12:04.814
and She’s lying in the triangular bone
known as Sacrum.

12:05.015 --> 12:11.883
But we don’t know what She works, how She
works, what happens to us.

12:12.599 --> 12:19.122
She rises in six centres and breaks
the seventh…

12:19.323 --> 12:22.380
I should say She breaks the sixth centre,

12:22.581 --> 12:27.052
because Ganesha’s centre doesn’t play
any role.

12:27.253 --> 12:34.591
So when She breaks the sixth centre, which
is the Sahasrara,

12:34.792 --> 12:42.244
then She connects you to the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love.

12:43.548 --> 12:54.299
But what is this Divine Love? What does
this do?

12:54.500 --> 13:02.209
It is the energy of the Mother.

13:02.410 --> 13:07.174
We can say it is the energy of Adi Shakti,

13:07.375 --> 13:14.875
which is all over, works through
vibrations.

13:15.076 --> 13:18.716
But what are these vibrations?

13:18.960 --> 13:22.037
It’s a very subtle energy

13:22.238 --> 13:28.148
that starts flowing through your Sahasrara.

13:28.349 --> 13:34.370
All the thousand petals of the Sahasrara
get slowly enlightened

13:34.571 --> 13:38.632
and it starts flowing throughout your body,

13:38.833 --> 13:45.340
throughout your hands, feet, throughout
your body.

13:45.541 --> 13:53.841
And the more you are… I mean your attention
is, on the Sahasrara,

13:54.042 --> 13:57.507
the more it works faster.

13:57.708 --> 14:02.262
Now in the science I’ve read that they
have discovered

14:02.463 --> 14:06.849
an energy called, they call it… what you
call that?

14:07.224 --> 14:13.386
I don’t know, because it was the scientists
that...

14:13.618 --> 14:18.010
Forget it, is the… (From the audience:
“Quantum”)

14:18.211 --> 14:23.414
What energy? Quantum ha! Quantum Energy.

14:23.615 --> 14:26.380
Quantum, I don’t know why they call it
Quantum,

14:26.581 --> 14:30.465
because Quantum is four.

14:30.666 --> 14:35.879
So it might be meaning the energy of
Ganesha, maybe, I don’t know.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.196
Because scientists are blind people,

14:38.397 --> 14:40.862
I don’t know what they call what.

14:41.063 --> 14:44.055
So they are saying there is a quantum
energy.

14:44.256 --> 14:51.360
Now this Quantum Energy, according to them,
flows, in a very subtle manner

14:51.561 --> 14:57.681
and it is normally not visible, but it has
light.

14:57.882 --> 15:03.313
You have seen that in so many of
photographs of mine,

15:03.514 --> 15:06.944
there’s light of all kind.

15:07.145 --> 15:09.841
This energy moves in a light.

15:10.042 --> 15:14.087
So this is the Quantum Energy I think
again, I am not very sure,

15:14.288 --> 15:18.435
because scientists, I have always found
them little bit vague.

15:18.636 --> 15:21.698
But this quantum energy they are talking
about

15:21.906 --> 15:24.548
is something like the spiritual energy

15:24.749 --> 15:29.350
or the energy of love, which flows around.

15:29.551 --> 15:35.589
And this Quantum Energy, they do not know
what it does,

15:35.790 --> 15:39.549
but they have seen it has got light.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.131
They call it Quantum because, according
to them,

15:42.332 --> 15:48.591
it flows in bundles, and every bundle is
a quanta, according to them.

15:48.792 --> 15:54.804
Now this energy, when it flows, as you have
seen yourself, it works.

15:55.005 --> 15:58.812
It works in every direction, in every
dimension.

15:59.013 --> 16:02.340
For example it works physically.

16:02.541 --> 16:05.638
Supposing you have some physical ailment,

16:05.839 --> 16:08.841
you have seen many people get cured
in my presence –

16:09.042 --> 16:12.848
just in my presence. I need not do anything
to them.

16:13.049 --> 16:18.215
Or also, as soon as I see somebody, I know
what he is suffering from.

16:18.416 --> 16:21.967
That’s also, I must say, my connection

16:22.221 --> 16:26.681
with the Divine, and that tells me what’s
wrong

16:26.882 --> 16:30.163
with what person and what should be done.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.994
And it can be cured in no time

16:33.204 --> 16:35.835
because that also comes to me just like
that.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.102
I mean, I don’t ask any questions,

16:38.303 --> 16:41.364
I don’t try to find out, I do not analyse,

16:41.565 --> 16:43.736
but it just says: “Do like this.”

16:43.937 --> 16:48.723
Or, it also doesn’t say, it just does.

16:48.924 --> 16:53.029
It just works automatically. It is very
difficult

16:53.230 --> 16:56.424
to explain how this energy works.

16:56.625 --> 16:59.549
But all of you who have got Realisation

16:59.750 --> 17:04.361
can also work out your own energies. How?

17:04.570 --> 17:12.285
By releasing it, by feeling it,

17:12.486 --> 17:17.683
by giving it to others, by experimenting.

17:17.884 --> 17:22.587
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has spread because
of you only.

17:22.788 --> 17:26.123
You are the people that have brought people
to Sahaja Yoga.

17:26.324 --> 17:31.223
But that’s not the end of it. We have
to save this world.

17:31.424 --> 17:38.095
For that at least I feel 40% of people
should get their Realisation.

17:38.296 --> 17:44.932
Whatever may be their nationality, whatever
may be their education, anything.

17:45.133 --> 17:49.699
They are to be given Self-realisation.

17:49.920 --> 17:57.045
In our Indian scriptures it is clearly
written:

17:57.245 --> 18:01.292
“Without Atma Sakshatkar, your life is
useless.”

18:01.493 --> 18:06.006
But what is Atma Sakshatkar? It’s
the knowledge about yourself.

18:06.207 --> 18:08.128
How can you have that knowledge,

18:08.329 --> 18:13.936
unless and until you become one with this
All-pervading Power?

18:14.137 --> 18:17.069
So it was a very great thing I felt

18:17.270 --> 18:24.708
that this Sahasrara I could open in 1970.

18:24.909 --> 18:28.698
I realised I was overwhelmed,

18:28.899 --> 18:32.268
because I knew this is the only trouble,

18:32.469 --> 18:35.928
it is the only obstacle human beings are
having.

18:36.129 --> 18:39.010
Because their Sahasraras are not open,

18:39.210 --> 18:46.232
that’s why they are going in the darkness,
that’s why they are having wars,

18:46.433 --> 18:49.974
that’s why they are having all kinds
of problems.

18:50.175 --> 18:52.970
But if their Sahasrara opens

18:53.171 --> 18:56.735
and if they become one with the Divine
Power,

18:56.936 --> 18:59.840
all their problems will be solved,

19:00.041 --> 19:02.632
every type of problem will be solved

19:02.833 --> 19:05.149
and they will be very happy people.

19:05.350 --> 19:09.709
I realised it and I was very happy, I was
over-joyous,

19:09.910 --> 19:13.245
but nobody understood me.

19:13.446 --> 19:17.774
I don’t know, they thought I must be
talking something nonsensical.

19:17.975 --> 19:20.284
Nobody understood it, what it is.

19:20.485 --> 19:26.531
Because even in the Shastras it’s not
written

19:27.444 --> 19:30.175
about Kundalini so clearly.

19:30.376 --> 19:34.413
Only one great saint called Jnaneshwara

19:34.614 --> 19:39.257
wrote it in his book in the sixth chapter
about the Kundalini.

19:39.458 --> 19:43.587
It’s not so clear, only he said that: “With
the Kundalini,

19:43.788 --> 19:46.200
you can get your awakening.”

19:46.401 --> 19:49.259
Also you sing that song always [“Jogawa”,
“Ude bai”] I’ve heard,

19:49.460 --> 19:54.257
which says that: “Oh, Kundalini Mother,
please be awakened!”

19:54.458 --> 19:58.641
But nobody knows that what this Kundalini
is

19:58.842 --> 20:01.591
and why are you singing that song.

20:01.792 --> 20:06.104
It was all in our country, people used
to sing in the village.

20:06.305 --> 20:11.339
So clearly, but nobody understood
the meaning of it.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.860
Just they used to sing as a, some sort
of a bhajan,

20:15.061 --> 20:18.708
or could be some sort of a music concert,

20:18.909 --> 20:22.159
but nobody knew what it was talking about.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.217
It was such a misunderstanding about
everything.

20:25.418 --> 20:30.215
And [for] all these poets, also, who have
written

20:30.416 --> 20:36.215
clearly about awakening, about Realisation,

20:36.416 --> 20:39.709
everything was just in the books.

20:39.910 --> 20:43.375
They would read one line of the book, then
stop there.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.906
Another person would start another line,

20:46.107 --> 20:50.591
then he stops at another point – like that
they were just reading.

20:50.792 --> 20:54.891
Same thing about all the scriptures.

20:55.092 --> 21:00.521
There was big misunderstanding created
and was used

21:00.722 --> 21:05.282
for the purpose of their own self-interest.

21:05.483 --> 21:08.827
That is how we couldn’t get people

21:09.028 --> 21:12.251
who understood what was Self-realisation.

21:12.452 --> 21:18.886
It was just for some money, or for some
certain type of a position to get,

21:19.087 --> 21:26.299
people started big, big organisations,

21:26.500 --> 21:31.179
very big religious organisations –

21:31.380 --> 21:36.920
I don’t know what to call them – but none
of them were realised souls.

21:37.121 --> 21:45.373
For example, there was a great saint called
Viditama who went to China (Japan),

21:45.574 --> 21:49.597
and he started a religion called Zen.

21:49.798 --> 21:51.975
Zen means dhyana.

21:52.176 --> 21:58.073
And he wanted to put Zen in such a manner

21:58.274 --> 22:02.299
that people become thoughtless.

22:02.500 --> 22:12.005
He made a big tank full of sand with
patterns, and put some stones

22:12.206 --> 22:17.971
and he had said that: “You sit on the edge
of this pond

22:18.172 --> 22:25.233
and just see but don’t think.” But people
didn’t understand what it was.

22:25.434 --> 22:27.716
Normally anybody would go there and say,

22:27.917 --> 22:33.289
“Oh, this looks like some ships in
the sea,” or all kinds of things.

22:33.490 --> 22:37.591
But nobody tried for thoughtless awareness.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.994
And I told some of them that, “This is for

22:40.195 --> 22:45.139
thoughtless awareness”, but they
couldn’t understand.

22:45.614 --> 22:51.395
Then we have also in Japan (China) – Tao.

22:51.596 --> 22:55.939
He talked about the All-pervading Power,
which is Tao.

22:56.140 --> 23:02.085
And Lao-Tse was the one who did… He had
described saints,

23:02.286 --> 23:07.817
how the saints are, how they behave,
how they talk,

23:08.018 --> 23:11.674
what is their mannerism, everything.

23:11.875 --> 23:15.667
But how you become a saint, nobody said.

23:15.868 --> 23:19.671
I think, throughout, there has been no
description

23:19.872 --> 23:27.456
how to make a person into a saintly
personality.

23:47.092 --> 23:56.215
So also in the twelfth century, Jnaneshwara
was in the twelfth century [i.e. 1200s],

23:56.416 --> 24:00.819
he talked about it, and he said about it
in his book everything.

24:01.020 --> 24:04.694
Because it was a kind of a style

24:04.895 --> 24:08.716
that a guru should have only one disciple,

24:08.917 --> 24:13.157
who should give to one disciple
Realisation, not to many.

24:13.358 --> 24:18.082
I don’t know why, what made them such
a law, or a rule.

24:18.283 --> 24:24.541
And then it started in the twelfth century,
there were many saints

24:24.742 --> 24:30.563
who sang the praise of Realisation.

24:30.764 --> 24:34.128
And all of them thought that these rituals
are no good,

24:34.329 --> 24:37.103
so they discarded rituals and this –

24:37.304 --> 24:42.139
but what was the thing that had to happen,
nobody knew.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.320
I have read all their lives,

24:46.521 --> 24:51.632
I’ve read afterwards also many saints who
were there,

24:51.833 --> 24:57.382
but it seems nobody knew how to raise
the Kundalini.

24:57.583 --> 25:03.011
This was the basic problem – they didn’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

25:03.212 --> 25:06.269
While, I think, they didn’t have that
power,

25:06.470 --> 25:08.772
or maybe they had no knowledge.

25:08.973 --> 25:11.535
They talked about Kundalini, alright,

25:11.736 --> 25:16.858
but they did not know how to raise
the Kundalini.

25:17.059 --> 25:22.039
This is a very special power
of spirituality.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.292
None of them have been able to say

25:25.493 --> 25:28.427
or tell you how to raise the Kundalini.

25:28.628 --> 25:31.457
Now you all have got this power,

25:31.658 --> 25:35.740
which is such a rare thing. All of you have
got it.

25:35.941 --> 25:41.123
I don’t see anybody who doesn’t have that
power to raise the Kundalini.

25:41.324 --> 25:45.429
You may not [use it], you may be contented
with yourself,

25:45.630 --> 25:47.799
but that’s not a very good thing.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.772
If you have got your Sahasrara opened out,

25:52.987 --> 25:55.724
and if you know how to raise the Kundalini,

25:55.925 --> 26:00.841
you must go all out to give Realisation
to people.

26:01.042 --> 26:06.562
Nothing is going to benefit people more
than Self-realisation.

26:06.763 --> 26:12.504
No use doing other charities, giving money,
giving this – is of no use.

26:12.726 --> 26:16.360
Best thing is to go all out to see people

26:16.561 --> 26:20.550
who want their Realization and to give
them Realization.

26:20.750 --> 26:27.560
I was very happy to see that they have
started working it out on the Gypsies.

26:27.761 --> 26:30.309
I have a special feeling for Gypsies.

26:30.510 --> 26:34.671
For no fault of theirs, they are leading
a very miserable life.

26:34.872 --> 26:39.096
And how the Gypsies got the Realization,

26:39.297 --> 26:46.313
you can see that you can give it to anyone
who wants to have it.

26:46.514 --> 26:49.846
One thing is there, you cannot force
on anyone.

26:50.047 --> 26:55.369
If they have a desire, a pure desire,
they can get Self-realization.

26:55.570 --> 26:59.928
So this day, I have to just say now so many
years have passed.

27:00.129 --> 27:04.163
I’ve worked quite hard, day and night,

27:04.364 --> 27:08.310
and my only desire was that you people

27:08.511 --> 27:12.301
should take it seriously and work it out.

27:12.502 --> 27:15.238
Don’t keep your Realisation to yourself.

27:15.439 --> 27:18.885
As many as people you can give
Realisation (to),

27:19.086 --> 27:25.238
the greatest obligation will be on me, and
on God Almighty.

27:25.439 --> 27:30.334
Only thing is you should try to give
Realization to others.

27:30.535 --> 27:32.734
You will never make a mistake.

27:32.935 --> 27:36.509
You can never make a mistake, because
the Kundalini knows.

27:36.710 --> 27:39.765
She knows you, She knows you are
a realised soul.

27:39.966 --> 27:43.331
She’ll respect you. Even if you make
mistakes,

27:43.532 --> 27:49.210
She’ll correct it and She’ll help you in
every way.

27:49.411 --> 27:59.683
I’m just a, I should say, a housewife who
had no support from anyone.

27:59.884 --> 28:07.261
But I was sure that it’s my job to find out
how to break the Sahasrara.

28:07.462 --> 28:10.710
Whatever way it is, outside doesn’t matter,

28:10.911 --> 28:16.946
my job was to find out the breaking
of Sahasrara, which I did.

28:17.147 --> 28:21.358
Now you also know that. So this is your
job.

28:21.559 --> 28:25.487
And the scientists now will be coming round
you to ask you questions,

28:25.688 --> 28:29.050
because they don’t know what they are
talking about

28:29.251 --> 28:34.402
is what we are already doing. So, you are
so powerful all of you.

28:34.603 --> 28:39.716
But how many of you are really doing this
work, is the point?

28:39.917 --> 28:43.591
Today is a very important day. I want
to tell you

28:43.792 --> 28:49.549
that you have to strengthen my hands.

28:49.750 --> 28:52.810
They say the Goddess has one thousand
hands,

28:53.011 --> 28:56.757
but even the one thousand hands are now
asking

28:56.958 --> 29:01.080
that you come along with your two hands
and work it out.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.266
Is very important what you have to do.

29:04.467 --> 29:10.716
All kinds of problems in this world – they
come because of ignorance,

29:10.917 --> 29:14.310
take it politics, take it any problem.

29:14.511 --> 29:22.632
And how it is solved is also is your power
with the Divine.

29:22.833 --> 29:25.591
I will give you one simple example,

29:25.792 --> 29:31.154
that the Turkish people came and were
begging of me,

29:31.355 --> 29:33.654
“Mother, You must come, You should not
postpone.”

29:33.855 --> 29:36.161
And my passport was a problem.

29:36.362 --> 29:40.620
I said, “The passport is not ready, how
will I come?”

29:40.821 --> 29:44.340
But then I thought: “Why not? We’ll have
the passport also done.”

29:44.541 --> 29:46.732
So passport was ready.

29:46.933 --> 29:49.573
And they wanted me to go to Turkey, because
they said,

29:49.774 --> 29:52.041
“The financial condition has gone down
very much,

29:52.242 --> 29:56.089
the economy has gone down absolutely.
We are ruined.”

29:56.290 --> 29:59.932
I went there, I didn’t do anything
about it,

30:00.133 --> 30:07.922
within two days, they announced ten billion
dollar help from the World Bank.

30:08.123 --> 30:10.170
Now I didn’t talk to the World Bank,

30:10.371 --> 30:14.084
I had nothing to do with them. I don’t
know.

30:14.285 --> 30:17.076
Then I said, “No, maybe, you see, they are
helping

30:17.277 --> 30:19.658
because you people are in such trouble.”

30:19.859 --> 30:21.674
They said: “But so many countries are,

30:21.875 --> 30:24.799
why have they helped us only?”

30:25.000 --> 30:26.757
I said: “That’s the point!”

30:26.958 --> 30:29.830
So now, I was surprised in Turkey

30:30.031 --> 30:34.084
there are only ladies, mostly, who are
leaders, mostly,

30:34.285 --> 30:36.733
and they have done such a big job.

30:36.934 --> 30:41.465
Now, I want to see what you people are
doing in your country.

30:41.666 --> 30:45.638
You may say that: “In my country,
the people are hopelessly bad.”

30:45.839 --> 30:48.034
Maybe, I don’t say no.

30:48.235 --> 30:52.500
But, still there are places, there are
pockets

30:52.701 --> 30:55.999
where you can go and talk to them, tell
them.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.650
Especially the media you must handle.

30:59.851 --> 31:06.289
It is something you have to do and find out
why you can’t do it.

31:06.490 --> 31:12.434
I was not supported by anybody, not helped
by anybody,

31:12.635 --> 31:16.187
and how I managed to break the Sahasrara,

31:16.388 --> 31:19.798
you can also break the Sahasraras
of others.

31:19.999 --> 31:23.584
It is not difficult, because my vision is

31:23.785 --> 31:28.684
that this world at least should have 40%
people

31:28.885 --> 31:35.632
who are realised souls and who are
practising Sahaja Yoga,

31:35.833 --> 31:43.387
who are giving Realization to people and
trying to change the people.

31:43.588 --> 31:46.692
Anybody you can go and tell, anybody.

31:46.893 --> 31:51.518
There’s no need to discriminate or to find
out or sit down with their…

31:51.719 --> 31:59.598
I mean people take sometimes the copy
of their education and this and that –

31:59.799 --> 32:04.225
that’s not needed. Whosoever it is.

32:04.426 --> 32:08.365
I’m not saying to give it to dogs or
to animals,

32:08.566 --> 32:13.479
but to human beings, wherever they are.
They may be anything.

32:13.680 --> 32:24.874
They may be English, or they could be
Germans, they could be Italians, anywhere.

32:25.075 --> 32:30.437
I am told also some people are doing lots
of seminars and working very hard,

32:30.638 --> 32:33.750
on all levels, and it is working out.

32:33.951 --> 32:36.939
Among Muslims also, we have started
working.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.057
And even in India it has worked.

32:40.258 --> 32:45.115
You don’t know, people have not lost all
their heads, so it can work out.

32:45.316 --> 32:49.760
Don’t be very much disappointed and upset
about it.

32:49.961 --> 32:51.687
Gradually it will improve.

32:51.888 --> 32:59.570
I think the greatest enemy of our
Self-realisation is the drinking.

32:59.771 --> 33:03.802
Drinking, if people take to drinking, they
become such slaves

33:04.003 --> 33:07.403
ki (that) their brains are not alright.

33:07.604 --> 33:12.296
So I think Sahasrara also must be spoilt
with drinking.

33:12.497 --> 33:15.809
So drinking I think is the worst enemy.

33:16.010 --> 33:18.679
And if you could find anybody drinking,

33:18.880 --> 33:23.547
if you could help that man to give up
drinking itself, it will work out.

33:23.748 --> 33:28.744
Of course, we have other enemies also,
like false gurus are there.

33:28.945 --> 33:33.918
Also we have other enemies who are having

33:34.119 --> 33:40.933
some sort of religious manipulations, but
that’s not so important.

33:41.134 --> 33:44.594
If you can get hold of people who are
drinking,

33:44.795 --> 33:46.982
I tell you it will change.

33:47.183 --> 33:51.605
And they will now understand that what they
have been doing so far,

33:51.806 --> 33:56.165
drinking, running away – now they’ll come
to the fields,

33:56.366 --> 33:58.901
and they’ll work out Sahaja Yoga.

33:59.102 --> 34:04.674
So you are like very gentle soldiers
of love,

34:04.875 --> 34:09.429
and that’s what you have to spread and talk
to others,

34:09.630 --> 34:11.956
give them that joy that you have.

34:12.157 --> 34:17.565
Not [to] be satisfied if you have got it
only or [a] few of you have it.

34:17.766 --> 34:20.569
You have to spread it very fast, and you
can do it.

34:20.770 --> 34:24.978
Because it doesn’t require money, it
doesn’t require any show,

34:25.179 --> 34:28.549
it is just inside it works. It’s already
there,

34:28.750 --> 34:32.465
it’s present there, everybody has it.
I knew all that.

34:32.666 --> 34:35.841
Of course, I knew it. But now you also
know it,

34:36.042 --> 34:39.756
so you should work it out, and work it out
in a manner

34:39.957 --> 34:45.851
that I am sure one day this world will be
a changed place.

34:46.052 --> 34:48.936
Thank you very much.
