Harbiye Military Museum
Istanbul (Turkey) 20.04.1998

00:01.651 --> 00:07.605
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:17.407 --> 00:22.750
First of all we have to know what is the truth.

00:29.260 --> 00:34.825
Truth is that, you are not this body,

00:34.866 --> 00:39.042
this mind, these emotions,

00:39.444 --> 00:47.068
conditionings but you are the pure spirit.

01:03.494 --> 01:10.753
The spirit is the reflexion of God Almighty in your heart.

01:16.656 --> 01:20.937
So you have to seek

01:21.994 --> 01:27.204
the spirit which resides in your heart.

01:33.964 --> 01:43.278
The spirit is the source of peace, of joy

01:49.638 --> 01:53.995
but when you achieve that

01:54.252 --> 01:59.138
you get rid of all your physical, mental,

01:59.210 --> 02:03.165
emotional and spiritual problems.

02:15.817 --> 02:20.937
Especially your country is very much blessed

02:20.956 --> 02:24.908
by so many Sufis you have.

02:32.292 --> 02:36.728
The word Sufi itself comes from word safiye

02:36.753 --> 02:40.670
clean with, cleanliness, cleansing.

02:47.688 --> 02:51.068
How will this safiye will express.

03:01.787 --> 03:06.910
To begin with, Prophet Mohammed has said

03:06.966 --> 03:14.147
that you must pray and surrender yourself to the Divine.

03:22.700 --> 03:29.838
By praying you will keep your attention
on the Divine seeking.

03:36.339 --> 03:40.230
But it doesn’t work out that way.

03:40.255 --> 03:45.926
It was human beings have so many weaknesses.

03:55.139 --> 04:00.490
They don't give to the straight path but go astray.

04:10.089 --> 04:14.646
That is why you have to have your ascent

04:14.671 --> 04:17.728
to reach the spirit state.

04:26.147 --> 04:28.687
To reach that spirit state,

04:28.711 --> 04:31.364
there is within us the power

04:31.406 --> 04:36.352
which can give you that great state of spirituality.

04:47.138 --> 04:51.439
Already it is existing in all of you.

04:56.639 --> 05:00.687
Whatever religion you may follow, it is there.

05:07.190 --> 05:11.969
It is a gift from the Divine

05:12.052 --> 05:14.816
that you can achieve your ascent

05:14.857 --> 05:18.729
which is call as miraj (ascension) in the Quran.

05:33.152 --> 05:38.036
This miraj, it is only possible,

05:39.533 --> 05:44.003
if you ask for it, if you want it.

05:50.857 --> 05:53.150
It cannot be forced.

05:56.224 --> 05:59.552
It cannot be pushed into it.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.694
It is a naturel sprouting of your being.

06:13.929 --> 06:16.484
Like a seed,

06:17.029 --> 06:22.582
you cannot break it.
You have to put it in the Mother Earth.

06:34.910 --> 06:38.624
It is a naturel process of evolution.

06:47.929 --> 06:53.099
We have to know to become the spirit

06:53.309 --> 06:57.699
and that is the promise of modern times.

07:08.579 --> 07:17.889
As it is, modern times is full of
all kinds of negative forces humanity,

07:25.287 --> 07:27.819
within and without.

07:30.847 --> 07:34.705
And the human being has become restless.

07:42.695 --> 07:46.821
So human being has to be transformed.

07:52.872 --> 07:58.540
With the kind of human being we have
we cannot solve any problem,

08:05.345 --> 08:11.578
because human beings live in the future or in the past.

08:19.439 --> 08:22.052
They cannot live in the present.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.732
And in the present is the reality,

08:33.248 --> 08:37.962
not in the past, nor in the future,

08:39.047 --> 08:42.007
because they don’t exist.

08:49.821 --> 08:55.800
So all this turmoil, all these tensions are because

08:55.825 --> 09:00.104
we are not at peace with ourselves and with others.

09:11.041 --> 09:19.611
We have been already told about
the inner between being within us.

09:24.435 --> 09:29.549
You don’t have to believe because I am saying so.

09:30.474 --> 09:34.040
You don’t have to believe because...

09:38.722 --> 09:41.142
You can experience.

09:44.362 --> 09:52.766
The second truth is that there is all
pervading power that we called as ruh.

10:02.412 --> 10:09.425
This power is existing thoughout.

10:15.516 --> 10:19.239
You see the beautiful flowers

10:19.264 --> 10:22.583
and you take them for granted.

10:30.007 --> 10:32.228
It is a miracle.

10:35.528 --> 10:39.678
All naturel activity is a miracle.

10:46.564 --> 10:52.160
Now only a new miracle has to work it out.

10:58.084 --> 11:02.427
And this new miracle is actually,

11:02.448 --> 11:07.380
the ascent of human beings in a very large scale.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.616
These centres as you see here,

11:18.649 --> 11:26.051
are responsible for our physical,
mental and emotional being.

11:38.378 --> 11:42.775
Now this miraj has to take place within yourselves.

11:49.731 --> 11:56.266
And Mohammed Sahab himself has said that

11:56.314 --> 12:01.813
when you will get your Brahma,

12:01.838 --> 12:04.601
you can call it the self-realization,

12:04.633 --> 12:07.302
then your hands will speak.

12:19.347 --> 12:22.395
One wonders how can hands speak

12:26.498 --> 12:30.808
or  what happens that when you get the ascent,

12:30.826 --> 12:36.066
you can feel this all-pervading power on your fingertips.

12:48.003 --> 12:51.701
And you can feel the cool breeze

12:51.743 --> 12:56.547
of the Holy Ghost as the Christians call it, the Ruh.

13:09.041 --> 13:16.528
And all these chakras, you can feel it
on your fingertips, clearly.

13:22.468 --> 13:27.095
And you know what are you suffering from,
what is wrong with you.

13:37.158 --> 13:43.368
This is how you get self-knowledge,
knowledge about yourselves.

13:52.529 --> 13:55.457
Otherwise you don’t know.

13:58.694 --> 14:03.847
Say, if you are suffering from cancer.

14:03.877 --> 14:07.273
You will not know otherwise I mean unless and until

14:07.306 --> 14:12.262
go through the whole thing more on
of the diagnoses by the doctors.

14:22.297 --> 14:26.495
But with this you will know immediately,
what troubles you have

14:26.511 --> 14:30.434
on your physical level or mental level

14:30.459 --> 14:35.192
and also your spiritual level in a way

14:35.224 --> 14:41.543
that is such as that certain centres are out of  reality.

14:59.185 --> 15:03.836
Also you may know how to get yourself all right,

15:03.933 --> 15:06.721
how to cure your centres.

15:22.734 --> 15:28.411
Thus you will also know about others,
what is wrong with them.

15:35.945 --> 15:43.388
Because you have a new dimension in your awareness,

15:54.370 --> 16:01.026
which we call as collective consciousness.

16:04.564 --> 16:08.333
And this happens to you automatically.

16:13.669 --> 16:18.701
You start feeling the vibrations of other person,

16:22.534 --> 16:24.798
again on your fingertips.

16:27.778 --> 16:32.655
And when that happens if you know how to cure them,

16:32.680 --> 16:35.045
you can cure others also.

16:45.012 --> 16:48.836
As it is when the kundalini rises

16:48.861 --> 16:52.988
on in the yours central nervous system, I should say

16:53.013 --> 16:59.819
on the through these different chakras
then it nourishes those chakras.

17:14.654 --> 17:21.682
And if it is something is obstructing,

17:21.706 --> 17:26.078
you will also know how to clear the way.

17:37.189 --> 17:44.417
Ultimately you will feel the cool breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.715
You can feel it.

17:57.434 --> 18:01.115
It is not just a sermon

18:01.140 --> 18:06.034
or a lecture but you can actually experience it.

18:14.276 --> 18:17.299
And you are amazed that yourselves.

18:20.864 --> 18:25.681
That is how you are connected to this all-pervading power.

18:33.558 --> 18:38.235
This all-pervading power,
which is doing all the living work.

18:46.031 --> 18:50.625
If you ask the doctor who runs your heart

18:50.902 --> 18:55.055
so he will say,it is autonomous nerves system

19:05.759 --> 19:07.925
but who is this auto.

19:12.521 --> 19:17.015
They will very honest,
cannot tell you the answer.

19:21.523 --> 19:27.762
The time has come, all of you
to get your miraj, your ascent.

19:37.125 --> 19:40.405
It has nothing to do with outside.

19:45.230 --> 19:48.332
It is all happen inside.

19:54.597 --> 19:58.581
This kundalini is your own mother.

20:02.614 --> 20:07.304
Every one of you have your individual mother.

20:12.179 --> 20:15.800
And she knows everything about you.

20:19.568 --> 20:23.275
She knows what are your conditionings,

20:23.300 --> 20:25.913
what are your inspirations.

20:33.860 --> 20:42.804
And she is so careful that very gentle
she rises, you don’t know feel her rises.

20:54.937 --> 20:57.940
And the result you get your ascent

20:57.974 --> 21:04.160
not only that but you get your power
to bring others to  this ascent.

21:14.825 --> 21:19.102
It is something they call miraculous.

21:19.234 --> 21:26.198
It is a process of evolution that has to enter now.

21:37.055 --> 21:40.698
Of course, you cannot pay for it.

21:45.268 --> 21:50.558
God almighty doesn’t understand money or banking.

21:55.440 --> 22:00.823
You cannot do any rituals for it.

22:05.807 --> 22:11.208
Only thing you have to have the pure desire to have it.

22:16.032 --> 22:18.571
And it works out.

22:22.244 --> 22:27.771
Of course there is somebody
who is suffering from some diseases

22:27.796 --> 22:34.024
or some potantions, then it may not work and passed.

22:46.281 --> 22:50.151
But this obstruction can be removed.

22:56.005 --> 23:00.609
So as I told you, you develop collective consciousness.

23:06.642 --> 23:13.750
Like a drop a water falls in the ocean,
it becomes the ocean.

23:20.394 --> 23:25.816
You are no more there,
but  you are lost in the collectivity.

23:33.169 --> 23:35.592
When we say Allahu- Akbar,

23:35.630 --> 23:41.804
we mean that ocean where we are part
and parcel of the ocean.

23:52.461 --> 23:56.153
Quran is not only for the Muslims,

23:56.178 --> 24:00.060
nor Gita is only for Hindus.

24:10.512 --> 24:12.892
They say the same thing;

24:13.880 --> 24:21.647
they say the same thing that
you have to be one with the Divine.

24:30.492 --> 24:34.398
Only problem is that,

24:34.423 --> 24:37.973
they have all written in poetic language.

24:45.131 --> 24:48.132
And people can change,

24:48.157 --> 24:53.525
can make them little intrigate and ambiguous.

25:04.261 --> 25:08.154
But once you have your miraj

25:08.179 --> 25:12.474
and once you become the spirit,

25:12.499 --> 25:17.065
you see the oneness in between the lines.

25:25.809 --> 25:29.086
All our false ideas dropp out

25:35.918 --> 25:41.258
and we understand that,
we have been fighting for nothing at all.

25:47.984 --> 25:53.105
Not only this, but look at your peace within yourselves.

25:59.877 --> 26:03.928
We live as I said in the past, in the future

26:04.246 --> 26:11.776
and the thoughts come up like a wave,
like that and again disappear.

26:22.267 --> 26:28.946
In the centre there is a little gap,
that is the present.

26:37.792 --> 26:42.816
We are all the time bombarding by thoughts,

26:50.464 --> 26:54.028
either from the future or from the past.

27:00.290 --> 27:06.580
But this happening, the kundalini separates

27:06.671 --> 27:10.767
and makes the thoughts belong it.

27:22.415 --> 27:27.038
And you become again I’m saying,  again I’m saying,

27:27.113 --> 27:30.526
you become thoughtlessly aware.

27:40.361 --> 27:44.115
That’s we achieve our peace within.

27:49.482 --> 27:55.444
And then whatever you think is coming
from the Divine source.

28:01.963 --> 28:06.258
With this Divine force, you see the truth.

28:11.004 --> 28:13.020
And the truth you see,

28:13.045 --> 28:19.930
that this all-pervading power is the power of Divine love.

28:27.463 --> 28:30.679
As we say it is rahmet (God’s mercy).

28:40.477 --> 28:44.684
This rahmet is coming from the Divine

28:44.774 --> 28:49.992
and makes us full of love and joy and affection.

29:00.575 --> 29:11.711
We feel the whole world is full of happiness
and of this love.

29:20.517 --> 29:24.725
All these enemies of hatred,

29:24.750 --> 29:30.200
of jealousies and all these our enemies just drop out

29:38.775 --> 29:41.887
because the spirit is pure

29:42.015 --> 29:46.829
and it has no such manifestations.

29:52.591 --> 29:57.896
And in the light of the spirit, we see clearly,

29:58.095 --> 30:02.041
what is right and what is wrong.

30:10.365 --> 30:15.961
Supposing now before you,
there is a man standing who is a cheat,

30:16.077 --> 30:19.768
immediately you can feel it on your fingertips,

30:19.784 --> 30:22.065
what sort of man he is.

30:37.990 --> 30:46.764
And if a saint is before you,
you can feel tremendous vibrations.

30:55.952 --> 31:00.566
For example, to know about Mohammed Sahab thoroughly,

31:00.591 --> 31:04.322
you have to see his vibration,

31:11.499 --> 31:13.412
about Christ also.

31:16.981 --> 31:22.786
You can find out about all of them, very clearly.

31:31.427 --> 31:37.308
The life becomes very peaceful, joy giving.

31:44.225 --> 31:48.917
And the countries will change when
this transformation take place.

31:56.276 --> 31:59.302
I will request you to read a book

31:59.327 --> 32:04.870
which a French lady has written about Sahaja Yoga and Quran.

32:15.496 --> 32:21.730
I read Quran with my father,
He translate it into Hindu.

32:29.003 --> 32:33.439
It is amazing how it talks of reality.

32:38.870 --> 32:43.562
Then came Guru Nanaka, he talks the same.

32:47.905 --> 32:51.531
But they just read the book,

32:54.178 --> 32:56.805
night after night.

33:01.984 --> 33:06.872
They are so blind, they cannot see the truth.

33:15.250 --> 33:22.214
I think people in Turkey are maybe wise
and get the truth.

33:27.557 --> 33:32.685
I am sure they can pave the way
for all the Islamic countries

33:32.720 --> 33:36.118
who are suffering for nothing.

33:50.328 --> 33:54.669
Say, tomorrow rest of life, it is all dark,

33:54.695 --> 34:00.627
then what will happen, so many people will be killed.

34:12.399 --> 34:19.348
Only in the light of spirit,
you can see what is reality.

34:24.879 --> 34:31.057
All this great people came on this earth, to tell us this.

34:40.602 --> 34:48.432
When it happens you form a beautiful group we can call it,

34:48.457 --> 34:52.943
collective being of people of all the nations.

35:06.232 --> 35:11.883
Already, Sahaja Yoga is working in 70 countries.

35:16.376 --> 35:21.402
Most surprising was Russia.

35:24.130 --> 35:30.904
I never expected that Sahaja Yoga will be
taken and go so deeply in Russia.

35:37.853 --> 35:43.322
But because, maybe of the suppression
with the communism, communist

35:43.349 --> 35:51.346
or maybe that they were told not to read
any books or anything about the God.

35:51.444 --> 35:55.383
They are so clean, such a clean state.

36:07.804 --> 36:14.489
There was no conditioning and
they were absolutely sensitive about it.

36:25.743 --> 36:30.816
In that country, they have not excepted anyone

36:30.834 --> 36:38.491
but for Islam and Orthodox Christianity and Sahaja Yoga.

36:51.159 --> 36:55.589
,It is very surprising, how they see truth

36:55.614 --> 37:00.292
the reality, the honesty of Sahaja Yoga.

37:09.020 --> 37:13.768
As I said, I have very great hopes for Turkish people.

37:20.777 --> 37:23.802
That they can come to Sahaja Yoga

37:23.827 --> 37:28.289
and see for themselves, what is the reality

37:28.427 --> 37:32.358
and get all the Muslim worlds into it.

37:45.590 --> 37:49.343
That you don’t have to tell them,
don’t do this, don’t do that,

37:49.362 --> 37:51.729
they just don’t do it.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.888
They become so powerful within.

38:05.739 --> 38:09.394
And so many miracles take place in their lives.

38:13.918 --> 38:16.831
That is what is going to happen to you all.

38:21.061 --> 38:24.259
Only thing you have to have pure desire.

38:29.358 --> 38:33.863
It will hardly take about 10 minutes to have it.

38:37.532 --> 38:44.916
But just you have to sit quietly
and allow to have this.

38:59.054 --> 39:04.602
Of course it is entirely depend on you,

39:04.646 --> 39:08.886
whether you want to have your miraj or not.

39:16.669 --> 39:20.827
As it is I have told,  you can’t pay for it.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.772
You can’t demand it.

39:32.456 --> 39:37.651
It works with people who want it from their heart.

39:54.649 --> 40:00.024
So, those who do not want,
I cannot force as I said,

40:00.056 --> 40:05.395
you have to leave the hall.
It will be very kind of you.

40:22.456 --> 40:23.456
All right,

40:24.424 --> 40:28.116
one thing I have to request, I hope you don’t mind,

40:28.215 --> 40:30.613
you have to take out your shoes.

40:30.669 --> 40:34.521
Because mother earth  helps us a lot.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.359
All right,

42:35.845 --> 42:40.876
please open your hands like this
as you do for namaz (muslim pray).

42:50.153 --> 42:55.955
One thing, you have to do is to forgive everyone.

43:00.536 --> 43:04.297
Many say, it is difficult to do it.

43:08.307 --> 43:12.433
But actually, logically if you see

43:12.475 --> 43:17.240
whether you forgive or don’t forgive
you don’t do anything.

43:26.667 --> 43:31.448
But if you don’t forgive then
you play in the wrong hands

43:31.473 --> 43:34.099
and torture yourselves for nothing.

43:42.010 --> 43:50.440
So please just say in your heart
that I forgive everyone.

43:56.990 --> 44:00.848
You may call me Mother or Shri Mataji,

44:00.873 --> 44:05.462
you can say, Mother I forgive everyone.

44:17.597 --> 44:23.983
Now you see, just keep your hands
in a very  relax manner.

44:31.964 --> 44:34.297
You can close your eyes.

44:42.460 --> 44:53.634
Now, raise your left hand,
on top of your fontanel bone area

44:53.691 --> 44:58.662
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

45:12.229 --> 45:15.054
Now, see for yourselves,

45:15.094 --> 45:20.430
is it a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

45:20.455 --> 45:25.232
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

45:36.635 --> 45:41.556
You can move the hand little bit
and bend your head.

45:52.150 --> 45:57.207
Now put your left hand towards me
and right hand on

45:57.235 --> 45:59.036
top of your head again.

45:59.061 --> 46:03.215
When we bend head on the fontanel bone area.

46:13.568 --> 46:17.933
You can move your hand up and down,

46:22.792 --> 46:24.355
both of sideways.

46:34.121 --> 46:37.336
Now put both your hands towards me again

46:37.346 --> 46:39.417
and you can open your eyes.

46:44.561 --> 46:46.705
Now see for yourselves

46:46.769 --> 46:54.058
if you are feeling any cool breeze
like on your fingertips or maybe hot.

47:06.210 --> 47:09.751
Now watch me without thinking.

47:12.821 --> 47:14.836
You can do it.

47:27.907 --> 47:35.133
All those who have felt cool
or hot breeze on their fingertips

47:35.231 --> 47:40.138
or on their palm or out of
their fontanel bone area,

47:40.148 --> 47:43.324
please raise both your hands,

47:56.063 --> 47:57.158
both your hands.

48:00.496 --> 48:02.234
All of you.
