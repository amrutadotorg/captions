00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.626
Harbiye Military Museum
Istanbul (Turkey) 20.04.1998

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:07.605
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:22.750
First of all we have to know what is the truth.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.825
Truth is that, you are not this body,

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:39.042
this mind, these emotions,

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:47.068
conditionings but you are the pure spirit.

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:10.753
The spirit is the reflexion of God Almighty in your heart.

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:20.937
So you have to seek

00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:27.204
the spirit which resides in your heart.

00:01:33.964 --> 00:01:43.278
The spirit is the source of peace, of joy

00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:53.995
but when you achieve that

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:59.138
you get rid of all your physical, mental,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.165
emotional and spiritual problems.

00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:20.937
Especially your country is very much blessed

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:24.908
by so many Sufis you have.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:36.728
The word Sufi itself comes from word safiye

00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:40.670
clean with, cleanliness, cleansing.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:51.068
How will this safiye will express.

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:06.910
To begin with, Prophet Mohammed has said

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:14.147
that you must pray and surrender yourself to the Divine.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.838
By praying you will keep your attention
on the Divine seeking.

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:40.230
But it doesn’t work out that way.

00:03:40.255 --> 00:03:45.926
It was human beings have so many weaknesses.

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.490
They don't give to the straight path but go astray.

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:14.646
That is why you have to have your ascent

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.728
to reach the spirit state.

00:04:26.147 --> 00:04:28.687
To reach that spirit state,

00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:31.364
there is within us the power

00:04:31.406 --> 00:04:36.352
which can give you that great state of spirituality.

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:51.439
Already it is existing in all of you.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.687
Whatever religion you may follow, it is there.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.969
It is a gift from the Divine

00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:14.816
that you can achieve your ascent

00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:18.729
which is call as miraj (ascension) in the Quran.

00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:38.036
This miraj, it is only possible,

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:44.003
if you ask for it, if you want it.

00:05:50.857 --> 00:05:53.150
It cannot be forced.

00:05:56.224 --> 00:05:59.552
It cannot be pushed into it.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.694
It is a naturel sprouting of your being.

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:16.484
Like a seed,

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:22.582
you cannot break it.
You have to put it in the Mother Earth.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.624
It is a naturel process of evolution.

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:53.099
We have to know to become the spirit

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:57.699
and that is the promise of modern times.

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:17.889
As it is, modern times is full of
all kinds of negative forces humanity,

00:07:25.287 --> 00:07:27.819
within and without.

00:07:30.847 --> 00:07:34.705
And the human being has become restless.

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:46.821
So human being has to be transformed.

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:58.540
With the kind of human being we have
we cannot solve any problem,

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:11.578
because human beings live in the future or in the past.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:22.052
They cannot live in the present.

00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:29.732
And in the present is the reality,

00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:37.962
not in the past, nor in the future,

00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:42.007
because they don’t exist.

00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:55.800
So all this turmoil, all these tensions are because

00:08:55.825 --> 00:09:00.104
we are not at peace with ourselves and with others.

00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:19.611
We have been already told about
the inner between being within us.

00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:29.549
You don’t have to believe because I am saying so.

00:09:30.474 --> 00:09:34.040
You don’t have to believe because...

00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:41.142
You can experience.

00:09:44.362 --> 00:09:52.766
The second truth is that there is all
pervading power that we called as ruh.

00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:09.425
This power is existing thoughout.

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:19.239
You see the beautiful flowers

00:10:19.264 --> 00:10:22.583
and you take them for granted.

00:10:30.007 --> 00:10:32.228
It is a miracle.

00:10:35.528 --> 00:10:39.678
All naturel activity is a miracle.

00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:52.160
Now only a new miracle has to work it out.

00:10:58.084 --> 00:11:02.427
And this new miracle is actually,

00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:07.380
the ascent of human beings in a very large scale.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.616
These centres as you see here,

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:26.051
are responsible for our physical,
mental and emotional being.

00:11:38.378 --> 00:11:42.775
Now this miraj has to take place within yourselves.

00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:56.266
And Mohammed Sahab himself has said that

00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:01.813
when you will get your Brahma,

00:12:01.838 --> 00:12:04.601
you can call it the self-realization,

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:07.302
then your hands will speak.

00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:22.395
One wonders how can hands speak

00:12:26.498 --> 00:12:30.808
or  what happens that when you get the ascent,

00:12:30.826 --> 00:12:36.066
you can feel this all-pervading power on your fingertips.

00:12:48.003 --> 00:12:51.701
And you can feel the cool breeze

00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:56.547
of the Holy Ghost as the Christians call it, the Ruh.

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:16.528
And all these chakras, you can feel it
on your fingertips, clearly.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:27.095
And you know what are you suffering from,
what is wrong with you.

00:13:37.158 --> 00:13:43.368
This is how you get self-knowledge,
knowledge about yourselves.

00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:55.457
Otherwise you don’t know.

00:13:58.694 --> 00:14:03.847
Say, if you are suffering from cancer.

00:14:03.877 --> 00:14:07.273
You will not know otherwise I mean unless and until

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:12.262
go through the whole thing more on
of the diagnoses by the doctors.

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:26.495
But with this you will know immediately,
what troubles you have

00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:30.434
on your physical level or mental level

00:14:30.459 --> 00:14:35.192
and also your spiritual level in a way

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:41.543
that is such as that certain centres are out of  reality.

00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:03.836
Also you may know how to get yourself all right,

00:15:03.933 --> 00:15:06.721
how to cure your centres.

00:15:22.734 --> 00:15:28.411
Thus you will also know about others,
what is wrong with them.

00:15:35.945 --> 00:15:43.388
Because you have a new dimension in your awareness,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:01.026
which we call as collective consciousness.

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:08.333
And this happens to you automatically.

00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:18.701
You start feeling the vibrations of other person,

00:16:22.534 --> 00:16:24.798
again on your fingertips.

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:32.655
And when that happens if you know how to cure them,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.045
you can cure others also.

00:16:45.012 --> 00:16:48.836
As it is when the kundalini rises

00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:52.988
on in the yours central nervous system, I should say

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:59.819
on the through these different chakras
then it nourishes those chakras.

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:21.682
And if it is something is obstructing,

00:17:21.706 --> 00:17:26.078
you will also know how to clear the way.

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:44.417
Ultimately you will feel the cool breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:17:53.533 --> 00:17:55.715
You can feel it.

00:17:57.434 --> 00:18:01.115
It is not just a sermon

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.034
or a lecture but you can actually experience it.

00:18:14.276 --> 00:18:17.299
And you are amazed that yourselves.

00:18:20.864 --> 00:18:25.681
That is how you are connected to this all-pervading power.

00:18:33.558 --> 00:18:38.235
This all-pervading power,
which is doing all the living work.

00:18:46.031 --> 00:18:50.625
If you ask the doctor who runs your heart

00:18:50.902 --> 00:18:55.055
so he will say,it is autonomous nerves system

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.925
but who is this auto.

00:19:12.521 --> 00:19:17.015
They will very honest,
cannot tell you the answer.

00:19:21.523 --> 00:19:27.762
The time has come, all of you
to get your miraj, your ascent.

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:40.405
It has nothing to do with outside.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.332
It is all happen inside.

00:19:54.597 --> 00:19:58.581
This kundalini is your own mother.

00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:07.304
Every one of you have your individual mother.

00:20:12.179 --> 00:20:15.800
And she knows everything about you.

00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:23.275
She knows what are your conditionings,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.913
what are your inspirations.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:42.804
And she is so careful that very gentle
she rises, you don’t know feel her rises.

00:20:54.937 --> 00:20:57.940
And the result you get your ascent

00:20:57.974 --> 00:21:04.160
not only that but you get your power
to bring others to  this ascent.

00:21:14.825 --> 00:21:19.102
It is something they call miraculous.

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:26.198
It is a process of evolution that has to enter now.

00:21:37.055 --> 00:21:40.698
Of course, you cannot pay for it.

00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:50.558
God almighty doesn’t understand money or banking.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.823
You cannot do any rituals for it.

00:22:05.807 --> 00:22:11.208
Only thing you have to have the pure desire to have it.

00:22:16.032 --> 00:22:18.571
And it works out.

00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:27.771
Of course there is somebody
who is suffering from some diseases

00:22:27.796 --> 00:22:34.024
or some potantions, then it may not work and passed.

00:22:46.281 --> 00:22:50.151
But this obstruction can be removed.

00:22:56.005 --> 00:23:00.609
So as I told you, you develop collective consciousness.

00:23:06.642 --> 00:23:13.750
Like a drop a water falls in the ocean,
it becomes the ocean.

00:23:20.394 --> 00:23:25.816
You are no more there,
but  you are lost in the collectivity.

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:35.592
When we say Allahu- Akbar,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:41.804
we mean that ocean where we are part
and parcel of the ocean.

00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:56.153
Quran is not only for the Muslims,

00:23:56.178 --> 00:24:00.060
nor Gita is only for Hindus.

00:24:10.512 --> 00:24:12.892
They say the same thing;

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:21.647
they say the same thing that
you have to be one with the Divine.

00:24:30.492 --> 00:24:34.398
Only problem is that,

00:24:34.423 --> 00:24:37.973
they have all written in poetic language.

00:24:45.131 --> 00:24:48.132
And people can change,

00:24:48.157 --> 00:24:53.525
can make them little intrigate and ambiguous.

00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:08.154
But once you have your miraj

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:12.474
and once you become the spirit,

00:25:12.499 --> 00:25:17.065
you see the oneness in between the lines.

00:25:25.809 --> 00:25:29.086
All our false ideas dropp out

00:25:35.918 --> 00:25:41.258
and we understand that,
we have been fighting for nothing at all.

00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:53.105
Not only this, but look at your peace within yourselves.

00:25:59.877 --> 00:26:03.928
We live as I said in the past, in the future

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:11.776
and the thoughts come up like a wave,
like that and again disappear.

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:28.946
In the centre there is a little gap,
that is the present.

00:26:37.792 --> 00:26:42.816
We are all the time bombarding by thoughts,

00:26:50.464 --> 00:26:54.028
either from the future or from the past.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:06.580
But this happening, the kundalini separates

00:27:06.671 --> 00:27:10.767
and makes the thoughts belong it.

00:27:22.415 --> 00:27:27.038
And you become again I’m saying,  again I’m saying,

00:27:27.113 --> 00:27:30.526
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:44.115
That’s we achieve our peace within.

00:27:49.482 --> 00:27:55.444
And then whatever you think is coming
from the Divine source.

00:28:01.963 --> 00:28:06.258
With this Divine force, you see the truth.

00:28:11.004 --> 00:28:13.020
And the truth you see,

00:28:13.045 --> 00:28:19.930
that this all-pervading power is the power of Divine love.

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:30.679
As we say it is rahmet (God’s mercy).

00:28:40.477 --> 00:28:44.684
This rahmet is coming from the Divine

00:28:44.774 --> 00:28:49.992
and makes us full of love and joy and affection.

00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:11.711
We feel the whole world is full of happiness
and of this love.

00:29:20.517 --> 00:29:24.725
All these enemies of hatred,

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:30.200
of jealousies and all these our enemies just drop out

00:29:38.775 --> 00:29:41.887
because the spirit is pure

00:29:42.015 --> 00:29:46.829
and it has no such manifestations.

00:29:52.591 --> 00:29:57.896
And in the light of the spirit, we see clearly,

00:29:58.095 --> 00:30:02.041
what is right and what is wrong.

00:30:10.365 --> 00:30:15.961
Supposing now before you,
there is a man standing who is a cheat,

00:30:16.077 --> 00:30:19.768
immediately you can feel it on your fingertips,

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:22.065
what sort of man he is.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:46.764
And if a saint is before you,
you can feel tremendous vibrations.

00:30:55.952 --> 00:31:00.566
For example, to know about Mohammed Sahab thoroughly,

00:31:00.591 --> 00:31:04.322
you have to see his vibration,

00:31:11.499 --> 00:31:13.412
about Christ also.

00:31:16.981 --> 00:31:22.786
You can find out about all of them, very clearly.

00:31:31.427 --> 00:31:37.308
The life becomes very peaceful, joy giving.

00:31:44.225 --> 00:31:48.917
And the countries will change when
this transformation take place.

00:31:56.276 --> 00:31:59.302
I will request you to read a book

00:31:59.327 --> 00:32:04.870
which a French lady has written about Sahaja Yoga and Quran.

00:32:15.496 --> 00:32:21.730
I read Quran with my father,
He translate it into Hindu.

00:32:29.003 --> 00:32:33.439
It is amazing how it talks of reality.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:43.562
Then came Guru Nanaka, he talks the same.

00:32:47.905 --> 00:32:51.531
But they just read the book,

00:32:54.178 --> 00:32:56.805
night after night.

00:33:01.984 --> 00:33:06.872
They are so blind, they cannot see the truth.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:22.214
I think people in Turkey are maybe wise
and get the truth.

00:33:27.557 --> 00:33:32.685
I am sure they can pave the way
for all the Islamic countries

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.118
who are suffering for nothing.

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:54.669
Say, tomorrow rest of life, it is all dark,

00:33:54.695 --> 00:34:00.627
then what will happen, so many people will be killed.

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:19.348
Only in the light of spirit,
you can see what is reality.

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:31.057
All this great people came on this earth, to tell us this.

00:34:40.602 --> 00:34:48.432
When it happens you form a beautiful group we can call it,

00:34:48.457 --> 00:34:52.943
collective being of people of all the nations.

00:35:06.232 --> 00:35:11.883
Already, Sahaja Yoga is working in 70 countries.

00:35:16.376 --> 00:35:21.402
Most surprising was Russia.

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:30.904
I never expected that Sahaja Yoga will be
taken and go so deeply in Russia.

00:35:37.853 --> 00:35:43.322
But because, maybe of the suppression
with the communism, communist

00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:51.346
or maybe that they were told not to read
any books or anything about the God.

00:35:51.444 --> 00:35:55.383
They are so clean, such a clean state.

00:36:07.804 --> 00:36:14.489
There was no conditioning and
they were absolutely sensitive about it.

00:36:25.743 --> 00:36:30.816
In that country, they have not excepted anyone

00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:38.491
but for Islam and Orthodox Christianity and Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:51.159 --> 00:36:55.589
,It is very surprising, how they see truth

00:36:55.614 --> 00:37:00.292
the reality, the honesty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:13.768
As I said, I have very great hopes for Turkish people.

00:37:20.777 --> 00:37:23.802
That they can come to Sahaja Yoga

00:37:23.827 --> 00:37:28.289
and see for themselves, what is the reality

00:37:28.427 --> 00:37:32.358
and get all the Muslim worlds into it.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.343
That you don’t have to tell them,
don’t do this, don’t do that,

00:37:49.362 --> 00:37:51.729
they just don’t do it.

00:37:59.277 --> 00:38:01.888
They become so powerful within.

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:09.394
And so many miracles take place in their lives.

00:38:13.918 --> 00:38:16.831
That is what is going to happen to you all.

00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:24.259
Only thing you have to have pure desire.

00:38:29.358 --> 00:38:33.863
It will hardly take about 10 minutes to have it.

00:38:37.532 --> 00:38:44.916
But just you have to sit quietly
and allow to have this.

00:38:59.054 --> 00:39:04.602
Of course it is entirely depend on you,

00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:08.886
whether you want to have your miraj or not.

00:39:16.669 --> 00:39:20.827
As it is I have told,  you can’t pay for it.

00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:28.772
You can’t demand it.

00:39:32.456 --> 00:39:37.651
It works with people who want it from their heart.

00:39:54.649 --> 00:40:00.024
So, those who do not want,
I cannot force as I said,

00:40:00.056 --> 00:40:05.395
you have to leave the hall.
It will be very kind of you.

00:40:22.456 --> 00:40:23.456
All right,

00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:28.116
one thing I have to request, I hope you don’t mind,

00:40:28.215 --> 00:40:30.613
you have to take out your shoes.

00:40:30.669 --> 00:40:34.521
Because mother earth  helps us a lot.

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:27.359
All right,

00:42:35.845 --> 00:42:40.876
please open your hands like this
as you do for Namaz (muslim pray).

00:42:50.153 --> 00:42:55.955
One thing, you have to do is to forgive everyone.

00:43:00.536 --> 00:43:04.297
Many say, it is difficult to do it.

00:43:08.307 --> 00:43:12.433
But actually, logically if you see

00:43:12.475 --> 00:43:17.240
whether you forgive or don’t forgive
you don’t do anything.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:31.448
But if you don’t forgive then
you play in the wrong hands

00:43:31.473 --> 00:43:34.099
and torture yourselves for nothing.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:50.440
So please just say in your heart
that I forgive everyone.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.848
You may call me Mother or Shri Mataji,

00:44:00.873 --> 00:44:05.462
you can say, Mother I forgive everyone.

00:44:17.597 --> 00:44:23.983
Now you see, just keep your hands
in a very  relax manner.

00:44:31.964 --> 00:44:34.297
You can close your eyes.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:53.634
Now, raise your left hand,
on top of your fontanel bone area

00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:58.662
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:45:12.229 --> 00:45:15.054
Now, see for yourselves,

00:45:15.094 --> 00:45:20.430
is it a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

00:45:20.455 --> 00:45:25.232
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:45:36.635 --> 00:45:41.556
You can move the hand little bit
and bend your head.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:57.207
Now put your left hand towards me
and right hand on

00:45:57.235 --> 00:45:59.036
top of your head again.

00:45:59.061 --> 00:46:03.215
When we bend head on the fontanel bone area.

00:46:13.568 --> 00:46:17.933
You can move your hand up and down,

00:46:22.792 --> 00:46:24.355
both of sideways.

00:46:34.121 --> 00:46:37.336
Now put both your hands towards me again

00:46:37.346 --> 00:46:39.417
and you can open your eyes.

00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:46.705
Now see for yourselves

00:46:46.769 --> 00:46:54.058
if you are feeling any cool breeze
like on your fingertips or maybe hot.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.751
Now watch me without thinking.

00:47:12.821 --> 00:47:14.836
You can do it.

00:47:27.907 --> 00:47:35.133
All those who have felt cool
or hot breeze on their fingertips

00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:40.138
or on their palm or out of
their fontanel bone area,

00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:43.324
please raise both your hands,

00:47:56.063 --> 00:47:57.158
both your hands.

00:48:00.496 --> 00:48:02.234
All of you.
