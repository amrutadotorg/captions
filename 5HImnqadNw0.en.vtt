WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:09.942
I bow to all the sahaja yogis of the world.

00:22.067 --> 00:24.816
It is very heartening

00:25.192 --> 00:30.942
to see so many of you assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:42.983 --> 00:53.150
To worship your Guru in person is regarded as the highest blessing.

01:03.732 --> 01:10.317
But in My case it’s a very different combination

01:10.816 --> 01:14.609
that I am your Mother and your Guru.

01:23.067 --> 01:29.525
So you can understand how Shri Ganesha worshipped his Mother.

01:34.692 --> 01:38.942
You all are created in the same image of Shri Ganesha

01:43.150 --> 01:47.150
who worshipped His Mother

01:47.983 --> 01:52.651
and then He became the Adi Guru, the first Guru.

01:57.900 --> 02:03.525
He is the primordial essence of mastery.

02:07.400 --> 02:13.983
Only the Mother can make the child a master.

02:15.858 --> 02:21.275
And the motherhood in any Guru – whether male or female –

02:22.067 --> 02:25.775
can only make the disciple a Guru.

02:34.692 --> 02:39.234
So, first you have to become the prophets

02:39.732 --> 02:43.317
and develop that motherhood within yourself,

02:45.108 --> 02:49.816
then you can make others also prophets.

03:04.275 --> 03:06.942
Now, to become a Guru,

03:09.234 --> 03:14.609
what do we have to do after our realisation?

03:20.816 --> 03:24.317
Guru word means gravity.

03:29.234 --> 03:32.275
Gravity means a person who is grave

03:32.525 --> 03:37.733
who is deep, who is magnetic.

03:45.942 --> 03:48.651
Now as you have learnt in Sahaja Yoga

03:48.858 --> 03:53.150
that realisation takes place in complete effortlessness.

04:02.732 --> 04:08.692
So normally a Guru tries to make his disciples effortless,

04:17.275 --> 04:22.484
which is called as prayatna shaytilya – means ‘relax your efforts‘.

04:31.275 --> 04:34.317
Without doing anything you got

04:34.816 --> 04:38.692
your prayatna shaytilya, otherwise Kundalini would not have risen.

04:49.275 --> 04:54.067
Then the second stage is vichara shaithilya – the thoughtless awareness.

05:02.692 --> 05:06.150
This also you got it without doing anything.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.442
And the third is complete negation of thought, abhava,

05:21.067 --> 05:23.942
and the bliss of peace.

05:28.484 --> 05:30.775
So one has to understand that

05:31.025 --> 05:33.858
you have to pass then, through three stages.

05:38.775 --> 05:41.442
First, when you get your realisation

05:41.732 --> 05:46.732
all these things come spontaneously, for that moment.

05:54.732 --> 05:57.150
When you raise the Kundalini of others,

05:57.359 --> 06:00.317
these things happen to them spontaneously.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.983
You too have that power now

06:07.275 --> 06:11.732
to raise the Kundalini of people and to establish it in them.

06:18.983 --> 06:23.359
But we must understand why it has to be done that way,

06:28.484 --> 06:31.484
why we have to have vichara shaithilya –

06:35.150 --> 06:38.983
because when you project any thought,

06:39.442 --> 06:40.983
it is artificial,

06:47.525 --> 06:49.192
it is not reality.

06:51.067 --> 06:54.108
Thought always stands between you and the reality.

06:58.942 --> 07:05.651
When you put in an effort, you stand against becoming.

07:14.108 --> 07:21.067
For example, if I have to cure you

07:22.025 --> 07:25.567
I just put my hand and finished – no effort,

07:31.067 --> 07:34.067
because I am that.

07:35.942 --> 07:40.732
You get your realisation because I am that.

07:43.983 --> 07:48.692
I don’t put in any effort, I don’t think about it, I am that.

07:54.900 --> 07:58.609
Just looking at someone, it can be done.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.484
Just putting attention to someone, it can be done.

08:13.234 --> 08:17.525
Just with a small desire, it can be done –

08:21.275 --> 08:26.733
because you are that. You can mould it the way you like.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.900
You can get an example from gold.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.733
Now gold is untarnishable

08:39.942 --> 08:42.816
It does not have to think it is untarnishable,

08:43.067 --> 08:46.983
it does not have to put in an effort it is untarnishable – it is.

08:59.816 --> 09:06.692
So to be, to be, you don’t have to put in any effort.

09:06.942 --> 09:10.775
If you have to put in an effort, that means you are not yet that.

09:20.567 --> 09:25.359
If you look at the sun – it shines.

09:25.609 --> 09:30.651
It doesn’t have to put in effort to shine – it shines.

09:38.942 --> 09:42.651
So to be that, if you have to put in an effort,

09:42.858 --> 09:46.651
that means you are not that, you are trying, you are artificial.

09:56.651 --> 10:01.400
The flowers are beautiful so they don’t have to beautify themselves.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.150
And this is what one has to understand – that innately

10:12.359 --> 10:16.816
if you are that,  if you have already become,

10:17.067 --> 10:19.733
then what is the need to put in any more effort?

10:31.525 --> 10:34.692
But when we say these things, you see,

10:34.900 --> 10:37.484
then people think you have to be lethargic,

10:47.567 --> 10:49.442
that you need not do anything,

10:52.150 --> 10:54.983
you become a Guru without doing anything.

10:58.234 --> 11:02.442
That’s why, at the very outset, I said it goes in stages.

11:08.816 --> 11:12.234
So the first stage is of Shri Ganesha –

11:15.692 --> 11:19.732
how He surrenders to the Shakti, to the Mother –

11:24.732 --> 11:27.567
that is the beginning. If one cannot surrender…

11:27.733 --> 11:30.150
That doesn’t mean you don’t do anything,

11:30.359 --> 11:33.317
but surrendering means the worship,

11:46.150 --> 11:48.525
the respect of the higher,

11:52.732 --> 11:55.609
the obedience to the higher.

11:59.359 --> 12:01.484
Not to argue it out,

12:04.692 --> 12:08.858
not to react, acceptance,

12:11.150 --> 12:16.609
absorption. Like a child absorbs the milk of the mother

12:21.400 --> 12:24.858
without questioning, without reasoning.

12:26.108 --> 12:29.692
That’s why Christ has said, “You have to become like children”.

12:33.234 --> 12:37.525
But if you are questioning, then you are no more a child.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.275
So first is the state,

12:41.484 --> 12:44.816
which you have to develop, is the child-like state.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.442
But child, which is a realised child, which has to have a gravity.

12:57.692 --> 13:04.025
If you can develop childhood first,

13:04.317 --> 13:07.609
then everything takes proper course,

13:17.900 --> 13:20.732
because maturity cannot take place unless

13:20.900 --> 13:23.609
and until you start from the very beginning,

13:31.400 --> 13:35.317
and gravity means maturity not frivolousness.

13:41.234 --> 13:43.692
So now the quality of Ganesha, as you know,

13:43.900 --> 13:47.192
is that He has viveka, means He has discretion.

13:53.150 --> 13:56.609
He ‘has’ means He is discretion.

13:59.816 --> 14:03.609
So try to develop your discretion power

14:08.816 --> 14:17.317
so that Shri Ganesha gives you the wisdom – subuddhi – wisdom.

14:22.108 --> 14:26.816
And this is why you have to have a dependence on Shri Ganesha.

14:31.732 --> 14:37.692
So at this point you have to make a negation of efforts.

14:41.609 --> 14:48.067
Like, whatever are efforts anti-Ganesha,

14:48.400 --> 14:52.732
or anti-innocence must be negated.

15:00.275 --> 15:08.108
So the negation of effort

15:08.525 --> 15:14.525
is to be achieved by negating whatever is the effort –

15:20.025 --> 15:23.732
means the effort of negation.

15:28.192 --> 15:31.108
So in the beginning you will not be effortless,

15:39.108 --> 15:42.567
you will have to put in effort for that.

15:47.816 --> 15:51.651
Like Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

16:02.442 --> 16:05.609
So how do you make your eyes innocent?

16:08.942 --> 16:15.733
In Sahaja Yoga we have a method by which we try to distract our eyes

16:16.108 --> 16:22.234
from effort that makes it adulterous.

16:33.858 --> 16:36.567
Like, we try to put our attention, our eyes,

16:36.733 --> 16:40.525
on the Mother Earth, on the grass, on the trees.

16:46.275 --> 16:52.359
So the avoidance, the avoiding of the effort itself is effort.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.733
So those people who have come now,

17:05.192 --> 17:08.733
recently, have to understand also that they have to put in

17:08.942 --> 17:12.359
all kinds of efforts to stop the efforts.

17:24.983 --> 17:29.108
For example, some people are used to very comfortable life,

17:29.275 --> 17:31.816
they may talk of all kinds of renunciation,

17:32.025 --> 17:35.067
when it comes to comfort, they want to have comfort.

17:42.775 --> 17:48.234
Such people should try to get out of the habit of comfort –

17:48.442 --> 17:51.651
Sleep on the ground, sleep on the Mother Earth.

18:12.067 --> 18:14.150
Some people have an attention

18:14.359 --> 18:16.359
which is all the time looking this side, that side –

18:16.525 --> 18:18.942
cannot see to one point – so fix your attention.

18:32.651 --> 18:37.651
So gradually, you will find, you’ll discipline yourself.

18:44.067 --> 18:47.108
So the effort that you put in

18:47.525 --> 18:51.816
is very important in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga.

19:00.317 --> 19:02.400
Another thing is very common, in the West,

19:02.692 --> 19:05.567
is the harsh tongue, the sarcasm

19:05.983 --> 19:11.567
and hurting others – is a very subtle way of violence.

19:22.150 --> 19:26.442
Or if they are really blunt

19:26.692 --> 19:31.442
they can start with ego expressions also “I, I, I…”

19:39.025 --> 19:40.609
Such people should stop talking

19:40.775 --> 19:44.067
completely, make an effort to stop – just don’t talk.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.442
Now watch your mind – is it

19:52.692 --> 19:56.442
is it trying to talk something sarcastic, nonsensical?

20:07.108 --> 20:10.108
So, this watching also requires effort.

20:17.983 --> 20:21.025
So, to sprout the seed is easy,

20:21.275 --> 20:26.108
but then one has to put in the effort to look after the little plant.

20:40.525 --> 20:44.400
And when it matures, then it’s on its own.

20:51.317 --> 20:56.567
So the, first the effort should be made to protect yourself

20:56.775 --> 21:00.067
against the mind which you have built in,

21:00.317 --> 21:02.192
through your ego or superego,

21:02.359 --> 21:06.651
that goes into the wrong direction of effort.

21:22.484 --> 21:26.525
But sometimes, be very careful, you have to be discreet.

21:34.651 --> 21:40.858
And the best way to be safe on discretion is to keep in the centre –

21:41.025 --> 21:44.442
never go to any extreme of anything.

21:53.983 --> 21:57.192
For example, some people are fond of music, say,

21:57.858 --> 22:01.275
so they’ll go on after the music part of it.

22:06.359 --> 22:09.275
Some people, say, are fond of poetry,

22:09.567 --> 22:12.400
then they’ll go after the poetry only.

22:19.651 --> 22:21.900
There is nothing wrong in those things,

22:24.359 --> 22:26.609
but whatever you achieve in all these things

22:26.733 --> 22:28.942
must be brought back to the collective

22:29.150 --> 22:31.484
and must be enjoyed by everyone,

22:31.733 --> 22:35.816
and you should also enjoy what others have found.

22:51.484 --> 22:57.400
For example, somebody is a very learned man and a dry person.

23:04.484 --> 23:09.692
So he has to make an effort to make himself sweet.

23:14.484 --> 23:20.192
So try to neutralise your extreme nature by coming in the centre,

23:28.609 --> 23:32.692
and the best way to say is, “I like everything.

23:40.732 --> 23:44.733
The way You keep me, I am happy in that state.”

23:52.525 --> 23:57.442
And to suggest yourself that, “I am the peace”

23:58.816 --> 24:01.983
– suggest, autosuggestion,

24:09.317 --> 24:14.484
“I am the satisfaction, I am the dignity.”

24:16.275 --> 24:20.067
Try to impose these artificialities upon yourself

24:29.400 --> 24:32.442
of these virtues and righteousness,

24:38.484 --> 24:43.108
and then ask yourself “If I am dignified how can I do such a thing?”

24:43.484 --> 24:47.816
Ask yourself, you judge yourself with those.

25:00.609 --> 25:03.400
For example, somebody is a miserly person

25:03.692 --> 25:05.816
and he says, “Oh you must be generous” –

25:06.025 --> 25:08.150
then you can call him a hypocrite.

25:13.775 --> 25:18.733
But supposing the miserly, you see, questions himself

25:19.234 --> 25:21.858
then he is not a hypocrite.

25:32.858 --> 25:38.359
So when you put all these artificial, so-called,

25:38.732 --> 25:44.525
values upon yourself – sort of a goal –

25:44.775 --> 25:49.192
and then try to achieve that goal through your own effort,

25:49.567 --> 25:51.732
then you become that.

26:15.983 --> 26:21.484
So automatically you criticise yourself and you don’t criticise others

26:27.192 --> 26:31.400
and you know what’s wrong with you.

26:34.732 --> 26:37.733
Because, what’s the use of knowing what’s wrong with others?

26:42.484 --> 26:45.651
It is like England trying to improve the conditions in India,

26:45.858 --> 26:49.234
and India trying to improve the conditions in England.

26:53.192 --> 26:56.858
But in this also human brain has an escape.

27:00.858 --> 27:04.150
When they want to criticise themselves, they find a pouch

27:04.400 --> 27:08.275
called the left Vishuddhi and become settled there.

27:19.025 --> 27:22.108
The more cunning you are, the more clever you are,

27:22.359 --> 27:24.484
the worse is the left Vishuddhi.

27:29.983 --> 27:33.942
Then you put everything there, settled down nicely to stagnate,

27:34.317 --> 27:36.651
to get all kinds of filth in it

27:36.858 --> 27:40.150
and to be settled with yourself nicely.

27:52.525 --> 27:54.525
It’s like any lousy housewife –

27:54.816 --> 27:56.275
she takes all the dirt of the house

27:56.484 --> 27:59.317
and all that and piles up into a room, locks it up,

27:59.651 --> 28:01.983
and thinks,  oh she has been very efficient.

28:13.983 --> 28:17.025
You have to face it and you have to correct it and see to it!

28:22.484 --> 28:25.442
And that’s how you become powerful.

28:27.442 --> 28:29.775
Because if your machinery is out of gear,

28:30.025 --> 28:33.150
what’s the use of improving somebody else’s machinery?

28:38.234 --> 28:40.234
And when your machinery is out of gear,

28:40.484 --> 28:41.942
you put it in a lock and key,

28:42.192 --> 28:44.567
and lock it up and say, “Now it’s alright.”

28:52.359 --> 28:55.567
Or you blame somebody because of this, because of that –

28:55.733 --> 28:58.484
something else other than you.

29:06.733 --> 29:10.983
Thank God to Sahaja Yoga today that you all have got realisation,

29:11.192 --> 29:14.234
so I don’t have to do all that cleaning, you can do yourself.

29:21.651 --> 29:26.192
So, in short, you become your own Guru to begin with.

29:29.609 --> 29:32.567
You try to tell yourself, separate yourself from yourself

29:32.775 --> 29:37.484
and say, “Hello Sir, how are you now, come along.”

29:47.525 --> 29:50.192
But in Sahaja Yoga, you see, people

29:51.108 --> 29:55.733
suddenly assume, you see, a big sort of a ego nonsense,

29:55.983 --> 29:57.692
and they think they are big gurus,

29:57.900 --> 30:00.733
you see, big, great people, avadhutas, you see, like that.

30:10.775 --> 30:12.775
And if you ask them,

30:12.942 --> 30:15.567
they say, “Mother, Mother I loved You very much.”

30:25.192 --> 30:27.692
So they think if they love Me, then it is My duty

30:27.900 --> 30:30.359
that I should really keep you clean.

30:38.983 --> 30:42.442
That’s not the attitude of a guru.

30:45.732 --> 30:50.567
What guru does, is to purify himself and others

30:50.775 --> 30:55.150
and give those flowers to the Deity.

31:01.150 --> 31:05.317
Till you all become gurus, I am your Guru,

31:05.732 --> 31:08.108
but once you become the guru

31:08.651 --> 31:11.275
then I become your Deity.

31:15.816 --> 31:22.858
Till they are not yet gurus, I am their Guru.

31:23.567 --> 31:25.275
Till they reach that state.

31:25.567 --> 31:29.900
Once they become the guru, then I am their Deity.

31:40.651 --> 31:45.567
Like all the Gurus, we can say Mohammad sahib –

31:45.942 --> 31:49.108
He talked of “Allah Hu Akbar.”

31:53.234 --> 31:55.858
He talked of the Holy Ghost,

31:56.942 --> 32:00.234
He talked of the resurrection,

32:00.609 --> 32:03.400
because He was a Guru.

32:03.732 --> 32:08.150
And whatever He had to say, He said it with full confidence

32:08.400 --> 32:10.983
pointing out towards the point where

32:11.275 --> 32:15.442
He looks, or where He gets His guidance from.

32:24.733 --> 32:31.900
Like Moses, like Christ also put His two fingers denoting His Father

32:35.609 --> 32:39.442
So till you become your own guru,

32:39.733 --> 32:44.442
you have to put in effort in the beginning.

32:52.150 --> 32:55.692
Then gradually you can achieve it effortlessly.

33:01.651 --> 33:05.733
Effortlessness is not to be certified,

33:08.732 --> 33:11.359
but you can verify it.

33:12.900 --> 33:15.983
A person who is discrete –

33:16.400 --> 33:19.900
in his presence others become discrete.

33:26.317 --> 33:32.525
A person who is honest – others in his presence become honest.

33:36.942 --> 33:41.567
It is said in Sanskrit language, ‘Yatha raja tatha praja’ –

33:41.816 --> 33:45.192
‘As the king is that’s how the subjects are’.

33:50.816 --> 33:54.983
When you are the guru, you are the example.

33:57.983 --> 34:00.732
You have to be the example.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.983
Now I have seen people who are gurus, who think,

34:05.192 --> 34:07.983
call themselves gurus, in different varieties and different

34:08.234 --> 34:10.732
types of life: like professors, teachers,

34:10.900 --> 34:13.150
you can call them, not spiritual gurus.

34:25.067 --> 34:27.525
They too, when they try

34:28.025 --> 34:31.150
to follow a mundane type of life –

34:31.400 --> 34:33.732
not of something exceptional –

34:34.067 --> 34:38.317
then their disciples lose faith in them.

34:52.858 --> 34:56.067
Even political leaders, when they…

34:56.317 --> 34:59.858
supposing a political leader is licentious, he has weaknesses,

35:00.442 --> 35:08.983
then the people who try to follow him have no respect.

35:20.234 --> 35:22.983
So they too have to have a personal character,

35:23.192 --> 35:26.025
a personal value system.

35:35.192 --> 35:38.567
So what about the spiritual gurus then?

35:42.733 --> 35:45.858
They have to be excellent people.

35:47.900 --> 35:54.442
There should be no two types of life, one outside, one inside.

36:00.983 --> 36:05.484
When the outside and inside becomes one, then it is effortless

36:14.942 --> 36:17.317
and that is what one has to do –

36:17.567 --> 36:23.858
the inside and the outside, one has to work it out from inside.

36:29.442 --> 36:33.108
For that you cannot bring the outside inside,

36:33.400 --> 36:36.983
but inside has to go outside.

36:40.609 --> 36:44.484
So this is the beginning of antar yoga, the inner yoga.

36:48.692 --> 36:52.942
At the second stage you have to become thoughtless.

36:56.192 --> 36:59.732
This is very important in the West

37:00.442 --> 37:04.150
because they live in thoughts – they do not have other problems

37:04.484 --> 37:06.651
of a gross nature.

37:15.025 --> 37:16.400
For example,

37:16.567 --> 37:22.900
they are brought up in such a way that they are frightened of law.

37:30.525 --> 37:33.775
They are brought up this way – they’ll keep all their carpets clean,

37:33.983 --> 37:35.525
everything clean, you see,

37:35.732 --> 37:38.775
very particular about keeping every place clean.

37:47.858 --> 37:52.275
All the gross things they keep clean,

38:02.067 --> 38:10.983
and then when they try to adjust themselves, they adjust within.

38:16.858 --> 38:19.317
Outwardly they are gentlemanly,

38:22.733 --> 38:28.359
but inside, in their thought, they are not clean.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.733
In their behaviour they are not clean, their eyes are not clean,

38:37.359 --> 38:39.108
it’s poison inside.

38:40.442 --> 38:43.025
And they like that poison to be taken out –

38:43.150 --> 38:46.067
sometimes it comes out as sarcasm,

38:50.234 --> 38:55.234
it comes out as their sinister acts of aggression on other countries.

39:02.025 --> 39:05.359
They may plan out the complete destruction of the world

39:10.067 --> 39:14.150
and they don’t think there’s anything wrong in it

39:16.567 --> 39:19.359
because it is ‘an ideology’ for which, is a thought

39:19.609 --> 39:20.900
they are fighting for.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.442
As long as there is an ideology, there’s a thought,

39:31.692 --> 39:35.651
there’s some sort of a sublime talk, then they can do what they like.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.192
This filth is very sophisticated.

39:54.192 --> 39:57.150
Like the people who don’t take their baths can use some

39:57.400 --> 40:01.567
artificial things to get a fragrance.

40:05.525 --> 40:07.816
Inside has to be clean

40:09.692 --> 40:14.732
and that’s why first the efforts are to be made to have good thoughts.

40:20.651 --> 40:22.983
Watch your mind –

40:24.858 --> 40:27.732
how does it think about others?

40:29.816 --> 40:34.609
I would say, racialism is one of the diseases of the same thing.

40:40.651 --> 40:44.067
I have seen people who are very well placed,

40:44.275 --> 40:46.900
sophisticated, wear immaculate dresses:

40:47.192 --> 40:53.775
when it comes to a person from a developing country,  or from say,

40:54.025 --> 40:59.983
another colour complexion, they come out with a remark,

41:00.359 --> 41:05.900
even if they are Sahaja Yogis I have seen they do it.

41:23.400 --> 41:27.150
I am saying this for the Sahaja Yogis and not for others.

41:30.150 --> 41:36.900
That suddenly that dead stuff, which we call as dead, becomes alive.

41:44.900 --> 41:48.192
So the mind is dirty,

41:49.525 --> 41:56.400
full of lust, greed, and anger, jealousy –

41:59.858 --> 42:04.900
and that’s why we have to be very, very careful.
Those people who have become sophisticated

42:05.192 --> 42:08.567
their weaknesses have also become sophisticated,

42:14.858 --> 42:18.275
and that’s why jealousy is a common disease.

42:21.525 --> 42:24.234
Like the other day I asked someone,

42:24.442 --> 42:27.275
“Why the father is angry with the son,

42:34.359 --> 42:37.359
and with his own brother?”

42:37.732 --> 42:39.733
So the answer was, “Because

42:40.067 --> 42:44.317
the brother is looking after the son in London.”

43:06.108 --> 43:09.150
Normally any person should be thankful

43:09.442 --> 43:13.858
that: somebody is looking after my son in my absence.

43:19.067 --> 43:21.775
But the fellow is jealous

43:22.067 --> 43:24.983
because of possessiveness

43:25.442 --> 43:28.525
and the possessiveness comes out of insecurity,

43:31.484 --> 43:34.400
and insecurity comes within us

43:34.732 --> 43:37.900
because we make others insecured.

43:45.651 --> 43:49.442
There are many reasons for insecurity,  but one of them is

43:49.609 --> 43:53.733
because we are ugly and we see that ugliness in others.

44:06.525 --> 44:09.816
Now this inside filth has to be taken out

44:10.067 --> 44:13.442
with greater effort than the outside filth,

44:21.442 --> 44:24.651
and that inside filth

44:25.067 --> 44:28.317
you can watch and see within yourself.

44:38.732 --> 44:42.359
Some people try to dominate others, to tell them things –

44:42.609 --> 44:45.317
just for the bossiness of it.

44:57.317 --> 45:02.275
Now watch out – first of all, have you bossed yourself enough?

45:07.733 --> 45:10.942
Have you mastered yourself enough?

45:13.192 --> 45:18.192
Are you master of your own or you are still lacking in that?

45:26.192 --> 45:29.400
Those who have not mastered themselves want to have others,

45:29.692 --> 45:32.234
to master them.

45:39.775 --> 45:44.942
But the one who is the master of oneself, need not master anyone.

45:47.816 --> 45:50.858
He becomes the master.

45:51.567 --> 45:54.775
He doesn’t have to put in any effort, he masters.

45:59.567 --> 46:02.732
And there are so many tricks by which he can master,

46:07.816 --> 46:12.067
so many things by which he can correct.

46:17.317 --> 46:24.484
He may not say, he may not do anything, but just he manages.

46:29.900 --> 46:35.400
Everyone learns a lesson without his doing anything about it.

46:43.942 --> 46:48.525
But they know that somebody is a master of masters.

46:53.816 --> 46:56.359
Maybe, such a person will be very unassuming

46:56.609 --> 46:59.108
simple, innocent looking,

47:09.442 --> 47:14.567
but that’s Mahamaya, that’s the illusion.

47:15.816 --> 47:22.609
So, the person who is that power doesn’t want to show it outside,

47:31.525 --> 47:39.484
on the contrary, it shows in such a way that people know it.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.025
I mean, the way things happen in life,

47:52.317 --> 47:56.858
we start understanding that we don’t have to put up any show –

48:05.816 --> 48:09.942
someone knows everything.

48:12.609 --> 48:17.651
When we have someone like that, try to follow.

48:24.150 --> 48:30.525
So, in the third stage the effort should be to follow your Guru

48:38.442 --> 48:41.234
who is a Sat Guru.

48:45.025 --> 48:51.651
Now that one becomes the one…a pattern, which you have to follow.

48:55.775 --> 48:59.900
But in this also Sahaja Yogis can be very superficial.

49:05.400 --> 49:09.317
One of the Sahaja Yogis used to wear a shawl in a particular way.

49:09.651 --> 49:12.025
So, I sent him some other sahaja yogis that

49:12.317 --> 49:15.733
he will try to help them, he can be their guru;

49:16.525 --> 49:20.900
they all started wearing shawls the same way.

49:41.359 --> 49:46.108
It’s not the outside; you have to follow the inside.

49:48.732 --> 49:56.732
So when you become the guru, become the guru, you become.

49:59.900 --> 50:06.442
It’s such a short method – just to become.

50:08.525 --> 50:10.651
Now if you face yourself, you’ll know

50:10.816 --> 50:14.067
that there are still some steps you have to cross to become.

50:19.692 --> 50:21.900
Even now when I am lecturing to you,

50:22.150 --> 50:25.484
you are thinking of others – “Oh, Mother is talking about him” –

50:25.733 --> 50:27.692
not about yourself.

50:38.525 --> 50:41.609
That is how one has to take it inside, the absorption

50:41.900 --> 50:45.525
from your Guru, that you have to see yourself.

50:54.025 --> 50:57.732
Now, that is very important

50:57.942 --> 51:03.733
if we have to become the prophets who will make others prophets.

51:12.067 --> 51:18.484
Now, the higher stage is that your Guru becomes a Deity.

51:19.400 --> 51:23.442
When you say “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara“.

51:23.732 --> 51:26.567
They go up to that point but nobody says “Guru is Devi”.

51:26.858 --> 51:31.442
You can have a higher stage, than Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

51:47.108 --> 51:52.651
Because the Guru state is where you have the innocence of all these

51:52.900 --> 51:57.651
Brahma and Mahesha and Vishnu –

52:07.400 --> 52:09.651
their power of innocence.

52:10.983 --> 52:15.025
But then ultimately they say, “Guru Sakshat Parabrahma”.

52:21.567 --> 52:24.158
And Parabrahma is the power of the Mother

52:24.711 --> 52:28.502
Not only by becoming but now,

52:28.960 --> 52:32.502
becoming the reflector of your Deity,

52:41.168 --> 52:48.711
to develop yourself into the reflector from guru to that state.

53:02.168 --> 53:06.669
At that state you start controlling all the elements.

53:12.669 --> 53:18.627
That’s why all these incarnations of Adi Guru

53:18.960 --> 53:22.043
had control over elements.

53:27.252 --> 53:33.627
Brahmadeva is absolutely manifested through them.

53:37.627 --> 53:43.377
So out of Ganesha, which is the Adi Guru,

53:44.210 --> 53:46.793
He is born,

53:47.085 --> 53:52.252
or He is manifested through these three – Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha –

54:03.627 --> 54:11.294
and then He comes out as Brahmadeva with four heads,

54:18.627 --> 54:24.711
three of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, and the fourth of Shri Ganesh.

54:33.918 --> 54:38.294
So Brahmadeva becomes the symbol of Guru,

54:42.252 --> 54:48.002
and as you know Ganesha is chatvari, is four –all the time.

54:48.294 --> 54:52.627
He becomes these four – in expression, in manifestation.

55:00.085 --> 55:04.043
And as you become Brahmadeva, at that stage

55:04.335 --> 55:07.210
you control all the elements.

55:16.711 --> 55:20.960
So, today I have tried to explain to you the different

55:21.252 --> 55:28.168
stages of gurupada – the state of guru.

55:35.168 --> 55:41.835
And one should understand whatever we are today,

55:43.168 --> 55:48.419
we are extremely blessed and fortunate people

55:57.085 --> 56:02.419
that, in this short time, you started from a scratch

56:02.793 --> 56:08.918
in the mud and you have become the lotuses.

56:17.793 --> 56:21.419
The lotus will invite many insects

56:22.168 --> 56:26.252
and will convert them into lotuses.

56:30.043 --> 56:32.210
madhukar they call it, madhukar,

56:32.502 --> 56:36.711
the ones who are selecting the madhu, the nectar,

56:37.043 --> 56:39.377
the… what do you call? – the honey.

56:54.627 --> 56:59.377
When they get the nectar, they become themselves the lotuses.

57:08.711 --> 57:16.419
The whole dirty, filthy pond is covered with those lotus flowers.

57:25.752 --> 57:29.627
And one lotus, who is the Guru, grows higher,

57:32.752 --> 57:40.127
and then is given to the Goddess on which She resides.

57:48.544 --> 57:53.585
She resides in the heart on the platform,

57:53.876 --> 57:57.085
beautiful platform that this lotus has created.

58:02.544 --> 58:07.711
But to bear Her on your heart, you have to have a heart.

58:14.043 --> 58:17.792
There are so many qualities of a Guru, which I have told you.

58:18.043 --> 58:24.252
All the best qualities, the twelve qualities of all the sides

58:24.711 --> 58:28.168
should be completely manifested in a Guru,

58:35.168 --> 58:39.127
and the owner of those qualities is Shiva.

58:43.168 --> 58:45.752
So that is how the essence of Shiva,

58:45.960 --> 58:49.043
out of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, the Mahesha’s qualities,

58:49.294 --> 58:51.043
should shine through you.

59:01.127 --> 59:02.918
The Vishnu’s qualities of Dharma –

59:03.127 --> 59:06.960
first you have to make an effort to be dharmic, to be balanced.

59:15.544 --> 59:18.876
Then you ascend.

59:20.792 --> 59:24.711
Then you become one with the Viraata

59:27.127 --> 59:31.752
and then you can give Dharma to others.

59:36.585 --> 59:40.085
So one has to know that stage-by-stage it happens to you

59:40.335 --> 59:42.835
and you do not become a hypocrite.

59:49.918 --> 59:52.752
But you become real

59:55.377 --> 01:00:00.835
and the reality is shown by its own being.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.502
That is how you become.

01:00:07.419 --> 01:00:12.043
So understand the reality within yourself, face it, solve it.

01:00:12.377 --> 01:00:14.918
But mostly, I have seen, when I tell anybody,

01:00:15.085 --> 01:00:16.502
“No, Mother I am not like that.

01:00:16.752 --> 01:00:19.960
No Mother, I didn’t say like that, that is not true!”

01:00:34.419 --> 01:00:37.043
Some such people would like to sit in front

01:00:37.294 --> 01:00:39.544
or sort of try to show off or anything,

01:00:39.752 --> 01:00:40.792
but that is not important.

01:00:40.918 --> 01:00:43.210
What is important is how much you know yourself,

01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:45.210
it is Self-realisation.

01:00:56.835 --> 01:01:01.335
Once you develop that, then you know the others in the real way

01:01:05.711 --> 01:01:07.460
and not artificially,

01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:11.792
and then the enjoyment is complete.

01:01:14.252 --> 01:01:19.669
Like a bee will never go to an artificial flower.

01:01:23.127 --> 01:01:26.585
But human beings have to become the bee.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:39.792
The Guru does not need to say that he’s the Guru.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.585
Today I bless you.

01:01:52.002 --> 01:01:56.792
I have completed the twelve years of Guru’s

01:01:58.835 --> 01:02:03.585
and you should really assume the Shiva’s powers within yourself

01:02:18.711 --> 01:02:26.210
I, that is My body, My mind, My heart,

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.752
everything, has spared no efforts

01:02:36.585 --> 01:02:43.876
to completely indulge into this cleansing, into this making,

01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:47.627
into this becoming of you people.

01:02:56.585 --> 01:03:04.502
I request you now that please do not waste My efforts.

01:03:08.711 --> 01:03:12.585
Look at yourself, help yourself

01:03:14.377 --> 01:03:20.377
and try to rise higher and higher to become your Self.

01:03:24.627 --> 01:03:28.419
When you become your Self, then you become the Guru.

01:03:32.043 --> 01:03:33.918
And once you become the Guru,

01:03:34.127 --> 01:03:38.793
you become Brahmadeva , Mahesha and Vishnu.

01:03:45.793 --> 01:03:51.210
So first you are made in the pattern of Ganesha,

01:03:52.002 --> 01:03:55.335
then Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:04:00.752 --> 01:04:05.419
But very much depends on your readiness to do it

01:04:09.502 --> 01:04:16.669
and, most of all, your honesty and sincerity.

01:04:17.876 --> 01:04:21.669
I hope Shri Ganesha will give you the wisdom

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:28.252
to understand.

01:04:28.792 --> 01:04:34.127
The Shakti will give you shakti to work hard,

01:04:37.793 --> 01:04:43.168
and Shiva will give you joy, Sadashiva will give you the joy

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:48.835
so that you proceed in your establishment.

01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:00.835
May God bless you.
