00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.251
So for a housewife,

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.133
she is the dignity of the household.

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:14.383
Not only that, but she is responsible

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:20.170
for the complete culture of that country,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.675
complete culture of that country.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.545
They represent the culture.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:29.604
On one side the woman,

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:33.564
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:37.896
On the other side she has to look after her family,

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:39.730
her children.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.522
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.688
for the society.

00:00:45.808 --> 00:00:48.730
She has to maintain the society.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.397
In a country where women are sensible

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.938
and are matured,

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.397
you will be amazed that they become

00:00:57.517 --> 00:01:00.813
extremely good families,

00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.267
good societies and good children.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.695
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

00:01:08.776 --> 00:01:12.025
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.771
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:19.272
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

00:01:19.392 --> 00:01:21.313
It doesn’t mean money,

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:22.605
not at all.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.813
To worship money is wrong.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.980
But what it means that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.480
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.021
or the whatever prosperity with that -

00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.605
should be very carefully spent,

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.559
because She is very mobile

00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:42.696
and the money can slip out.

00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:47.896
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:51.230
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.105
But if you want to spend,

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:55.480
you must spend it in the right way,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.849
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:09.399
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.644
you must be knowing, out of the
churning of the sea She came out.

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.608
She had four hands,

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:20.977
one hand was to give.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.019
She is generous, She gives.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.648
Like this She gives,

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.690
and with one hand She blesses.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.608
These are Her two hands.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:36.186
One is to give, and to bless the person.

00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.274
Very important it is,

00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:44.768
that when you give to somebody something,

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.066
you forget about it,

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.524
and you bless that person.

00:02:49.644 --> 00:02:51.232
Not only you give money,

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:54.519
but also you bless that person.

00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:57.899
The other two hands

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.019
have got two lotuses of pink color.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.232
Pink is the color of love.

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:10.608
And a person who has money

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.608
should have a house

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:16.940
which is full of love.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.483
Any guest who comes in the house

00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:21.728
should be respected.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:26.728
He should be treated just like God.

00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:33.827
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.619
is a house full of love.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.118
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

00:03:41.238 --> 00:03:45.511
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.317
and the beetle goes inside

00:03:47.437 --> 00:03:51.437
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.071
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.955
So these are the significance
of the form of the Goddess.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:04.496
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:07.538
That means no pressure on anyone.

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:10.496
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:14.830
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.287
just on Her own She stands

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:23.866
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:28.032
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

00:04:28.152 --> 00:04:30.818
So one has to remember

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:34.749
that when you want to give something to someone

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.750
do it with the full heart.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.998
Such full heart that

00:04:40.118 --> 00:04:43.698
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.193
You see, that should happen, otherwise

00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:49.896
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

00:04:50.673 --> 00:04:54.594
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:57.553
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

00:04:57.673 --> 00:04:59.637
that what they have to understand,

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:03.215
what they have to be, how they should be.

00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:07.594
I have always told you

00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:12.219
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.840
very much more than the man.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.647
So one should understand also.

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:20.475
When somebody gives you something

00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:22.522
you should understand

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:27.293
what is the significance of that,

00:05:27.413 --> 00:05:29.676
and not to feel bad about it.

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.900
The significance of that could be very much great,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.649
you may not understand.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:39.858
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:43.232
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:46.775
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

00:05:46.895 --> 00:05:50.061
that it should be auspicious.

00:05:50.613 --> 00:05:54.680
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.388
It’s a very, very subtle thing
one should try to understand.

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.240
If you don’t want to give, you
should not give. But if you want to give,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.723
then you must give something which is
worth the person to whom you are giving.

00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:13.849
This is what it is. That whatever
you do, you do it with love.

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:15.849
If you do it with love,

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.890
you will be able to make it auspicious.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.306
But if there’s no love, you are
just doing for some purpose,

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.262
then it is useless.

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:30.598
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:34.426
That is, when you understand

00:06:36.384 --> 00:06:38.884
the value of money

00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.771
and when you are saturated

00:06:44.598 --> 00:06:47.451
and you are fed up.

00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.798
From inside you get detached,

00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:56.673
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

00:06:56.793 --> 00:06:59.465
that is Mahalakshmi.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:03.631
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:06.673
which is the spiritual awakening.

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:11.381
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.381
this desire started

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:19.215
that they should seek the truth,
they should find out the truth

00:07:19.335 --> 00:07:21.923
and that’s how you are all here.

00:07:22.043 --> 00:07:26.548
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:29.257
that you were seeking the truth.

00:07:29.377 --> 00:07:33.215
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:35.127
So this Mahalakshmi

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.448
is very important for you also.

00:07:37.568 --> 00:07:39.242
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:43.050
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.810
meaning “Where the women are respected,

00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:50.483
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.643
not that they are to be worshipped,

00:07:52.762 --> 00:07:55.742
but they are respectable –

00:07:55.862 --> 00:08:01.063
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:06.465
So, so much responsibility is on women.

00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:10.069
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:13.069
perhaps we never realize it.

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:15.628
Now we see so many lights here,

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:18.389
electricity is there running.

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:21.149
But what is the source of this electricity?

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.748
Is it not much more important than these lights?

00:08:26.549 --> 00:08:31.669
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:35.429
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:41.109
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:45.269
I was surprised when I went to

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:47.748
Italy also, that

00:08:48.549 --> 00:08:51.829
how women have made themself cheap.

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:56.949
And they want to look attractive to every man.

00:08:57.549 --> 00:08:59.509
What is the need?

00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:03.429
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:07.748
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:12.469
This cheapness of women

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:16.389
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:19.309
I know one feels very unhappy

00:09:19.429 --> 00:09:21.989
the way men treat them.

00:09:22.109 --> 00:09:24.789
But you must have your own personality,

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:28.549
you must have your own understanding

00:09:28.669 --> 00:09:31.549
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:35.989
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:40.389
But if you do not keep to your own

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:42.669
personality or your chastity,

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:46.149
then you cannot achieve

00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:49.822
your goal in life.

00:09:49.942 --> 00:09:55.189
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:57.829
to your husband,

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:01.749
to all the society the woman gives power.

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.069
I am also a woman, as you know,

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:06.829
and I also have a family.

00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:10.782
With all the powers that I have,

00:10:10.902 --> 00:10:15.511
I never showed them that I have those powers.

00:10:15.592 --> 00:10:18.150
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:21.302
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

00:10:21.422 --> 00:10:24.720
And he also came from a society

00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:28.248
which was more Islamic-oriented.

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:32.748
But that was just a joke for Me,

00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.788
because I thought

00:10:35.869 --> 00:10:38.748
“He’s just like a child

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:41.429
and I have to be

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:45.748
very patient with him.”

00:10:46.748 --> 00:10:49.189
He always says that because of My powers

00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:51.069
he earned everything in life.

00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:53.949
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:56.549
I don’t know that part, but definitely

00:10:56.669 --> 00:11:01.109
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

00:11:01.748 --> 00:11:04.949
I never think the way other people think

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:07.309
that we must try to dominate the husband,

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:10.989
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

00:11:11.109 --> 00:11:15.109
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:20.795
Also the men must realize
that they have to respect women.

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:24.668
I mean, not to such an extent that
she tells you to do something wrong,

00:11:24.748 --> 00:11:27.429
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:28.629
That’s slavishness.

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:30.949
Men have to be men.

00:11:32.309 --> 00:11:35.709
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

00:11:35.789 --> 00:11:38.749
I do not say it that way;

00:11:38.869 --> 00:11:41.628
because if you have your own powers,

00:11:41.748 --> 00:11:47.349
ultimately whatever may be the
husband, he’ll have to come and

00:11:47.909 --> 00:11:51.748
understand what you want.

00:11:52.309 --> 00:11:54.949
He’ll have to know what you are.

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:58.029
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

00:11:58.149 --> 00:12:01.229
that it has done that way.

00:12:01.349 --> 00:12:03.748
I would never say anything.

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:08.549
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet. All right.

00:12:08.669 --> 00:12:10.628
After all he has to fight outside

00:12:10.748 --> 00:12:12.547
and he has to take out temper on Me

00:12:12.628 --> 00:12:15.973
that he couldn’t do: if he does
this to others they will beat him,

00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:18.549
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

00:12:18.669 --> 00:12:22.667
And I never, never felt that
way that he’s dominating Me.

00:12:22.748 --> 00:12:25.668
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

00:12:25.748 --> 00:12:28.628
But I’ve seen that whenever

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:33.829
I said something to him, he thought about it.

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:38.069
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

00:12:38.748 --> 00:12:41.628
and all these decisions

00:12:41.748 --> 00:12:44.829
he still remembers one by one

00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:48.389
and knows that it was very, very important.

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:51.789
Other things I never tell him what to do.

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:55.869
Whatever was most important is the principle.

00:12:56.829 --> 00:13:00.748
Now, he also realized that

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.628
I have a very important mission.

00:13:03.748 --> 00:13:06.949
So he gave Me money, he gave
Me time, gave Me all freedom.

00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:10.069
But first I had to establish Myself

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:14.149
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

00:13:16.907 --> 00:13:20.508
The men as a whole are very different type,

00:13:20.589 --> 00:13:22.509
you must understand.

00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:24.829
They are extroverts,

00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:28.629
and whatever the women care
too much for, they do not.

00:13:28.748 --> 00:13:30.429
It’s all right,

00:13:30.549 --> 00:13:34.589
because women and men are complementary.

00:13:35.309 --> 00:13:38.989
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

00:13:39.109 --> 00:13:43.789
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:45.628
who never went out,

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:48.389
but he knew his source of energy

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.909
from where it was coming.

00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:56.949
Because women were never respected as shakti,

00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:02.789
they started getting drifted
into this Western modern ideas

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:05.429
that “we have to fight men,

00:14:05.549 --> 00:14:08.469
they are problematic, they are troubling us

00:14:08.589 --> 00:14:12.429
and we should take revenge.”

00:14:12.549 --> 00:14:15.748
That’s how society cannot work out.

00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:20.269
Responsibility of the women is much greater

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:22.748
than that of men.

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:25.629
Men have to just go to offices,

00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:30.189
work it out something, come back home.

00:14:30.748 --> 00:14:36.069
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:38.429
for the growth of the children,

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:40.389
the protection of the husband,

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:43.989
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:45.949
That’s why in India we say,

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:50.495
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:52.992
and she has to be respectable.”

00:14:53.112 --> 00:14:55.272
Now, we are husband and wife

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:59.152
because we love each other, we are complementary.

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.952
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

00:15:02.072 --> 00:15:06.632
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

00:15:06.752 --> 00:15:10.392
and women should not expect men to be like you –

00:15:11.512 --> 00:15:16.191
very, I should say, noble.

00:15:16.992 --> 00:15:21.592
They are qualities of a woman
and the qualities of a man.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:25.992
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:29.552
If her chastity is disturbed,

00:15:30.112 --> 00:15:33.632
then she is a dangerous person,

00:15:33.752 --> 00:15:35.592
very dangerous.

00:15:36.191 --> 00:15:39.191
She can not only harm her husband,

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.312
but also her children, her society.

00:15:43.952 --> 00:15:47.071
We come from a culture which is very akin

00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:50.191
to Islamic culture also.

00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:53.352
Indian culture is like that.

00:15:53.872 --> 00:15:58.592
In the Indian culture women respect their
chastity more than anything in this world.

00:15:58.712 --> 00:16:02.597
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

00:16:04.357 --> 00:16:08.457
So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out.

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:14.778
Unless and until you learn how to
open out your heart how can you enjoy?

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:19.318
Open your heart.

00:16:20.442 --> 00:16:25.311
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the
Lakshmi Puja, means the day they worship Lakshmi.

00:16:25.392 --> 00:16:30.043
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol
of Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

00:16:30.123 --> 00:16:36.634
And it was so that She came out of the water.

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:45.873
Through the water, She came out so clean.

00:16:46.715 --> 00:16:56.574
And She has no pride.

00:16:56.694 --> 00:17:03.070
She doesn’t assert Herself. She
doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

00:17:05.387 --> 00:17:11.183
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the lotus.

00:17:11.303 --> 00:17:15.271
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,

00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:21.507
that She doesn’t disturb any
petals of the lotus, nothing.

00:17:21.587 --> 00:17:26.037
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

00:17:26.117 --> 00:17:30.247
Unless and until you have
balance you cannot stand on a lotus.

00:17:30.327 --> 00:17:32.256
So She is so balanced.

00:17:32.336 --> 00:17:38.377
Her center of gravity is so balanced
that She cannot topple down.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.407
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some
people, you ask them: “How are you?”

00:17:46.355 --> 00:17:49.817
Ten years have passed,

00:17:49.897 --> 00:17:52.760
sometimes like this also.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.430
Why?

00:17:56.983 --> 00:18:04.373
Because you must be grounded in the
Mother Earth, into the practical side of it.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:15.020
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging in
the air, but we are grounded in the Mother Earth.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:23.140
And the slightest thing happens to
us, again we come back to our balance.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.589
So this is Her position when She stands up in a lotus.

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:33.235
Now She has a hand, one hand like this
[which gives], one hand like this [which protects],

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:37.065
and there are two hands which have
got again the lotuses, the pink ones.

00:18:37.145 --> 00:18:43.358
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is
Her fragrance I think is spread on the sky.

00:18:43.478 --> 00:18:52.454
And She is pink, pink because
that shows that Her house,

00:18:52.535 --> 00:18:59.230
Her nature is pink, pink is inviting, is loving.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:07.021
Because he must have a cozy,
beautiful – cozy, again I say, cozy house.

00:19:07.108 --> 00:19:14.551
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital, anything
drops, you feel frightened: “Oh, my God."

00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:16.839
Then you’ll pick it up.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.882
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable. It’s all right,

00:19:21.963 --> 00:19:25.723
in the house, in the home, if somebody comes and stays.

00:19:25.804 --> 00:19:30.124
Then it’s little bit this here and there,
doesn’t matter, then you put it right,

00:19:30.205 --> 00:19:33.606
but that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

00:19:33.687 --> 00:19:38.768
It should not be taken as a lousy
house, but a house which is inviting.

00:19:38.848 --> 00:19:46.160
When people come in, you give them a
place to sit down and make them enjoy.

00:19:46.257 --> 00:19:50.994
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that extreme,

00:19:51.074 --> 00:19:58.210
but something that will
give joy to others, to visitors,

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.619
to people who come to your
house, we’ll soothe the sick.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.394
People should feel happy to come to your house.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.841
So there’s no showing off.

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:19.394
Not to show off but to make
them comfortable and very happy.

00:20:19.505 --> 00:20:26.005
You can do lots of things, very interesting
things, if you have the Lakshmi principle in you.

00:20:28.329 --> 00:20:33.839
That’s, that’s what it is a
personality which is joy-giving.

00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:37.928
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also,

00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:43.484
a beetle comes, a black
beetle with horrible thorny legs,

00:20:43.564 --> 00:20:50.144
and enters into this lotus for a
sleeping in the night, you see.

00:20:50.224 --> 00:20:57.907
And the lotus closes down its cosiness
on it and sleeps very comfortably.

00:20:58.027 --> 00:21:03.066
And then next day it opens out, so it flies out.

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:10.384
That’s how your homes, your
ashrams, your hearts should be.

00:21:10.465 --> 00:21:19.394
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel
that soothing and that comforting feeling,

00:21:19.474 --> 00:21:22.633
when they are in your company.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.674
But, it’s not the end of it.

00:21:26.754 --> 00:21:29.944
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told you.

00:21:30.024 --> 00:21:35.294
But once this Lakshmi principle covers
you up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

00:21:35.374 --> 00:21:42.083
is that you think of the world
as a great challenge to you,

00:21:42.163 --> 00:21:48.534
that you have to give them Mahlakshmi
principle, that you have to give them Realization.

00:21:48.614 --> 00:21:50.524
You have to raise them up.

00:21:50.604 --> 00:21:54.074
And this principle, once starts
working in the Mahalaksmi principle,

00:21:54.154 --> 00:22:00.304
then all the problems are your own.

00:22:00.384 --> 00:22:03.454
You have to start working it out.

00:22:04.394 --> 00:22:11.453
Change he attitude, is the best way I can say towards

00:22:11.533 --> 00:22:18.359
all other things that we have to solve the
problem, we are here to solve the problem.

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:25.243
So out of the Lakshmi principle

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:31.691
I hope you get all the tatwas, all
the principles, satisfied in you, fully,

00:22:31.771 --> 00:22:36.377
and also the Mahalakshmi
principle flows through your being.

00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:41.269
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable people.

00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:42.959
Not to find faults.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:49.701
If you are finding faults, then
know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:55.521
But you must know how the whole
principle of benevolence is working itself.

00:22:55.601 --> 00:23:01.195
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing
the benevolence part; you must know that.

00:23:02.615 --> 00:23:07.556
As I’ve told you before also, you
have to be like the sea which receives

00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:12.109
all the rivers into it.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.825
If you are on top of the hill
you cannot receive anything.

00:23:16.906 --> 00:23:24.169
So you have to be like a sea to receive
everything and you have to be at the height.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:30.220
As I told you the other day, the
same way, that very close to the sea

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.724
there should be a personality
which is above everything else.

00:23:33.804 --> 00:23:37.465
Such a beautiful personality you
should have, is the depth of the sea

00:23:37.545 --> 00:23:40.723
and the height of the Kailasha.

00:23:40.843 --> 00:23:42.953
May God bless you all.
